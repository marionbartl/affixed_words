How to cook your next porterhouse .
9th Apr 2009 Nick Kindelsperger
I 'm not interested in carbonizing the surface of the meat .
To me that ruins the flavor .
- Alain Ducasse
It was a bachelor weekend of sorts .
My wife mercifully let me pass on attending a wedding of an old family family friend , so I had the whole weekend alone in the apartment to get work done .
I had some crazy projects planned including a mad braise of a cow tongue , but the first night alone was all about pure unrestrained male gluttony .
I bought a bottle of wine , a potato the size of a shoe , and an enormous rib eye .
This should have been a simple meal , one requiring little skill beside turning on the stove and plopping a pan on a burner .
But somewhere along the way I realized I had n't eaten much ribeye in my life and I began to wonder whether this stove - top method was the best way to do it .
The only " steaks " I tend to eat are skirt or flank , as they 're about the only ones I can afford .
This splurge had me stumped .
Should a sear it on an iron skillet , broil it , or should I dump a bunch of charcoal into my little hibachi and try to get that sucker as hot as possible ?
Really , what is the best way to cook a ribeye ?
My initial thought was to mimic the technique nearly every serious steak house in the Midwest does : broiling it under an inferno .
And I mean that .
They reguarly reach hellish temperatures of around 1800 degrees .
The quick sear blackens the outside while leaving the inside nice and rare .
Of course , much like the perfect New York pizza oven , one cannot easily recreate this temperature at home .
I could only try hard and hope to get close .
I was looking around on eGullet to see if there was a better way of doing this when I came across an article called The Best Way to Cook a Thick Steak .
I figured it would be a good place to start .
But I was a little taken aback by what I read .
Instead of hellish temperatures , and visible flames , this article claimed that the best way to cook a steak was over medium heat in a skillet bathed in butter .
The reasoning is that while high temperatures do a good job of searing the meat , they create burnt flavors .
This more moderate approach allows for even cooking and a great flavor because of the Maillard Reaction .
And suddenly , and without warning , my simple meal of meat and potatoes required a science lesson .
And it 's science that I do n't quite understand .
I am a little out of my league .
Maybe one day I 'll indulge in a more serious scan of Harold McGee to better grasp .
They even linked to an article by Alain Ducasse , a very muddled essay in the New York Times about how this is the way he likes to cook his steak .
He casually mentions that those high heat methods burn the steak , and that he thinks steak tastes better when cooked in a moderate pan with loads and loads butter .
Even Tom Colicchio is also a fan of this method , claiming he can " get a crust this way . "
Though I am intrigued by the science , what honestly sold me was the serious food porn on eGullet 's site .
Even though I was a little skeptical about the idea , I just could n't get these images out of my head .
It would require skill and care .
The steak is first cooked on its edge to render some of the beef fat and lubricate the pan , then flipped onto its side and cooked in its own fat for a few minutes .
Then the fat is poured out and a lot of butter is added .
A LOT of butter .
Still I had my doubts .
I worried that the relatively long cooking times would mean my steak would cook past medium rare .
I worried that all I was going to taste was butter .
And mostly I worried I had n't been gluttonous enough .
Ducasse recommended a steak that was 24 ounces and an inch and half thick .
The one I picked up was only 17 ounces and only an inch and a quarter , which was still more than I 'd ever need on a normal night .
I adjusted the cooking times , hoping that I could still get a nice a rare steak , but I was just a little off .
Mine got just a tad too close to medium , which makes me wonder whether this technique is only good at cooking insanely big steaks that I 'll only cook once a year , if that often .
But I think the technique is right .
Next time I might start with butter sooner in the process , flip more often , and pay just a little more attention to it .
Because once you see this crust , man ... it's hard to look away .
The Butter Steak
1 16 - ounce Ribeye
2 tablespoons butter
2 cloves garlic
salt and pepper
I set an iron skillet over medium heat .
Then I set the ribeye on its fatty edge upright in the skillet .
I cooked it for about 5 minutes until it had rendered a decent amount of fat .
I flipped it on to one flat side and cook it for about 5 minutes .
Then flipped it and cooked it for about 3 more .
I removed the steak , poured off the beef fat , and added the butter and garlic .
The steak was returned to the skillet on the side it had cooked on the least , sprinkled with salt , and cooked for about 6 minutes .
During that time I basted it continuously with the butter .
Then I flipped it , sprinkled that side with salt , and cooked it for about 3 minutes continuing to baste it with butter .
It then rested for about 10 minutes .
Ducasse 's rule of thumb is that it need half as long as it takes to cook the meat .
It was seasoned with more salt and pepper and sliced up .
As you can ( sort of ) see , I cooked mine just a tad too much .
The middle is way past red and into a muted pink territory .
It 's a little hard to see , but there is a definite band of pink .
But the crust is off the charts .
TIP 6 : FORMING YOUR SAUSAGE
Once you 've finished mixing your sausage and you 're happy with the texture , it 's time to form it so it can be cooked .
You can go ahead and cook it as it is , or maybe you might prefer to crumble the sausage over a pizza before sticking it in the oven .
Alternatively , you can form the sausage into patties and put them straight onto the grill , or you might want to form little meatballs to put into a pasta sauce .
Of course , you might also prefer to stuff your sausage into casings and twist them into links .
If you 're using a sausage stuffer , work carefully to establish a good speed and rhythm .
It 's important not to work too quickly , as you risk bursting the casing .
Likewise , you also do n't want to work too slowly , as the casings could be too loose , but they also might end up too tight and burst .
Carbon Dioxide
Get your CO 2 extinguishers at Safety Emporium
Definition
Carbon dioxide is a colorless , odorless , faintly acidic - tasting , and non-flammable gas at room temperature .
Solid carbon dioxide , also known by the trade name Dry Ice , sublimes ( converts directly from a solid to a gas ) at - 78 oC ( - 109 0 F ) or above .
Carbon dioxide is a molecular solid with a molecular formula CO 2 .
The linear molecule consists of a carbon atom that is doubly bonded to two oxygen atoms , O=C=O .
Note : Although both are common products of combustion , DO NOT confuse non-toxic carbon dioxide with deadly poisonous carbon monoxide .
Additional Info
Carbon dioxide is the fourth most - abundant gas in the Earth 's atmosphere .
Animals exhale carbon dioxide and plants use photosynthesis to convert it to sugars and other forms of energy .
Commercially , carbon dioxide has thousands of uses .
The most familiar example is its use to carbonate soft drinks and beer .
It also finds use in a technology called supercritical fluid extraction that is used to decaffeinate coffee .
Dry Ice is used in theatrical productions to make stage fogs and make " magic potions " bubble as demonstrated on the right .
A common misconception is that carbon dioxide is a visible gas .
The white mist that one sees around solid carbon dioxide is actually water vapor that has condensed from the air .
The discharge from a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher is white partly due to condensed water vapor and partly due to solid CO 2 " snow " which quickly sublimes into invisible carbon dioxide gas .
Carbon dioxide dissolves slightly in water to form a weak acid called carbonic acid , H 2 CO 3 :
CO 2 + H 2 O H 2 CO 3
Carbonic acid reacts slightly and reversibly in water to form a hydronium cation , H 3 O+ , and the bicarbonate ion , HCO 3 -:
H 2 CO 3 + H 2 O HCO 3 - + H 3 O +
This chemical behavior explains why water , which normally has a neutral pH of 7 has an acidic pH of approximately 5.5 when it has been exposed to air .
It also explains the burning / stinging sensation in your nose and eyes when you inhale too quickly from a freshly - opened container of soda pop ; the gas quickly reacts with the water in your eyes and nose to form a small amount of carbonic acid .
The primary health dangers of carbon dioxide are :
Finally , note that carbon dioxide is a " greenhouse gas " .
Although it is naturally present in the atmosphere , Man 's activities such as the combustion of fossil fuels have drastically increased the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere and contributed to global warming .
All rooms with fixed extinguishing systems must have appropriate warning signs like this one from Safety Emporium .
SDS Relevance
You are most likely to encounter carbon dioxide on an SDS in reference to fire fighting measures .
Carbon dioxide extinguishers are not appropriate for all fires , especially those involving flammable metals and pyrophoric substances .
Using a CO 2 extinguisher on such fires would be very much like putting gasoline on a fire !
For more information about fire extinguishers and a downloadable PowerPoint presentation , visit our Fire Extinguishers page .
If your company uses an automatic fire extinguishing system ( such as in a computer room or where flammable organic solvents are used ) , critical precautions must be taken to avoid asphyxiation .
Special signage and training is essential .
Three different OSHA standards cover fixed fire extinguishing systems ; see the OSHA link under Further Reading below .
You may also find carbon dioxide mentioned as a decomposition product or as an incompatible material .

The Rule of One : A Simple Technique to Create a Relaxed Student Life
August 31st , 2009 · 41 comments
Note ( 8/31/09 ) : I ’m leaving tonight to give a research talk in Bologna , Italy ( yes , it ’s a tough life I lead ) .
I ’ll almost definitely have internet access , but I ’ll also be quite busy , so I give my typical warnings about being slow to post , answer e-mails , and moderate comments over the next week .
The ( Over ) Committed Student
Last week , I received an e-mail from a student who I ’ve advised in the past .
His new semester was about to start and he was worried about his schedule .
“ I think I ’m overcommitting myself , ” he told me .
“ I considered dropping some activities , but it ’s hard because I want to do them all . ”
He then asked me to review the following “ time budget ” that he created for his schedule :
5 courses — 24 hours / week in class
— 24 hours / week in class Lab volunteering — 15 hours / week
— 15 hours / week Peer educator and mentor — 10 hours / week
— 10 hours / week Exercise — 6 hours / week
— 6 hours / week Hospital volunteering — 3 hours / week
— 3 hours / week Executive of a club — 5 hours / week
— 5 hours / week Public speaking club — 8 hours / week
After reading his e-mail , I realized it ’s time for me to revist one of the main themes preached here on Study Hacks : simplicity is beautiful .
The idea that doing less can actually make you more impressive is , of course , the cornerstone of my Zen Valedictorian Philosophy .
I ’ve also argued that doing lots of extracurricular activities is meaningless for your job hunt , and that overloaded course schedules are like a devestating virus that can destroy your life .
In this post , I want to add a new strategy to your minimilast arsenal .
The Rule of One
My response to the student from above is that , in my opinion , he ’s overcommitted .
His schedule will inevitably cause stress and yield little tangible advantages in terms of his perceived impressiveness .
He ’s following a diligence strategy instead of an ability strategy , and he ’ll eventually pay a price for it .
My advice for this student is to follow what I call the rule of one .
This rule includes the following three requirements :
One Major : I do n’t want to hear about your nonsense plan to combine a bio major with a music major so you ’ll be perfectly positioned for a lucrative job studying the effects of Mozart on bacteria .
Choose one major , then use your extra time to become an A* student .

Choose one major , then use your extra time to become an A* student .
One Extracurricular : Having a laundry - list of activities has become so outdated as a strategy that it ’s almost embarassing at this point .
Choose one pursuit and then spend four years pushing it somewhere exceptional .
If it helps , you can ease into this lifestyle with an activity vacation .

If it helps , you can ease into this lifestyle with an activity vacation .
One Hour of Focused Relaxation Per Day :
When constructing your autopilot schedule , block off one hour each day for what I call focused relaxation .
This involves going somewhere quiet where you ’re completely disconnected — no phone , no e-mail , no iPod — and doing something you enjoy .
Read a book .
Walk through the woods .
Take notes on big ideas .
If you do this every day , not only will your stress decrease , but you ’ll also gain a sense of control over your life which will pay huge dividends as the demands you face increase .
It ’s impossible to follow the rule of one and still feel overwhelmed or stressed .
Even better , if you couple this minimalist approach with a dedication to focusing hard and doing exceptionally well at your small number of pursuits , you ’ll actually increase your impressiveness .
The beginning of a new semester is a perfect time to make new resolutions about your student lifestyle .
I implore you to give this approach a try .
If you do , let me know — I want to hear your story .
On Friday , the City Council adopted a resolution authorizing a very complicated - sounding lease that will let the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power ( LADWP ) look into the possibility of developing a geothermal energy facility near the Salton Sea .
UPDATE *:
In fact , the City Council did n't sign the lease , but agreed to proceed with the lease agreement upon hearing more information — in this case , the finalization of the SCPPA Memorandum of Understanding relative to the Geothermal Feasibility and Exploration project .
The lease would be between the DWP and the Southern California Public Power Authority , a joint powers authority of 11 LA - area cities and the Imperial Irrigation District .
The agreement would involve 2,950 acres owned by DWP and 2,280 acres owned by the Imperial Irrigation District .
The Council followed the Energy and Environment Committee 's recommendation on the motion .
In an earlier report , the Energy and Environment Committee had raised concerns about money -- their report says " potential cost of a geothermal facility averages $ 250 million , without including transmission or debt costs , of which DWP might pay 50 percent or $ 125 million . "
The report that DWP has admitted to transmission issues in the area that " could limit the accessibility to that electricity for DWP customers . "
So ... we might be paying a lot to tap all that sweet heat out of the earth without even getting a piece ?
· Report from Board of Water and Power Commissioners [ LACity.org ]
Nov 5 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Senate has rejected a measure that would have required prisoners charged with involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks to stand trial in a military court rather than a criminal court .
Here are some facts about the detention center on the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and the fate of those held there .
* The Guantanamo detention camp was set up in January 2002 to hold foreigners captured after U.S. - led forces invaded Afghanistan to root out al Qaeda and its Taliban protectors in response to the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York , Washington and Pennsylvania .
* The United States holds 215 prisoners at Guantanamo and has released or transferred to other governments more than 550 others .
Twenty - five of those were released under the Obama administration and the rest were released under the Bush administration .
* Six captives have died in custody at Guantanamo -- one from cancer and five from suicide .
* Two Guantanamo prisoners have been transferred to the United States .
Yaser Hamdi , who was born in Louisiana to Saudi parents , was moved to a naval brig in South Carolina in 2002 when the military learned he was a U.S. citizen .
He was held without charge for two years and then deported to Saudi Arabia in 2004 after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld his right to challenge his detention .
The other , Tanzanian citizen Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani , was sent to New York in June 2009 to stand trial in a civilian court on pending charges of conspiring in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya , which killed 224 people .
* Only three trials have been completed in the special military tribunals at Guantanamo .
Two prisoners were convicted of providing material support for terrorism , held for a few more months at Guantanamo , then sent home to Australia and Yemen .
The Obama administration says those convictions are unlikely to withstand appeal because that charge was not classified as a war crime when the acts were committed .
The third , also a Yemeni , is still at Guantanamo , serving a life term for conspiring with al Qaeda , soliciting murder and providing material support for terrorism .

( New UPDATE : Monday 5:02 p.m. OK , it 's not funny if you work at the White House .
But for everybody else a new video at the bottom of this post will provide some chuckles about how the rest of the world chooses to greet the Japanese Emperor .
Hint :
It 's different than President Obama . )
( UPDATES : 12:22 p.m. Saturday .
A brief news video has been added below , showing the greeting in this photograph .
Contrary to some claims , the video shows no reciprocal bow by the emperor , who traditionally bows to no one .
And we 've added a file photo from 2007 of Vice President Dick Cheney greeting the Japanese Emperor at the same residence in a different fashion . )
How low will the new American president go for the world 's royalty ?
This photo will get Democrat President Obama a lot of approving nods in Japan this weekend , especially among the older generation of Japanese who still pay attention to the royal family living in i ts downtown castle .
Very low bows like this are a sign of great respect and deference to a superior .
To some in the United States , however , an upright handshake might have looked better .
( See Cheney - Akihito photo , right ) .
Remember Michelle Obama casually patting Britain's Queen Elizabeth on the back during their Buckingham Palace visit ?
America 's royalty tends to make movies and get bad reviews and lots of money as a sign of respect .
Obama could receive some frowns back home as he did for his not - quite - this - low - or - maybe - about - the - same - bow to the Saudi king not so long ago .
( See photo here )
How times change under Democratic presidents .
Back in 1994 when President Bill Clinton appeared to maybe perhaps almost start to bow to Akihito at a White House encounter , U.S. officials rushed to deny it was any such a thing .
And the N.Y .
Times chronicled the comedic drama here .
Akihito , who turns 76 next month , is the eldest son and fifth child of Emperor Showa , the name given to an emperor and his reign after his death .
Emperor Showa is better known abroad by the life name of Hirohito .
He became emperor in 1925 and died in 1989 , the longest historically - known rule of the nation 's 125 emperors .
Hirohito presided over his nation 's growth from an undeveloped agrarian economy into the expansionist military power and ally of Nazi Germany of the 1930's .
And , later , Japan became a global economic giant .
Hirohito , along with Prime Minister Hideki Tojo , who authorized the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor , were much reviled abroad during World War II .
Historically , deba te has simmered over how much of a political puppet Hirohito was to the country 's military before and during the war .
Even after Democratic President Harry Truman ordered the two atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the summer of 1945 , there were strong forces within Japan that wanted to continue to fight the Americans in the spirit of kamikaze suicide pilots .
But Akihito 's father went on national radio , the first time his subjects had ever heard Hirohito 's voice , and without using the inflammatory word " surrender , " pronounced that the country must " accept the unacceptable . "
It did .
As the conquering Allied general and then presiding officer of the U.S. occupation , Gen. Douglas MacArthur , decided to allow Japan to keep its emperor as a ceremonial unifying institution within a nascent democracy .
Tojo , on the other hand , was hanged .
MacArthur treated Emperor Hirohito respectfully but , as his body language in this blac k and white postwar photo demonstrates , was not particularly deferential .
( But then MacArthur was not known as a particularly deferential person , as Truman discovered just before firing him later .
But that 's another war . )
Akihito was born during Japan 's conquering of China and was evacuated during the devastating American fire - bombing of Tokyo , which was built largely of wood in those days .
The future emperor learned English during the U.S. occupation , but , inexplicably , his father ordered that his oldest boy not receive an Army commission as previous imperial heirs always had .
Akihito assumed the throne on Jan. 7 , 1989 .
Within weeks he began a series of formal expressions of remorse to Asian countries for Japan 's actions during his ....
... father 's reign .
In 2003 , he underwent surgery for prostate cancer .
In 1959 , Akihito married Michiko Shoda , the first commoner allowed to enter the Japanese royal family .
That was two years before the birth of Akihito 's future presidential guest , Barack Obama .
Joe Biden was already 17 by then .
But he was n't a senator .
: Here 's a new video assembled by some clever College Republicans at the University of Connecticut .
It 's even got music and requires no explanation .

Adding to John ’s post on the CBC hack from London and Stella Artois , here is a pic from the CDR ’s twitter account ( Via Lauren Elgee ) .
Exciting times for the ‘ exploding pizza ’ created by Burton Kramer .
Remixing is alive and well and it looks like Canadian design is a well of great sources !
The Chancellor Palpatine Surgical Reconstruction Center , sometimes shortened to ChanPal SuRecon Center , crowned one of the tallest buildings on Coruscant .
During the Clone Wars , it was also known as the Grand Republic Medical Facility or simply as the Grand Medical Facility .
It later became known as the Emperor Palpatine Surgical Reconstruction Center , being commonly referred to as the EmPal SuRecon Center .
It was an imposing spire that dominated its particular stretch of the Galactic City — later Imperial City — skyline .

History Edit
Dark designs Edit
The Sith stronghold hid in plain sight with large windows that seemed to show that there was nothing to hide .
In addition , it relied on the Jedi's reluctance to attack a hospital and risk the patients inside .
It featured four landing pads for emergency cases near the top of the structure .
The interior was lined with ultradense walls of neuranium shielding to conceal any radiation leak from the building 's reactor .
Surrounding this shielding was an exterior shell of durasteel armored with a lanthanide and duralium alloy .
Palpatine performed acts of Sith alchemy within the ChanPal SuRecon .
Darth Vader Edit
This gloomy location was the site of Darth Vader 's rebuilding .
After Darth Vader 's duel with his former Master , Obi-Wan Kenobi , Darth Sidious brought his badly wounded apprentice via shuttle to the Reconstruction Center where he was to be rebuilt .
During the duel , Vader had sustained near - fatal third - degree burns , severe lung damage and the loss of his remaining limbs , as well as emotional pain .
The damage to his body would be repaired through intensive cybernetic enhancement at the main laboratory .
Palpatine also ordered the medical droids — two 2 - 1B surgical droids , one FX - 6 medical assistant droid , and one DD - 13 cybernetic surgical droid — to keep Vader awake during the process so the pain would make him stronger .
Many of these droids had either participated in or observed the transformation of Qymaen jai Sheelal into Grievous .
Upon his revival as a cyborg , Vader questioned his master about Padmé Amidala .
Sidious replied that Vader had killed his wife in his anger .
Overwhelmed by his despair in the belief he had killed his wife and their unborn child , Vader broke his bindings on the operating table and struggled to walk under the power of his new mechanical legs .
His rage destroyed the medical droids that had saved his life and severely damaged the interior of the main laboratory .
It also caused a worker to go deaf permanently .
The workers did n't know it was Vader who was being worked on .
They thought it had been either a ghost or all the beings who had been killed in the Clone Wars screaming one last scream .
This rumor continued through 18 BBY .
Galactic Empire Edit
In the first months of the Galactic Empire , Emperor Palpatine used the EmPal SuRecon Center as his headquarters .
He hosted meetings with members of the Imperial Senate in a throne room below his private chamber and Sith medical facility .
He eventually moved his base of operations to the Imperial Palace once it had been rebuilt to his specifications .
Darth Vader returned to the facility for repairs to his prosthetic right arm , damaged in a duel with Bol Chatak on Murkhana .
Later in the reign of the Empire , the EmPal SuRecon Center became known to citizens as one of the most prestigious medical treatment centers in the galaxy .
Its architecture included VLD2261 laser cannons , Royal Guard emplacements , a private meditation chamber for Palpatine , and other facilities used for training Dark Jedi .
Korriban lightsaber crystals , Sith scrolls , powerful Sith artifacts , bio-details of hundreds of generations of Sith , and a dark force reservoir were also housed in the building 's center .

You may update your antivirus software diligently , immediately download all new Windows security patches , and refuse to click any e-mail links ostensibly sent by your bank , but even if your computer is running exactly the way it ’s supposed to , a motivated attacker can still glean a shocking amount of private information from it .
The time it takes to store data in memory , fluctuations in power consumption , even the sounds your computer makes can betray its secrets .
MIT researchers centered at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab ’s Cryptography and Information Security Group ( CIS ) study such subtle security holes and how to close them .
In 2005 , Eran Tromer , now a postdoc at CIS , and colleagues at the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot , Israel , showed that without any breach of security in the ordinary sense , a seemingly harmless computer program could eavesdrop on other programs and steal the type of secret cryptographic key used by one of the most common Internet encryption schemes .
Armed with the key , an attacker could steal a computer user ’s credit card number , bank account password — whatever the encryption scheme was invoked to protect .
Computer operating systems are supposed to prevent any given program from looking at the data stored by another .
But when two programs are running at the same time , they sometimes end up sharing the same cache — a small allotment of high - speed memory where the operating system stores frequently used information .
Tromer and his colleagues showed that simply by measuring how long it took to store data at a number of different cache locations , a malicious program could determine how frequently a cryptographic system was using those same locations .
“ The memory access patterns — that is , which memory addresses are accessed — are heavily influenced by the specific secret key being used in that operation , ” Tromer says .
“ We demonstrated a concise and efficient procedure for learning the secret keys given just this crude information about the memory access patterns . ”
Complete extraction of the private key , Tromer says , “ takes merely seconds , and the measurements that are needed , of the actual cryptographic process being attacked , can be carried out in milliseconds . ”
The encryption system that Tromer was attacking , called AES , was particularly vulnerable because it used tables of precalculated values as a computational short cut , so that encoding and decoding messages would n’t be prohibitively time consuming .
Since Tromer and his colleagues published their results , Intel has added hardware support for AES to its chips , so that Internet encryption software wo n’t have to rely on such “ lookup tables . ”
In a statement , Intel told the MIT News Office that its decision “ was mainly motivated by the performance / efficiency benefits achieved , ” but that “ in addition , there is a potential security benefit since these new instructions can mitigate the possibility of software side channel attacks on AES that have been described in research papers , including those discovered by Tromer , Percival , and Bernstein . ”
“ I think it ’s fair to say that it ’s a direct response to the cache - timing attacks against AES , ” Pankaj Rohatgi , director of hardware security at the data security firm Cryptography Research , says of Intel ’s move .
Together with CIS cofounder Ron Rivest and CSAIL ’s Saman Amarasinghe , Tromer is trying to develop further techniques for thwarting cache attacks by disrupting the correlations between encryption keys and memory access patterns .
A couple weeks ago , at the Association for Computing Machinery ’s Symposium on Operating Systems Principles , the researchers announced that they had a “ proof - of - concept prototype ” of a defense system , but they plan to continue testing and refining it before publishing any papers .
Tromer has also been investigating whether cloud computing — the subcontracting of computational tasks to networked servers maintained by companies like Amazon and Google — is susceptible to cache attacks .
Many web sites rely on cloud computing to handle sudden surges in their popularity : renting added server space for a few hours at a time can be much cheaper than maintaining large banks of proprietary servers that frequently stand idle .
The word “ cloud ” is supposed to suggest that this vast agglomeration of computing power is amorphous and constantly shifting , but Tromer and colleagues at the University of California , San Diego , were able to load their eavesdropping software onto precisely the same servers that were hosting websites they ’d targeted in advance .
In part , their approach involved spreading their software across a number of servers , then assailing a targeted website with traffic .
By spying on the caches of the servers hosting their software , they could determine which were also trying to keep pace with their fake traffic spikes .
Once they ’d identified the target site ’s servers , they could use cache monitoring to try to steal secrets .
“ Imagine a stock broker that specializes in a specific company , ” Tromer says .
“ If you observe that his virtual machine is particularly active , that could be valuable information .
Or you may want to know how popular your competitors ’ website is .
We ’ve actually demonstrated that we can very robustly estimate web server popularity . ”
“ This has sparked the imagination of both the research community and industry , ” Rohatgi says .
“ I interact with a lot of people in industry , and when they say , ‘ Give me the technical basis for this , ’ I point to [ Tromer and colleagues ’ ] papers . ”
Finally , Tromer is continuing work he began as a graduate student , on the use of a “ hundred - dollar commodity microphone ” to record the very sounds emitted by a computer and analyze them for information about cryptographic keys .
So far , Tromer has n’t been able to demonstrate complete key extraction , but he believes he ’s getting close .
Any information at all about a computer ’s internal workings “ is actually fairly damaging , ” Rohatgi says .
“ In some sense , some of these cryptographic algorithms are fairly brittle , and with a little extra information , you can break them . ”
There is absolutely nothing coincidental about Apple launching new products today .
The big product launch is Apple 's first preemptive marketing strike against Microsoft , Windows 7 and the entire PC industry .
It 's a bold move exploiting a position of strength against an industry weakened by low - margin , low - priced netbooks .
Windows 7 officially launches in two days .
Best Buy already has Windows 7 PCs on sale , but not for purchase .
Dell started taking Windows 7 over the weekend .
Gartner is telling businesses they must upgrade to Windows 7 , despite any hardships migrating from Windows XP .
Microsoft is priming the marketing pumps .
The PC industry is collectively turning its attention to Windows 7 , which Microsoft is trying to launch with some bang rather than a whimper .
But what has the geek world been babbling about for the last 24 hours ?
Apple .
Firstly , there were rumors of new iMac , revamped white MacBook , new Mac mouse and updated Mac mini -- all products Apple unveiled early this afternoon .
Secondly , late yesterday , there were Apple 's blow - out fiscal 2009 fourth - quarter results : $ 1.67 billion profit and 3.05 million Macs shipped , the majority notebooks .
Apple outperformed Wall Street 's consensus , blasting past the econolypse 's effects like it was business as usual .

Exactly who is talking about Windows 7 today or will tomorrow ?
Or gasp , on launch day -- Oct. 22nd ?
Netbooks are a Plague
Apple 's new product release timing is clearly deliberate , designed to pull attention away from Windows 7 .
But Apple also is looking to pull away Windows PC sales at the high end , where Macs are strongest and PCs are weakest .
Surely , Apple executives realize that the PC industry is hoist with its own netbook petard .
I 've complained about netbooks for months .
They are cannibalizing Windows PC sales at an alarming rate .
By comparison , laptops commanded higher margins and average selling prices when their popularity started to increase .
PC manufacturers -- and even Microsoft -- benefited from notebooks ' reversing the trend of falling computer ASPs ; for a time .
By comparison , netbooks are a plague , because they dramatically lower ASPs and margins and pull away sales from real laptops .
Last week , Gartner and IDC issued preliminary PC shipment data for third quarter .
Both analyst firms once again identified netbooks as driving portable and overall PC shipments .
Gartner observed the negative impact on ASPs .
Mikako Kitagawa , Gartner principal analyst , said in a statement :
The consumer mobile PC market drove US shipment growth in the third quarter of 2009 , fueled by back - to - school sales .
However , the results came with a revenue loss because of very steep declines in average selling prices ... Consumers were comfortable buying PCs , but they were relentlessly looking for bargains .
Our preliminary research shows consumer mobile PC ASPs declined more than 20 percent compared to a year ago .
On October 8 , DisplaySearch explained netbook 's derisive impact on PC ASPs .
Laptop ASPs fell to $ 688 in second quarter from $ 704 in first quarter and $ 849 in Q2 2008 .
Netbook prices fell to $ 361 from $ 371 and $ 506 , respectively , during the same time period .
Additionally , netbooks accounted for 22.2 percent of overall PC sales and 11.7 percent of revenues .
Netbook sales jumped a staggering 264 percent year over year , while overall laptop sales ( without counting netbooks ) declined 14 percent .
Netbooks remain the Windows PC industry 's huge Achilles tendon , exposed and ready to be cut by an aggressive Apple .
Windows 7 is n't going to lessen demand for netbooks .
Consumers might find them even more appealing because of Microsoft 's new operating system .
The " Pay More " Principle
Apple positioned Macs as the alternative for people willing to pay more , which is a surprising number of buyers given the gloomy economy .
Today 's new Mac product announcements give potential shoppers more reasons to look Apple 's way -- even with Windows 7 launching on Thursday .
For Betanews readers frothing to comment , I want to be absolutely clear : I am not suggesting Windows 7 wo n't sell well .
But I am asserting that many new Windows 7 sales will be on netbooks , not the high - priced , margin - rich systems Microsoft and PC partners need to sell .
Something else -- and this is hugely important :
Last week , there was speculation that PC and peripheral manufacturers may have overproduced for the holiday quarter in big anticipation of Windows 7 demand .
Based on my own quiet channel checks , I have the same concern .
I 'll predict now that Windows 7 PC supply will be greater than consumer or small business buying demand during fourth quarter .
If OEMs anticipated big demand for netbooks , then the bigger problem will be for Microsoft , which makes less on Windows 7 Starter Edition than other 7 versions .
But if OEMs bet big on pricer systems , they will stuff the retail channel this holiday season .
The resulting price war would be good for consumers looking for bargains , but further sap tight OEM margins .
Macs have remained largely immune to the economic gloom or even the potential threat of lower - priced Windows PCs .
But Macs have competed against Windows Vista PCs .
Can Macs defy Windows 7 gravity ?
Because of the netbook scourge , I must say yes .
Few Windows PC manufacturers are competing where Apple sales are strongest : Computers selling for $ 1,000 or more .
But all major OEMs are fighting for sales in the segment for the smallest , least powerful , lowest - cost and least profitable portables .
Are their executives insane ?
I 'm on record as asserting that Windows 7's release will stall Mac market share gains .
My reasoning : Windows 7 netbooks are sure to drive up PC unit volumes .
But market share is but one measure of success .
Yesterday there was an interesting Twitter discussion about market volume versus sales margins .
Jason Snell , Macworld editorial director tweeted : " Apple sold 2.3 M laptops at an average price of $ 1,265 per unit .
Imagine how much money it could have lost if it had a netbook ! "
He 's absolutely right , and so is Apple for choosing not to compete in a portable segment where brands and margins are lost to lowest price .
Mind Share versus Market Share
Apple has got geekdom's attention , and that of Wall Street and even consumer and trade publications .
For today and tomorrow and quite possibly Thursday , which otherwise should belong to Microsoft and Windows 7 .
Some enthusiasts will be quick to point out many apparent Mac shortcomings .
Windows PC defenders will rightly observe that :
" The new MacBook packs less RAM and storage than comparably priced Windows PCs . "
Maybe , but the $ 999 price will appeal to enough buyers , who will get a sturdy , attractive new enclosure and big battery life .
" The 27 - inch iMac is too big and too pricey at $ 1,699 . "
Maybe , but the screen size makes the desktop a potential computer and TV , when streaming or playing programs or when attached to a tuner from companies like El Gato .
" The updated Mac mini remains pricey at $ 599 . "
Maybe , but price is low enough for many people thinking of adding a Mac as second PC .
The $ 999 Snow Leopard Server Mac mini has huge potential appeal to small or home - based businesses .
There seems to be a blind spot when it comes to understanding Macs in relationship to Windows PCs , and I do n't understand why .
Many analysts , computer enthusiasts and reporters miss something simple : Macs compete against Windows PCs , while Windows PCs compete against , well , Windows PCs .
Apple can compete differently because Macs are the alternative to a big , saturated Windows PC market .
Macs are the new thing , while another Windows PC is just another old thing .
Macs will compete against PCs , but in the PC market Windows XP ( and some Vista ) will compete against Windows 7 .
Yesterday with record Mac sales and today with new Mac products , Apple has declared -- at least for holiday 2009 -- war on the entire PC industry .
To win , Apple just needs to make more money off lower volumes .
Apple does n't need to gobble up market share .
A few points of share here or there are huge to Apple but losses to Macs have little impact on PC OEMs .
It 's an unfair battle in some ways , because the PC industry is n't fighting Macs but a civil war of Windows old against Windows new .
Sadly , netbooks will scorch the earth behind every sale .
Steel girders crashing down on commuters crossing the Oakland - San Francisco Bay Bridge ; drivers killed in Minneapolis as an overwater link on a major interstate highway collapsed underneath them ; hundreds of people drowned in New Orleans as levees supposedly designed to protect the city from catastrophic flooding were overwhelmed by Hurricane Katrina ’s storm surge .
There is an evident pattern here – and it can be traced directly to federal , state and local government ’s failure to devote both its attention and taxpayers ’ money to the mundane and largely invisible job of maintaining the nation ’s infrastructure as opposed to “ investing ” it in more politically rewarding economic development projects .
“ We never talked about levees ” , as one member of New Orleans ’s Levee Board later admitted .
Predictably more responsive to the parochial interests of developers , realtors , financial institutions and other local special - interest groups , Louisiana ’s levee district boards deliberately expanded their bureaucratic fiefdoms far beyond their original mandates .
Over time , using its powers of eminent domain for flood - control projects , the governing board of New Orleans ’s Levee District became the largest landlord at Lake Pontchartrain .
It built two marinas there , constructed parks , walking paths and other amenities along the lakefront and , in order to spur development at the sites it helped finance , built roads , a commuter airport , and a dock leased to the Belle of Orleans , a floating casino , in return for a cut of the expected gaming revenue .
New Orleans ’s district board also considered , but ultimately abandoned , a plan to lay fiber - optic cable along 26 miles of the city ’s levee system .
The humdrum job of flood - control maintenance took a backseat to more newsworthy lakefront development initiatives .
As a result of that neglect , sections of the levee along the Industrial Canal , where a major breach occurred , was built around a steel floodwall that had no horizontal footing , was surrounded by protective pilings that may not have been driven deeply enough to provide stability , was compromised further by seepage underneath its base , and consequently was simply pushed aside by Katrina ’s storm surge , creating an opening so large that a river barge was swept through it .
Bureaucrats in California ’s Bay Area , Minneapolis , New Orleans and elsewhere can afford to roll the dice on your behalf – and evade responsibility for the ensuing failure of roads , bridges and dams – because they likely will have left public office before people are injured or killed as a result of their bypassing of needed repairs .
The nation ’s infrastructure is deteriorating , but one should be cautious in supporting the spending of economic “ stimulus ” money to mend it .
Tax revenue will by and large be earmarked for financing much more visible “ shovel - ready ” projects .
Politicians garner a greater electoral payoff from financing new construction projects than from fixing potholes or the supports of aging bridges .
Further headlines of bureaucratic death and destruction surely will follow .

Concluding Remarks
New version .
The present essay was originally written , or at least published , in 1999 ; but I decided to rewrite almost all of it in March 2005 , when I found the time to engage in more detailed hermeneutics .
Following an analysis that could be characterized as almost Talmudic ( though not as mere ‘ pilpul ’ ) , my conclusions about Mill ’s methods are considerably more severe .
Preamble
Below , I list John Stuart Mill ’s five “ Methods of Experimental Inquiry ” ; then I try to expose and evaluate them .
It should be noted that though my approach is at times critical , my main intent is to clarify ; I am more interested in Mill ’s achievements , than in his apparent mistakes .
( All symbols used below are mine – introduced to facilitate and clarify discussion . )
Mill ’s terminology is a bit obscure , but can be interpreted with some effort .
In the paradigm ( the first method ) , he seems to be looking out at the world , or a specific domain of it , and observing something ( say , X ) occurring in some things or events , in scattered places and times , and not occurring in others ; and also observing some second thing ( say , Y ) occurring in some things or events , in scattered places and times , and not occurring in others ; and he wonders at how two such events can be causally related .
In the first three methods , Mill verbally differentiates the two things under study by naming one “ the phenomenon ” ( X , for us ) and the other “ the circumstance ” ( Y , for us ) , suggesting that in his mind ’s eye the former is the effect and the latter its cause , although note well in his conclusions he rightly ( usually ) considers the two items interchangeable , so that either might be the cause or effect of the other .
In the fourth method , Y is viewed as a “ part ” of the “ phenomenon ” X . In the last method , Mill refers to both items with the same word , viz . “ phenomenon ” .
Whatever the words used for X and Y , it is clear that Mill has no intent to prejudice the conclusion .
These terms are intended very broadly to mean any thing or event , i.e. ( since he is considering experimental inquiry ) any object of perception .
( I prefer the very neutral – purely logical – term “ item ” for this . )
Now , these items ( X , Y , or their negations ) are found scattered in the world , or some segment thereof , in various things or events , in scattered places and times – this is what Mill means by “ instances ” .
Wherever X , Y , or their negations occur , that is one of the “ instances ” or cases under consideration .
Thus , the instances might be instances of a kind of thing ( e.g. humans or water ) , and X , Y , or their negations , might be predicates ( in a broad sense , including any attribute or movement or situation or quantitative property or relation or whatever ) of that subject .
The goal of Mill ’s present study , as its name implies , is methodological : he seeks to correlate phenomena , i.e. to identify how we can establish one thing to be a cause or effect of another , to whatever extent .
Given certain facts about X and Y , what conclusions can be drawn as to their causal relation ?
The causal relation investigated is evidently causation ( of whatever mode ) , rather than volition ( although once volitions have taken place , their results become causatives ) , note .
He has in mind experimental inquiry – but in fact , his arguments could equally be applied to passive observations .
His are ( ideally , at least ) universal inductive principles , which effectively define various causative relations , as well as offer practical guidance for their discovery .
As we shall see , Mill apparently makes numerous mistakes ; and overall , his treatment of causation is not as systematic and exhaustive as it should have been .
For all that , his doctrine is instructive , as is the discussions it stimulates .
1. The Joint Method of Agreement and Difference
Mill stated :
If two or more instances ( A , B… ) in which the phenomenon ( X ) occurs have only one circumstance in common ( Y ) , while two or more instances ( C , D… ) in which it ( X ) does not occur have nothing in common save the absence of that circumstance ( Y ) , the circumstance ( Y ) in which alone the two sets of instances differ , is the effect , or the cause , or an indispensable part of the cause [ of the given phenomenon ] ( X ) .
Let X be the phenomenon , and A , B… be instances in which it occurs , and C , D… be instances in which it does not occur ; and let Y be a circumstance the former instances ( A , B… ) have in common exclusively , and the latter instances ( C , D … ) lack in common exclusively .
Then , according to Mill :
Instances A , B… have X and have Y ( exclusively ) ; and
Instances C , D… lack X and lack Y ( exclusively ) ;
Therefore : Y is the effect , or the cause ( or an indispensable part of the cause ) , of X .
This may be considered as an inductive argument , with two compound premises and a disjunctive conclusion ( i.e. a set of three possible conclusions ) .
I have here put in brackets and in italics those parts of the premises and the conclusion that I consider mistaken , for reasons I shall presently discuss .
A simplified and corrected version of Mill ’s statement would look as follows :
If a phenomenon ( X ) is invariably accompanied by another ( Y ) , and its absence ( not - X ) is invariably accompanied by the other ’s absence ( not - Y ) –– we may infer that X is the cause of Y , or Y is the cause of X , in the sense of complete and necessary causation .
This simple statement is an apt description of the strongest causative relation possible between two items X and Y or between their negations .
It corresponds to what David Hume earlier called “ constant conjunction ” , between two phenomena and between their negations .
That this is for Mill the essence of the method under consideration is evident in the name he gave it : “ agreement and difference ” .
This name also shows his awareness that causation has both a positive and a negative aspect .
Had Mill contented himself with such a simple statement , I would have congratulated him for providing scientists with an excellent research tool .
I do not therefore quite know why Mill chose to complicate the matter by adding an extraneous condition in each premise and proposing an inaccurate alternative conclusion .
Before we consider these problems , however , let me further analyze the intent of Mill ’s main statement .
The terms “ agreement ” and “ difference ” in the title of this method refer respectively to having in common or lacking in common some feature ( namely the “ circumstance ” Y ) .
The expression “ joint ” method here is due to these terms recurring separately in the next two methods .
When Mill refers to “ two or more instances ” in each premise , he must in fact be referring to the two or more instances , i.e. all ( the known ) instances .
Clearly , this must be the case , otherwise it would be conceivable that we encountered instances of X without Y , or instances of not - X without not -Y ; and if that were the case , the proposed strong conclusion would not be valid .
Mill ought to have added the definite article “ the ” to avoid all misunderstanding .
Mill ’s use of the expression “ two or more ” is due to his trying to say several ( too many ) things at once .
First , that one instance is hardly sufficient to establish causation ; there must be repetition of the conjunctions .
Second , the number of repetitions is indefinite , because we are here ( except when dealing with finite sets ) concerned with open - ended induction .
We can never know all the instances directly , but can only arrive at general premises through generalization from all known cases to all cases period .
The conclusion is only as valid as those generalizations .
The form “ If X , then Y , and if not X , then not Y ” ( = “ Y is the effect of X ” ) and its contraposite “ if Y , then X , and if not Y , then not X ” ( = “ Y is the cause X ” ) are both generalizations from the forms “ X and Y are universally conjoined , and not - X and not - Y are universally conjoined ” .
If , upon further inquiry , the latter generalities turn out to be inaccurate , the inferences drawn from them must also be attenuated .
Mill should have specified all that explicitly ( I do not know if he did so somewhere else ) .
But there is little doubt in my mind that he tacitly intended it .
He might also have pointed out that the “ two sets of instances ” involved ( here symbolized as A , B… and C , D… ) once generalized , together exhaustively cover the whole world .
Another implicit detail worth highlighting is that “ X is contingent and Y is contingent ” .
This is inferable from the observation and mention of occurrences of X and of not - X , and likewise regarding Y and not -Y .
Note also that although Mill speaks of “ the phenomenon ” or “ the circumstance ” – the predicates X and Y are general terms , and not one - time happenstances , since each occurs in “ two or more instances ” .
Finally , looking at Mill ’s conclusion , we may add that his uncertainty as to which of the two items X and Y causes the other ( at least in our main conclusion ) is justified .
Since the relationships described in the premises are symmetrical with regard to X and Y ( apart from purely verbal differences ) , the conclusion cannot differentiate between them .
At this level , then , the words “ cause ” and “ effect ” have no formal difference ; some other condition ( such as time ’s arrow or the degree of abstraction ) must be specified before we can identify a direction of causation .
Now , let us turn to criticism of Mill ’s formula .
Mill ’s first inexplicable complication is his requirement that the “ circumstance in common ” ( viz. Y or not -Y ) in the premises be exclusive .
In the first premise , he says Y is the “ only one ” ; and in the second , there is “ nothing save ” not - Y .
Moreover , these circumstances must “ alone ” differentiate the two sets of instances , for the conclusion to follow .
Mill apparently fears that some third item , say Z , might come into play and affect the projected strong relation between X and Y .
However , this fear is formally unjustified .
Let us consider the extreme case where three items X , Y , Z are constantly conjoined , and their negations not - X , not -Y , not - Z likewise always occur in tandem .
In such a situation , all the following propositions ( and their respective contraposites ) are true :
If X then Y , and if not X then not Y .
If X then Z , and if not X then not Z .
If Y then Z , and if not Y then not Z .
The truth of the latter two propositions does not impinge upon the truth of the first one .
The causative relation between X and Y remains the same , even if some third factor like Z comes into play .
The same can be argued if only one of these extra propositions is true .
In such situations , we would simply conclude that there are parallel causations , or again causative chains .
Mill apparently failed to develop these concepts , and inserted an extraneous requirement of exclusivity in a vague attempt to insure against possible third - factor interference .
In truth , the relation between any two variables X and Y can be determined without reference to any other variables .
If – as indeed does occur – the two variables under consideration are affected by others , to the extent that their relation is weaker than here concluded , we will soon notice the fact by observing that X is not always with Y , and / or that not - X is not always with not - Y .
But in such case , the stated premise (s ) about constant conjunction will simply not be true !
In other words , in such case , Mill ’s conception of the premise (s ) would be self - contradictory .
Perhaps , someone might interject , Mill was here trying to account for the scientific methodology of “ keeping all other things equal ” ?
No – because : this refers to a situation where there are two or more partial causes to an effect , and to establish each of the partial causes as such , we have to consider each one in turn without the other – and in such case , complete causation could not be a putative conclusion for any of the partial causes .
The second inexplicable complication in Mill ’s formula is his reference in the conclusion to a third alternative , viz .
that Y might be “ an indispensable part of the cause ” of X .
This clause is interesting , first of all , because it indicates that when Mill initially states that Y might be “ the effect , or the cause ” of X , he has in mind complete causation ( as distinct from the partial causation in the third alternative ) .
With regard to this third alternative , let us first notice that Mill does not mention that X might equally be “ an indispensable part of the cause of ” Y , even though he has granted that X and Y are interchangeable in the first two alternatives .
Why this asymmetry ?
I suspect it is not intended to convey some radical insight , but merely reflects Mill ’s terminology and the gradual development of his formula .
He started by referring to Y as a “ circumstance ” , suggesting that he viewed it as the precondition or cause of X , “ the phenomenon ” under investigation .
Then , it probably occurred to him that he could not formally distinguish between X and Y , as to which is the cause and which is the effect – so he added the possibility that Y might be the effect of X .
Then , he got to thinking Y could be a partial ( necessary ) cause of X , so he added that in ; but he simply forgot to recover symmetry and suggest the reverse to be possible .
Now , the big issue : the phrase “ an indispensable part of the cause ” clearly refers to partial necessary causation .
Given that X and Y are indeed constantly conjoined and that their negations are constantly conjoined , no conclusion is formally permissible other than complete necessary causation .
It follows that it was an error for Mill to insert this additional disjunct in his conclusion .
Note parenthetically , Mill does not anywhere give us a clue as to how partial necessary causation might be distinguished from complete necessary causation .
Supposing such alternative conclusion had been correct , he would have been obliged to a detail practical methodology for resolving the issue .
I suspect that Mill resorted to the said third alternative conclusion due to his lingering doubt concerning some possible third factor ( which we above labeled Z ) weakening the relation between X and Y .
Apparently , Mill considered that Z might diminish the degree of causation of X by Y from complete to partial ; i.e. he viewed Z as a complementary partial cause imbedded with Y in some larger cause .
This explanation is appealing , because it suggests a correlation between the said complications in premises and conclusion .
However , as already shown , Z might equally well be a parallel or concatenated complete cause – so we must still fault Mill for imprecision and confusion .
In any case , logically , Mill could not have his cake and eat it too .
If in the premises he has firmly excluded circumstances besides Y , there is no reason for him to make allowance in his conclusion for an eventual complement Z !
Another objection we could raise here is : if Mill considered the possibility here of partial necessary causation , why not equally that of complete contingent causation , or for that matter , the possibility of partial contingent causation ?
If he felt ( perhaps because of their inductive basis ) his premises were shaky , then why did he not foresee all possible modifications of the main conclusion ( complete necessary causation ) ?
The answer to the latter question (s ) is simply that although Mill conceived of partial causation , he apparently never grasped the inverse concept of contingent causation .
This will become evident as we continue our analysis of his methods , and find no mention anywhere of that weak alternative to necessary causation .
Mill ’s omission suggests that , in his mind , only “ indispensable ” things could be causatives ( although if asked the question he might well have denied it ) .
Another deficiency in Mill ’s viewpoint is his failure to consider that in some cases , though X and Y and their negations exhibit perfect regularities of conjunction as described in the premises , we ( i.e. people in general ) do not conclude that Y causes X or X causes Y , but conclude that “ X and Y are both effects of some third thing ” .
This alternative conclusion is admittedly inexplicable formally , just as the distinction between cause and effect is difficult to pinpoint .
But there may in practice be indices that encourage the former , just as there are indices for the latter .
Granting this , it would have been more appropriate for Mill to use that clause as his third alternative .
To sum up : what is manifest from all our above analysis is that Mill had an unclear idea of causation , mixing its paradigm up with its possible variations .
He failed to first clearly distinguish and separately consider all the determinations of causation ( both generically and specifically ) .
Consequently , when he faced the inductive issue – the issue of how in practice to identify causation – his confusion was compounded by the need to consider the fact of generalization and the possibility of particularization .
2. The Method of Agreement
Mill stated :
If two or more instances ( A , B… ) of the phenomenon ( X ) … have only one circumstance ( Y ) in common , the circumstance ( Y ) in which alone all the instances agree is the cause ( or effect ) of the given phenomenon ( X ) .
Let X be the phenomenon , and A , B… be instances in which it occurs ; and let Y be the only circumstance they have in common .
Then , according to Mill :
Instances A , B… have X and have Y ( exclusively ) ; and
Therefore : Y is the cause , or the effect , of X .
This may be considered as an inductive argument , with a compound premise and a disjunctive conclusion ( i.e. a set of two possible conclusions ) .
In view of the name given to this method , the conclusion may be taken to refer to the positive aspect of causation , i.e. complete causation .
I have here put in brackets and in italics the ‘ exclusive ’ demand of the premise , which I consider mistaken for reasons to be presently given .
The essence of this argument is generalization , from the constant conjunction of two items , X and Y , wherever and whenever they are observed to occur ( the instances A , B… ) , to all existing or possible instances .
The conclusion from such universal repetition is either that “ if Y , then X ” ( whence , Y completely causes X ) or that “ if X , then Y ” ( whence , X completely causes Y ) .
Such generalization is logically possible , note well , provided that the “ two or more instances ” ( A , B… ) are all the encountered instances of X and of Y .
Mill obviously intended that , but he should have made it clear – e.g. by saying the two or more – to preempt his formula being construed as allowing for unspecified instances in which X occurs without Y or Y occurs without X .
Mill should have mentioned this to show his awareness of the formalities involved , notably that the form “ if X , then Y ” means “ X is impossible without Y ” ( and similarly , “ if Y , then X ” means “ Y is impossible without X ” ) .
The most significant aspect ( for a causative conclusion ) of the constant conjunction of the two items is the implied denial of possible conjunction between one item and the negation of the other .
We could offer a generous reading Mill ’s statement to cover this issue .
We could suppose that Mill confused circumstances other than Y with circumstances contrary to Y , and suggest that the clause “ only one circumstance ( Y ) in common ” is intended to mean that there are no instances with X accompanied by some negation of Y .
Likewise , the exclusive word “ alone ” could be taken to refer to X rather than Y , meaning that the two or more instances involving X , are the only ones among “ all the instances ” to have Y , implying that there are no instances without X that have Y .
However , I do not seriously think Mill intended this interpretation .
Another tacit proviso for drawing our conclusion is that each of the items X and Y be contingent .
Strictly speaking , a conditional proposition like “ if X , then Y ” or “ if Y , then X ” can be taken to imply causation only if we know that “ X is possible , but unnecessary ” and “ Y is possible , but unnecessary ” .
In Mill ’s statement , here ( unlike in the joint method ) , the occurrence of X and Y is implied in the premise , but their non-occurrence is not mentioned .
This omission is noteworthy , suggesting that Mill was not fully aware of these requirements for validity .
It should be said , too , that once the contingency of the theses is granted , a hypothetical proposition could be contraposited .
That is , “ if X , then Y ” would imply “ if not Y , then not X ” ; similarly , “ if Y , then X ” would imply “ if not X , then not Y ” .
Thus , although the intent of Mill ’s formula ( judging by its title ) was an inference of complete causation , strictly speaking his formula allows for one of necessary causation .
That is , the valid conclusion from his premise is a disjunction of four possible conclusions .
Thus , Mill ’s formula leaves us uncertain , not only as to which item is the cause and which is the effect ( as he admits ) , but also as to whether we are dealing with complete or necessary causation ( which he fails to notice ) .
One thing is sure , however , is that the conclusion is a strong determination .
This is tacitly suggested by Mill in his use of the definite article “ the ” in “ the cause ” or in “ the effect ” .
If he had had in mind weak determination ( i.e. partial or contingent causation ) , he would have probably written “ a cause ” and “ an effect ” .
This brings us to Mill ’s requirement that the instances where the phenomenon ( X ) have “ only one ” circumstance ( Y ) in common , which he repeats when we says that the latter is “ alone ” that in which the instances agree .
Why such exclusiveness ?
We have seen a similar , mystifying concern in Mill ’s joint method .
In the present case , again , Mill seems worried that there may be circumstances other than Y that will weaken the causative relation between Y and X ; i.e. he is trying to preempt any possibility of partial ( or contingent ) causation .
In his mind ’s eye , apparently , if some other circumstance ( say , Z ) was also ( like Y ) constantly conjoined with the phenomenon ( X ) , a doubt would arise as to which of the two circumstances , Y or Z , caused X .
But this is formally unjustified : the possible truth of “ if Y , then X ” would not be affected by the eventual truth of any other proposition like “ if Z , then X ” ; if X , Y and Z are compatible , as our premise confirms , the two hypotheticals are quite compatible .
Mill here again has apparently not considered the possibility of parallel causations or causative chains .
We might add that Mill ’s attempt to limit the number of accompanying circumstances to just ‘ one ’ is ontologically open to doubt .
Are there anywhere in the world two or more things ( instances in which X occurs ) having literally only ‘ one ’ circumstance ( Y ) in common ?
I very much doubt it !
If there is such a set of things , it must be very exceptional .
Most things have many ( innumerable ) common factors .
There are always large predicates like existence , location in space and time , size , shape , etc. to consider , for a start .
Usually , when we say something so exclusive , we do not really mean it .
For example , saying “ the only similarity between these two individuals is their wealth ” – we do not really mean to imply that the individuals do not both have a spinal cord , a heart , a brain , etc .
Such misleading language is not accurate in scientific statements ; at least , we should think twice before ever using it or taking it literally .
3 . The Method of Difference
Mill stated :
If an instance ( A ) in which the phenomenon ( X ) … occurs , and an instance ( B ) in which it ( X ) does not occur , have every circumstance in common save one ( Y ) … [ , that circumstance ] ( Y ) is the effect , or the cause , or an indispensable part of the cause … [ of the given phenomenon ] ( X ) .
Let X be the phenomenon , and A be an instance in which it occurs and B be an instance in which it does not occur ; and let Y be the only circumstance they do not have in common .
Then , according to Mill :
Instance A has X and has Y ; and
Instance B lacks X and lacks Y and
( Instances A and B , have every other circumstance in common ; )
Therefore : Y is the effect , or the cause ( or an indispensable part of the cause ) , of X .
This was intended as an inductive argument , with two compound premises and a disjunctive conclusion ( i.e. a set of three possible conclusions ) .
As we shall demonstrate below , this argument is a rather gauche depiction of necessary causation .
I have here put in brackets and in italics those parts of the premises ( here treated as a third premise ) and the conclusion that I consider mistaken , for reasons I shall presently discuss .
It should first be noted that Mill ’s formulation does not make clear whether the presence of X is accompanied by the presence or absence of Y , and inversely what the absence of X is accompanied by .
I have assumed symmetry , i.e. presence with presence , and absence with absence , in order that the conclusion be expressed wholly in positive terms .
It is not a very important issue , but still a puzzling imprecision on Mill ’s part .
Next , let us notice that Mill ’s formula mentions only one instance ( A ) of X ’s occurrence ( presumably with Y ) and only one instance ( B ) of X’s ( and Y’s ) non-occurrence – without this time in any way suggesting plurality , let alone universality .
Mill ’s wording as it stands does not exclude the possibility of some third instance where X occurs with not -Y , and of some fourth instance where not - X occurs with Y .
In such cases , how would Mill dare claim a causative relation ?
This is very intriguing : I find it hard to suppose that Mill considers that causation can be induced from single instances .
One may from single occurrences deny that some causation is applicable , but one could in nowise affirm it .
In order for the premises to allow the conclusion he proposes , we would have to replace “ an instance ” with “ all ( known ) instances ” in at least one of the premises .
Causation is about patterns of conjunction , not about coincidences .
Mere occasional agreement or difference does not establish a pattern .
One wonders what Mill possibly had in mind !
( I suspect he had eaten or drunk too much the day he wrote this . )
Perhaps Mill considered the constancy of surrounding circumstances as the requisite pattern , somehow .
Why does he at all refer to the two instances ( A and B ) having “ every circumstance in common ” save one ?
This is a redundancy : the very uniformity of surrounding circumstances makes them irrelevant .
In any case , uniformity in only two instances is hardly significant .
I presume , here again , he imagined that if the surrounding circumstances had not been uniform , they would have somehow impinged on the causative relation between X and Y .
For this reason , he insists on their distinctive uniformity whether X or not -X is the case .
He is apparently not aware of the possibility of parallel causations or of causative chains .
In any case , there are always innumerable surrounding circumstances , behaving in quite random fashion , that are totally unconnected with the phenomena at hand ; non-uniformity is not proof of causation .
And moreover , the circumstances that are here uniform ( in the instances A , B ) might behave more erratically in other instances .
Is the exceptive ( “ save one ” ) clause in Mill ’s formula , i.e. the contrasting behavior of Y , his main focus , perhaps ?
The given fact that one circumstance ( Y ) differs from all other circumstances in that it is uncommon , i.e. present in one instance ( say , A ) but absent in the other ( say , B ) , just makes Y stand out from the rest ; it does not signify a causative relation to X .
This is all the more true when , as here , only a couple of instances are under consideration .
But finally , it occurs to me that there is one way we can at least in part redeem Mill ’s statement .
That is by supposing that , when he here referred to “ an instance ” he subconsciously had in mind “ a kind of instance ” !
In that case , A and B are each a set of instances , corresponding respectively to the occurrences of X ( with Y ) and those of not - X ( with not - Y ) .
From these ( experimentally ) encountered instances , we may by generalization assume the same regularities hold universally .
Granting this supposition , and ignoring the extraneous mention of uniform surrounding conditions and insistence that Y be the only non-uniform circumstance , a causative relation between X and Y can indeed be inferred .
However , in such case the premises and conclusion of this method would seem identical to those of the joint method !
This is obviously not Mill ’s intention .
Considering the title of the ‘ method of difference ’ , we can safely suppose that it refers to something found in part in the ‘ joint method of agreement and difference ’ and not found in the ‘ method of agreement ’ .
Mill was apparently struggling to split necessary complete causation ( the ‘ joint method ’ ) into its two components , complete causation ( agreement ) and necessary causation ( difference ) .
He managed to formulate the former , positive aspect readily enough , but had considerable trouble putting his finger on the latter , negative aspect .
A further confirmation of our supposition is to be found by comparison of the conclusions of the three methods .
Note first that whereas the method of agreement concludes that Y is “ the cause ( or effect ) of ” X , the other two methods conclude in reverse order that Y is “ the effect , or the cause … of ” X. Moreover , the joint method and the method of difference , distinctively from the method of agreement , propose as an alternative conclusion that Y might be “ an indispensable part of the cause ” of X .
This latter possibility obviously refers to partial necessary causation , as earlier pointed out .
“ Indispensable ” means that one cannot do without it , it is a sine qua non , a necessity ; and “ part of the cause ” means a fraction of the sufficient cause .
All this suggests that , in Mill ’s mind , the causation found by the method of agreement is essentially positive and whole , whereas that found in the other two ways may be negative and fractional .
But since , as already said , the joint method and the method of difference cannot be identical , the latter must be assumed to focus on necessary causation only .
We should , by combination of the methods of agreement and difference , arrive at the same result as with the joint method .
So , our task is to isolate the ‘ difference ’ component ( necessary causation ) from the ‘ agreement ’ component ( complete causation ) .
Mill might have achieved this by proposing some sort of negative ‘ mirror image ’ of his formula for the method of agreement , one about “ two or more instances ( A , B ) in which the phenomenon ( X ) does not occur ” having “ the absence of one circumstance ( Y ) in common ” .
Some such more analogous statement could be constructed for the method of difference , but I will not even try , because of all the difficulties in the earlier statements already discussed .
Moreover , if we attempt such a reconstruction , we soon realize the title “ method of difference ” to be a misnomer , in view of the use of the term “ agree ” within Mill ’s formula for the method of agreement .
His method of difference is really just another application of the method of agreement , except that we focus in it on the absences , instead of presences , of the items ( X , Y ) concerned .
“ Difference ” ( i.e. disagreement ) can only really be claimed in the joint method , where we switch from presence to absence or vice - versa .
In this perspective , the titles ‘ method of agreement of positives ’ and ‘ method of agreement of negatives ’ might be more appropriate .
Whatever the name used for it , and the language used to formulate it , it is evident for reasons of symmetry that the method of difference aims at the negative aspect of causation , i.e. necessary causation .
It follows that the premise (s ) must be such that by generalization we can ideally conclude that “ if not - X , then not - Y ” or “ if not - Y , then not - X ” .
This would in practice be based on observed constant conjunction between not -X and not -Y .
The matter is that simple !
Mill realizes this at some level , but goes quite astray in his attempt to put it in words .
His statement of the method of difference is incredibly garbled .
He not only repeats some of the mistakes he made in formulating the preceding two methods , but also makes many more .
Before leaving this topic , it should be added that the said constant conjunction of negations only formally implies causation after generalization if the terms concerned are known contingent , i.e. if X is possible and Y is possible .
Moreover , given such contingency , the inferred conditional propositions can be contraposited to “ if Y , then X ” and “ if X , then Y ” ; so that strictly speaking , the conclusion formally allows for complete causation as well necessary causation ( whether of X by Y , or of Y by X ) .
Observed constant conjunction of negations does not , however , formally allow as alternative conclusion partial necessary causation – or for that matter , complete contingent causation or partial contingent causation .
Mill ’s proposition that Y may be “ an indispensable part of the cause ” of X is artificial and erroneous .
Needless to say , reversing its direction would also be erroneous , as would inverting the polarities of the terms .
Anyway , as already pointed out , Mill apparently completely misses out on the possibility of contingent causation .
I have already discussed the issue of partial causation with regard to the joint method , and will not repeat my comments here .
These are commendable attempts by Mill to insert it in his analyses , but his approach so far is unequal to the task .
He makes arbitrary claims in his conclusions , which are incompatible with his premises ; and even supposing consistency , he provides no means to decide between his alternative conclusions .
He does , however , offer some more precise means for identifying partial causes in his next method , that of ‘ residues ’ .
4. The Method of Residues
Mill stated :
Subduct from any phenomenon ( F ) such part ( D ) as is known by previous inductions to be the effect of certain antecedents ( A ) , and the residue ( E ) of the phenomenon ( F ) is the effect of the remaining antecedents ( B ) .
Here , Mill is attempting to deal with partial causation .
He is saying :
Suppose : D is a part of F ; and E is the rest of F ( i.e. D + E = F ) .
And suppose : A causes D ( i.e. presumably , If A , then D , etc. )
It follows that : B causes E ( i.e. presumably , If B , then E , etc . )
Note that a tacit assumption , here ( suggested by the reference in the conclusion to “ remaining ” antecedents ) , which we can readily grant , is that A and B together ( as C , say ) cause F ( the compound of D and E ) , i.e. that :
( A + B ) = C ; and C causes F ( i.e. presumably , If C , then F , etc . )
Note also that I presume that the kind of causation by A of D , and by B of E , intended by Mill , is complete causation , i.e. a relation including positive implication by the cause of the effect ( i.e. if the cause , then the effect ) , plus strictly speaking a negation of the inverse implication ( i.e. if not the cause , not - then not the effect ) .
The causations mentioned and tacit in Mill ’s statement are considered as already established , as he admits by saying “ as is known by previous inductions ” .
The means of induction used is not specified ; he presumably intends one of the other four ‘ methods ’ ( probably the second ) .
His formula is only intended to infer a causation from within other , given causations .
This is a purely deductive argument .
Moreover , Mill appeals to the relation between whole and parts without really defining it .
We could briefly express that relation by saying that D and E together imply and are implied by F .
But to fully clarify this relation , we ought to mention that D without E or E without D , as well as not - D + not - E , amount to not - F. Similarly , with regard to A + B versus C .
Mill ’s process of “ subduction ” is thus essentially based on the following reasoning :
If A+B ( = C ) , then D+E ( = F ) – call this the major premise .
But :
If A , then D – call this the minor premise .
Therefore ,
If B , then E – the putative conclusion .
This argument is , I hasten to add , formally invalid , although a common error of inference !
This can be seen by splitting the major premise into the two hypotheticals :
If A + B , then D
If A + B , then E
Clearly , the minor premise “ if A , then D ” overrides the first proposition , “ if A + B , then D ” , which has the same consequent , showing the component “ B ” of the antecedent to be extraneous .
However , the second proposition , “ if A + B , then E ” , whose consequent is different , is unaffected by the minor premise ; i.e. its antecedent remains compound .
We can , if we wish , “ nest ” this eduction , putting our result in the form “ if A , then if B , then D ” .
But this inference still leaves “ A ” conditional .
Whence , Mill ’s putative conclusion “ if B , then E ” is pretentious .
The only way we could draw it would be to confirm “ A ” to be categorically true .
It does not suffice to mention the element “ A ” conditionally , as in “ if A , then D ” .
Thus , Mill ’s present account of partial causation is not strictly correct .
Partial causation can readily be defined and in practice identified , but the appropriate formula for it is a bit more complicated than Mill suggests .
It requires a more radical understanding and more systematic treatment of causation .
There is no need to go into it here , since I treat it in detail in my main text on the subject .
The notion of a “ residue ” ( or remainder or leftover ) is a mathematical one , rooted in the relation of whole and part : if you have a basket with three fruits and you remove one , you still have two left .
A similar idea can be used in causation – but only to say :
If one of the partial causes is found to be present , then we can anticipate that as soon as the remaining partial causes are also found to be present , all their collective effects will follow on their heels .
Mill ’s ‘ method of residues ’ subconsciously appeals to this obvious truth .
But he confuses the issue , when he considers that things ( like D ) that the present phenomenon ( A ) causes by itself ( i.e. things it alone suffices to bring about ) can be counted as among the collective effects ( like E ) of all the causal phenomena under consideration ( A and B ) .
This is his essential error .
Here again ( as with his previous attempts to infer partial causations ) , his premises and conclusion are not consistent with each other .
Note finally that Mill ’s language is positive , suggesting that he had in mind specifically partial causation .
Here again , as in the preceding methods , he does not apparently consider the other form of weak causation , that involving negative theses , viz . contingent causation .
Moreover , even supposing that Mill had successfully identified partial causatives , he does not here specify that such causes might be necessary or contingent .
Perhaps , having spoken ( although out of place ) about necessary partial causation in the joint method and the method of difference ( mentioning “ an indispensable part of the cause ” ) , he might be supposed here to be focusing on contingent partial causation .
But this would be reading into Mill ’s treatment something he has given no sign he has awareness of .
One more point worth adding , concerning the appeal to “ residues ” in reasoning about causes .
There is indeed a method that can be so named , one commonly used by scientists and ordinary thinkers .
This method was known to Francis Bacon already , long before Mill .
It consists simply of disjunctive apodosis – i.e. the gradual elimination of alternative hypotheses .
Such reasoning has the form :
Either P or Q or R or … is the cause of S ;
these ( P , Q , R , … ) are all the conceivable causes of S .
The cause of S is not … ; and it is not R ; and it is not Q .
Therefore , the cause of S must be P ( i.e. the only remaining alternative ) .
For example , Sherlock Holmes might say : “ the culprit is either Jack or Jill ; it ca n’t be Jack , since he has an alibi ; therefore , it has to be Jill . ”
5 . The Method of Concomitant Variations
Mill stated :
Whatever phenomenon ( X ) varies in any manner whenever another phenomenon ( Y ) varies in some particular manner , ( X ) is either a cause or an effect of that phenomenon ( Y ) , or is connected with it through some fact of causation .
Let X be “ whatever phenomenon ” , and Y be “ another phenomenon ” ; let X1 , X2 , X3 … be variants of X , and Y1 , Y2 , Y3 … be corresponding variants of Y .
Then :
· Whenever Y varies from Y1 to Y2 , X varies from X1 to X2 ;
· Whenever Y varies from Y2 to Y3 , X varies from X2 to X3 ;
· etc. ;
· therefore , X is “ either a cause or an effect of ” Y , “ or is connected with it through some fact of causation ” .
Notice Mill ’s use of “ whenever ” : he is correctly referring to unvarying relations , not mere random coincidences .
That is , we may suppose he was implying that if the variations of the two phenomena ( the kinds of events we labeled X and Y ) are not concomitant , they may be assumed independent of each other .
Mill does not explicitly tell us what degree of causation may be inferred – whether complete and necessary , or only the one or the other , or neither .
He is seemingly open to all possibilities , since he vaguely mentions that “ some fact of causation ” may in some cases be the best conclusion we can draw .
Granting this phrase refers to the weaker determinations , we may suppose that when he refers to “ a cause or an effect ” he means a stronger determination .
However , since he here uses the indefinite article “ a ” , instead of his usual definite article “ the ” , this supposition is debatable .
In sum , Mill concludes some sort of causation to be inferable , but is vague as to which sort and when .
Whereas in the first three methods , changes from presence to absence or vice versa are concerned – in concomitant variations , every incremental change in measure or degree of the cause is accompanied by a corresponding incremental change in the measure or degree of the effect ; and / or vice - versa .
In some cases , the correspondences between two phenomena are in this way very regular ; but in other cases , additional phenomena have to be taken into consideration to clarify the more complex relationship involved .
In any case , the fact of concomitant variation may be considered an ontological derivative of that of causation , dealing with quantitative instead of merely qualitative relationships between two or more phenomena .
That is , in Mill ’s terms , this fifth method is a corollary , or frequent further development , of the preceding four .
In the case of ‘ agreement ’ ( interpreted as complete causation ) , we would expect changes in the cause to be invariably followed by concomitant variations in the effect .
In the case of ‘ difference ’ ( interpreted as necessary causation ) , we would expect changes in the effect indicative of predictable concomitant variations in the cause .
In the ‘ joint ’ case ( i.e. the strongest possible causative relation ) , both these directions of inference would be applicable .
Note that these alternatives are not made clear in Mill ’s formula , where X ’s variations follow Y’s variations , yet X is concluded to be “ either a cause or an effect ” of Y .
Given regular variation of X with Y , the more probable conclusion would be that Y is a complete cause of X ; although a second possible conclusion would be that X is a necessary cause of Y .
Mill presumably does not mention the reverse case , where Y varies with X , simply because he considers that in such case we would just place each term in the other ’s position in his formula .
Fair enough , but then he should at least have mentioned in his formula that in some cases variations are concomitant in one direction only , and in others in both directions !
In the last case ( ‘ residues ’ – interpreted as partial and / or contingent causation ) , we would have to use more a elaborate technique : to identify and monitor all the factors involved , and observe how and how much each varies with whatever changes occur , or are experimentally produced , in the other factors .
This is generally achieved using the cunning method of “ keeping all other things equal ” while investigating just two factors at a time , until all the factors have successively been played off against each other and we obtain a full picture of their multilateral quantitative relationship .
In my view , Mill should have mentioned all that explicitly in his formula .
It is reasonable to assume he knew it , since the method was oft used in scientific experiments in his day .
Why did n’t he , then ?
Let us go on , anyway , and analyze these matters a bit more .
We can theoretically express concomitant variations by means of series of causal propositions , either through statements mentioning changes ( as above initially done ) or more radically through statements mentioning states , like :
If A=A1 , then B=B1 ;
if A=A2 , then B=B2 ;
etc .
However , often in practice , these innumerable , point - by - point correlations between various quantities are plotted on a graph and then summarized in a mathematical equation .
For example , if B is directly proportional to A , we would write ( where k is some constant ) :
B = kA .
Actually , we have to be careful in this matter , because such a mathematical equation implies / presupposes fully convertible relations .
Thus , the following would also have to be true :
If A=A1 , then B=B1 ; if B=B1 , then A=A1 ; where B1=kA1 .
If A=A2 , then B=B2 ; if B= B2 , then A=A2 ; where B2=kA2 .
etc .
This does not have to imply the causation involved to be reversible , only that A be a complete and necessary cause of B .
Thus , while in common language we can readily express concomitant variation between a merely complete cause and its effect ( or conceivably between a merely necessary cause and its effect ) – in the language of mathematical equations , necessary as well as complete causation is implied ( although , I believe , modern mathematics can readily overcome this difficulty ) .
Note well that if we just say “ If A=A1 , then B= B1 ” , it does not exclude that for another value of A ( say , A8 ) , B may have the same value ( B1 ) again .
Such reiterations of value will translate mathematically into more complex formulas than mere proportionality .
More complex relationships may , but do not in all cases , signify partial and / or contingent causation , involving more than two items ( at least two causes and one effect ) .
Thus , note well , Mill ’s statement of this method need not be limited to two variables ; he presumably had this in mind when he wrote the alternative conclusion “ or is connected with it through some fact of causation ” .
Note , finally : the idea of comparing variations between two or more variables was proposed long before Mill , by Francis Bacon .
Concluding Remarks
John Stuart Mill ( 1806 - 73 ) was an English philosopher , a highly educated man whose interests ranged very widely , including all aspects of logic .
He published the work in which he presents the above ‘ methods of experimental inquiry ’ , A System of Logic , when he was 37 .
He sought for a pragmatic , empiricist , inductive approach to knowledge ; an updated logic , but one that would “ supplement and not supersede ” Aristotle’s .
Mill ’s five methods have generally been well received , and I acknowledge them as having been an inspiration to me .
However , as the above analysis shows , though his intentions were laudable , his performance was often woefully inadequate .
I take no pleasure in saying this ; but I am somewhat consoled by the knowledge that others have before me also sharply criticized him .
If these methods had been developed before the dawn of modern science – say before the publication of Isaac Newton ’s Principia ( 1687 ) – I would have congratulated their author for having provided researchers with potentially valuable cognitive tools .
But Mill ’s work is dated 1843 – almost the mid-19th Century !
At that late date in modern science and philosophy , one could no longer discover these research tools , but one could at least give an ex post facto exposé and validation of them .
Mill ’s effort in that direction was , in the last analysis , surprisingly confused , considering his broad knowledge of science and philosophy till his day .
As we have seen , Mill ’s methods could just as well be characterized as techniques ‘ for identifying causation ’ , because that is the form of their conclusions ; and also , because experimental data is not essential to them , i.e. they can be applied as well to passive observations .
His method of residues , unlike the others , is deductive rather than inductive .
Whether this list of methods , without regard to its internal imperfections , constitutes an exhaustive summary of actual scientific techniques is open to debate .
What is clear , anyhow , is that Mill did not fully understand the relations of causation .
Flaws are evident in his treatment of each of his five methods .
Briefly put :
In the ‘ joint method ’ , he seemingly tries and succeeds defining or identifying the paradigm of causation , complete necessary causation .
However , his understanding is put in doubt by his mention of irrelevant conditions ( exclusiveness of the circumstances ) in the premises , and his drawing of an alternative conclusion ( “ an indispensable part of the cause ” ) logically contrary to the given premises .
In the ‘ agreement method ’ , he seemingly tries and succeeds defining or identifying complete causation .
However , his understanding is put in doubt by his mention of irrelevant conditions ( exclusiveness ) in the premises , and his failure to specify the unnecessity of the theses ( as needed to infer causation from constant conjunction ) .
In the ‘ difference method ’ , he seemingly tries but quite fails defining or identifying necessary causation .
His understanding is put in doubt by his appeal to single instances ( instead of kinds ) , his mention of extraneous conditions ( the uniformity of surrounding circumstances ) , and his drawing of an alternative conclusion ( “ an indispensable part of the cause ” ) logically contrary to the seemingly intended premises .
In the ‘ residues method ’ , he seemingly tries to deduce a partial causation from two complete causations .
His understanding is here again put in doubt , by his proposing conflicting premises ( the same thing cannot be both a complete and a partial cause of a given phenomenon ) , and his suggesting an excessive conclusion ( i.e. more than the givens allow ) .
In the ‘ concomitant variations method ’ , he seemingly tries and vaguely succeeds defining or identifying the quantitative aspect of causation .
This is logically his soundest method , but he fails to mention and distinguish the various degrees of causation that may be involved .
Mill obviously had difficulty with the concept of plurality of causes ; i.e. distinguishing between parallelism and composition of causes .
The inclusion of redundancies concerning surrounding circumstances in some of his statements indicates that he did not have an entirely accurate picture of causation .
His resort to seemingly last minute inserts at the tail end of certain conclusions leads to the same suspicion .
Moreover , in none of the five methods does he so much as hint he has heard of contingent causation .
Mill ’s first four methods may be taken to essentially refer to the causative forms mn , m , n , and p , respectively .
The first and third methods mention the specific determination np , but give us no clue as to how such causation might be established , i.e. concluded rather than mn or n , respectively .
Since he apparently ignores the generic determination q , he misses the specific determinations mq and pq .
His treatment is thus neither symmetrical nor exhaustive .
I should also point out that Mill does not clearly distinguish between generic and specific determinations .
I assume he does not intend the generic determinations that he separately as well as jointly affirms ( namely : m , n ) as absolute lone determinations ; but the issue is not to my knowledge explicitly raised by him so we can not be sure what he imagined .
As we have seen , Mill ’s formulations are open to further criticism .
His language is often ambiguous and its intent difficult to fathom .
He did not always manage to capture in words what he was trying to say .
His logic is in places dubious , if not downright self - contradictory .
He may propose mutually incoherent premises and / conclusions that contradict explicit premises .
The main reason for the weaknesses in Mill ’s treatment is perhaps his attempt to deal with definition and induction simultaneously .
He would have been more successful if he had , more systematically , first defined the various forms of causation ( ratio essendi ) and then investigated how their contents may be induced ( ratio cognoscendi ) .
Perhaps due to his association with the Utilitarian school of philosophy , he was ideologically inclined towards a rather heuristic approach , eschewing a more theoretical treatment of causation .
The logician ’s main task is to describe and validate forms of reasoning .
While Mill took some pains to describe causal arguments , he made little effort to validate them .
At times , his treatment seems like a sham – not out of malice , but due to negligence .
He does not seem to intentionally lie ( as some do ) ; but one gets the impression he has not really done his best to do a good job , and he does not expect anyone to notice or care .
The logician ’s role is also to provide methodological aids for scientists , students , and indeed thinking people in general .
Whether Mill ’s contributions to causal logic ever actually affected anyone ’s investigation of nature in a positive or negative way is hard to say .
Nevertheless , some of his thoughts on the subject were misleading , and the fact should be made public .
This is all very disappointing , considering J. S. Mill ’s status in British intellectual history .
How could a man of his social standing and educational caliber have made such mistakes , and moreover gotten away with them , one wonders .
After all , causation and its varieties were pretty well known to the ancients ; this is even evident in commonly used Latin legal terms , like causa sufficiens or sine qua non .
And Mill was very well read in ancient thought ; he was brought up with it by his father , James .
Major British philosophers had already discussed causality at considerable length .
John Locke ( 1632-1704 ) , in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding ( 1690 ) , put forward a theory of induction based on regularities of sequence between phenomena .
David Hume ( 1711 - 1776 ) , for all his avowed skepticism in An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding ( 1748 ) , had clearly expounded constant conjunction .
Mill ’s views about causation were frankly influenced by Hume’s .
Most shocking , is the realization that Mill ’s logical treatise ( 1843 ) was published 238 years after the founding father of British Empiricism , Francis Bacon ( 1561 -1626 ) , published his Novum Organon ( 1605 ) .
Mill was aware of Bacon ’s work , too , since he ( rightly ) criticized Bacon ’s view of causation as simplistic in various respects .
But he manifestly failed to notice and learn the important lessons taught by this unsung ( or insufficiently sung ) hero of the modern scientific method ; namely , Bacon ’s programme of adduction and matricial analysis ( to use my terminology ) .
Suffices to quote the Encyclopaedia Britannica ( 2004 ) description of Bacon ’s “ new method ” for this failure of Mill ’s to be clear :
The crucial point , Bacon realized , is that induction must work by elimination not , as it does in common life and the defective scientific tradition , by simple enumeration .
Thus he stressed “ the greater force of the negative instance ” — the fact that while “ all A are B ” is only very weakly confirmed by “ this A is B , ” it is shown conclusively to be false by “ this A is not B . ”
He devised tables , or formal devices for the presentation of singular pieces of evidence , in order to facilitate the rapid discovery of false generalizations .
What survives this eliminative screening , Bacon assumes , may be taken to be true .
Bacon presents tables of presence , of absence , and of degree .
Tables of presence contain a collection of cases in which one specified property is found .
They are then compared to each other to see what other properties are always present .
Any property not present in just one case in such a collection cannot be a necessary condition of the property being investigated .
Second , there are tables of absence , which list cases that are as alike as possible to the cases in the tables of presence except for the property under investigation .
Any property that is found in the second case cannot be a sufficient condition of the original property .
Finally , in tables of degree proportionate variations of two properties are compared to see if the proportion is maintained .
Note in passing that “ every ” implies general knowledge – which is empirically impossible without generalization ( except with regard to finite sets ) .
We can never in practice be sure to have identified all existing circumstances ; and though we may assume we have done so , as a working hypothesis , we have to remain vigilant and continue to look for still unidentified factors that might also be relevant .

GeoMeme is a web app ( and also a mobile web app for iPhone and Android ) that I recently developed as a pet project .
It measures real - time local twitter trends .
Visitors to GeoMeme choose a location on the map , and two search terms to compare .
GeoMeme then measures and compares the number of matching tweets within the bounds of the map , based on public data from a number of mobile twitter apps .
As an example , GeoMeme can work out that beats in San Francisco :
A large amount of geo-data is generated by GeoMeme , and so arises a need shared by many geo apps : scalable , fast , and accurate spatial queries , used to select a subset of geo -data for display as markers on a map , or on Google Earth .
Google App Engine
Google App Engine is an obvious choice for hosting your geo app .
The App Engine datastore is built on top of Google ’s BigTable technology which scales very well , and is optimized for fast data retrieval .
And it does n’t cost the earth like some traditional GIS database solutions .
Inequality constraint
If you are coming from a background of relational databases , you might think the solution here would be to store the latitude and longitude of all your markers in a database table , and do a simple query to retrieve only those contained within the bounds of the map .
However , the flipside of being optimized for fast data retrieval is that BigTable only allows inequality filters on a single dimension , to avoid the burden of full table scans .
For example , the following form of spatial query is not supported because it specifies inequality filters on both latitude and longitude dimensions :
SELECT latitude , longitude , title FROM myMarkers WHERE latitude >= : south AND latitude <= : north AND longitude >= : west AND longitude <= : east >>>
BadFilterError : invalid filter :
Only one property per query may have inequality filters
Geohash to the rescue
Fortunately , there is an answer to this : geohash , the geocoding system invented by Gustavo Niemeyer .
My suspicion is that Niemeyer has travelled back in time after working out how to collapse two - dimensional space into a single dimension , but you might want to read the Wikipedia explanation of the algorithm instead .
An example : the location of the Sydney Opera House can be specified in two dimensions as {latitude : - 33.858 , longitude : 151.215} , or in a single dimension as {geohash : r3gx2ur29zzg7} .
Schuyler Erle has written an open source geohash python module , which enables the following form of spatial query on Google App Engine , because the inequality filter is specified only on a single dimension :
sw_geohash = Geohash ( ( west , south ) ) ne_geohash = Geohash ( ( east , north ) ) SELECT latitude , longitude , title FROM myMarkers WHERE geohash >= :sw_geohash AND geohash <= : ne_geohash
Do n’t hash me , coz I ’m close to the edge
However …!
We ’re not done yet , because an artifact of the geohash algorithm is that queries like the one above can often return rogue markers which are outside of the required bounds , when the map spans what we shall call a geohash “ faultline ” .
This problem is particularly evident near the equator and the Greenwich Meridian , which are the biggest faultlines , but there are actually faultlines all over the place at every zoom level .
Faultline correction
GeoMeme solves this problem using “ faultline correction ” , an approach that I would like to share here :
If a spatial query is vulnerable to faultlines , it is split into multiple sub-queries that do not cross the faultline .
Sub -query limits are approximately weighted according to their relative size .
Sub -queries are executed in parallel , taking advantage of BigTable ’s distributed goodness , and the results combined , so all this happens very fast .
Even though the sub-queries are executed in parallel without any significant impact on user experience , App Engine CPU costs can increase to around 2 x the CPU cost of a single less accurate query .
Sub -query results are memcached to reduce this CPU overhead .
Here ’s a demo showing the effect of geohash faultlines , and the relative accuracy of spatial queries with or without faultline correction .
Rogue markers are shown in the area surrounding the map .
Switch between Correction : off / on / double and compare the accuracy .
Note : “ double ” correction is an advanced option which splits the sub-queries into sub-sub - queries so that they do not cross any faultlines either .
This can further increase accuracy , but with further CPU cost ( up to 8 x the CPU cost of a single less accurate query ) .
All the source code can be found here , including ffGeoSearch , a python module to handle faultline - friendly geo search , if you want to use this technique on your own geo app .
Enjoy !
This post is one of a series that aims to share some of the technology innovation that can be found in GeoMeme .
Other posts cover topics such as fast map re-location using Google Static Maps v2 , and location - aware mobile web apps using Google Maps v3 .
Dear Glenn ,
First of all , congratulations on deciding to become a community organizer for the cause of liberty and prosperity , as reported all over the media recently .
You will be a stark contrast to the Marxist in the White House who boasts of his u201 Ccommunity organizing u201D efforts for the exact opposite cause , ACORN - style socialism as defined by its u201CPeople ’s Platform.u201D
( His nationalization of banks , General Motors , and possibly health care , and his administration ’s bombastic , anti-capitalist rhetoric , reminds me a lot of Lenin ’s first months in power . )
Glenn , I ’m writing to offer a few suggestions with regard to your upcoming community organizing efforts , which I ’m sure will attract huge media attention and could potentially be very influential .
First , you really need to u201 Cman upu201D those u201CFive Pledgesu201D of yours , especially Pledges 1 and 2 .
There you say you are in favor of a balanced budget , and that government should not increase the financial burden on taxpayers u201 Cduring difficult economic times.u201D
I certainly agree with the last part of this statement .
Raising taxes during a depression is exactly the opposite of what even a central - planning Keynesian would advocate .
This only highlights the fact that Obama is not a Keynesian central planner , as Democratic presidents usually are ( and most Republicans as well ) , but a central planner of the Marxian variety .
Marxists want to destroy the existing economic system , creating a social catastrophe that they hope will allow them to foment a revolution and consolidate their political power .
Keynesians are merely neo-mercantilists who use Keynesian ideology to pull the wool over the public ’s eyes with regard to their policy of perpetual political plunder under the guise of a perpetual quest for prosperity .
But come on , Glenn , do n’t fall for that Big Government propaganda line about the alleged virtues of a balanced budget .
What the government establishment means by budgetary balance is a devotion to endless tax increases to fund all of their pie - in - the - sky special - interest spending programs .
According to this propaganda line a doubling , tripling , or quadrupling of government spending , and the consequent shrinking of private - sector prosperity , is perfectly fine as long as taxes are also doubled , tripled , or quadrupled at the same time .
Americans already pay more in taxes than medieval serfs did , so what ’s so good about waiting for u201 Cgood economic timesu201D to be plundered and robbed even more ?
I notice that you frequently display a picture of Thomas Jefferson on the television screen during your Fox News Channel program .
You would do well to dump those first two pledges and , in their place , adopt what Mr. Jefferson said in his first inaugural address :
[ A ] wise and frugal Government , which shall restrain men from injuring one another , shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement , and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned .
This is the sum of good government . . .
Saying that government u201 C shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned u201D means there should be no taxes on earnings .
If you ’re serious about calling yourself a Jeffersonian , Glenn , you would advocate the total elimination of income taxation ( for starters ) , and not potentially endless increases of it u201 Cduring good times .
u201D
You should also abandon that Pledge # 3 about u201 Cenergy independence .u201D
Such rhetoric is just another protectionist smokescreen , no different from those who insist that we must free ourselves of foreign beef , tomatoes , cars , etc .
Isolating ourselves from the international division of labor is a good recipe for economic disaster .

Your pledge # 5 is also highly problematic .
You say , u201CI believe the United States of America is the greatest country on earth and therefore will not apologize for policies or actions which have served to free more and feed more people around the world than any other nation on the planet .
u201D
The problem with this is that you equate u201 Cthe United States of Americau201D with the federal government .
I think your confusion stems for a misunderstanding of the difference between nationalism and patriotism .
A nationalist , as my old friend Clyde Wilson has said , is someone who promotes the aggrandizement of the state in all its u201 Cglory .
u201D
A patriot , in sharp contrast , is someone who simply loves his country and its people .
Your statement is way too nationalistic .
It seems to be a version of the neocon propaganda line that u201CWe saved Europe from the Nazis in World War II , therefore , every successive military intervention , no matter how misguided , and no matter how many innocent foreigners are murdered , is justified .
The rest of the world should just shut up .u201D
This is what the neocons at the Claremont Institute and the American Enterprise Institute would call u201Cstatesmanship , u201D but u201 Carrogant , imperialistic propagandau201D would be more accurate .
Lincoln Unmasked : What ...
Thomas J. Dilorenzo Best Price : $ 5.95 Buy New $ 9.85 ( as of 07:10 EST - Details )
Good luck with the Washington , D.C. rally that you ’re planning for next August at the Lincoln Memorial .
One more suggestion : Hold the rally at the Jefferson Memorial instead .
Lincoln was a tyrant who waged total war on his own citizens , orchestrating the murder of some 350,000 of them , including 50,000 Southern civilians .
Jefferson was the founding generation ’s champion of liberty .
In his first inaugural address Lincoln first made an ironclad defense of slavery , including a promise to support its enshrinement in the U.S. Constitution , while threatening u201Cbloodshedu201D and u201 Cinvasionu201D over tax collection .
He said it was his u201 Cduty to collect the duties and imposts , u201D and u201 Cbeyond that there will not be an invasion of any state .
u201D
The tariff on imports had just been doubled two days earlier .
u201CPay Up or Dieu201D was his message .
Contrast this , Glenn , with what Thomas Jefferson said in his first inaugural address : u201CIf there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this Union or to change its republican form , let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it .u201D
This could not possibly be more different from Lincoln ’s u201CDo As I Say Or Dieu201D commandment .
After all , secession or u201Cseparationu201D from the British Empire is how America was created .
Secession was u201 Ctheu201D principle of the American Revolution according to George Washington ’s Secretary of State , Timothy Pickering .
Since the theme of your television program on the Fox News Channel is u201CRefounding America , u201D
I think you should highlight and discuss the right of secession and its virtues on your program every single day .
It is probably the only real hope that we have to escape Obammunism .
If you ’re not convinced , consider this :
In a January 29 , 1804 letter to Dr. Joseph Priestly , Jefferson wrote that u201CWhether we remain in one confederacy , or form into Atlantic and Mississippi confederacies , I believe not very important to the happiness of either part .
Those of the western confederacy will be as much our children & descendants as those of the eastern . . . and did I now foresee a separation [ i.e. , secession ] at some future day , yet I should feel the duty & the desire to promote the western interests as zealously as the eastern . . .u201D
In an August 12 , 1803 letter to his friend John Breckenridge on the subject of the New England Federalists , who were at that time threatening to secede from the union , Jefferson said that if there were a u201Cseparationu201D then u201CGod bless them both [ North and South ] & keep them in the union if it be for their good , but separate them , if it be better .
u201D
Hamiltonu2019s Curse : ... Thomas DiLorenzo Best Price : $ 1.35 ( as of 11:00 EST - Details )
As you can see , Glenn , Lincoln was in many ways the anti-Jefferson , which is to say , an enemy of liberty .
Consider Mr. Jefferson ’s most famous publication , The Declaration of Independence .
In that document the states are said to be u201C free and independent .
u201D Lincoln disagreed and waged total war on the Southern states to u201 Cproveu201D himself right .
They were not free and independent , he insisted , despite the clear language of the Declaration and of all the other founding documents on this matter .
In his u201CTrain of Abusesu201D condemnation of the King of Great Britain Jefferson said u201CHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly … u201D Lincoln imprisoned members of the Maryland legislature , deported a Democratic congressman , and imposed military rule on parts of the South that became conquered territory during the war .
This is no different from what King George III did .
u201CHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone , u201D Jefferson wrote .
By suspending habeas corpus and imprisoning tens of thousands of Northern citizens without any due process , Lincoln made his will the law of the land , just as King George III had done .
u201CHe has erected a multitude of New Offices , and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people , and eat out their substance , u201D said Jefferson in the Declaration .
Myriad new bureaucracies , including an internal revenue bureaucracy , were created to run the occupied states during the war , and all states after the war .
u201CHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power .u201D
This is exactly what Lincoln did by suspending the writ of habeas corpus and ordering the mass arrest of thousands of political dissenters in the North during the war .
u201CHe has kept among us , in times of peace , Standing Armies without the consent of our legislatures .
u201D
The legislatures of the Southern states did not invite a federal invasion , as required by the u201 Cinsurrection clauseu201D of the U.S. Constitution in cases of insurrections , which did not exist anyway in 1861 .
The Party of Lincoln kept standing armies in the South for a decade after the war while the states were ruled as military dictatorships under the direction of the Republican Party .
u201CHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution , and unacknowledged by our laws . . .u201D Lincoln ignored the Constitution completely .
Nowhere is a president given the constitutional authority to invade his own country , suspend habeas corpus , wage war without consent of Congress , deport congressmen , shut down hundreds of opposition newspapers , etc. , etc .
u201CFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world .
u201D Lincoln blockaded Southern ports during the war , and was a lifelong protectionist of the worst kind .
His party imposed average tariffs in the 50 percent range for almost half a century after the war .
u201CFor imposing taxes on us without consent .
u201D
The South did not consent to paying a doubled import tariff .
Lincoln kept the promise that he made in his first inaugural address and launched a military invasion of the entire South to force them to pay u201 Chisu201D duties and imposts .
u201CFor depriving us in many cases , of the right of Trial by jury .
u201D
How else could one describe Lincoln ’s suspension of habeas corpus ?
Slavery in New York Best Price : $ 34.82 Buy New $ 55.00 ( as of 03:10 EST - Details )
u201CHe has abdicated Government here , by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us .
He has plundered our seas , ravaged our coast , burnt our towns , and destroyed the lives of our people .
He is at this time transporting large Armies , of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death , desolation and tyranny .
u201D
Well , Southerners certainly were n’t u201 Cprotected u201D by Lincoln ’s invasion of their country ; Southern ports were blockaded and Southern ships were sunk ; entire Southern towns were burned to the ground by the Union Army under Sherman and others ; the lives of some 350,000 Southerners were snuffed out ; hundreds of thousands of European mercenaries were paid to wage war on American citizens by the Lincoln regime .
u201CDeath , desolation and tyrannyu201D is a perfect description of the Lincoln administration .
Glenn , I know that you have praised Lincoln for u201 Cperseveringu201D in his mass murder of fellow citizens from the Southern states until he finally u201 C prevailed .
u201D
This of course is an essential part of the neocon / Lincoln Cult party line .
It has been repeated endlessly on your own Fox News Channel by all those neocons who keep telling us that we should never , ever , withdraw our military from the Middle East until u201 Cthe job is finished u201D ( which would probably be long after we are both dead , if ever ) .
But did you know that all other countries of the world that ended slavery in the 19th century , the British , Dutch , Spaniards , French , Danes , Swedes — all did so peacefully without a war ?
And did you know that slavery was also ended peacefully in all of the Northern states , including New York where slavery still existed in the early 1850s ?
( See the book , Slavery in New York . )
I highly recommend that you read Jim Powell ’s excellent book , Greatest Emancipations :
How the West Ended Slavery , which describes in great detail how the rest of the world ended slavery peacefully instead of using slaves as political pawns in a war that was not about them but was a struggle for political power , as all wars are .
Greatest Emancipations ... Jim Powell Best Price : $ 3.00 Buy New $ 24.97 ( as of 10:15 EST - Details )
This calls into question the fairy tale about Lincoln and emancipation that all Lincoln Cultists repeat endlessly .
The war was all a part of some grand strategy to free the slaves , they tell us .
But what kind of u201Cstatesmanu201D would ignore all of world history including the history of his own country ( in the Northern states ) with regard to how slavery was ended and plunge his country into the bloodiest war in human history up to that point ?
Is this u201 Cgrand strategyu201D that caused the death of almost 700,000 Americans and maimed several times that number for life a praiseworthy one ?
Glenn , if you are upset about the Fed and its showering of corporate welfare on Wall Street banksters and myriad other fat - cat corporations , you should also know that Lincoln spent his entire adult life championing the u201CAmerican Systemu201D of Alexander Hamilton , which was the only policy plank of the Whig Party that Lincoln belonged to for more than twenty years before becoming a Republican .
The u201CAmerican System , u201D which was really the corrupt British mercantilist system designed for America , involved a central bank that would print money to finance corporate welfare for railroad corporations and others , along with high , protectionist tariffs which are also , of course , a form of corporate welfare .
It was Lincoln ’s National Currency Acts that resurrected central banking in America and led to the creation of the Fed .
No member of the old Whig Party was a more forceful proponent of central banking — a bank run by politicians out of the nation ’s capital — than Abraham Lincoln was .
What Lincoln ’s Whig Party ( which morphed into the Republican Party after the Whig Party imploded in the early 1850s ) stood for was perfectly described by the famous playwright and law partner of Clarence Darrow , Edgar Lee Masters of Illinois , in his book , Lincoln the Man .
It was a u201 Cpolitical system which doles favors to the strong in order to win and to keep their adherence to the government .
[ It ] offered shelter to devious schemes and corrupt enterprises . . . [ and ] a people taxed to make profits for enterprises that cannot stand alone . . . .
Its principles were plunder and nothing else .
u201D
In light of this , I think it would be an absurd farce to hold a rally protesting the Fed , corporate welfare , bailouts , Big Government , etc. at the Lincoln Memorial .
Thomas Jefferson opposed every one of these policies , as did his political heirs , the big majority of whom were Democrats and neither Whigs nor Republicans .
Hold the rally at the Jefferson Memorial .
Best of luck to you .
The Best of Thomas DiLorenzo
It does if you hold the organization to the same standard it uses to insist that health reform would result in publicly funded abortions .
A few weeks ago , I wrote about the fungibility argument that many pro-life groups and politicians have employed to oppose health reform .
The problem , they say , is that if any insurance plan that covers abortion is allowed to participate in a public exchange , then premiums paid to that plan in the form of taxpayer - funded subsidies help support that abortion coverage even if individual abortion procedures are paid for out of a separate pool of privately - paid premium dollars .
You can debate about whether it makes sense to use this strict standard , but that ’s the argument .
But are those pro-life organizations holding themselves to the same strict standard ?
As it happens , Focus on the Family provides its employees health insurance through Principal , an insurance company that covers “ abortion services . ”
A Focus spokeswoman confirmed the fact that the organization pays premiums to Principal , but declined to comment on whether that amounts to an indirect funding of abortion .
Even if the specific plan Focus uses for its employees does n’t include abortion coverage–and I ’m assuming it does n’t –the organization and its employees still pay premiums to a company that funds abortions .
If health reform proposals have a fungibility problem , then Focus does as well .
And if they do n’t think they do have a fungibility problem , then it would be interesting to hear why they think the set - up proposed in health reform legislation is so untenable .
( By the way , I ’m not trying to pick on Focus on the Family , which has opposed congressional health reform proposals but certainly has n’t been the only or leading organization involved .
I suspect many of the groups denouncing health reform as funding abortion have the same issue with their own insurance plans .
Focus was just the only group willing to call me back and confirm its insurance coverage . )
BOSTON , Massachusetts , USA -- Friday , September 11 , 2009 -- The Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) today announced updates related to its list of fully free GNU / Linux distributions , including the addition of one new distribution called Kongoni , and a milestone release of the Trisquel system .
Trisquel , which was added to the list last December , has issued its 3.0 release , codenamed " Dwyn . "
It is the first in a new series of short term support releases that will be updated every six months with new software to add features , improved performance , and hardware compatibility .
Kongoni , named after the Shona word for " gnu , " is based in Africa .
For optimal performance with minimal bandwidth requirements , it uses a packaging system called " ports " that downloads programs as source and builds them automatically .
Trisquel , Kongoni , and the other GNU / Linux system distributions on the FSF 's list only include and only propose free software .
They reject nonfree applications , nonfree programming platforms , nonfree drivers , nonfree firmware " blobs , " and any other nonfree software and documentation .
They uphold a commitment to remove any such components as they are discovered -- a commitment most well - known GNU / Linux distributions do not follow .
FSF operations manager John Sullivan said , " It 's very encouraging to see this list continuing to increase in both quality and quantity .
While others continue to propagate the outdated claim that it's too hard or not possible to make distributions without proprietary binary firmware and other nonfree programs , free software activists and developers working on projects like Kongoni and Trisquel continue to prove them wrong . "
Both Trisquel and Kongoni are calling for more contributors to help .
Trisquel is seeking mirrors , package maintainers , beta testers , translators , and documentation writers .
Kongoni is looking for people to help with publicity , and writing new package ports .
More information about using and contributing to Trisquel and Kongoni can be found at their respective Web sites , http://trisquel.info/ and http://kongoni.co.za/.
The FSF 's guidelines for free system distributions are online at http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html, and the distributions committed to those guidelines are listed at http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html.

About Free Software and Open Source
The free software movement 's goal is freedom for computer users .
Some , especially corporations , advocate a different viewpoint , known as " open source , " which cites only practical goals such as making software powerful and reliable , focuses on development models , and avoids discussion of ethics and freedom .
These two viewpoints are different at the deepest level .

About the GNU Operating System and Linux
Richard Stallman announced in September 1983 the plan to develop a free software Unix - like operating system called GNU .
GNU is the only operating system developed specifically for the sake of users ' freedom .
See http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html.
In 1992 , the essential components of GNU were complete , except for one , the kernel .
When in 1992 the kernel Linux was re-released under the GNU GPL , making it free software , the combination of GNU and Linux formed a complete free operating system , which made it possible for the first time to run a PC without nonfree software .
This combination is the GNU / Linux system .

No Apologies – Lambert
American Idol season 8 runner - up Adam Lambert is not offering any apologies for the racy performance he did at the closing of the 2009 American Music Awards .
ABC network received more than a thousand complains regarding some “ lewd ” acts he did while singing the lead single of his latest album .
This includes simulating oral sex with a male dancer , grabbed his crotch and kissed male keyboardist Tommy Ratliff who is straight .
Dick Clark Productions edited out the scenes for the west coast broadcast .
Each one of these acts was done at the spur of the moment .
Lambert believes that there was a double standard .
He compared it to exotic and provocative dances that female pop singers are already doing for years .
He said he would not be surprised if there would be some editing , but he thinks it should not be edited , as it was to promote freedom of expression and artistic freedom .
He stressed out that everybody should open up their minds and enjoy things as it was no big deal .
Many viewers and celebrities do n’t agree however .

T he release last week of the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission 's report on Internet traffic management – known as the net neutrality decision – attracted national attention .
Canadians , Internet providers and politicians debated whether the regulator had struck the right balance in addressing how ISPs manage Internet traffic .
While some headlines seemed to suggest that the CRTC has given Canada 's ISPs the green light to do as they please , the reality is that the decision establishes several notable requirements and restrictions .
First , the commission adopted a new test to determine reasonable traffic management practices .
Where a consumer complains , ISPs will be required to describe their practices , demonstrate their necessity and establish that they discriminate as little as possible .
The CRTC added that targeting specific applications or protocols may warrant investigation – and slowing down time - sensitive traffic likely violates current Canadian law .
Second , the commission rejected arguments that the market would ensure ISPs provide adequate disclosure on how they manage their networks .
Instead , it mandated full disclosure of traffic management practices , including information on when they occur , which applications are affected , and their impact on Internet speeds .
Third , the CRTC banned the use of personal information obtained through deep - packet inspection for anything other than traffic management purposes .
By also prohibiting the disclosure of such information , the commission ensured that inspecting user traffic cannot be parlayed into marketing opportunities .
These conditions ensure that traffic management is not a free - for - all .
The days of ISPs arguing they can do whatever they please on their networks – as some intimated during the summer hearing – are over .
With the CRTC framework in place , it now falls to Industry Minister Tony Clement to become more engaged on the issue .
Both the Liberals and NDP have expressed support for net neutrality and some groups have renewed their demands for new legislation .
Yet Clement can advance the issue in several meaningful ways without tabling a bill .
Critics of the CRTC approach rightly note that the onus falls to consumers to compile evidence of traffic management practices that run afoul of the commission 's test and file complaints .
When asked about the issue last week in the House of Commons , Clement stated that he is " watching those providers very closely and I do not want to see a situation where consumers are put at risk in terms of their access to the Internet . "
He can go several steps further by asking the CRTC to conduct regular compliance audits of ISP traffic management practices and by providing financial support to consumer groups who wish to conduct their own investigations .
The federal government also can play a significant role in establishing neutrality for wireless Internet access .
The CRTC acknowledged that many of the same issues arise in the wireless context and that it expects wireless carriers to follow the same guidelines .
Within the next two years , the federal government will conduct another spectrum auction as part of the digital television transition .
Clement could incorporate net neutrality requirements directly into the bidding process , effectively mandating neutrality into new wireless services .
Finally , Clement should acknowledge that net neutrality concerns are largely a function of an uncompetitive marketplace that allows ISPs to leverage their positions without fear of losing customers .
The best way to address net neutrality is therefore to give priority to increased competition in the Canadian Internet marketplace .

A flu pandemic in Ukraine that has triggered a nationwide panic is worsening this weekend with up to 400 deaths already reported .
The arrival of the virus , suspected by the World Health Organisation to be swine flu but possibly a combination of the H1N1 strain and a respiratory illness , has paralysed the country 's fragile health system and could even lead to the postponement of the general election which is scheduled for 17 January .
Seven people died and 35,000 new cases were reported on Friday , said the health minister , bringing the total number of people infected to 1.6 million out of a population of 46 million .
The onslaught of the virus has seen all the major political figures eagerly exploiting the outbreak .
Prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko announced the arrival of an epidemic on 30 October , when only one case had been reported , and has closed all schools and banned public gatherings – including campaigning political rallies – for the past three weeks .
Her standing in the polls has shot up after frequent TV appearances , urging people to take care and criticising her political foes for inaction .
Tymoshenko even went to the airport to greet a shipment of Tamiflu , prompting president Yushchenko to send one of his own representatives .
President Viktor Yushchenko , who is still the electoral front runner but facing an ever narrowing gap with Tymoshenko , has been trying to match her by pledging to spend his campaign funds on medical supplies and 20 million face masks .
" This is very dangerous , ' said Igor Shkrobanets , chief of the health ministry in the western district of Chernivtsi .
" One or another politician will gain from this situation , but the doctors and their patients certainly will not . "
He said the level of fear was such that people were calling out ambulances when they felt the first touch of a fever and hospitals were " overloaded " .
In such uneasy times , bloggers and conspiracy theorists have whipped up fears by suggesting that bubonic plague , or a new , more lethal strain of the flu , was sweeping Ukraine and that there was a massive cover - up of the numbers of deaths .
" We are seeing reports of bodies lying in the streets , " said one .
Others claim to have seen reports of doctors mystified by the state of a patient 's lungs after death .
But with no authoritative medical analysis of the cases available , such amateur diagnosis has run riot .
The isolation of many Ukrainian towns , especially as winter closes in , combined with the lack of public trust in the weak government and the inexperience of many of the new , 24 - hour media outlets , was fuelling the rumour - mongering and the scare stories , said one of the staff at the English - language Kyiv Post .
Semon Gluzman , a psychiatrist in the capital , Kiev , told the Washington Post : " What we 're seeing is a normal psychological reaction to the complete incompetence of the state authorities .
People are scared and they do n't know who to trust any more . "
The scare has also led to people hoarding surgical masks and flu remedies , which are now almost impossible to find .
Even lemons and garlic , homemade cures for flu , are in short supply .
On Thursday the country received humanitarian aid from 13 nations , the WHO and two Ukrainian charities , and is in talks with six more countries about help with the outbreak .
Swine flu pandemics are also being reported in Belarus , Moldova , Poland and Hungary .

Medical marijuana has gone mainstream .
It routinely receives above 70 % in public opinion polls , it has been legalized in 13 states , and this year 18 more states either tried or are still trying to pass medical marijuana laws .
It was also the subject of legislative activity in four states that already have medical marijuana laws .
march in Madison , Wisconsin last month by the group '' Is My Medicine Legal Yet ? ''
But just because it 's mainstream does n't mean it 's easy .
The legislative process is notoriously slow , arduous , and fickle .
At the beginning of the year , movement leaders thought we would see perhaps four or five states pass medical marijuana laws this year .
That has n't happened .
This year , no state that did n't have a medical marijuana law has managed to get one passed , and in a pair of medical marijuana states that did pass additional legislation , recalcitrant governors proved to be obstacles .
Nevertheless , progress has been made , with prospects for more , whether this year or later .
As 2009 enters its final weeks , here 's where we stand :
PASSED BUT VETOED :
Minnesota :
In May , the Minnesota legislature approved a restrictive medical marijuana bill , SF 97 .
The House version of the bill won on a 70 - 64 vote .
The Senate , which had approved its version of the bill a month earlier , accepted the House version , passing it on a 38 - 28 vote .
The vote was largely along party lines , with most Republicans opposing and most Democratic Farm Labor ( DFL ) members supporting the bill .
In neither chamber was the margin of victory large enough to overcome a veto .
Gov. Tim Pawlenty ( R ) quickly vetoed the bill .
Blocked by a recalcitrant governor , Minnesota medical marijuana proponents are considering an end run around him next year .
Under Minnesota law , the legislature can bypass the governor by voting for a constitutional amendment to allow medical marijuana use .
If such a measure passes the legislature , it would then go directly to a popular vote .
With support for medical marijuana at high levels in Minnesota , proponents believe the measure would pass .
New Hampshire :
The legislature passed HB 648 , which would have created three nonprofit medical marijuana dispensaries for patients , but Gov. John Lynch ( D ) vetoed it .
In October , the House voted to override the veto on a vote of 240 - 115 , but the Senate fell two votes short on a 14 - 10 vote .
DEAD OR DORMANT :
Alabama : The Alabama medical marijuana bill , HB 434 , sponsored by Rep. Patricia Todd ( D - Birmingham ) was referred to the House Judiciary Committee and died there without a vote when the session adjourned in May .
Connecticut :
Two medical marijuana bills were introduced this year , HB 6156 , introduced by Rep. Penny Bacchiochi ( R - Sommers ) , and HB 5175 , introduced by Rep. Mary Mushinsky ( D - Wallingford ) .
Neither bill received a public hearing .
No medical marijuana legislation is likely to move in Connecticut until Gov. Jodi Rell ( R ) is gone .
In 2007 , medical marijuana bills passed both the House and the Senate , only to be vetoed by Rell .
Iowa : Sen. Joe Bolkcom ( D - Iowa City ) introduced a medical marijuana bill , SF 293 , in March .
That same month it got a hearing before the Senate Human Resources Subcommittee , but has had no action since .
Maryland : Maryland enacted an affirmative defense law for medical marijuana patients in 2003 , but that does n't protect them from arrest .
HB 1339 , sponsored by Delegate Henry Heller ( D - Montgomery County ) , introduced this year , would have created a task force to make recommendations about changing the state 's medical marijuana law .
The bill received a hearing in the House Judiciary Committee , but died when committee Chairman Joseph Vallario ( D - Calvert County ) refused to schedule a vote on it .
Massachusetts : A medical marijuana bill , HB 2160 , was filed in January and referred to the Joint Committee on Public Health , which held a hearing in May .
Since then , no action .
Missouri :
For the third year in a row , a medical marijuana bill was filed , but went nowhere .
HB 277 , introduced by Rep. Kate Meiners , was stalled by the House leadership and assigned to the Health Care Policy Committee too late to be scheduled for a hearing this year .
North Carolina : The North Carolina medical marijuana bill , HB 1380 was introduced in April by Rep. Earl Jones ( D - Guilford ) .
It got a public hearing before the House Health Committee in June , but has not moved since .
South Dakota : A South Dakota medical marijuana bill , HB 1127 , sponsored by Rep. Gerald Lange ( D - Madison ) , managed to survive three restrictive amendments in the House Health and Human Services Committee before the committee voted to kill it on a 9 - 4 vote in February .
The legislature will have one more chance to pass a medical marijuana bill early next year .
If it does n't , medical marijuana backers will place an initiative on the November 2010 ballot .
HB 1128 , also sponsored by Lang , would have provided a medical necessity defense for medical marijuana patients .
In February , the House Judiciary Committee unanimously killed it by referring it " to the 41st day . "
The session only has 40 days .
Tennessee : The Tennessee Medical Marijuana
Act of 2009 , SB 209 , sponsored by Sen. Beverly Marrero ( D - Memphis ) , and its companion measure , HB 368 , sponsored by Rep. Jeanne Richardson ( D - Memphis ) were assigned to their respective Health and Human Services Committees , where they were ignored and died a quiet death .
Texas : A Texas medical marijuana bill , HB 164 , introduced by Rep. Elliot Naishtat ( D - Austin ) was introduced in November 2008 and referred to the House Public Health Committee in February .
No action has occurred since then .
STILL ALIVE :
Delaware : A medical marijuana bill , SB 94 , sponsored by Sen. Margaret Rose Henley ( D - Wilmington ) passed the Senate Health and Social Services on a 4 - 0 vote in June .
It awaits a Senate floor vote when the legislature reconvenes for the second year of its two - year session in January .
Illinois : The Compassionate Use of Cannabis Pilot Program Act , SB 1381 , passed the state Senate by a 30 - 28 vote in May .
It passed the House Human Services Committee on a 4 - 3 vote the next day , but has had no further action in the House .
The bill may move when the House returns for the second half of its session in January .
Gov. Pat Quinn ( D ) will give " serious consideration " to a medical marijuana bill that reaches his desk .
New Jersey : The New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act , which had already passed the Senate , was approved by the Assembly Health Committee on a 7 - 1 vote , but only after making it dramatically different from and more restrictive than the Senate version .
At the behest of committee chair Herb Conaway ( D - Burlington ) , who was responding to criticism that the bill 's distribution and oversight provisions were n't tight enough , the bill was amended so that only " alternative treatment centers " could grow , process , and distribute medical marijuana .
In the version passed by the Senate , patients could also grow their own or have caretakers grow it for them .
In this latest version , there is no role for caretakers , because it also provides that only patients may pick up medical marijuana at a dispensary , or have a courier deliver it to them .
The bill now heads for a floor vote in the Assembly .
It also must go back to the Senate , which must approve the amended version .
New York :
In New York , a medical marijuana bill , S4041 , passed the Senate Health Committee in May , marking the first time a medical marijuana had ever passed the previously GOP - controlled state Senate .
It must now pass the Senate Codes Committee before proceeding to a Senate floor vote .
The identical House version of the bill , A7542 , has been passed from the House Health Committee to the House Codes Committee .
The bills are sponsored by Assembly Health Committee Chair Richard Gottfried ( D - Manhattan ) and Senate Health Committee Chair Tom Duane ( D - Manhattan ) and would create state - registered dispensaries for patients .
Patients could not grow their own .
The legislature is expected to return for a special session later this year , and proponents are pushing for a vote .
Pennsylvania :
For the first time in memory , Pennsylvania legislators have a medical marijuana bill , HB 1393 before them .
Introduced in April by Rep. Mark Cohen ( D - Philadelphia ) , the bill has been in the Assembly Health and Human Services Committee ever since .
Just last week , however , the committee chair , Rep. Frank Oliver ( D - Philadelphia ) , scheduled a December 2 hearing on the bill .
Wisconsin : The Wisconsin medical marijuana bill , SB 368 was introduced late last month .
Gov. Jim Doyle supports it .
The bill is set for a December 15 hearing and could move quickly after that .
VOTES IN MEDICAL MARIJUANA STATES :
Hawaii : In July , the Hawaii legislature overrode Gov. Linda Lingle 's ( R ) veto of SB 1058 , which establishes a task force to examine problems and critical issues surrounding the state 's medical marijuana law .
The vote was 25 - 0 in the Senate and 38 - 9 in the House .
Gov. Lingle has since refused to fund the task force , forcing interested legislators to create the informal Medical Cannabis Working Group to hear testimony .
Maine :
In April , when faced with a citizen petition to amend the state 's medical marijuana law , the Maine legislature punted , taking no action and leaving it to the voters in this month 's election .
The voters approved the measure allowing for the creation of dispensaries .
Montana : Montana already has a medical marijuana law , but several bills seeking to change it -- for better or worse -- saw action this year .
SB 326 , sponsored by Sen. Ron Erickson would have increased allowable amounts , added several illnesses to the list of qualifying conditions , and added child custody protections for patients .
It passed the Senate 28 - 22 , but failed on a tie vote to get out of the House Human Services Committee .
Sponsors then tried a House floor vote to get the bill out of committee , but they needed 60 votes and only got 47 .
Similarly , HB 73 , which would have allowed nurse practitioners and physician assistants to recommend marijuana to patients , died in the House Human Services Committee on a tie vote .
Two bad bills also died .
HB 473 , sponsored by Rep. Tom Berry ( R - Roundup ) would have barred anyone with a drug felony from ever becoming a registered patient .
It died on a tie vote in the House Judiciary Committee .
And SB 212 , introduced by Sen. Verdell Jackson ( R - Kalispell ) , attempted to force patients with more than a specific amount of THC in their system to prove their innocence if accused of driving under the influence .
It was killed by a unanimous vote of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Rhode Island :
In the only medical marijuana victory at the statehouse so far this year , the Rhode Island legislature in June overrode Gov. Donald Carcieri 's veto of a bill to create a system of state - licensed medical marijuana dispensaries .
The override vote was a unanimous 68 - 0 in the House and a punishing 35 - 3 in the Senate .
Rhode Island thus became the first state to expand an existing medical marijuana program to allow for state - licensed dispensaries .
Statehouse legislation is only one measure of progress in the drive to fully legalize medical marijuana use .
Initiative victories , such as Maine 's mentioned above , is another , as is the expansion of the dispensary supply infrastructure to states like Colorado or Montana is another .
Increased mainstream support , such as last week 's bombshell from the American Medical Association certainly bodes well for the future , as does the Obama administration 's formalized policy of not targeting medical marijuana providers that are obeying their states ' laws .
But statehouses make state law -- for better or for worse -- and they are a place where reforms need to be taken , as well as an opportunity for them .
By that measure 2009 has been a slower year than hoped -- but not a bad one .

Skynet , Cornell 's entry in the DARPA Urban Challenge , drove itself through 55 miles of simulated city driving .
Could it manage Collegetown ?
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Although Cornell 's self - driving car did n't win the DARPA Urban Challenge in 2007 , it is alive and well and soon to become safer and more talented -- it will soon be a test bed for new research in robotics and artificial intelligence ( AI ) .
" We 'll be looking at the next level of intelligence in the vehicle , " said Mark Campbell , associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and the lead researcher for a new $ 1,473,121 , three - year grant from the National Science Foundation under NSF 's Cyber - Physical Systems program using federal stimulus funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( ARRA ) .
As of Oct. 1 Cornell has received 109 ARRA grants totaling more than $ 93 million .
" In the near term there will be elements of the research that can be integrated into safety systems in human - operated vehicles , " Campbell added , noting that while robots are not as intelligent as humans , they can react far more swiftly .
Such systems could warn of collisions or take evasive action , recognize if a driver is impaired or asleep , and assist handicapped drivers .
The researchers also will work with self - driving Segway transporters , which will be programmed to work together as teams for mapping and search - and - rescue - applications .
Video and LIDAR sensors and a computer brain replace the standing human driver on this modified Segway transporter .
Cornell robotics researchers are experimenting with teams of self - driving Segways for mapping and disaster relief applications .
Hadas Kress - Gazit , assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering , and Daniel Huttenlocher , the John P. and Rilla Neafsey Professor of Computing , Information Science and Business and dean of computing and information science , are co-principal investigators for the project .
Campbell and Huttenlocher were advisers to the team of Cornell students who built Skynet , Cornell 's entry in the DARPA ( Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ) Urban Challenge .
The car , a converted Chevy Tahoe named for the AI in the Terminator movies , was one of six of 11 finalists ( and 35 semifinalists ) to successfully complete the DARPA race by driving autonomously over about 55 miles of city streets , obeying traffic laws and merging with and passing other robotic cars as well as cars driven by humans .
DARPA hopes to develop self - driving vehicles to replace human drivers in hazardous environments such as war zones .
Civilian applications are in mining , farming , disaster response and remote exploration .
But autonomous vehicles still are n't smart enough , Campbell said .
The DARPA challenge was run on a closed , controlled course .
" They did n't have pedestrians or people on bicycles , " Campbell pointed out .
" Our car could not drive autonomously through Collegetown right now . "
The present car uses sensor data from radar , lidar and video cameras to build a " model " of its environment -- something human drivers also do , Campbell pointed out -- but the model is still quite simple .
It 's designed to avoid collisions , but it still can make mistakes , such as failing to distinguish between another car and a cement barrier -- a mistake Skynet made in the DARPA challenge .
To intelligently drive through a place like Collegetown , the environmental model must be created in real time , Campbell said , and distinguish between small cars and big trucks , not to mention pedestrians and even pedestrians towing rolling suitcases .
Then the car must anticipate changes and plan accordingly -- in other words , it has to practice defensive driving .
This raises issues of trust , Campbell said .
" A human driver trusts that the oncoming car will stay in its lane , that others are going to stop at an intersection -- but if the other car swerves or does n't stop , a human driver can and usually does adapt , " he explained .
The level of trust you assign to others can never be 100 percent ; the car must make driving decisions based on this " probabilistic " information .
" If you try to anticipate all the possibilities before you decide on an action , you 'll never move , " Campbell said .
Ultimately , he said , the car must drive safely and intelligently even in the presence of uncertainty .

A provision in a Senate bill quietly adopted in 2008 yet to reach a vote would allow veterans in the FBI ’s criminal background system listed as “ mentally incapacitated ” to purchase firearms .
The provision is coming under fire in the wake of a mass shooting at Ft. Hood Army base earlier this month which killed 13 .
The new law would allow vets on the FBI list to buy weapons if they have n’t been ruled ineligible by a judicial body .
ADVERTISEMENT
A press release issued by Republican North Carolina Sen .
Richard Burr explained his reasoning for the measure in 2008 after it was adopted by the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee .
The measure is also supported by a key Democratic senator — Jim Webb of Virginia .
“ Currently , when the Department of Veterans ’ Affairs ( VA ) appoints a fiduciary to assist a veteran with managing their financial affairs , VA also deems the veteran mentally incompetent and reports him or her to the FBI ’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) , ” Burr ’s release wrote .
“ The Veterans Second Amendment Protection
Act would require a judicial body to deem a veteran , surviving spouse , or child as a danger to himself or others before being listed in NICS , which would prohibit the veteran from being able to purchase certain firearms .
The legislation is supported by the American Legion , Veterans of Foreign Wars , AMVETS , and the Military Order of the Purple Heart .
“ I am very pleased the committee endorsed this legislation protecting our veterans ’ second amendment rights , ” Burr said in the statement .
“ My bill would ensure America ’s brave men and women enjoy the rights they fought so hard to protect .
This legislation was included in a larger piece of legislation that will improve the care provided to our veterans .
I hope the Senate can quickly consider this bill and I urge my colleagues to support it . ”
Mother Jones noted opposition to the provision in a story Monday .
The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence , they noted , believes the proposal is “ dangerous ” and asserts that it could enable “ over 100,000 mentally incapacitated or incompetent persons ” to buy firearms who are currently prevented from doing so by the US Veterans ’ Administration .

Despite the Ft. Hood shootings — attributed to Army psychiatrist Maj. Nadal Hasan —
Burr defends his proposal .
In a recent interview with Fox News , the conservative Carolina senator said the Brady Campaign was using the incident to “ exploit the senseless murder of American soldiers in the quest to secure personal triumph . ”
“ Responding to Burr Thursday in an open letter , Helmke wrote , ‘ it is hardly ‘ exploitative ’ to have an honest debate ’ about the proposal , which would cancel out key provisions of the Gun Control Act of 1968 and override standards used by the VA for nearly four decades , ” Mother Jones ’ Corbin Hiar notes .
“ Contrary to your reported assertion that our opposition to your bill is a matter of my ‘ personal agenda , ’ or to secure some ‘ personal triumph , ’ the issue is the safety of our veterans , their families , and the nation they have so valiantly served , ” Paul Helmke added in the letter to Burr .
“ In the wake of a mass shooting committed by a serviceman on a heavily - fortified Army base , it is hardly ‘ exploitive ’ to have an honest debate about your proposal to allow guns in the hands of thousands of individuals already determined to present sufficient risk that they should be denied firearms . ”

“ Your bill , ” he continued , “ would allow veterans determined to be ‘ mentally incapacitated , deemed mentally incompetent , or experiencing an extended loss of consciousness ’ to possess firearms by removing their names from the Brady Law ’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) . ”
Financial Crash Risk Increasing Exponentially as Derivatives Monster Continues to Grow
Martin here with an urgent reminder that , despite what you may be hearing from Washington , risk is still a four - letter word .
And despite solemn vows to the contrary , the U.S. government is promoting risk with new - found enthusiasm and gall .
Again !
Yes , Fed Chairman Bernanke says he wants to avoid the possible risk of a future speculative bubble .
And yes , Treasury Secretary Geithner says he wants to reform financial regulation to avoid a future debt disaster .
But even while they give lip service to protecting you , they stand by passively as derivatives grow explosively .
Derivatives are debts and bets of all shapes and sizes , especially on interest rates , bonds , mortgage - backed securities , and other fixed instruments .
They were at the epicenter of the financial earthquake that shook the world last year .
They triggered the demise of Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers , AIG , and many others .
And they ’re still causing a series of aftershocks around the world , as in Dubai late last week .
So you ’d think the authorities would have taken steps to reduce their threat to the U.S. banking system .
Not quite !
Despite a brief reduction in derivatives outstanding in last year ’s third quarter , U.S. commercial banks now hold a grand total of $ 203.5 trillion in derivatives , a new all - time high .
What ’s worse , there has been no change whatsoever in the stranger - than - fiction facts behind that number — namely that …
A whopping 97 percent of all U.S. bank - held derivatives are concentrated in the hands of just FIVE institutions — JPMorgan Chase , Goldman Sachs , Bank of America , Citibank and Wells Fargo .
JPMorgan alone holds $ 79.9 trillion in derivatives — more than the grand total held by Bank of America and Citibank combined .
( For the evidence , click here . )
Over 96 percent of all U.S. bank - held derivatives are traded over the counter , outside of any regulated exchange — a wild zone where neither central authority nor national responsibility play a significant role .
Although some banks have made some progress in reducing their credit exposure , Citibank is still risking over double its capital … JPMorgan is still risking nearly three times its capital … and Goldman Sachs is still risking over NINE times its capital — all on the bet that their counterparties will not default .
The derivatives held by insurance companies like AIG are n’t even included in this tally .
Yet , in a confidential memorandum leaked to the press earlier this year , AIG executives confessed that
“ Systemic risk [ triggered largely by derivatives ] afflict all life insurance and investment firms around the world …
If AIG were to fail , it is likely to have a cascading impact on a number of U.S. life insurers already weakened by credit losses .
State insurance guarantee funds would be quickly dissipated , leading to even greater runs on the insurance industry . ”
( For your reference , AIG ’s memo is up on our website with key sections highlighted .
Click here to view . )
Globally , the monster is three times larger than the $ 203.5 trillion in derivatives held by U.S. banks : According to the Bank of International Settlements ( BIS ) , the worldwide total of just the unregulated , over - the - counter derivatives alone was $ 604.6 trillion at mid-year 2009 .
Although down from 2008 peak levels , it was up sharply from year - end 2008 .
( The evidence . )
Global authorities claim they want to tame this monster .
In practice , however , they ’re doing everything they can to feed it and keep it growing .
It ’s the same derivatives monster that former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan & company fought to protect back in the 1990s .
And it ’s the same derivatives monster that Bernanke and Geithner are struggling so strenuously to protect today .
How ?
We ’ve detailed and quantified the weapons of mass expansion they ’ve been deploying in recent months :
But there ’s more …
Extend and Pretend
New tax rules issued by Mr. Geithner ’s Treasury Department three months ago are now prompting banks around the country to sweep bad maturing loans under the rug simply by extending their terms — despite deteriorating collateral values and even despite questionable payment history .
These tactics — widely known in the industry as “ extend and pretend ” or “ delay and pray ” — are very similar to those used by savings and loans in the 1970s and early 1980s , also with the tacit encouragement of the regulators .
The big difference : Today , a far larger percentage of those bad debts are leveraged up with derivatives , another form of fuel for the growing monster .
Right now , the banks ’ extend - and - pretend tactics are especially popular in the one loan sector that has the biggest troubles : commercial real estate .
No one knows which banks are the biggest offenders .
But we do know which ones are the most exposed :
As a rule , a bank ’s nonperforming commercial real estate loans should be no more than a fraction of a percent of total assets .
In contrast …
Tamalpais Bank of San Rafael , California has 4.16 percent of its assets tied up in nonperforming commercial real estate loans
Builders Bank of Chicago — 4.27 percent
Mellon United National in Miami — 4.46 percent
Michigan Commerce Bank in Ann Arbor — 4.55 percent
Saehan Bank in Los Angeles — 4.57 percent
Bank of Florida Southwest in Naples — 4.7 percent
Bank of Miami in Coral Gables — 5 percent
Sun American Bank in Boca Raton , FL — 5.37 percent
Savings Bank of Maine in Gardiner — 5.39 percent
Westernbank Puerto Rico in Mayaguez , PR — 5.84 percent , and
United Central Bank in Garland , TX — a whopping 9.95 percent .
None of these are pipsqueak institutions — all have total assets of at least half a billion .
Plus , there are another 42 smaller U.S. banks with similar — or greater — exposure to bad commercial real estate loans .
( For the complete list , click here . )
If the authorities had any semblance of respect for their own pronouncements , they ’d crack down .
Instead , they ’re doing precisely the opposite — aiding and abetting a bad - loan cover - up with new accounting rules that make most of the cheating perfectly legal .
Looming FHA Fiasco
The U.S. Congress and the public are now painfully privy to the massive role that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac played in enabling American homeowners to overborrow … enabling Wall Street to overleverage and fomenting the conditions that led to the housing bust and derivatives disaster of recent years .
So … is that why , in our infinite wisdom , we have encouraged the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) to do precisely the same thing , effectively picking up from where Fannie and Freddie left off ?
When will we ever learn ?
Unfortunately , that may not happen until AFTER the FHA goes bankrupt .
According to the FHA ’s own annual report , its Mutual Mortgage Insurance ( MMI ) capital ratio — its single most important measure of solvency — has plunged from 6.82 percent in 2006 to a meager 0.53 percent in 2009 .
According to the National Housing Act , the FHA is required to keep this ratio at 2 percent or higher .
So already , it is in violation of the Act .
( For the evidence , click here . )
And despite promises to remedy the problem , the stated goals of the FHA — to replace much of the housing market lending support that was wiped away in the debt crisis — is merely dragging it deeper into the hole .
Bottom Line
In its encore performance to create a new speculative bubble , Washington has done virtually nothing to alter its old script .
All it has done is replace some actors and change some names .
For you , that means two things :
First , it means that bull markets — especially in sectors and countries that help investors escape this madness — have obviously returned .
And no matter how much we may question their underpinnings , pragmatic investors must take advantage of the short - and medium - term opportunities as they come .
More importantly , it means that risk is back … and with that risk comes the continuing danger of unexpected busts .
Bottom line : Continue to approach the financial markets with great caution , investing moderately , taking profits out along the way , and retaining a big stash of cash .
Good luck and God bless !

Last night I went and watched the upcoming Tucker Max movie , in full .
Here is what I saw , before I erase it from my mind entirely .
It was bad .
It was really bad .
It was not bad in the good way .
It was not bad ironically .
It was not bad in the " Let 's go see it because we like to watch bad movies like Knowing , and laugh at them " way .
I do not want to say the wrong thing here , that might convince anyone that this movie is worth paying to see , even for train wreck purposes .
This is the movie that happens when a narcissist — not an interesting one , though — writes an entire movie about how cool he is , and is given full creative control over that movie .
Imagine someone you know who is an asshole .
Now imagine that person being able to write and produce a movie about themselves , and how awesome they are .
There you have it .
The plot of this film : Tucker Max and two of his bros go to a bachelor party , meeting various cum sluts along the way .
Whore bitches can't get enough of Tucker Max 's bad boy personality , which is probably why so many of these twats want him inside of their vaginas .
Tucker fucks a midget stripper and the world loves him for it , the end .
Other highlights :
Close - ups of poop , coming out of someone 's butt , a lot .
There 's a wedding scene in the end where the guests are all white and the servers are all black .
There 's not a joke to go with that .
The best character in the film is Tucker 's friend Drew , because he looks like he was just dropped in from another movie , and can't wait to get back .
Drew is a misanthropic video game nerd who goes to strip club and meets a hot stripper who is also a video game nerd and falls for him and they rush home and sleep together and Drew instantly bonds with her son and they become a couple immediately .
This is as close to a plausible male - female interaction sequence as this movie gets .
If you 're still curious about Making a Mess In a Cum Slut 's Mouth Because She Wo n't Let Me Not Do That , just watch our preview clips or read the script we published a year ago , which did indeed turn out to be pretty close to the final version .
This movie is not , in fact , hilarious .

Publisher of Donaghy tell - all pulls book from shelves because the NBA threatened to sue …
… at least according to Donaghy ’s liason to the book publisher .
( ESPN )
Pat Berdan , a senior consultant at Executive Prison Consultants and Donaghy ’s liaison to the book publisher , told ESPN.com on Wednesday night that the NBA “ threatened that they would sue ” if the book was published .
An NBA spokesman denied the claim , saying the league was aware of the book but had not received or reviewed a copy .
What is the NBA afraid of ?
Well , you can read excerpts for yourself over at Deadspin .
Here ’s a taste :
The 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Sacramento Kings presents a stunning example of game and series manipulation at its ugliest .
As the teams prepared for Game 6 at the Staples Center , Sacramento had a 3 – 2 lead in the series .
The referees assigned to work Game 6 were Dick Bavetta , Bob Delaney , and Ted Bernhardt .
As soon as the referees for the game were chosen , the rest of us knew immediately that there would be a Game 7 .
A prolonged series was good for the league , good for the networks , and good for the game .
Oh , and one more thing : it was great for the big- market , star - studded Los Angeles Lakers .
In the pregame meeting prior to Game 6 , the league office sent down word that certain calls — calls that would have benefitted the Lakers — were being missed by the referees .
This was the type of not - so - subtle information that I and other referees were left to interpret .
After receiving the dispatch , Bavetta openly talked about the fact that the league wanted a Game 7 .
“ If we give the benefit of the calls to the team that ’s down in the series , nobody ’s going to complain .
The series will be even at three apiece , and then the better team can win Game 7 , ” Bavetta stated .
As history shows , Sacramento lost Game 6 in a wild come - from - behind thriller that saw the Lakers repeatedly sent to the foul line by the referees .
For other NBA referees watching the game on television , it was a shameful performance by Bavetta ’s crew , one of the most poorly officiated games of all time .
This is certainly sobering , if true .
But Donaghy has every reason to lie .
It helps his reputation somewhat if he can sully the reputation of his peers ( i.e. he was n’t just a “ bad apple ” ) and he can make a buck by telling outlandish stories about rampant corruption in the NBA .
I remember watching Game 6 of that Lakers / Kings series in ’ 02 , and it was poorly officiated , but I chalked it up to my own distaste for the Lakers .
Donaghy also mentions that Bavetta worked Game 7 of the ’00 Lakers / Blazers series , when Portland was somehow outscored 31 - 13 in the fourth quarter to blow the series .
The Lakers shot 37 free throws in that game compared to the Blazers ’ 16 .
Like I said , this is sobering , if true .

Extremely useful .
It helped me to understand what options I had and what I really need to do .
It helped me filter all my options and opt for the best one .
Amazing experience in all .
Lauren Cochrane has a great post today with ideas for lists organizations could create with Twitter ’s new List function .
If you have n’t heard about Lists yet , you ’re not behind !
They have only been rolled out to around half of the users so far .
You can read more about Lists on the Twitter Blog here .
Lauren outlines 7
Lists that organizations may find useful , including :
Your organisation ’s chapters and campaigns .
Related international organisations and campaigns .
Organisations that are somewhat related to your organisation .
Celebrities , politicians and others with a high profile .
Media .
Volunteers .
Retweeters and people who have contacted you .
As I added to Lauren ’s post in the comments , I think there ’s a lot of opportunity for organizations to leverage the List functionality for boosting visibility of their work and finding new supporters .
Think about the way Facebook Fan pages work , the way we see when others add a Fan page and we may join as well , and so on .
This kind of visibility work taps people ’s desire to be cause - related in self identity .
Here ’s my idea for an organizational visibility campaign using Lists :
Create a list for Supporters .
( Make sure it ’s a public list , and link to it from your website and elsewhere . )
Encourage people who want to be included on that list to publicly @reply to you and say why they support you .
Then , add them to the list .
So , they ’ve already publicly promoted you to their whole followers list and as a member of the list can feel a bit more connected with the organization ( to retweet messages in the future , help promote campaigns or other projects , etc. ) .
What do you think ?
Would love to hear if you have other ideas about using Lists for organizations .
Do you already have the Lists function enabled on your account – have you used it yet ?
Residents of Gaza got a special treat Saturday when 20 bodybuilders contended for the title of " Mr. Gaza . "
Around 500 residents of the Strip attended the competition , where men took the stage wearing nothing but briefs and flexed their well - oiled muscles .

It was not the first time such an event had been held in Gaza , but it has certainly become a rare sight since Hamas ' takeover of the Strip .

The BBC has unveiled the new Doctor Who logo - due to grace the nation 's small screens when Matt Smith takes over as the latest incarnation of the Time Lord in 2010 .
The Beeb explains that the revamped logo is the 11th to front the sci-fi series and the first overhaul since 2006 .
Before Smith gets the keys to the Tardis as its 11th occupant , alongside new companion Amy Pond – played by Karen Gillan - David Tennant bows out with three specials later this year .
The first , The Waters of Mars , also features Lindsay Duncan , and promises " thrills as well as chills * when the Tardis touches down on the Red Planet " .
The BBC earlier this year announced that Tennant 's final exit will feature the return of John Simm as the Master and former 007 Timothy Dalton - a fact confirmed when a still of the three leaked onto the interwebs . ®

But the Growing Pains star says he'd be okay if his kids believed in evolution
He ’s used to getting love letters and high - fives as a former teen heartthrob , but onetime Growing Pains actor Kirk Cameron is n’t letting the mockery and criticism dissuade him from promoting his controversial project to dispute evolutionary theory .
“ Atheism has been on the rise for years now , and the Bible of the atheists is The Origin of Species , ” Cameron tells PEOPLE .
“ We have a situation in our country where young people are entering college with a belief in God and exiting with that faith being stripped and shredded .
What we want to do is have student make an informed , educated decision before they chuck their faith . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
FLASHBACK : Kirk Talks Being Religious in Hollywood
So what is the plan that Cameron , 38 , has hatched to supposedly save the souls of freshmen around the country ?
He and other creationists have created thousands of editions of Charles Darwin ’s landmark work explaining evolutionary theory , with a 50 - page introduction that picks apart aspects of Darwin ’s work and try to link it to everything from Nazi eugenics to the scientist ’s alleged “ disdain for women . ”
Distributing Books
On Nov. 19 , three days before the 150th anniversary of the original publication of Origin of Species , Cameron and other religious activists will distribute their books at “ the top 50 ” universities around the country .
An online video of Cameron describing his theory – and his controversial beliefs – has been circulated wildly across the Internet , where it has also inspired many many counterarguments and spoof videos .
But then , speaking out about his faith is nothing new for Cameron , who has been doing it since finding God 20 years ago during the height of his fame as wise - cracking Mike Seaver on the long - running ABC sitcom Growing Pains .
Cameron has made a cottage industry out of starring in films that cater to evangelicals , such as the Left Behind series and Fireproof .
Fiery Reactions
But never has he ruffled so many feathers , especially among academics , as he has this week , slamming evolutionary theory as untrue , inherently un-Christian and the driving force behind some of the most horrendous catastrophes of the 20th century , including Adolf Hitler ’s plan to destroy “ inferior races . ”
“ You can see where [ Hitler ] clearly takes Darwin ’s ideas to some of their logical conclusions and compares certain races of people to lower evolutionary life forms , ” Cameron says .
“ If you take Darwin ’s theory and extend it to its logical end , it can be used to justify all number of very horrendous things . ”
But academics dismiss such arguments as ludicrous .
“ This has been refuted many , many times .
The anti-evolutionist fearmongers have to link Darwin to every perceived evil from mankind , ” says Kevin Padian , professor of paleontology and evolutionary biology at the University of California , Berkeley .
“ The two kinds people who believe that religion and evolution can not coexist are extreme atheists and extreme religious fundamentalists .
Everyone else does n’t really have a problem .
[ A majority ] of Americans believe that a belief in god is compatible with evolution . ”
Willing Target
Cameron , who lives outside of Los Angeles with his wife of 20 years , Chelsea Noble , and their six children , realizes that he is making himself a target by being so outspoken , but is willing to do so for a cause that he believes so strongly in .
“ I am proud to bring this to people ’s attention , ” he says .
“ You see things in the world that are truly distressing and you think , ‘ What can I do ? ’
Well this is something I can do . ”
It looks like Engadget editors are n't the only folk who prefer technology that 's slimmer , cheaper , and better .
According to an article at GamesIndustry.biz , a group that charts retail sales in the UK is saying that sales of the PS3 increased over 999 percent in the week since its British debut of the newer , slimmer form factor .
And if that was n't good news enough for Sony , the console has also outsold the DS , Wii and Xbox 360 by approximately 3:1 .
Although the last time it was the lead hardware format in the UK was the first week of 2008 , the PS3 has never lagged as far behind the others as it has Stateside .
But still -- a near 1000 percent increase ?
If true , that makes the States ' 104 percent increase seem lackluster in comparison .
Then again , maybe the Brits never realized that Disney Sing It !
High School Musical 3 is available on platforms other than the PlayStation .
That could explain a lot of things , actually ...
I ’ve said this before and I ’ll say it again , software development is about more than just processes and technology , there are always people involved .
And whenever there are people involved , it makes everything a whole lot more complicated .
No matter what position you ’re in , manager , team lead , just a regular developer you will at one point need to negotiate , compromise , convince someone that you ’re right , convince someone that they are wrong , convince someone that someone else is wrong , the possibilities are endless when you ’re dealing with people .
And I do n’t just mean outsiders , the business , the stakeholders etc. , you can often find more than enough of these kinds of situations within your very own team .
So how do you make sure that your voice is heard , that your words are given the weight that they surely deserve ( they do deserve it right ? ) , how do you get your teammates , managers , customers to listen to you and give your opinions due consideration ?
There is no one sure - fire way , but it all hinges around two very important attributes :
authority
trust
Trust is when people listen to you and give weight to your opinion because they have a personal relationship with you .
This relationship could be friendship , love or simply knowing that you wo n’t steer them wrong based on empirical evidence ( i.e. you ’ve come through for them in the past ) .
Authority is when people perceive you to have some expertise , knowledge or power that they do n’t have .
You may be celebrated for your knowledge , or have the weight of experience on your side or simply have been placed in charge , regardless people will tend to defer to authority sometimes without even realizing they are doing so .
So , in order to make sure you ’re heard and listened to you need to get yourself either some authority , some trust or preferably some of both and there are three ways of doing this .
Have It
Authority and trust are funny in that they feed off each other .
If people consider you authoritative then they will automatically tend to trust you more , it also works the other way , the more people trust you the more weight they will give to your opinion ( i.e. you ’ll be more of an authority in their eyes ) .
So , the best and most foolproof way of getting authority and trust is to already be an authority .
That may seem obvious , but do n’t dismiss it , experts have it easy , so it may be in your best interest to try and get to that point .
Getting to the point where you ’re considered an expert is hard work .
You need to put yourself out there , be involved in the community , share your opinions , write , talk and get your face known by others .
But once you do get there , no matter what situation you find yourself in , whatever you say will carry significant weight .
You might be the newest person on a team with no domain or system knowledge , but people will still tend to give your views a lot of consideration .
Picture this , you ’re discussing some code design and Uncle Bob ( Robert C. Martin ) comes in and decides to weigh in with a few gems of his own , or perhaps you might be chatting about refactoring and Martin Fowler walks by and shares his thoughts , you will probably treat their views with a lot more consideration than you would if Joe Schmoe , developer from down - the - hall , said the same thing .
The best way to make sure you ’re a heavy - weight in any discussion / negotiation is to actually be widely considered to be an authority on the subject .
It does n’t even have to be your main area of expertise a related field will do , true authority casts a long shadow .
Fake It
But what if you ’re not yet considered an expert ( you may be working your way up there but you ’re not there yet ) ?
You ’ll still sometimes be the new guy on a team or find yourself negotiating scope ( or whatever ) with your customers .
In this situation your best bet would be to rely on trust , as I said above , if people trust you they will automatically consider you more of an authority .
However gaining trust is tough because it is a very time - consuming process .
Building a relationship that results in genuine trust does not happen overnight , you need to work on it and give it time to mature .
Once you do have it though you ’re almost in as a good a position as if you were a genuine authority , people will listen to you because of the relationship you have built up with them .
But , this does not help you if you ’re the new guy or simply have not yet had time to build the necessary level of trust .
In this case you can try to fake some authority .
I do n’t mean you should lie and try to pass yourself off as an expert in an area you know nothing about , but the old adage does apply – fake it till you make it .
If you ’re already working on becoming an authority in an area you will have a level of expertise , you may not have universal recognition as yet , but it is possible to make people believe that you ’re more of an authority than you actually are .
You can point out some previous work you have done in the field , or highlight the recognition you have received before , the idea here is to simply make people aware of the fact that you know what you ’re on about and that some other people know it too .
Until your fame runs before you :) , you will actually need to let people know that you have some knowledge in the area under discussion .
If you do this right , people will give your words more weight , however if you do this wrong , people will tend to dismiss you as boastful and self - promoting .
You therefore need to be very confident in your interpersonal skills before you go down the route of trying to artificially inflate your authority .
So , if you ’re not comfortable with it , do n’t do it , there is another way .
Borrow It
Have you ever been to a conference or a talk where the material was to be presented by two people , one famous ( i.e. someone you ’ve heard of ) and one not so much .
You were probably attracted to the talk by the name of the more famous person , in your eyes they had authority so you wanted to hear what they had to say .
But , when you actually went to the presentation , the material was almost fully presented by the less famous of the two people with the more famous taking a background role .
Chances are you still enjoyed the presentation ( people who have built up authority do n’t tend to put their name on inferior material ) , but you might have been somewhat puzzled by why the famous person ’s name was even on the material at all .
You may have shrugged it off or had a chuckle about how the ‘ celebrity ’ was riding their fame and reputation ( without doing much work ) .
But , that was not at all the case .
In reality the less famous of the two presenters was borrowing some authority from the more famous .
Chances are the two people presenting were probably friends or colleagues .
The less famous of the two had something interesting to share , but knew that he was unlikely to attract many people ( perhaps the material did n’t seem interesting until you dig into it ) , so he asked his more famous friend to share some of his authority to help attract more of an audience .
In effect people came to see the celebrity but stayed due to the quality of the material .
You can do the same thing in your day - to - day work and you do n’t even have to be friends with any famous people .
There are probably people you work with who have built up a lot of trust with others ( e.g. they may have been working there a while and have a lot of great relationships ) .
If you also have a good relationship with that person and need to convince some other people of something , it may be a good idea to borrow some authority / trust from your friend to help you .
Perhaps you can ask them to be involved on your side or simply get them to introduce you , to get your presentation started on the right note .
If you ’re new to a workplace , but were referred by a friend , it is a good idea to get your friend to introduce you around .
That one gesture will help other people associate you with someone they already trust / like , some of this will be transferred to you which means you will start to form great relationships with your teammates much faster ( think of it as a kind of shortcut ) and start building some trust of your own .
The lessons here are as follows .
If you want your opinions to always have genuine weight in any discussion related to your field , then you need to work on building your authority in that field .
Until others begin to recognize that you really know what you ’re talking about you will need to make sure they are aware of the fact that you ’re working on being an authority and then you need to talk real sense to back up your claim .
But , if you ca n’t convince others by yourself then try and borrow some authority from an influencer or someone who has built up a lot of trust .
If you ca n’t do any of those it does not mean your voice will not be heard , but it does mean yours will be just one of many .
Throughout all this make sure that you always try to build genuine relationships with the people you work with , your teammates , your managers , your customers and users .
The trust you gain will help you be perceived as more of an authority which in turn will mean your opinions will be solicited and given extra weight every time .

Strict new road rules relating to the use of mobile phones by drivers are threatening to kill the burgeoning market in apps and services that enable smartphones to be used as satellite navigation systems .
The legal changes will affect iPhones that use apps made by TomTom , Navigon and Sygic ; Nokia phones using its Ovi Maps ; Telstra phones using its Whereis Navigator GPS service and any other service or software that enables a mobile phone to be used as an in - car navigation device .
TomTom 's new iPhone app in use with the yet - to - be released car - kit .
Victoria will roll out the new rules , which will limit drivers ' use of mobile phones and satellite navigation devices , on November 9 .
A spokesperson for VicRoads , the Victorian Government 's roads and traffic authority , said that under the laws - as applied in Victoria - it would be illegal for drivers to navigate using a mobile that doubles as a satellite navigation device .
Aaaaand , here it is .
Pretty much the most air - gasping , lunch - choking , eyeball - gouging page in the entire book .
It 's ...
The ... faces .
And the ... captions .
There 's really nothing more that I could possibly say .
It 's gross .
It 's offensive .
And I do n't want to even think about how many more years ' worth of book editions it took for this to finally get cut out .
But ... wait .
What are those faint pencil marks up top there ?
Let 's take a closer look .

JK Rowling 's Harry Potter 's books have sold more than 400 million copies
Harry Potter author JK
Rowling missed out on a top honour because some US politicians believed she " encouraged witchcraft " , it has been claimed .
Matt Latimer , former speech writer for President George W Bush , said that some members of his administration believed her books promoted sorcery .
As a result , she was never presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom .
The claims appear in Latimer 's new book called Speechless : Tales of a White House Survivor .
He wrote that " narrow thinking " led White House officials to object to giving Rowling the civilian honour .
The award acknowledges contributions to US national interest , world peace or cultural endeavours .
Past literary recipients of the award include John Steinbeck and Harper Lee .
Others denied the privilege under the Bush administration included Senator Edward Kennedy , who died in August this year .
Latimer claimed , in his book , that the veteran politician and health care activist was excluded because he was deemed to be too liberal .
A pet cat which went missing in Tasmania and turned up in outback Queensland has been reunited with its owners in the Derwent Valley .
The long - haired Himalayan named Clyde disappeared from home when he was just 12 - months - old .
He was eventually found in Cloncurry in north - west Queensland , 3,800 kilometres away .
Earlier this year , Clyde walked into the local hospital and followed a nurse home .
The woman contacted Clyde 's owners after a vet found the cat was microchipped .
Owners Katrina Phillips and her daughter Ashley Sullivan are convinced Clyde was stolen and say they are still in shock that he has been found .
Ms Phillips says the family will be keeping a a close eye on the wanderer .
" We 'll get that cattery up as quickly as what we can so he 's safe at home , " she said .
" I really expected him to be quite frantic when we got him out , I really expected to have a cat that did n't want to be held up and needing its space .
" And for him to be so relaxed and calm , I 'm positive he remembers . "
They plan to keep Clyde indoors for a few days before reintroducing him to their other animals - four cats , a dog , a cockatoo and 40 horses .
On Wednesday ,
Joseph Farah told us what he would do if he were the new
president .
He focused mainly on whom he 'd appoint to his cabinet , but I 'd like to tell you what actions I 'd take if I 'd been elected president .
After my inaugural day , I 'd probably spend little more than an hour a day in the Oval Office , because a busy president is a dangerous president .
But for the very first day , I 'd have an extremely long agenda .
On that first day in office , by executive order I would :
Pardon everyone who had been convicted on a federal , non-violent drug charge , order their immediate release , reunite them with their families , and restore all their civil rights .
( Anyone convicted of using violence against someone else in a drug case would not qualify as " non-violent . " )
Pardon everyone who had been convicted on any federal gun-control charge , tax - evasion charge , or any other victimless crime , order their immediate release , and restore all their civil rights .
TRENDING : The Bidens avoided paying more than $ 500,000 in payroll taxes by exploiting S corporations
I would empty the prisons of those who have n't harmed anyone else and make room for the violent criminals who are currently getting out on plea bargains and early release .
Following the issuance of the pardons :
I would announce a policy to penalize , dismiss , or even prosecute any federal employee who violated the Bill of Rights by treating you as guilty until proven innocent , by searching or seizing your property without due process of law , by treating you as a servant , or in any other way violating your rights as a sovereign American citizen .
I would immediately order that no federal asset forfeiture could occur unless the property 's owner had been convicted by full due process .
And I would initiate steps to make restitution to anyone whose property had been impounded , frozen , or seized by the federal government without a legal conviction .
( Over 80 percent of such seizures occur when no one has even been charged with a crime . )
As commander in chief of the Armed Forces , I would immediately remove all American troops from foreign soil .
Europe and Asia can pay for their own defense , and they can risk their own lives in their eternal squabbles .
This would save billions of dollars a year in taxes , but -- more important -- it would make sure your sons and daughters never fight or die in someone else 's war .
I would order everyone in the executive branch to stop harassing smokers , tobacco companies , successful computer companies , gun owners , gun manufacturers , alternative medicine suppliers , religious groups ( whether respected or labeled as " cults " ) , investment companies , health - care providers , businessmen , or anyone else who 's conducting his affairs peaceably .
I would end federal affirmative action , federal quotas , set - asides , preferential treatments , and other discriminatory practices of the federal government .
Any previous president could have done this with a stroke of the pen .
Do you wonder why none of them did ?
And then I would break for lunch .
There 's more ...
After lunch , I would begin the process of removing from the Federal Register the thousands and thousands of regulations and executive orders inserted there by previous presidents .
In most cases these regulations give federal employees powers for which there is no constitutional authority .
I would call Office Depot and order a carload of pens -- to use to veto congressional bills that violate the Constitution or that spend more money than necessary for the constitutional functions of government .
I would send to Congress a budget that immediately cuts federal spending in half -- on its way to reducing the government to no larger than its constitutional size .
Congress would undoubtedly pass a larger budget and expect me to sign it .
I would n't .
I 'd veto it .
Would Congress override my veto ?
Maybe it would and maybe it would n't .
Even if Congress succeeded in passing bills over my veto , the battle finally would be joined .
We finally would have something we have n't had in my lifetime -- a president standing up to Congress .
At long last , there would be two sides arguing in Washington -- one to increase government and one to cut it sharply -- instead of the current trivial debate over whether government should grow 5 percent a year or " only " 3 percent .
Just say no
No president in the past several decades has had the will , the determination , the courage to " just say no " to Congress .
No president in the past several decades has even tried to reduce the size of government .
Any president who wanted to do so could have managed it -- even in the face of a hostile Congress .
No president since the 1950s has proposed a single budget that would reduce the size of the federal government .
And when Congress has come back with even larger budgets , no president has vetoed them .
Every president who claimed to be against big government has had that veto at his disposal , but none thought enough of your freedom to use it .
As president , I would -- for the first time -- use that office on your behalf .
I would say no to Congress .
Whatever new program it wanted to spend money on , I would veto .
Whatever new tax it wanted to impose , I would veto .
Whatever new intrusion it wanted to make in your life , I would veto .
No deals .
No excuses .
No apologies .
No regrets .
But I would do more than just defend what little freedom you have left today .
I would go on the offensive .
I would n't rest until the income tax was repealed , the federal government was so small you would n't worry about who was elected president , and you had control over your own money , your own freedom , your own life .
And when we achieved this , we'd have a celebration .
Do you remember the German youths who tore down the Berlin Wall and sold pieces of it to us ?
Well , we would tear down the IRS building and sell the pieces -- and use the proceeds to help IRS agents find honest work .
Do you think any of my plans would appeal to George W. Bush or Al Gore ?
Not likely , is it ?
So why are we worrying over which one of them will win the current legal mud-wrestling ?
From simple marks such as crosses and triangles to sophisticated and multi-layered semiotic codes today , we ’ve always been visually led when it comes it choosing what we want , and beer has always led the way .
Beer and pubs have been around for 1000 years , and for most of that time the people drinking were illiterate – visual identity was vital in building recognition and loyalty .
Ask any beer lover why they choose the beers they drink , and they ’ll tell you it ’s all about the taste .
That may be true , but you need to see a beer and order it before you can find out what it tastes like .
Today in Britain there are over 2500 breweries , most of whom brew an ever - changing range of different beers .
On the bar of any decent pub , or shelves of a good bottle shop or supermarket beer aisle , the choice can be overwhelming .
People make snap decisions so quickly we do n’t even notice .
And the design of a beer label , pump clip , bottle or can has to do a lot of work to stand out , get noticed , and suggest to the thirsty punter that here is a beer they will enjoy .

La Comisi�n de Hacienda de la C�mara de Diputados aval� un techo de endeudamiento para el Gobierno de la Ciudad de M�xico , por�5 mil�millones de pesos , para 2010 .
La decisi�n de los diputados resulta inferior a la propuesta de la administraci�n capitalina que era de 5 mil 500 millones de pesos .
El endeudamiento fue producto de un amplio debate en la comisi�n , una vez que la fracci�n del PRI , en nombre del diputado Sebasti�n Lerdo de Tejada hab �a puntualizado que era inaceptable el planteamiento , por lo que deber�a ser de cero pesos el endeudamiento .
A la C�mara de Diputados tuvo que acudir el secretario de finanzas del Distrito Federal , Mario Delgado Carrillo para defender la propuesta de endeudamiento .
Argument� que los recursos ser�n utilizados para la L�nea 12 del Sistema de Transporte Colectivo Metro .
El responsable de la finanzas p�blicas inform � que , el pr�ximo a�o , tendr�n vencimientos de contrato por 8 mil millones de pesos , relacionados con la edificaci�n de la L�nea 12 del Metro .
Agreg� que esa situaci�n ser� cubierta con endeudamiento , una partida que esperan de la C�mara de Diputados y esfuerzos de recaudaci�n local .
There has been much speculation lately about whether Mass Effect , the hugely - popular and critically acclaimed RPG , currently exclusive to the Xbox 360 , will be making it to the PS3 .
A recent listing on GAME ’s website further fueled the fire .
Bioware , the guys behind Mass Effect , have been pretty quiet about this issue…until now .
When questioned by a forum member on their forums , a representative for the company , Patrick Weekes , did not deny the rumor ; but at the same time , did not confirm it .
“ we do n’t comment on rumors . :-) ”
The mere fact that Weekes did not outright deny the claims is surprising .
If Bioware really had no intention on bringing the award - winning series over to the PS3 , they should have outright denied the claims ; whether through an official statement or on their forums .
They should n’t be letting the rumors grow , only to leave the fans disappointed .
This issue certainly wo n’t be going away any time soon .
So stick with PlayStation LifeStyle , as we ’ll bring you all the latest news on this topic .

Israel Videos - Part 1
Jeff Gates along with Anthony Lawson produce this startling new video ,
A Closer Look at Israel ’s Role in Terrorism ( Scroll Down to Watch )
that is an absolute necessity for every American who genuinely loves his country and knows something has gone very very wrong .
In Jeff ’s own words :
What I tell people is that our specialty is enabling people to grasp “ how ” this duplicity operates in plain sight and , to date , with impunity .
With that knowledge , they can sort out for themselves Who and Why .
Absent that knowledge , they ’re left adrift in the domain of conspiracy theorists , hate - mongers and such .
We see this knowledge as essential in the transition to the Knowledge Society .

After his wife 's car plunged into a river , Stacy Horton had an agonising decision to make : rescue her or their teenage son .
His wife Vanessa had escaped from the car but was crying for help as she struggled to keep her head above water , while their son Silva , 13 , was still trapped inside the sinking vehicle .
With time to save only one , Mr Horton dived into the river .
' I just had to accept the fact that he had gone .
' Instead of going down and risking my life as well as my wife and son's , I chose to take Vanessa back and sat on the shore praying .
It was all I could do . '
Silva 's friend and the family dog , who had also been in the car , had managed to scramble to safety by the time Mr Horton arrived at the scene , two minutes after the car had entered the Whanganui River , north of Wellington , New Zealand .
Grief : The Horton family tell of their ordeal and sadness at losing Silva
The tragedy began when a group of children broke the Hortons ' letterbox at their home in Whanganui before running off .
Mrs Horton , 35 , clambered into the station wagon with Silva and his friend to give chase , while her husband followed in another car .
He caught up with his wife 's car not far from their home .
It is thought she had found the group of children and stopped to confront them when the car rolled down the bank into the river .
Tragedy :
The accident happened on Saturday night at Whanganui River on New Zealand 's North Island
After Mr Horton had made his heartbreaking decision to drag his wife to safety , police and firefighters , summoned by passers - by , dived into the murky water to try to free Silva .
However , by then , even reaching the vehicle proved impossible in the darkness .
' We tried everything but to no avail , ' said senior fire officer Gary Wilson .
' It was a long shot but it was worth the risk to try and save him . '
Police spokesman Kim Perks said : ' It was a very tough call for Mr Horton .
I certainly would not have wanted to be in his shoes . '
Their son : 13 - year - old Silva Horton was trapped inside the sinking car - his father Stacy could only watch as it sank into the Whanganui River
Divers managed to recover Silva 's body on Sunday .
Mrs Horton said she was comforted by her belief that Silva , a committed Christian , was now in a better place .
' He 'll be having a party at the moment , ' she said .
Mr Horton said : ' He was outgoing and anyone who he came across he made friends with .
' Even anyone he did n't like , if he saw they were in trouble he would go and help them .
' He rammed as much into his life as anyone could possibly do .
' It 's just a freak accident .
We can't blame anyone .
I 've forgiven the kids who were wrecking our letterbox .'
' I love those kids and I know how they will be feeling , ' said Mrs Horton .
' I do n't hold them responsible . '
The couple said Silva 's funeral on Thursday would be a celebration of his life and they planned to release 13 balloons , one for each year they spent with him .
jamwt 's been around in the Twisted community for a while .
He 's written a bunch of fairly deep Twisted code and he clearly knows what the framework is capable of .
I 've spoken with him on a number of occasions , and for all I know I might have discussed this with him .
I do n't remember it , but it would be pretty embarrassing to write a big rant about how nobody talks to us only to have him paste some chat log where he explained why he was writing Diesel six months ago , and I said " oh , okay " ;-) .
Nobody is calling Twisted names or making vague , unsubstantiated accusations .
You 're not obligated to examine Twisted , nor Nevow , nor Orbited , I just feel that you owe us some explanation if you publicly say that you tried it and found it wanting .
The tone on the Diesel announcement , in its one brief mention of Twisted , is " we tried it , but we kinda wanted to do our own thing " .
So , good for them , they did their own thing , I hope they had fun .
Thanks to jamwt for the shout - out on the announcement of Diesel Since the reaction to my reaction to tornado was so good ( or at least so ... energetic ) , I figure I should comment on Diesel as well .
Spoiler alert : my reaction is ... largely similar , but since jamwt has been kind of nice to Twisted in the past , and did n't actually say anything mean this time , I 'm somewhat reluctant to have that reaction .
Nevertheless , I swore a solemn oath to tell it like it is , keep it real , and soforth .
So I must .
Once again , I 'm happy that event - driven programming is getting some love .
This time , I 'm pleased that nobody is saying anything especially snarky or FUD - ish about Twisted .
I do feel like it's a little weird not to mention Twisted , or include some comparisons to Nevow or Orbited , both of which provide different , comprehensive approaches to COMET with Twisted .
( Worth noting : Orbited also originally started out using its own event - driven I/O layer , but switched to Twisted later , because Twisted is " crazy delicious " .)
Diesel has many more interesting ideas at the level of async I/O than Tornado did .
I think the generator - based approach for implementing protocols is interesting and deserves some more exploration .
I 'm not sold on it for every use - case , and I think the implementation might have some flaws , but it definitely has some advantages .
I 'd give jamwt a hard time for not reporting issues and communicating with Twisted more before re-writing the core , but for three issues :
Now , personally , I 'd like to leave it at that , but there is a certain inevitable comparison that I think is going to take place .
Diesel has a nicer web page than Twisted .
They have entwittered ... twitified ... uh ... tweetened ... the project , and we have n't ; we just have an old - fashioned " blog " .
Diesel is smaller than Twisted , so it 's easier to explain , and so the people approaching it will have a better idea of its scope .
This might give the immediate impression that it is a simpler , better , more " modern " replacement for Twisted 's I /O layer , and this is not the case .
So I still feel it 's important that I set the record straight .
Before I launch into my critique , I should say that I do n't want to harsh on Diesel too bad .
It 's a neat little hack and you should go play with it .
And I feel bad pointing out problems with it , since as I mentioned above , nobody 's dumping on Twisted .
So , Diesel fans , please take this in the spirit of a frank code - review , not a complaint about your behavior .
The interesting generator - munging bits could be easily adapted to run on top of Twisted 's loop , which , arguably , they should have been in the first place ; and the toy " hub " that they 've written might be good enough for some simple applications where reliability under load is not a serious concern .
In fact , inlineCallbacks might provide a good deal of what is needed to support Diesel 's programming style .
Alternately , Diesel might provide some hints as to how things like inlineCallbacks could be made more efficient .
That said , Diesel 's I / O loop sucks .
It 's disappointing to see the same mistakes getting made over and over again .
First and foremost : no tests .
Come on , Python community !
You can do better !
The # 1 benefit that a brand - new I/O loop projecthave over Twisted is that Twisted was written in the bad old days before everybody knew that TDD was the right way to write programs , so we do n't have 100 % test coverage .
But , we strive to get closer every day , while every new project decides that they do n't need no stinking quality control .
Predictably , as it has no tests , Diesel 's I / O layer is full of dead code , inaccurate documentation , and unhandled errors .
Consider this gem , which I found about 30 seconds into reading the code : KqueueEventHub is documented to be " an epoll - based event hub " , and its initializer defines an inner function which is never used .
I 'm not going to belabor the point by enumerating all the typo bugs I found , but you may find the output of ' pyflakes diesel ' interesting .
Instead of Tornado 's inaccurate handling of EINTR , Diesel hashandling of EINTR , as far as I can tell .
It also does n't handle EPERM , ENOBUFS , EMFILE , or even EAGAIN on accept ( ) .
To be fair , it has a catch - all exception handler all the way at the top of the stack , so none of these will cause instant crashes , but they will cause surprising behavior in odd situations ( and possibly infinite traceback - spewing loops ) .
More surprisingly - I had to re-read the code about five times to make sure - it does n't appear that sockets are ever set to be non-blocking , and EAGAIN is not handled from accept ( ) , recv( ) , or send ( ) .
And yes , thishappen even if your multiplexor says your socket is ready for reading and / or writing .
The conditions are somewhat obscure , but nevertheless they do happen .
So , occasionally , Diesel will hiccup and block until some slow network client manages to send or receive some traffic .
In other words : Diesel is not really async .
It just fakes it convincingly , most of the time .
Once again , there 's no way to asynchronously spawn a process , and no way to asynchronously connect a TCP client .
Sure , this looks like an asynchronous connect call , but it 's misleading : it blocks on resolving the hostname , and it potentially blocks on the initial SYN / ACK / SYN+ACK exchange .
There 's no asynchronous SSL support .
And no , that is not trivial .
Not to mention handling all the crazy errors that spew out of the Windows TCP stack .
And since the loop is implemented to be incompatible with Twisted , it 's not obviously trivial to compatibly plug it in and get those features .
Again , I do n't want to dump on Diesel here ; for what it is , i.e. an experiment in how to idiomatically structure asynchronous applications , it 's all right .
For that matter Twisted has its fair share of bugs too , which would be pretty easy to lay out in a similar post ; you would n't even need to do the research yourself , just go look at our bug tracker .
But both Diesel and Tornado make the mistake of attempting to replace the years of trial - and - error , years of testing discipline , and years of portability and feature work that Twisted has accumulated with a few oversimplified , untested hacks .
What theyhave done is contributed any extensions that they needed to Twisted 's loop , or modifications to Twisted 's packaging that would allow them to get a smaller sliver of Twisted 's core to bootstrap , if that 's what they needed .
My goal in pointing out all these flaws is not to illustrate any particular point about Diesel , but to reinforce the point I implicitly made in my Tornado post , which is thatyouscrew it up .
You will most likely screw it up in ways which will only surface later , under mysterious circumstances , when your servers are under load and you are under the gun for a deadline .
Or if I happen to get wind of it and write a blog post about it , of course .
Then you get to cheat a little .
It 's not an indictment of Diesel that it screwed this up ; everyone screws it up .
would probably screw it up , if I did n't have Twisted sitting in front of me as a direct reference .
POSIX by itself is unreasonably subtle and difficult , but POSIX , plus the subtle variations in different platforms which implement it , plus the Windows APIs which are almost - but - not - quite - exactly - nothing - like the POSIX APIs , presents an inhuman challenge .
Hopefully Diesel will grow some tests .
Hopefully it will fix , or better yet shed , its somewhat unfortunate I /O hub .
I am hopeful that someone will follow Dustin 's excellent lead ( perhaps Dustin himself ! ) and port Diesel 's API and generator system over to Twisted 's I/O architecture and eliminate all these silly bugs .
Of course , it someone did that , you could use Dustin 's tornado port with Diesel .
With the silly bugs from the I/O loop out of the way , the Diesel team can write tests for the more interesting pieces , and fix the bugs which are n't entirely silly :-) .
Ever ask yourself why Pres .
Obama has never come straight and said he would Veto any bill that does n't have the Public Option ?
Hell , or at least put up some kind of flag so people knows where he really stands ?
Helen Thomas has been asking Robert Gibbs the same question , over and over .
You can read the transcript at the Washington Sketch or just watch the video for the full effect below the fold .
I have to give a hat tip to Gregg Levine over at FDL for pointing this classic Helen Thomas exchange out to us .
Between Gregg and Dana Milbank we now have another chance to ponder why it is so damn hard for Pres.
Obama to stand up for the Public Option in Black and White terms all of America can understand .
Law enforcement officials are concerned that the recruits , who hold American passports , could be commissioned to return to the United States to carry out attacks here , though so far there is no evidence of such plots .
“ The potential implications to national security are significant , ” said Ralph S. Boelter , the special agent in charge of the Minneapolis field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
He added that the nationwide inquiry would continue with the cooperation of many Somali immigrants and that more arrests might be coming .
The disclosures are the government ’s first public account of a recruitment operation that it says has largely focused on Somali - American men from the Minneapolis area .
Those young men included Shirwa Ahmed , 26 , who carried out a suicide attack in northern Somalia in October 2008 , becoming the first known American suicide bomber .
Since then , at least five other recruits have been killed in Somalia , relatives and friends say , and four defendants have entered guilty pleas .
The court documents , which included unsealed indictments and criminal complaints , provide chilling details about the experience of the recruits , who began to enlist in Al Shabab in September 2007 .
They attended training camps in Somalia run by Somali , Arab and Western instructors , who taught them to use machine guns and rocket - propelled grenades and indoctrinated them with anti-American and anti-Israeli beliefs , according to one complaint .
Two of the Minneapolis recruits took part in an ambush against Ethiopian troops , and many others were involved in combat , according to the documents .
One of the fighters , Cabdulaahi Ahmed Faarax , later returned to Minneapolis and emerged as a recruiter , officials said .
A 32 - year - old cab driver and divorced father of two , Mr. Faarax had sustained a leg injury while fighting with Al Shabab , a senior law enforcement official said .
( CNN ) --
They smell bad , ca n't talk and generally possess a single - minded hunger for human flesh .
Jesse Eisenberg is pursued by zombies in the new release " Zombieland . "
So why , exactly , do we love zombies so much ?
According to experts -- and , yes , there are zombie experts -- it 's because for all their limitations , the brain - rotted , animated corpses are so darned versatile -- helping reflect whatever our greatest fears happen to be at the time .
" You ca n't shoot the financial meltdown in the head -- you can do that with a zombie , " said Max Brooks , author of the best - selling " Zombie Survival Guide " and " World War Z " -- which is currently in development to become a movie .
Watch clips from some essential zombie movies »
" All the other problems are too big .
As much as Al Gore tries , you can't picture global warming .
You can't picture the meltdown of our financial institutions .
But you can picture a slouching zombie coming down the street . "
Zombies initially shuffled onscreen in 1932 as the mindless minions of horror movie legend Bela Lugosi in the film " White Zombie . "
This weekend , they 'll chase a shotgun - and - banjo - toting Woody Harrelson through an amusement park when " Zombieland " opens .
They 've also starred in video games , music videos , pop songs and books , picking up a devoted , if not obsessive , set of fans along the way .
Since ancient times , monster stories have been used to channel other concerns about life and death , said Andrea Wood , a graduate fellow at Georgia Tech who teaches the course " Apocalyptic Nightmares of the Living Dead " and is working on a book about zombies in popular culture .
But the zombie , she said , offers a uniquely blank canvas .
" Since the zombie does n't have the long literary tradition of the vampire or a number of other monsters , it allows artists a degree of autonomy to conceptualize the zombie any way they see fit , " said Wood .
Early zombie films like " White Zombie " and 1943's " I Walked With a Zombie " stick to the monster 's Caribbean voodoo traditions , in which some sort of evildoer uses magic to force the recently deceased to do his bidding .
It 's no coincidence , says Peter Dendle , an associate professor of English at Pennsylvania State University - Mont Alto , that such stories emerged during the Great Depression .
" The United States that prided itself on individuality and hard work found itself standing in soup lines , " said Dendle , author of " The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia " and other works about the undead .
" The terror in Haiti is not so much being attacked by a zombie , but becoming one -- having your life and soul taken from you and placed under someone else 's will . "
In 1968 , director George A. Romero re-imagined the monsters as flesh - eating ghouls , creating the pop-culture zombie identity that exists to this day .
In the turbulent late '60s , Romero 's zombies helped provide some thinly veiled commentary on race , class and the breakdown of the American Dream .
Since then , zombie movies have given viewers a way to consider , if indirectly , problems such as natural disasters , technology gone awry , deadly viruses and the daily grind of their own lives .
Nervous about warfare and military secrets ?
Wait until they unleash a poisonous nerve gas in " Planet Terror . "
Think animal - rights activists go too far ?
Watch them rescue and release a monkey that spreads the " Rage " virus in " 28 Days Later . "
And then there 's one of the most basic human fears of all , the fear of death .
" [ With zombies ] we see the process of decay as it happens right before our eyes , " Wood said .
" They are this kind of perverse manifestation of humans ' desire for immortality gone horribly awry . "
Brooks , whose third book , the graphic novel " Zombie Survival Guide : Recorded Attacks , " will be released Wednesday , said zombies provide a safe and socially acceptable way to deal with those fears .
" It 's safe to do something like a zombie walk -- it is n't so fun to do a swine flu walk , " Brooks said .
" If , at a party , you bring up how you 'd survive a zombie attack , you'd be the life of the party .
But if you say , ' What would you do if super - AIDS came to America ? ' you 'd clear the room . "
Throughout their history , zombie movies have tended to be low - budget affairs .
The highest - grossing zombie movie was the 2004 remake of Romero 's " Dawn of the Dead , " which hauled in about $ 59 million .
That put the film at No. 92 on Horror.com 's list of 100 top - grossing horror movies .
But the films often achieve cult - classic status , with fans continuing to watch them decades after they 're released .
Whether " Zombieland , " with its big budget and high - profile cast , breaks that trend , nobody is expecting tales of the walking dead to ever go away .
" In the early 2000s , I had all but pronounced the genre dead -- there had n't been a big studio movie in more than 10 years , " he said .
" I 've gone out of that business .
I 've pulled up my shingle for pronouncing the death knell of the zombie . "
After all , like zombies , zombie movies are remarkably resilient ( even when faced with shotguns and chainsaws ) .
That 's another part of the appeal , experts say -- appeal that can be measured in such things as a 74,000 - member Facebook group titled " The Hardest Part of a Zombie Apocalypse Will Be Pretending I'm Not Excited . "
To promote his books , Brooks travels the country talking about the undead menace .
Instead of questions about writing , he said he often gets asked about the best type of ammunition to kill a zombie or the best way to prepare your house for the coming onslaught .
" I 'd say 90 percent are saying , ' We all know it 's fake ; we 're playing along , ' " he said .
" The other 10 percent are saying , ' We 're ready ! '
" And I 'd say 10 percent of that 10 percent can't wait for it to happen . "

The two Florida men reportedly met two months ago and spent time fishing and playing cards .
On Friday night , one of the men , Luke R. Petruschke , was invited by the other , Manuel Vidal Vega , for a family dinner .
But the next morning , according to the police in Davie , Fla. , Mr. Vega ’s 3 - year - old son told his father that Mr. Petruschke , 38 , had groped him the night before .
An enraged Mr. Vega and a neighbor battered Mr. Petruschke so brutally with a concrete block , rocks , their fists and their feet that Mr. Petruschke had to be placed in a medically induced coma on Saturday , the police said .
The official report described the beating as “ savage . ”
A police affidavit said that when Mr. Vega was about to be arrested , he told the police , “ That is my son , what would you do ? ”

You may or may not recognize yourself in this essay from Georgetown Associate Professor John Hasnas :
Being a libertarian means living with an almost unendurable level of frustration .
It means being subject to unending scorn and derision despite being inevitably proven correct by events .
How does it feel to be a libertarian ?
Imagine what the internal life of Cassandra must have been and you will have a pretty good idea . [… ]
Libertarians spend their lives accurately predicting the future effects of government policy .
Their predictions are accurate because they are derived from Hayek 's insights into the limitations of human knowledge , from the recognition that the people who comprise the government respond to incentives just like anyone else and are not magically transformed to selfless agents of the good merely by accepting government employment , from the awareness that for government to provide a benefit to some , it must first take it from others , and from the knowledge that politicians cannot repeal the laws of economics .
For the same reason , their predictions are usually negative and utterly inconsistent with the utopian wishful - thinking that lies at the heart of virtually all contemporary political advocacy .
And because no one likes to hear that he cannot have his cake and eat it too or be told that his good intentions cannot be translated into reality either by waving a magic wand or by passing legislation , these predictions are greeted not merely with disbelief , but with derision . [… ]
If you 'd like a taste of what it feels like to be a libertarian , try telling people that the incoming Obama Administration is advocating precisely those aspects of FDR 's New Deal that prolonged the great depression for a decade ; that propping up failed and failing ventures with government money in order to save jobs in the present merely shifts resources from relatively more to relatively less productive uses , impedes the corrective process , undermines the economic growth necessary for recovery , and increases unemployment in the long term ; and that any " economic " stimulus package will inexorably be made to serve political rather than economic ends , and see what kind of reaction you get .
And trust me , it wo n't feel any better five or ten years from now when everything you have just said has been proven true and Obama , like FDR , is nonetheless revered as the savior of the country .
Rahm skeptical of U.S. troop surge in Afghanistan
White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel expressed doubts on Sunday that sending more troops into Afghanistan would have the desired effect , unless there ’s a credible government in the country to work with .
Emanuel told CNN ’s “ State of the Union ” that the White House is planning additional meetings with military advisers over the next two weeks to discuss strategy in Afghanistan .
“ The question at the heart is ... do you have a credible Afghan partner for this process that can provide the security and the type of services that the Afghan people need ? ” Emanuel said .
“ We would love the luxury of this debate to be reduced down to one question : additional troops , 40,000 , " he said .
But " this is a much more complex decision …
The real [ question ] here is not how much troops you have , but whether in fact there ’s an Afghan partner . ”
And , Emanuel said , Afghanistan is n't currently at the point where it can become a partner with the United States to govern the country .
" We 're beginning from scratch , the starting point after eight years , " Emanuel said .
" There 's not a security force , an army , the type of services important for the Afghans to become a true partner .
So that is the question . "

I have gotten many question about revisions to the Reader Emails on Birth / Death Model and Unemployment Rate .
In case you missed it the BLS has admitted that its Birth / Death Model has overestimated jobs by about 800,000 .
The New York Times talked about this in Jobs Vanish .
The Labor Department said that it planned to revise the job figures by subtracting more than 800,000 jobs that it had wrongly estimated were filled by workers .
The so - called “ benchmark revision ” that was announced today will not formally be incorporated into the job figures until February , and could be revised .
But the figures indicate that last March the government overestimated the total number of jobs by 824,000 , or 0.6 percent .
Its overestimate of private - sector employment was even greater — 855,000 jobs , or 0.8 percent .
The culprit is probably the much maligned birth - death model , although Victoria Battista , an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics , said the bureau was looking into other possible issues , such as changing response rates to the questionnaire sent out by the bureau to employers each month .
That model adds in jobs assumed to have been created by employers who are too new to have been added to the survey , and subtracts jobs from employers assumed to have failed and therefore not responded to the bureau ’s survey .
Birth Death Model Revisions 2009
Short Comings
In BLS Birth Death Model
The U.S. government is having a tough time guesstimating how many small businesses failed in this recession , casting doubt on the reliability of vital data on employment and economic growth .
The formula the U.S. Labor Department designed to help it deliver timely , thorough monthly employment reports broke down in the heat of the financial crisis , miscounting the number of jobs by an estimated 824,000 in the year through March .
That model appears to have misjudged how many companies went out of business during the recession , meaning the labor market was even weaker than initially thought when President Barack Obama took office in January .
More recent figures may still be underestimating job losses now , but it will be many months before the Labor Department is certain .
One characteristic of this recession is that it has hit small businesses especially hard , driving down demand and choking off vital sources of credit at the same time .
Jan Hatzius , an economist at Goldman Sachs in New York , thinks that is distorting not only the employment data , but also figures for retail sales , durable goods and even the biggest economic indicator of all -- gross domestic product .
Indeed , 43,546 businesses filed for bankruptcy in 2008 , the highest tally since 1998 , and the pace has picked up this year , according to data from the American Bankruptcy Institute .
In the second quarter of 2009 , the most recent data available , 16,014 businesses filed for bankruptcy , up from 14,319 in the previous three - month period and the highest mark in 16 years .
The Labor Department simply can't catch all those failures fast enough to compile its monthly employment reports , which are normally released on the first Friday after the end of the month .
So it must make an educated guess .
Each month , the department surveys about 160,000 firms to get a sense of how many jobs were added or cut .
It also uses the " birth - death " model to try to estimate out how many companies opened or closed .
Once a year , the department looks at unemployment insurance tax records to get a more accurate picture of how many people were employed , and matches that up with its own data .
Each February , it tries to reconcile these differences by releasing a " benchmark revision " .
Normally , the discrepancy is modest .
This coming February , it is likely to be about 824,000 , according to the Labor Department 's preliminary estimate last month .
That would mean instead of about 7.2 million jobs lost since the start of the recession in December 2007 , there were more like 8 million .
" Preliminary research indicated that a big portion of that was a result of a breakdown in the birth - death model , " said Chris Manning , the department 's benchmark branch chief .
Reader Question On The Unemployment Rate
Manning said his department was still trying to figure out what went awry this time .
One possibility is that the model was not sensitive enough to the credit crunch , which choked off borrowing and pushed many companies into bankruptcy .
" We 're researching ways to better understand the limitations of the model , in particular when it comes to responding to economic shocks , " he said .

Calgary - West MP , Rob Anders , is trying to mend ties with Calgary 's largest Muslim organization .
Anders attended a Ramadan dinner to try to defend his actions after a political pamphlet was sent from his office .
Anders met with the Muslim community in his riding at a Ramadan prayer service Friday , but not everyone was pleased to see the area MP .
Tension is boiling over a mail - out in which Anders wrote :
" It is now illegal to hold opinions that offend radical Muslim activists ... under Section 13 of the so - called Human Rights Code Canadians have been prosecuted for holding personal beliefs which offend radical Muslim Imams and Liberal activists . "
The examples refer to two Canadian journalists , Mark Steyn and Ezra Levant , both of whom were taken to court over editorials they published .
" We want to gather a petition of people who are against Section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights
Act which is restriction of freedom of expression , " said Anders .
But the Muslim Council of Calgary says the flyers were ill conceived .
" He unfairly scapegoated the Muslim community as somehow being a threat to freedom of speech in Canada because we have from time to time taken recourse to the Human Rights Commissions , " said David Liepert , Muslim Council of Calgary spokesperson .
The Muslim Council of Calgary invited Anders to a prayer service to help improve ties .
" We can't condemn him for not building bridges if we do n't do it ourselves , " added Liepert .
Anders did n't apologize for his flyers saying he was simply using two well known cases to illustrate his point .
Still , some in crowd felt slighted , but others hope Anders ' willingness to meet with the Muslim community will be the first step toward a renewed relationship .

MAPLE HEIGHTS --
For the first time in 525 days , Jim Bartek will have 103 extra minutes a day to kill .
On Saturday , the 49 - year - old Maple Heights man banged his head to the Judas Priest double album " Nostradamus " for the 524th and final time -- after listening to it at least once a day for the previous 523 consecutive days .
The feat gained him international notoriety , thanks to hundreds of articles in newspapers , blogs and magazines such as Rolling Stone .
He ended his streak at the Maple Grove bar in Maple Heights before about 35 people .
" Some think he 's crazy , " said Bill Peters , a DJ on WJCU FF / 88.7 who started spotlighting Bartek 's feat on his radio show 500 days ago and attended the event .
" But his passion and devotion made him an international cause . "
The feat even moved Rob Halford .
The Judas Priest singer not only sought out Bartek during a Cleveland concert in July , but he also taped a testimonial that was played at Saturday 's event :
" You are a special guy . . .
You brought a lot of attention to ' Nostradamus ' around the world .
We got quite a bump from that .
Thank you , Jim .
Thank you for being a fan . "
" Nostradamus " is dedicated to the 16th century seer who predicted cataclysmic events .
There was nothing cataclysmic about the Final Listening Party , though .
Bartek , who works in a truck shop , lorded over the bar in a Nostradamus costume .
He smiled and laughed , his feet dangling and swinging from a large wooden throne like a baby 's on a high chair .
His boxer Clarence was in wagging spirits too -- and not because Bartek kept pouring Labatt Blue in the dog 's bowl .
He 's been Bartek 's sidekick throughout the streak .
" Instead of bonding by going for walks , we 'd listen to Judas Priest together on the couch , " said the Maple Heights resident .
As " Nostradamus " neared its end , there was Clarence , side by side with his lord .
Bartek 's fans cheered -- out of respect , but also joy that the critically panned opus was over .
They handed Bartek a sledgehammer and instructed him to smash the CD .
Bartek looked aghast but relented .
" Now you can go back to being Jim Bartek , " yelled Peters .
So what is Jim Bartek planning on doing with that extra 103 minutes a day ?
" I might start the streak all over again after taking a day off , " he said .
" But I 'm thinking I should write a book about this and get a movie deal . "
Most of the drinking water is stripped of valuable electrons , making the water acidic and creating free radicals .
Free radicals steal electrons from the body ’s cells .
This is called Free Radical Damage and it is the cause of many serious health conditions .
They operate much like rust on a car , zapping people from their life force .
E2 : Electron Energized Technology adds trillions and trillions of electrons .
Thus producing stable negative ionization .
Negative ions along with antioxidants act to neutralize free radicals .
They are more accepted by the body ’s aquaporins .
Channels that usher in water and cellular nutrients for increased cellular hydration .
Astronomers examining data from a supernova first observed in 2002 have determined that it represents a new class of rapidly exploding star .
The explosion may have resulted from a binary star system where helium flowed from one white dwarf star to another , building up a layer of gas that detonated in a thermonuclear explosion .
The supernova , dubbed SM 2002bj , was three to four times faster than a standard supernova , disappearing in about 20 days , compared to three to four months for a typical supernova .
" This is the fastest evolving supernova we have ever seen , " said Dovi Poznanski , an astronomer with University of California , Berkeley , and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .
" Its brightness just dropped like a rock . "
The spectrum of the explosion had a strong signature for helium and none for hydrogen .
It also suggested the possible presence of vanadium , an element never before seen in a supernova .
All of these qualities led the researchers to conclude that this type of supernova had never been seen before .
Their work was published online this week in Science Express .
" This supernova is qualitatively different from the complete disruption of a white dwarf , known as a Type Ia supernova , or the collapse of an iron core and rebound of the surrounding material , so - called ' core - collapse supernovae , ' " or Type II supernova , said co-author Alex Filippenko of UC Berkeley .
This type of explosion was first predicted two years ago by theoretical physicists at the University of California , Santa Barbara .
Because this new type of supernova is similar to a Type Ia but is about one - tenth as bright and lasts about one - tenth as long , a Harvard physicist jokingly called it a Type " . Ia " ( point one A ) , and the name has since stuck .
When the supernova was first observed in 2002 , it was erroneously classified as a standard Type II supernova and filed away .
Poznanski found the spectrum of SM 2002 bj while looking through data on Type II supernovae .
Jess Bravin reports on Sonia Sotomayor ’s confirmation hearing .
Ouch !
Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R. , Ala. ) , seeking to discredit Judge Sonia Sotomayor ‘s judicial philosophy , cited her 2001 “ wise Latina ” speech , and contrasted the view that ethnicity and sex influence judging with that of Judge Miriam Cedarbaum , who “ believes that judges must transcend their personal sympathies and prejudices . ”
Associated Press
Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R. , Ala. ) , ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , questions Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor , during her confirmation hearing before the committee Tuesday .
Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R. , Utah ) is at left .
“ So I would just say to you , I believe in Judge Cedarbaum ’s formulation , ” Sessions told Sotomayor .
“ My friend Judge Cedarbaum is here , ” Sotomayor riposted , to Sessions apparent surprise .
“ We are good friends , and I believe that we both approach judging in the same way , which is looking at the facts of each individual case and applying the law to those facts . ”
Cedarbaum agreed .
“ I do n’t believe for a minute that there are any differences in our approach to judging , and her personal predilections have no effect on her approach to judging , ” she told Washington Wire .
“ We ’d both like to see more women on the courts , ” she added .
Cedarbaum , a pioneering woman lawyer who graduated from Columbia Law School in 1953 , goes way back with both participants in the colloquy .
Cedarbaum mentored Sotomayor after she joined the federal district court in Manhattan in 1992 , and they have been close friends ever since .
In 1986 , Cedarbaum and Sessions were both nominated to the federal bench by President Ronald Reagan , and were members of the same orientation class for future judges .
Their paths then diverged , however .
Cedarbaum was confirmed , but Sessions nomination floundered over a controversy surrounding comments he made involving the Ku Klux Klan and the NAACP .
ALBANY  Gov. David A. Paterson said Thursday that he would include gay marriage on the agenda of an extraordinary session he is calling for Tuesday , potentially setting up the first vote on the issue in the State Senate and a dramatic floor debate .
Senate Democratic leaders could still block the issue from coming to the floor and have done so before , though it appears more likely to be put to a vote this time .
Gay rights advocates , who feared holding a vote amid a Senate leadership feud this summer , cheered the governor ’s action .
The measure ’s chances of passing , though , are seen as far less likely .
While a same - sex marriage bill has already been passed twice in the Assembly , it faces an uphill battle in the Senate .
Democrats have a shaky 32 - to - 30 edge in the chamber , but several Democrats have said they will vote against the measure , and no Republicans are publicly supporting it .
The primary purpose of the session is to vote on the governor ’s plan to reduce a deficit of more than $ 3 billion , but few expect the governor and lawmakers to agree on a compromise plan by Tuesday .
So issues like same - sex marriage and measures to reform the pension system and public authorities are likely to dominate the session .
The Senate voted 71 to 28 for a massive spending bill that would restore $ 670 million cut from manned space exploration by the House in June .
The proposed spending still faces a strong test of wills as the Senate and House try to reach a budgetary compromise .
NASA is “ at a crossroads , starved of funds , ” Sen . Bill Nelson , D - Fla. , chairman of the Senate subcommittee that exercises jurisdiction over the space agency , told Senate colleagues during floor debate .
“ NASA can't do anything unless it gets some serious , new , additional money . ”
The Senate measure provides $ 3.2 billion for shuttle operations through Sept. 30 next year ; $ 4 billion for construction and operation of the orbiting $ 100 billion International Space Station ; and $ 628 million to pay the Russian space agency to ferry U.S. astronauts and cargo to the ISS after the shuttle fleet is retired .
Cornyn voted against it
The NASA spending was part of a $ 65.1 billion spending package providing funds for the departments of Commerce and Justice as well as science agencies such as NASA and the National Science Foundation .
“ We look forward to the budget passing both houses of Congress and being signed by the president , ” NASA spokesman Michael Cabbage told the Houston Chronicle .
“ Prior to that , it would be premature to comment on the deliberative process . ”
A panel of space experts led by retired aerospace executive Norman Augustine has recommended spending an additional $ 3 billion to extend space huttle operations for several months , speed delivery of the shuttle 's successor and extend operation of the International Space Station by five years through 2020 .
Texas ' senators split on the measure .
Sen . Kay Bailey Hutchison , R - Dallas , voted in favor of the spending bill and won a seat on the team of Senate negotiators that will work out differences with the House .
Sen .
John Cornyn of Texas , chairman of the GOP campaign committee working to win control of the Senate in 2010 and an increasingly ardent voice against federal spending , voted against the package .
Cornyn backs full funding for NASA , spokesman Kevin McLaughlin said .
But the overall measure increases federal funding for the various agencies and departments by nearly 13 percent over last year , McLaughlin said .
Budgetary pressures
NASA enjoys wide bipartisan support on Capitol Hill .
But the agency is under immense budget pressure amid massive federal spending on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and federal rescue efforts on the economy , the auto industry , Wall Street financial firms and ordinary Americans thrown out of work during the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression .
House budget writers cut NASA 's proposed exploration budget last summer at the behest of Rep. Alan Mollohan , D - W. Va. , chairman of the House Appropriations Committee panel that handles NASA spending .
Mollohan insisted the budget cuts “ should not be viewed as a diminution of my support or that of the subcommittee in NASA 's human spaceflight activities . ”
But he added : “ We want very much for the funding to be an honest and realistic cost assessment . ”

What is ooc ?
ooc was born out of the desire to write cross- platform applications with a concise , yet clear syntax , and to produce native binaries rather than relying on a downloadable runtime .
It ’s a general - purpose , language with a source - to - source compiler ( to C99 ) , and a portable SDK , readily available bindings for quite a few C libraries , a flexible module system , testing facilities and a set of utilities to make one ’s life easier .
History
It was 2009 , I had just started studying micro-engineering at EPFL , and we were given a programming assignment , something about a prey / predator simulation .
After having spent years using Java in my spare time , I did not want to go back to something as low - level as C , so I did what any lazy programmer would have done : I spent the first few months writing a source - to - source compiler from a Java-ish language to C , and then the last 48 hours actually coding the project .
Everything turned out fine - I got the maximum grade , and immediately began rewriting the compiler ( implemented in Java , back then ) .
And then I rewrote it again .
A community started to form around it .
By 2011 , we were overy fourty regulars on the IRC channel .
Then , time passed , some of us got jobs , we had our share of leadership problems within the project , and interest in the project slowly faded .
A small team kept maintaining the compiler and SDK in the background .
Bugs were fixed , long - awaited features were implemented .
Development has quietly continued , and the project was never actually abandoned .
After a long while with just a single page website , we decided to rebuild a proper one to help newcomers get up and running quickly .
You are reading it right now !
Why use ooc ?
It ’s a hard choice to make nowadays , to spend a chunk of your time learning and writing a codebase in a language that is n’t “ mainstream ” .
Some would argue , not without reason , that it is a dangerous enterprise - that choosing a more established platform is the right thing to do .
That hobby programming language skills are n’t marketable , etc. , etc .
However , a good programmer is a good programmer in any language .
Discovering new ways of perceiving , designing , and manufacturing pieces of software is always a worthy pursuit .
Hence , for small to medium - sized , personal projects - a personal command - line utility , a graphical front - end for an application you like , a custom piece of zeromq - powered network infrastructure , or an indie game - ooc is a practical alternative to what ’s out there .
It ’s been a while since the “ marketing ” phase of the ooc project has been abandoned .
Although it is motivating to push for adoption , imperatives like paying the bills , maintaining healthy relationships , and preserving one ’s sanity , have pushed for a more intimate approach to development .
Since its inception , many novelty programming languages have come and gone .
The naiveté of youth , combined with a relentless thirst for experimentation , have inspired many developers to try and do their own thing .
ooc survived through sheer , continued usefulness .
I sincerely hope you find it useful , quirky , and enlightening as well .
Similar projects
There are several new - ish , general - purpose programming languages floating around .
Some of them are similar to ooc , and some of them are very different .
If ooc does n’t fulfill your needs , perhaps some of these do :
“ A long time ago , someone suggested that the [ C.T.E. rate ] in boxers was twenty per cent , ” McKee told me .
“ I think it ’s probably higher than that among boxers , and I also suspect that it ’s going to end up being higher than that among football players as well .
Why ?
Because every brain I ’ve seen has this .
To get this number in a sample this small is really unusual , and the findings are so far out of the norm .
I only can say that because I have looked at thousands of brains for a long time .
This is n’t something that you just see .
I did the same exact thing for all the individuals from the Framingham heart study .
We study them until they die .
I run these exact same proteins , make these same slides — and we never see this . ”
McKee ’s laboratory occupies a warren of rooms , in what looks like an old officers ’ quarters on the V.A. campus .
In one of the rooms , there is an enormous refrigerator , filled with brains packed away in hundreds of plastic containers .
Nearby is a tray with small piles of brain slices .
They look just like the ginger shavings that come with an order of sushi .
Now McKee went to the room next to her office , sat down behind a microscope , and inserted one of the immunostained slides under the lens .
“ This is Tom McHale , ” she said .
“ He started out playing for Cornell .
Then he went to Tampa Bay .
He was the man who died of substance abuse at the age of forty - five .
I only got fragments of the brain .
But it ’s just showing huge accumulations of tau for a forty - five - year - old — ridiculously abnormal . ”
She placed another slide under the microscope .
“ This individual was forty - nine years old .
A football player .
Cognitively intact .
He never had any rage behavior .
He had the distinctive abnormalities .
Look at the hypothalamus . ”
It was dark with tau .
She put another slide in .
“ This guy was in his mid-sixties , ” she said .
“ He died of an unrelated medical condition .
His name is Walter Hilgenberg .
Look at the hippocampus .
It ’s wall - to - wall tangles .
Even in a bad case of Alzheimer ’s , you do n’t see that . ”
The brown pigment of the tau stain ran around the edge of the tissue sample in a thick , dark band .
“ It ’s like a big river . ”
McKee got up and walked across the corridor , back to her office .
“ There ’s one last thing , ” she said .
She pulled out a large photographic blowup of a brain - tissue sample .
“ This is a kid .
I ’m not allowed to talk about how he died .
He was a good student .
This is his brain .
He ’s eighteen years old .
He played football .
He ’d been playing football for a couple of years . ”
She pointed to a series of dark spots on the image , where the stain had marked the presence of something abnormal .
“ He ’s got all this tau .
This is frontal and this is insular .
Very close to insular .
Those same vulnerable regions . ”
This was a teen - ager , and already his brain showed the kind of decay that is usually associated with old age .
“ This is completely inappropriate , ” she said .
“ You do n’t see tau like this in an eighteen - year - old .
You do n’t see tau like this in a fifty - year - old . ”
McKee is a longtime football fan .
She is from Wisconsin .
She had two statuettes of Brett Favre , the former Green Bay Packers quarterback , on her bookshelf .
On the wall was a picture of a robust young man .
It was McKee ’s son — nineteen years old , six feet three .
If he had a chance to join the N.F.L. , I asked her , what would she advise him ?
“ I ’d say , ‘ Do n’t .
Not if you want to have a life after football . ’ ”
At the core of the C.T.E. research is a critical question : is the kind of injury being uncovered by McKee and Omalu incidental to the game of football or inherent in it ?
Part of what makes dogfighting so repulsive is the understanding that violence and injury cannot be removed from the sport .
It ’s a feature of the sport that dogs almost always get hurt .
Something like stock - car racing , by contrast , is dangerous , but not unavoidably so .
In 2000 and 2001 , four drivers in Nascar ’s élite Sprint Cup Series were killed in crashes , including the legendary Dale Earnhardt .
In response , Nascar mandated stronger seats , better seat belts and harnesses , and ignition kill switches , and completed the installation of expensive new barriers on the walls of its racetracks , which can absorb the force of a crash much better than concrete .
The result is that , in the past eight years , no one has died in Nascar ’s three national racing series .
Stock - car fans are sometimes caricatured as bloodthirsty , eagerly awaiting the next spectacular crash .
But there is little blood these days in Nascar crashes .
Last year , at Texas Motor Speedway , Michael McDowell hit an oil slick , slammed head first into the wall at a hundred and eighty miles per hour , flipped over and over , leaving much of his car in pieces on the track , and , when the vehicle finally came to a stop , crawled out of the wreckage and walked away .
He raced again the next day .
So what is football ?
Is it dogfighting or is it stock - car racing ?
Football faced a version of this question a hundred years ago , after a series of ugly incidents .
In 1905 , President Theodore Roosevelt called an emergency summit at the White House , alarmed , as the historian John Sayle Watterson writes , “ that the brutality of the prize ring had invaded college football and might end up destroying it . ”
Columbia University dropped the sport entirely .
A professor at the University of Chicago called it a “ boy - killing , man-mutilating , money - making , education - prostituting , gladiatorial sport . ”
In December of 1905 , the presidents of twelve prominent colleges met in New York and came within one vote of abolishing the game .
But the main objection at the time was to a style of play — densely and dangerously packed offensive strategies — that , it turns out , could be largely corrected with rule changes , like the legalization of the forward pass and the doubling of the first - down distance from five yards to ten .
Today , when we consider subtler and more insidious forms of injury , it ’s far from clear whether the problem is the style of play or the play itself .
Take the experience of a young defensive lineman for the University of North Carolina football team , who suffered two concussions during the 2004 season .
His case is one of a number studied by Kevin Guskiewicz , who runs the university ’s Sports Concussion Research Program .
For the past five seasons , Guskiewicz and his team have tracked every one of the football team ’s practices and games using a system called HITS , in which six sensors are placed inside the helmet of every player on the field , measuring the force and location of every blow he receives to the head .
Using the HITS data , Guskiewicz was able to reconstruct precisely what happened each time the player was injured .
“ The first concussion was during preseason .
The team was doing two - a - days , ” he said , referring to the habit of practicing in both the morning and the evening in the preseason .
“ It was August 9th , 9:55 A.M .
He has an 80-g hit to the front of his head .
About ten minutes later , he has a 98 - g acceleration to the front of his head . ”
To put those numbers in perspective , Guskiewicz explained , if you drove your car into a wall at twenty - five miles per hour and you were n’t wearing your seat belt , the force of your head hitting the windshield would be around 100 gs : in effect , the player had two car accidents that morning .
He survived both without incident .
“ In the evening session , he experiences this 64 - g hit to the same spot , the front of the head .
Still not reporting anything .
And then this happens . ”
On his laptop , Guskiewicz ran the video from the practice session .
It was a simple drill : the lineman squaring off against an offensive player who wore the number 76 .
The other player ran toward the lineman and brushed past him , while delivering a glancing blow to the defender ’s helmet .
“ Seventy - six does a little quick elbow .
It ’s 63 gs , the lowest of the four , but he sustains a concussion . ”
“ The second injury was nine weeks later , ” Guskiewicz continued .
“ He ’s now recovered from the initial injury .
It ’s a game out in Utah .
In warmups , he takes a 76 - g blow to the front of his head .
Then , on the very first play of the game , on kickoff , he gets popped in the earhole .
It ’s a 102 -g impact .
He ’s part of the wedge . ”
He pointed to the screen , where the player was blocking on a kickoff : “ Right here . ”
The player stumbled toward the sideline .
“ His symptoms were significantly worse than the first injury . ”
Two days later , during an evaluation in Guskiewicz ’s clinic , he had to have a towel put over his head because he could n’t stand the light .
He also had difficulty staying awake .
He was sidelined for sixteen days .
When we think about football , we worry about the dangers posed by the heat and the fury of competition .
Yet the HITS data suggest that practice — the routine part of the sport — can be as dangerous as the games themselves .
We also tend to focus on the dramatic helmet - to - helmet hits that signal an aggressive and reckless style of play .
Those kinds of hits can be policed .
But what sidelined the U.N.C. player , the first time around , was an accidental and seemingly innocuous elbow , and none of the blows he suffered that day would have been flagged by a referee as illegal .
Most important , though , is what Guskiewicz found when he reviewed all the data for the lineman on that first day in training camp .
He did n’t just suffer those four big blows .
He was hit in the head thirty - one times that day .
What seems to have caused his concussion , in other words , was his cumulative exposure .
And why was the second concussion — in the game at Utah — so much more serious than the first ?
It ’s not because that hit to the side of the head was especially dramatic ; it was that it came after the 76- g blow in warmup , which , in turn , followed the concussion in August , which was itself the consequence of the thirty prior hits that day , and the hits the day before that , and the day before that , and on and on , perhaps back to his high - school playing days .
The elusive perfect baguette .
Beautifully browned , crisp / crackly crust , fabulous flavor .
Can you make baguettes at home as good as those that come out of the oven at your local bakery ?
Well , it depends on the bakery .
Can you make baguettes as tasty and gorgeous as those from a bakery with talented artisan bakers , using the best ingredients ( namely , water , flour , salt , and yeast - period ) , and baking in a steam - injected , imported French brick oven ?
No , probably not .
But wait ; do n't despair .
Can you make baguettes as tasty and gorgeous as those from a bakery using previously frozen loaves , filled with chemicals , distributed from a commissary a thousand miles away from the bakery ?
Or baguettes equal to the soft bread wands labeled " baguette " in the supermarket bread section ?
Absolutely .
As the artisan bakers in our King Arthur bakery do , we 'll use just four ingredients – King Arthur Flour , yeast , water , and salt – to make a baguette that 'll do any home baker proud .
A rest in the fridge gives the dough terrific flavor .
And , since this recipe makes enough dough for four baguettes , you can tweak your technique baguette by baguette , one day at a time .
In the end , making baguettes at home is always a work in progress .
The more you bake , the more you learn , the more you hone your skills .
And trust me – no baguette you bake at home is ever a complete bust .
It may not be as light as you want , as crisp - crusted , as flavorful – but that 's why croutons and crostini were invented .
So , let 's dive in .
This is n't a classic baguette recipe ; it 's an easier - for - beginners , no - knead formula .
Well , ALMOST no-knead ; I find a minute or so in a stand mixer ( or under your hands ) does wonders for the baguette 's texture .
Enjoy !
Let 's start by measuring the dry ingredients into a bowl .
The key ingredient in any baguette is flour .
In this version , we use King Arthur Unbleached All - Purpose Flour - which is , in fact , the closest American flour to what a typical French baker would use for baguettes .
How do we know ?
Because France 's " godfather of bread , " the late Prof.
Raymond Calvel , chose KA in a blind " bakeoff " as replicating most closely his preferred French flour .
The flour / liquid ratio is important in this recipe .
If you measure flour by sprinkling it into your measuring cup , then gently sweeping off the excess , use 7 3/4 cups .
If you measure flour by dipping your cup into the canister , then sweeping off the excess , use 6 3/4 cups .
Most accurate of all ( and guaranteed to give you the best results ) , weigh the flour : you 'll need 33 ounces .
And , here 's another monkey wrench : flour absorbs moisture from the atmosphere .
This dough , made in the dead of winter , will be much stiffer than it is at the end of a long , hot , humid summer .
With that in mind , I 'd suggest increasing the flour to 34 or 35 ounces in summer , to avoid dough that 's unworkably sticky .
Note :
If you follow this recipe on our recipe site , you 'll notice it calls for 8 cups ( 34 ounces ) of flour .
That 's because Sue Gray , my longtime fellow test kitchen baker , and the author of this recipe , prefers a very slightly stiffer dough .
Go either way ; your choice .
Combine the flour with 1 tablespoon of regular salt ( or 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt ) ; and 1 tablespoon of instant yeast .
Put 3 cups ( 24 ounces ) of lukewarm water in a mixing bowl , and add the dry ingredients .
This is where the " almost no - knead " part comes in .
Rather than just stir the ingredients together , as most no - knead recipes ask you to do , I actually beat them together to make a rough , sticky dough ...
... like this ...
... then switch to the dough hook and knead very briefly , just 1 to 2 minutes .
STICKY but cohesive ...
... and look how the gluten has developed , just from that short knead .
Next , put the dough in a large , lightly greased bowl or bucket ; I 'm using a 6 - quart dough - rising bucket here .
Why did I use such a big bucket for this small amount of dough ?
Because within about 2 hours at room temperature , it 'll look like this .
Next , I 'm going to refrigerate the dough overnight .
This improves the baguette 's flavor .
Here 's what it looks like going into the fridge ; notice how close it is to the circular ridge in the bucket .
And the next morning - check out that same ridge in the bucket .
See how the dough has shrunk ?
That 's fine ; it reached its maximum height , fell , and as long as you leave it in the fridge it 'll remain fairly dormant – up to about 7 days , after which the yeast will start to lose its stuff .
Try to use all the dough within a week ; or plan to freeze some when it's at this point .
Next , grab a scant 1 pound of dough ( about 1/ 4 of the batch , 14 1/2 ounces ) out of the bucket .
It helps to oil or wet your hand first .
Look how the gluten has continued to develop overnight – nice !
Want to make two baguettes ?
Grab two pieces of dough .
A scale helps you assess your " eyeballing " accuracy skills .
Pretty close !
Place the dough on a very well floured surface , and shape it into a rough oval .
I 'm using our silicone mat here ; it makes cleanup easy .
Fold the dough in half the long way .
Press the edges together , using the heel of your hand .
Flatten it into an oval again ...
... fold ...
... and press the edges together again .
Notice how the dough has automatically lengthened itself from an oval to a preliminary baguette shape .
This fold / seal , fold / seal shaping method is classic , and it works ; if I skip it , and simply roll the baguette to size under my hands , the finished loaf does n't rise nearly as well .
The folding adds needed structure , particularly in this very slack ( wet ) dough .
Now it 's time to gently roll the dough under your cupped fingers to form the classic baguette shape : about 15 ” long , with tapered ends .
Put the baguettes on a parchment - lined ( or lightly greased ) baking sheet .
Or , if you 're using a pizza stone , simply place on a piece of parchment .
I did n't do a great job tapering these ends ... sigh .
Could be better , but I 'm not into fussing with dough endlessly for the sake of perfect appearance .
Let the baguette (s ) rise , covered , for about 90 minutes .
They should get pretty puffy .
Do n't worry if they spread outwards rather than up – they 'll ” pick up ” when they hit the oven .
Speaking of , towards the end of the rising time , preheat your oven to 450 °F .
Use a sharp knife to quickly , and assertively - but - gently make 3 or 4 diagonal slashes in the loaf .
Hold the knife at a 45° angle , rather than perpendicular .
The cuts should be fairly deep .
Your baguette (s ) will start to deflate .
Do n't panic !
Quickly spritz with warm water , and get them into that hot oven .
Notice how a deflating baguette responds to 450 °F heat !
Kind of flat ...
... quickly becomes nicely fat !
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes .
The loaves should be nicely browned ; actually , I pulled these out a bit prematurely ; they should be darker than this .
And see what I mean about those non-tapered ends ?
Oh well ...
Baguettes are always a work in progress for me .
Nice interior , though .
A good , crackly crust ...
... and trust me .
These taste great !
Perfect for sandwiches , or simply dipping in seasoned olive oil .

The former Prime Minister Tony Blair was told today he had " blood on his hands " by a bereaved father at a reception following a memorial service for those killed in Iraq .
Peter Brierley , whose son Lance Corporal Shaun Brierley , 28 , was killed in March 2003 , refused to shake Mr Blair 's proffered hand and said : " I 'm not shaking your hand , you 've got blood on it . "
The former prime minister was ushered away and afterwards Mr Brierley , from Batley , West Yorkshire , said : " I understand soldiers go to war and die but they have to go to war for a good reason and be properly equipped to fight . "

He added : " I believe Tony Blair is a war criminal .
I can't bear to be in the same room as him .
I can't believe he 's been allowed to come to this reception .
" I believe he 's got the blood of my son and all of the other men and women who died out there on his hands .
" It comes back to me every day , every time I see a coffin come off a plane ; it reminds me of what happened to Shaun . "
The reception at Guildhall , in London , was also attended by the Prince of Wales , the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince William .
The royals mingled with military personnel and their families and the young prince laughed and posed for photos with eager veterans .
Lance Corporal of Horse James Shaw , 28 , of the Household Cavalry in Windsor , was pleased to see Prince William again after training at the same base .

He said : " When we got here , we realised what a momentous occasion it was .
" We 've lost a couple of lads out there and it was nice to think of them . "
L/ Cpl Shaw , from Windsor , completed three tours of Iraq , returning for the final time in November 2007 .
He said : " You want to keep these people alive in your memory . "
The Prince , dressed in RAF flight lieutenant uniform number ones with medals and a garter sash , also met Spr Stephen Wilby , of 39 Engineer Regiment , based out of Waterbeach near Cambridge .
Spr Wilby , 24 , from Chorley , Lancashire , returned from his tour in Iraq in August last year .
He said : " I feel proud to be here today .
It was a nice tribute to those that are lost .
It was surreal to meet Prince William - it 's not every day you get to meet the future king . "
Addressing another group of veterans , William said : " I think what 's important about today is not only remembering the sacrifices of those who lost their lives or were injured but also paying tribute to the families of those soldiers who are still serving .
" Without them they could n't do the job that they do . "
Private Craig Fletcher , 22 , of the Royal Logistic Corps 2LSR , based out of Gutersloh , in Germany , originally from Liverpool , said : " We had a little laugh with him .
He had plenty of time for us .
" I see him as one of the boys as well as a prince .
It felt like we had a bit of banter . "
When a photo taken of Pt Fletcher , the Prince and his friends did not turn out right , the royal said That 's just me , I 'm just blurry " and happily posed for a second time .
The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall met other veterans at the reception and were pleased to meet a group of chefs .
Staff Sgt Steve Firth , 36 , of the 7 Para RHA from Doncaster , based in Colchester , spoke to the Prince about his culinary interests .
Staff Sgt Firth said : " The Prince talked to me about solar - powered cooking and the Duchess of Cornwall was telling me about how much of a foodie her son is . "
Also in his group was Corporal Chris Small , 37 , of 9 Para Squadron RE , based out of Colchester .
Cpl Small , of Woodbridge , Suffolk , said : " Today was touching , I lost two friends in Iraq and when the wife of one of my friends lit a candle during the service , it really hit me but it was a great tribute and it was everything I hoped for . "
Kellie Merritt , 40 , who flew from Canberra , Australia , with her son Jackson , 10 , and daughters India , six , and Jordie , 12 , attended the St Paul 's service to remember her husband , Australian Paul Pardoel , an RAF navigator in 47 Squadron .
After the service , she said : " Having travelled from Australia , the royal commemorative service was a dignified and fitting tribute to all who fell in Iraq .
" Attending St Paul 's today meant a huge amount to me and my children .
" It was a fitting memory of Paul and we hope for the stability for the Iraqi people . "
Suppose that the Federal government were to offer sizable loan guarantees for any and all " green energy " companies .
Any firm , including new entrants , would be eligible .
The government would do some cursory due diligence , only to establish that the company in question would actually spend the capital it raised on real projects colorably linked to green energy ( as opposed to , say , buying New Zealand dollars in a carry trade ) .
Would n't such a program constitute a stimulus to the economy ?
If sufficient leverage is allowed , it would lead in short order to a bunch of entrepreneurs founding companies on just a shoestring of equity and a whole lot of cheap , guaranteed debt .
Firms with even a small likelihood of success would constitute real options worth more than the sliver of private capital at risk , so arbitrageurs would rush to create them .
Such a program would be a pretty direct form of fiscal stimulus .
Although politicians and financiers enjoy pretending otherwise , contingent liabilities are still liabilities , and offering loan guarantees to all comers for risky projects is , ex ante , just a way of financing a government expenditure equivalent to the expected losses of the program .
We should n't be surprised that an oddly financed stimulus would function as a stimulus .
But note that if , by good fortune , the artificially spurred new firms do surprisingly well and very few guarantees are actually paid , that would n't eliminate the ex ante stimulus effect of the program .
It is not the actual transfer of Federal money that serves as the stimulus .
The stimulus comes only and precisely form the certainty the program provides to investors that capital spent will be repaid , with interest .
So , suppose that the government does nothing , but " the market " becomes certain ( correctly or not ) that green energy companies are a sure thing .
As long as the cost of capital to such firms falls sufficiently , precisely the same dynamic would take hold .
We 've just watched it happen , twice .
When capital became very cheap to internet firms , entrepreneurs understood ( and discussed quite openly ) that there was an attractive lottery on offer , so why not get in ?
During the structured credit bubble , the market became convinced that some classes of debt yielding more than the " risk - free " interest rate were certain to be repaid .
Entrepreneurs ( both speculative borrowers and financial engineers ) saw the arbitrage , and found ways of offering those classes of debt .
In both cases , if the market had been right , everyone would have been happy .
But when the market was wrong , it was someone else 's cost .
Many entrepreneurs walked away rich and happy .
Others lost , but only a small amount relative to what they'd have made if things worked out differently .
It was a good gamble for them ex ante .
Responding to Arnold Kling 's " recalculation theory " , Paul Krugman asks ( as he has asked many times )
why [ does n't ] , say , a housing boom — which requires shifting resources into housing — ... produce the same kind of unemployment as a housing bust that shifts resources out of housing .
A housing boom , any kind of boom , is attended by an increase in certainty .
Information is stimulus , confusion is contraction .
A bust occurs when the market is unsure of everything , when market participants perceive better risk - adjusted return in holding government securities ( or supply - inelastic commodities ) than in financing real investment .
Sectoral shifts per se have no clear implication with respect to variables like employment and output .
But " hangovers " do happen , because powerful booms are periods when market participants make consequential decisions with great swagger and confidence , and busts are when we learn that despite their certainty , they were wrong .
They are left not only impoverished and burdened by debt , but bereft of confidence in their ability to evaluate new opportunities .
The best way to avoid the hangover is not to err so terribly in the first place .
Easier said than done , perhaps , but that 's no reason to cop out .
We can build a better financial system , one in which degrees of certainty are attached and removed from economic propositions dexterously , rather than clinging like giddy leeches until a collapse .
Information is stimulus .
As markets become more informed , money will be created and lent into the economy as surely as if the government printed and spent it .
And stimulus is information , since governments do not spend randomly but do so in accordance with their own revealed certainties , which may or may not turn out to be wise .
Poorly chosen stimulus and asset price bubbles are covert twins — only the identities of the people making bad decisions are different .
Conversely good economic choices by governments can lead to outcomes as salutary as a healthy market .
( See this very nice post by Bryan Caplan , and the articles cited . )
Information is a behavioral attribute , not an attribute of the external phenomena to which it may ostensibly refer .
To say that an agent is informed means she behaves differently than an uninformed agent .
Her behavior is less random , more predictable .
To be informed does not imply ones information is accurate .
( In general , accuracy is unknowable , both ex ante and ex post . )
Information increases the volatility of outcomes , because it provokes larger and more concentrated bets than uncertain agents would take , creating large gains and losses depending on how adaptive the informed behavior turns out to be .
It is often better , as a behavioral matter , to be uninformed than to be poorly informed .
But we do not always have the option of remaining uninformed .
We can not afford to hedge all of our bets .
Whether via a great mis-recalculator in the sky or a political establishment largely captured by certain interests , new information will be manufactured .
( I think it probable that government stimulus will substitute for market - generated information in the near term , as chastened capital market participants are more conscious of the hazards of certainty than policymakers are . )
We will be spurred to take some actions and eschew others , and the structure of the economy will shift accordingly .
Let 's hope those choices are good , and do our best to help make them that way .

The Saltine Challenge
While on business at our New York offices a couple of weeks ago , I was introduced to a peculiar competition known as “ The Saltine Challenge ” .
Apparently this has been around for quite awhile but I ’d never heard of it .
In a nutshell , one must ingest 6 Saltine crackers in 60 seconds without the help of water or any other digestive lubricants .
The crackers must also be of the salted variety .
Seems quite easy … that ’s what I thought .
With a small crowd of onlookers , I tried and failed badly on the first attempt .
The second attempt was a failure as well .
Not even close .
I managed to get all 6 decently chewed , but there were still two full crackers worth of dough when the minute mark passed .
So I went back to Seattle thinking , as I was told , that less than 1 in 10 people can accomplish this .
Not wanting to give up , however , I sent out an all - office e-mail summoning Saltines from all corners of the building for use in further testing .
I administered the Challenge to four more people , and sure enough , everyone failed .
Before giving up , I decided to give it one more try using a special chunking strategy that my co-worker in New York Phil Berberian had mentioned in passing , and lo and behold , I did it !
Six down the hatch !
Just to see if this feat was repeatable , I tried three more times over the next three days and lowered my time in each trial .
Could seven be next ?
Absolutely .
After all , if six Saltines was a great bar trick in itself , seven would bring the house down .
Sure enough , I did seven on my first try yesterday .
And now a day later , I ’ve officially reached the addiction stage .
I ’ve already tried eight twice today and although I failed both times , 70 seconds was all it took to get everything down .
It ’s definitely within reach and I ’m not stopping until I achieve this dietary milestone .
Has anybody else tried this ?
Care to post your results ?
UPDATE : Chunking strategy revealed !
UPDATE # 2 : 8 Saltines accomplished !
My Quest To Analyze Every Man-Made Chemical In My Body

Turkish Lamb
Stew is a classic comforting food with a few ingredients .
Lamb pieces are browned and then combined with onion , pepper and tomato .
Flavored with spices , this one - pot stew makes a perfect winter weeknight dinner .
Today , our dinner was Turkish Lamb Stew served with our usual side dish , Rice Pilaf with Orzo .
How To Make Lamb Stew Turkish
Put lamb pieces in a pot , pour 1/ 3 cup water over them , cover it and cook it over low heat until it releases its water and then absorbs it back .
Add in olive oil and stir .
Sprinkle salt and other spices .
Put peppers first and stir it until they get tender , then add in onions and keep stirring .
After they all get tender , pour pureed tomatoes and stir once .
Cover it and cook for about 10 minutes more .
Finally , take it from fire and put the bay leaf on the top , cover it again .
Let it rest for some minutes .
The flavor of the bay leaf will spread into the dish during this time .
As I do n’t love a very strong flavor of bay in my dish , I use this method , but if you love it , you may put it into the pan with the spices .

Gee , for some reason , this story has n't managed to make it out of the local news and into the national headlines :
CUYAHOGA FALLS , Ohio – Following a pipe bomb explosion Monday night , police and federal law enforcement officials are trying to figure why a Center Avenue man turned his apartment into a bomb factory .
Police said no charges have been filed against Mark Campano , 56 .
Police found 30 completed pipe bombs in his apartment along with components to make more , plus 17 guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition .
Campano is in an Akron hospital with injuries received when one of the bombs exploded .
As police and federal authorities puzzle over Campano 's past and what he planned to do with the bombs , a former neighbor said Campano often railed against the government .
Barbara Vachon lived next door to Campano at the Center Park Place Apartments for several years and said he was a big reason she moved .
" He was always trying to get me and another neighbor to listen to anti-government tapes and watch anti-government videos , " said Vachon .
" I would never watch them .
He was some kind of radical , and he did n't believe in the government . "
She said there were other warnings .
" There were a few times I heard minor explosions from outside the apartment building , and he would scream that he had hurt himself , " she said .
" I never knew what he was up to . "
Vachon said Campano seemed to be most active at night .
" There was a steady stream of creepy visitors going in and out of his apartment , " she said .
The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms is also investigating the case .
" All the farmers we have asked just can't believe it when we show them .
We looked on the internet and the last recorded tiny egg found inside a bigger egg was in Japan . "
Over - the - counter dental whitening products are drawing scrutiny , as rival vendors carpet - bomb the web with graphic advertisements promising cheap and effective treatment for discolored teeth .
The ads have been inescapable in recent months , appearing on major U.S. web sites and search engines including Google , Yahoo , MSN and Microsoft 's Bing at a time when Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz has publicly offered investors a chagrined promise to do better screening out low - quality ads .
Now fraud busters are zeroing in on at least one tooth - whitening vendor – Cyprus - based Farend Services , doing business in the United States as Dazzle Smile and Dazzle Smile Pro – in what could be the first shot across the bow for an industry that 's spawned a web - wide advertising eyesore to rival the X10 wireless video cam , Viagra and penis - enlargement products .
In a little - noticed action last month , Utah ’s consumer - protection division cited Farend ( .pdf ) for trapping customers with fine print on a network of fake blogs that signs them up for an expensive subscription to the tooth - whitening products rather than the low - cost or free single unit they think they ’re ordering .
" After realizing I was scammed , I tried four times to cancel , two times through live chat ... and two times by phone , a free trial offer to Dazzle Smile and was told that the auto - ship subscription was canceled ; however the free trial subscription could not be canceled [ and ] to my surprise , I also found out that they auto - enrolled me in another service , World Club Fitness , " reads a complaint to the Oklahoma attorney general , one of thousands related to online tooth - whitener scams reported recently to law enforcement and consumer - rights agencies .
Attempts to reach the company for comment were unsuccessful .
The citation is the first indication of a backlash against tooth whiteners and the companies that market them , fueled by the intensity of recent online ad campaigns touting several competing products .
In a sign of widening interest , the Better Business Bureau this month joined the fray , opening an investigation into multiple tooth - whitening brands , including Dazzle Smile .
" The use of negative marketing options [ that offer ] a free trial and then you get billed every month over and over again , is being used to sell so many products online right now , and it 's just a scourge of the internet , " said Alison Southwick , spokeswoman for the Better Business Bureau .
" People are getting ripped off across the country for any number of products [ including these tooth - whitening products ] when they think they are getting a free trial . "
Despite the deluge of complaints over deceptive sales practices , some home tooth - whitening products may be safe and effective , according to medical experts .
The FDA has approved tooth - whitening pastes and lozenges with the active ingredient carbamide peroxide ( first used during World War I as an anti-inflammatory antiseptic ) , a widely used substance that works by oxidizing stains on teeth .
The American Dental Association agrees that carbamide peroxide can work as advertised , when properly applied by professionals .
" Data accumulated over the last 20 years indicate no significant , long - term oral or systemic health risks associated with professional at - home tooth - bleaching materials containing 10 percent carbamide peroxide ( 3.5 percent H 2 O 2 ) , " the group said in a statement ; but the ADA cautioned that " these data were collected from studies conducted by dental professionals , and there is no safety evidence on bleaching materials that do not involve dental professionals , regardless of H 2 O 2 concentration or application venue . "
Be that as it may , marketing practices in the industry are anything but stainless .
One tooth - whitening vendor contacted by Wired.com admitted to engaging in deceptive marketing practices in the past , but claimed that it has since stopped .
Dazzlesmile ( not related to Farend or Farend 's Dazzle Smile brand ) is a division of Optimal Health Science and sells FDA - approved tooth - whitening paste and lozenges with carbamide peroxide .
Epic Advertising pairs two teeth whiteners in a single ad , according to Dazzle Smile CEO Roger LeFevre , a former client .
In an interview with Wired.com , Dazzlesmile CEO Roger LeFevre said his company was duped by its outside marketing agency , New York - based Epic Advertising , which he claims engineered the deceptive language used in its offers without his knowledge .
( Epic claims it " is not involved in any deceptive creative development including any trademark infringement issues Mr. LeFevre has with another advertiser . " )
LeFevre said Epic currently represents Farend , and that he ended his relationship with Epic when his customer - service department began fielding irate calls over unauthorized credit card charges .
( Epic claims that he " asked for additional traffic . " )
" Epic is the one that creates all the ads , their own creative people create all the landing pages , and companies like ours just get led down the primrose path , " he said .
Dazzlesmile and Optimal Health Science on Tuesday filed a trademark - infringement cease - and - desist letter against Farend and Epic , targeting Farend 's dazzlesmilepro.com web site .
" The legitimate Dazzlesmile has wrongfully been the subject of Better Business Bureau inquires , and has been contacted by the consumer - protection division and state attorneys general of Utah , Delaware , Vermont and Oklahoma about the deceptively similar and false advertising of www.dazzlesmilepro.com, " the company wrote in a press release announcing the action .
Epic chief marketing officer Michael Sprouse confirmed that the company represents Farend , and that Dazzlesmile is a former client .
He denied that Epic facilitates fraud for any of its current or former customers , including Farend and Dazzlesmile , adding that Epic enforces strict anti-fraud standards .
Nevertheless , he agreed fraud is a big problem in the industry in general .
" This is an area that for the betterment of all online marketing needs to be talked about and cleaned up , " he said .
Sprouse said he believed that Farend may have run into trouble with one or more different networks running its ads , and that the networks may have been responsible for the fine print , leaving customers confused and leading to complaints about unauthorized credit card charges .
" Advertisers that utilize [ our promotional ] networks do n't only utilize Epic , they utilize several networks , " said Sprouse .
" If either of these advertisers or both are running through other networks , there is a chance that through those other networks , if they do n't have the same standards that we do , that there will be the fine - print issues that you [ mentioned ] . "
Meanwhile the fraud allegations could further embarrass reputable sites like Yahoo and Microsoft , for whom such ads serve as a daily reminder of the economic challenges facing online publishers today .
A Yahoo representative declined to comment specifically about Farend 's ads , but said the company is aware of the general problem of low - quality ads appearing on its sites and has taken steps to address it .
" We are making more - stringent editorial decisions about display - ad content and have several categories that we have removed , " this person said .
Microsoft also declined to comment on Farend 's ads .
" While we can't comment on the specifics of this case , Microsoft is committed to protecting the advertisers on its network and aggressively combating online ad fraud . "
The question is : Can they do both ?

Madison —
Advocates for medical marijuana say they have their best chance yet of passing a bill through the state Legislature .
Democratic Gov. Jim
Doyle said recently he supports the idea , and the lead co-sponsors of the bill on Monday announced committee hearings would be held Dec. 15 on the bill .
" I do think the chances are pretty good for this to become law , " said Sen. Jon Erpenbach ( D - Waunakee ) , the chief Senate author of the bill .
Erpenbach said Senate Majority Leader Russ Decker ( D - Weston ) was " open to the idea " of scheduling a floor vote on the bill .
Rep. Mark Pocan ( D - Madison ) , the lead Assembly sponsor , said he was confident the Assembly Public Health Committee would approve the bill and forward it to the full Assembly .
Advocates for medical marijuana have pushed their efforts for years but have made little headway in the Capitol .
Gary Storck , who has congenital glaucoma , said Wisconsin 's laws must change to protect those with cancer , AIDS and other serious illnesses .
" We 're not criminals .
We 're people just trying to get on with our lives , " said Storck , a board member of the group Is My Medicine Legal Yet ?
The bill would allow people with debilitating medical conditions to grow up to 12 marijuana plants or buy up to three ounces of marijuana from new , non-profit " compassion centers . "
Patients would have to register with the state Department of Health Services .
If patients bought marijuana on the street , they could use their medical condition as a defense at trial .
Patients would not be allowed to drive or operate heavy machinery while under the influence of marijuana .
They could not smoke it in schools , parks and many other public places .
The bill would cover people with cancer , AIDS , Crohn 's disease , Hepatitis C , Alzheimer 's disease , post - traumatic stress disorder and other maladies .
Jason Glaspie of Madison said he welcomed the bill because marijuana was crucial to managing his pain as he went through chemotherapy and radiation for a cancerous brain tumor .
" I personally feel there 's no reason you can have morphine or something that has huge side effects and you can't grow a plant in your garden that makes you feel better , " he said .
Erpenbach and Pocan said they saw several signs of improving conditions for their bill .
They noted President Barack Obama 's administration has taken a hands - off approach in dealing with states that have medical marijuana laws .
In the past , federal authorities have conducted raids on dispensaries in California and other states because marijuana is illegal under federal law .
Last week , the American Medical Association called for more research of medical marijuana , which proponents said was another sign of support for medical marijuana laws .
Erpenbach said the Assembly and Senate health committees would consider the bills together at the Dec. 15 meeting .
" It 's a combined hearing - not a joint hearing , but a combined hearing , " he said .
Thomas Jefferson ’s tombstone | Jefferson ’s epitaph and tombstone design – original
A friend asked about the linkage between American government and education : the United States is an Enlightenment country certainly , and we definitely make claims to be a meritocracy .
But as any reader of this blog knows , Enlightenment came at the expense of ancient and medieval thought , and the sciences in an almost wholly practical sense can be advanced by commercialism .
It is n’t clear that we should have schools , and in fact , education in the law itself – knowledge of how republicanism itself is supposed to work – is left an almost private matter .
The structure of our government and the political science it rests on are products of Enlightenment ; but what of actually trying to make an enlightened people ?
Jefferson ’s thought depends on an implicit linkage between freedom and knowledge , with a sentiment not unlike that we get from some more obnoxious atheists today ( Jefferson ’s phrase : “ monkish ignorance ” ) .
His epitaph , in its simplicity , accentuates the positive part of this linkage :
Here was buried
Thomas Jefferson
Author of the Declaration of American Independence
of the Statute of Virginia for religious freedom
& Father of the University of Virginia
Right away , you can see that “ Author ” and “ Father ” are different roles , two different types of creation .
An author looks to be a creator whose work is fixed and final ; America declared independence , Virginia established religious freedom .
A Father creates also , but there is nothing fixed or final about that enterprise .
There ’s a progression in the list – we move from declaring independence , to establishing our own law for freedom ’s sake , to exploring and perhaps knowledge itself : the New World is perpetually new .
Both freedom and knowledge are universal in that they benefit all men , and that is maybe how “ Author ” and “ Father ” complement each other : nowadays , we only think of right negatively , what government does n’t restrict .
A “ right ” for us involves the right to become an alcoholic or curse loudly at public officials .
But the truth is that one is only free inasmuch as one can act with knowledge : if you act without knowledge , you usually find some way of hurting yourself only , and it is n’t clear that you have exercised freedom as much as found restraint .
“ American Independence ” and “ religious freedom ” in Virginia are by themselves pointing to universality , but it looks like “ university ” is most emphatic on that matter .
A futex overview and update
LWN .net needs you !
Without subscribers , LWN would simply not exist .
Please consider signing up for a subscription and helping to keep LWN publishing
The futex [ PDF ] mechanism , introduced in 2.5.7 by Rusty Russell , Hubertus Franke , and Mathew Kirkwood , is a fast , lightweight kernel - assisted locking primitive for user - space applications .
It provides for very fast uncontended lock acquisition and release .
The futex state is stored in a user - space variable ( an unsigned 32 - bit integer on all platforms ) .
Atomic operations are used in order to change the state of the futex in the uncontended case without the overhead of a syscall .
In the contended cases , the kernel is invoked to put tasks to sleep and wake them up .
Futexes are the basis of several mutual exclusion constructs commonly used in threaded programming .
These include pthread mutexes , condvars , semaphores , rwlocks , and barriers .
They have been through a lot of reconstructive and cosmetic surgery over the last several years , and are now more efficient , more functional , and better documented than ever before .
Overview
While few application developers will use futexes directly , a cursory knowledge of how to do so is necessary to appreciate the improvements presented a bit later .
By way of a simple example , futexes can be used to store the state of a lock and provide a kernel waitqueue for tasks blocking on the lock .
To minimize syscall overhead , this state should allow for atomic lock acquisition when the lock is uncontended .
The state could be defined as :
unlocked locked
In order to acquire the lock , an atomic test - and - set instruction ( such as cmpxchg ( ) ) can be used to test for 0 and set to 1 .
In this case , the locking thread acquires the lock without involving the kernel ( and the kernel has no knowledge that this futex exists ) .
When the next thread attempts to acquire the lock , the test for zero will fail and the kernel needs to be involved .
The blocking thread can then use the futex ( ) system call with the FUTEX_WAIT opcode to put itself to sleep on the futex , passing the address of the futex state variable as an argument .
To release the lock , the owner changes the lock state to zero ( unlocked ) and issues the FUTEX_WAKE opcode , which will wake the blocked thread to return to user space and try to acquire the lock ( as described above ) .
This is a an obviously trivial example with lots of room for optimization .
Ulrich Drepper 's " Futexes are Tricky " [ PDF ] is still the undisputed reference for using futexes to build locking primitives such as mutexes .
It explores the many race conditions involved with using futexes as well as optimizations to improve on the example given here .
When the user threads call into the kernel with the futex ( ) system call , they pass the address of the futex state ( uaddr ) , the opcode to perform ( op ) , and various other arguments .
The uaddr is used by the kernel to generate a unique " futex_key " to reference the futex .
When a thread requests to block on a futex , as with FUTEX_WAIT , a " futex_q " is created and queued in the " futex_queues " hash table .
There is one futex_q for every task blocked on a futex , possibly many futex_q 's per futex .
The futex_queues themselves ( the hash table lists , not the " futex_q 's " ) are shared among futexes , since multiple futex_keys will hash to the same queue .
These relationships are illustrated below :
In most cases , there is no policy defining how the user space state variable is to be used ( despite what the futex man pages may or may not say ) .
The application ( or a library such as glibc ) uses this value to define the state of the locking construct being implemented .
This can be as simple as a boolean variable ( as in the example above ) , however optimized implementations and other locking mechanisms require more complex state values .
In addition to the simple FUTEX_WAIT and FUTEX_WAKE operations , the kernel also manages special operations that require more knowledge of the locking construct 's state than can be had in user space , most notably the priority inheritance ( PI ) chains and robust lists .
PI and robust futexes are exceptions to the user - defined - policy rule regarding the state variable .
Their state depends not only on the locked state of the mutex , but also on the identity of the owner and whether or not there are waiters .
As such , the futex value is defined as the thread identifier ( TID ) of the owner and a bit to indicate pending owners .
This policy still allows for user space atomic operations to avoid calling into the kernel in the uncontended case .
Improvements
Futexes have seen numerous improvements from a handful of developers since their debut appearance in 2.5.7 .
Some notable improvements include priority based wake - up for real - time tasks ( by Pierre Peiffer ) and robust and PI futexes ( by Ingo Molnar and Thomas Gleixner ) .
These latter features have been in use for some time and have been adequately covered here on LWN .
net as well as in the excellent discussions on the kernel mailing list .
Your author 's foray into futexes picks up here , about two and a half years ago .
Aside from several fixes to address rare corner cases and race conditions , the futex code has seen several functional and performance improvements since those earlier contributions .
Significant effort went into reducing futex overhead .
Eric Dumazet introduced private futexes as an optimization for PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE pthread mutexes .
Private futexes can only be used by threads of the same process .
They are distinguishable from each other simply by their virtual address , while shared futexes have different virtual addresses in each process , requiring the kernel to lookup their physical address for unique identification .
This optimization eliminates the use of the mmap_sem semaphore for private futexes , reducing system - wide contention .
It also eliminates the atomic operations used in reference counting for private futexes , resulting in less cache - line bouncing on SMP machines .
Glibc now uses private futexes by default .
Peter Ziljstra further reduced the futex dependency on mmap_sem by using get_user_pages_fast ( ) in the fast paths , making use of get_user_pages ( ) , and pushing the mmap_sem locks down tightly around the slow paths ( September 2008 ) .
These changes had the added benefit of removing much of the virtual memory related logic from kernel / futex .c , simplifying the code considerably .
Due to their dependence on user space addresses , futexes are burdened with several possible fault points .
Holding mmap_sem complicated the fault logic since it had to be released prior to calling get_user ( ) .
With mmap_sem usage reduced , your author greatly simplified the fault logic ( March 2009 ) , resulting in far more legible code .
Bitset conditional wakeup was added by Thomas Gleixner ( February 2008 ) in order to enable optimized rwlock implementations in glibc .
FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET
and FUTEX_WAKE_BITSET
allow the user to specify a bitmask which limits the woken tasks to those which specified the same bitset ( or a superset , such as FUTEX_BITSET_MATCH_ANY ) at wait time .
Since the introduction of PI futexes , the glibc condvar implementation of pthread_cond_broadcast ( ) ( with a PI mutex ) has been forced to wake all waiters , rather than take advantage of FUTEX_REQUEUE , due to the lack of support for requeueing to PI futexes .
This leads to a wake - up storm as all the waiters race back to user space to contend for the lock .
It also fails to ensure that the highest priority task acquires the lock first .
Recent kernels ( 2.6.31 - rt* and 2.6.32 - rc* ) now have your author 's FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PI patches ( April 2009 ) which provide the kernel - side support for requeueing waiters from a non -PI futex to a PI futex .
With glibc patches in the works by Dinakar Guniguntala , real - time applications will soon be able to use pthread condition variables with guaranteed wake - up order and fewer overall wake - ups .
Now What ?
While there are several items that futex developers may consider in the future , they are hopeful that kernel / futex.c and all its brain - bending , liver - killing insanity can be put to rest for at least a little while .
However , since no article is complete without a list of next steps , the following items may receive some attention in the future :
Man pages :
The current man pages do not include some of the new futex operations .
They suggest a policy for the value of the futex which has led to some confusion regarding usage of futexes .
Worst of all , the user space futex ( ) definition has been removed from / usr / include / linux / futex.h , rendering the man pages not only incomplete , but also inaccurate .
Users of futexes must use the syscall interface directly .
Adaptive futexes :
It is possible that some of the scheduling overhead of futexes can be reduced by some optional amount of spinning prior to going to sleep in the kernel .
However , as futexes expose their state to user space , this spinning can also be done in user space , as is done with adaptive mutexes in glibc now , albeit without the knowledge of whether the owner is running , so spinning is reduced to a simple maximum - retries loop .
Interruptible futexes :
There is some interest in interruptible blocking lock operations from large proprietary software projects .
Futex operations currently restart themselves in the event of a signal , rather than returning - EINTR to user space .
Futexes could be flagged with FUTEX_INTERRUPTIBLE which would be checked on signal - induced wakeup to determine if the syscall should be restarted or if - ECANCELED should be returned to user space .
Exposing such a feature in the pthread locking primitives would involve non-POSIX compliant changes to the pthread library , but this is not without precedent .
Scalability enhancements :
There has been some discussion on LKML regarding private as well as NUMA - optimized hash tables .
The futex hash table is shared across all processes and is protected by spinlocks which can lead to real overhead , especially on large systems .
This overhead is not serving any useful purpose if these systems are partitioned on NUMA nodes , or even for processes that use private futexes exclusively .
Futex test suite :
Your author has been compiling a list of requirements for an exhaustive test suite to validate futex functionality .
This test suite would serve as a regression suite for future development .
The many corner cases and misuse cases possible with futexes complicate the test suite and present a challenge to its design .

Part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were musicians , poets , and artists , and zoologists , and historians .
They also happened to be the best computer scientists in the world .
But if it had n’t been computer science , these people would have been doing amazing things in other fields .
We all brought to this a sort of " liberal arts " air , an attitude that we wanted to pull the best that we saw into this field .
You do n’t get that if you are very narrow .

The world 's smallest working train set ... it 's the size of a fingernail
Measuring a tiny eighth of an inch by quarter of an inch , this carefully crafted piece of engineering is the world 's smallest working train model .
The five - carriage train , which is 35,200 times smaller than a real train , nips around an oval route even taking in a ride through a tunnel on its three - quarter inch track .
Created by New Jersey train enthusiast David Smith , the miniscule model was built using nothing more fancy than a craft knife and a steady hand .

Part of 55 - year - old David 's larger model train set at his home in Tom 's River , the tiny locomotive was completed two months ago .
' This model train set is going to be part of the larger train set I have at home , ' says David .
' I am creating a fictitious village called James River Branch and this model train is going to be placed inside the model shop I am building as part of the re-creation .
' It is going to be a model train village inside a model , so it is very post - modern . '
Pocket power :
The motor powering the model can be bought in any hobby store in America
New Jersey model train enthusiast David Smith is the man behind the tiny treasure
Powered by a standard two - inch - long rotating motor head and carved out of moldable plastic , the model train cost David just over £ 6 to make .
' The motor can be bought from K - Mart or any hobby store in America , ' says David .
' There is a slight optical illusion with this train model though .
' There are no tracks and the train and carriages are carved out of plastic stuck atop the motor .
' This gives the impression of a train following the oval track .
' But , still , it is impressively small . '
With James River Branch still under construction , David has yet to install the tiny model train inside the model shop in his model village .
' To get a sense of scale you have to remember that the River Branch project is being built to the scale of 1 - 220 , ' says David .
' It has taken up two - and - a half - years of my life and is going to be very impressive once it is finished . '
Cheap trick :
The model , including the pictured motor , cost Smith just over £ 6 to make

We all want freedom for ourselves , but many people have doubts about the way others might use their own freedom .
Under these conditions , the state is there to help .
Get enough people to favor enough restriction , and the state is good to go , administering every aspect life from its smallest to its largest detail .
Every day presents more cases , but the most recent case is stunning .
It turns out that 97 % of people polled support a universal ban on texting while driving .
Half of those surveyed say that the penalty should be as severe as that for drunk driving .
Among these , how many do you suppose do text and drive but do n't want to admit it to the pollster ?
Probably plenty .
And yet I could n't find a single online defense of the practice anywhere on the web .
The truth is that it is not necessarily unsafe to text behind the wheel .
It all depends on the situation .
If you are in a traffic jam , and are late to an appointment , the ability to text can be a lifesaver .
Or if there are no cars around , you might be able to risk it .
On the other hand , it would probably be a mistake to attempt this doing 80 mph around slower traffic on a freeway .
How can we know the difference between when it is safe and when it is not ?
The principle applied on American roads is that the driver himself makes that decision .
If this principle did n't make sense , there would be no way that the roads themselves could work at all .
Think of this the next time you are in a big city zooming around curves and between lanes along with thousands of others , doing top speeds .
Here we have 4,000 - pound hunks of steel barreling down the road without aids other than a dotted yellow line on the road .
These are real - life death machines in which one wrong move could cause a 100 - car pileup and mass death .
We do it anyway .
What 's remarkable is not that there are so many wrecks .
The miracle is that it works at all and that , for the most part , people get to where they are going .
And consider too the demographic behind the car : old , young , abled , disabled , experienced , inexperienced .
Some people have a facility for driving and others do not .
Some people have spatial agility and others do not .
How does it all work ?
Do n't tell me that it is due to central planning and the police .
The police are n't driving every car and controlling every wheel .
Our human volition on the road and the decisions we make that affect other drivers are nearly 100 % our own .
And yet it works .
Why ?
The reason is that it is not in anyone 's interest to get in a crash .
It is in everyone 's interest to get to where one is going in one piece and to do it efficiently .
Roll together tens of thousands of people with the same broad goal and you get spontaneous cooperation .
Something that people normally think could not work does in fact work .
Looked at from that angle , the orderliness we see on the roads is a general expression of the capacity for human society to work in the context of self - interested individualism .
Now think of this poll showing a widespread opposition to texting while driving .
I submit that you would get similar results from a poll that asked people about the right to drive :
Do you support or oppose the right of everyone to own 4,000 - pound heaps of steel and control them completely and autonomously at top speeds in the midst of thousands of other citizens whose lives could be in danger with so much as a slight flick of the wrist to the right or left ?
That question could elicit nearly 100 % negative results .
We generally trust our capacity to manage ourselves but we do not trust the capacity of others to manage themselves .
And we surely do n't believe that society can generally function well under conditions of freedom .
Even though we live in the midst of spontaneous order and use its brilliance every day ( grocery store , the world wide web , restaurants , housing developments ) , we do n't really understand it .
Or how about this one :
Do you support the right of anyone over a certain age to buy and consume as much hard liquor as he wants , even to the point of drinking himself into a life - threatening stupor , neglecting the kids , wrecking family life , and killing brain cells that can not be replaced ?
Probably most people would say no .
And yet this is precisely the reasoning behind Prohibition , which most people today regard as a terrible error .
Today , we supposedly realize that the social cost of the right to drink hard liquor was greater than the supposed benefit we receive from enforcing prohibition .
So it is with texting and driving .
There are times when it is safe .
There are times when it is not safe .
The only ones who can really know the difference are the people behind the wheel .
These people already enjoy the freedom to talk to passengers , to fiddle with their stereo , to drive following an exhausting jog , to drive while distracted with anxieties over work and marriage , to pray or sing in the car , and do many other things that seem like a distraction from the goal at hand .
Somehow it all works , and there is a lesson here .
You can count on more order to emerge from trusting freedom than you get from attempting to micromanage people 's lives .
Now , the libertarians among us might point out that these roads are publicly owned and that this is the core source of the problem .
Under privately owned roads , there might be intense restrictions on what you can and cannot do and these might be part of the contract you make with the road owner .
The market would take care of the rest .
If an owner were too restrictive , drivers would take other routes .
If they are too lenient , their insurance premiums would rise and they would pay too high a price .
The resultant rules of the road would be a result of this careful calibration , tested constantly by the forces of supply and demand .
Under the existing rules of private roads , we see no evidence of a crackdown on texting .
Maybe it would come in the future , but at least there would be a market test .
When a rule fails in private markets , the rule is changed .
But it is different with government .
No matter how preposterous the rule , it stays and stays , regardless of whether it works to accomplish its end .
And there can be no question that a crackdown on texting is coming .
Obama has already banned texting while driving for federal workers .
A bill that would deny federal funds to states is flying through the Senate .
Look for a nationwide ban in the coming months .
The ban says , You do n't know what is good for you so you must be forced to do what the government thinks is good for you .
The ban gets support because people generally think that while they are responsible and good at calibrating what is safe and unsafe , others are not .
Through this method , all freedoms could be abolished .
It 's a bad way to form the rules of a society .
Researchers said Thursday they uncovered evidence that a Canadian tobacco company destroyed scientific data it had decades ago showing that cigarettes were addictive and caused cancer .
The three Canadian researchers published copies of 60 internal documents , shredded by Imperial Tobacco Canada in 1992 to avoid embarrassment or liability , in the Canadian Medical Association Journal .
The copies were uncovered in the files of parent firm British American Tobacco subsidiary .
The documents detail evidence from scientific reviews prepared by British American Tobacco 's researchers , as well as dozens of original research studies between 1967 and 1984 , such as the examination of the biological activity and carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke .
They describe research on cigarette modifications and toxic emissions , including how consumers adapted their smoking behavior to these modifications , and depict a comprehensive research program on the pharmacology of nicotine and its central role in smoking behaviour .
Some studies found second - hand smoke on rats was dangerous .
Other research cast doubt on the comparative benefits of low - tar cigarettes , as smokers simply compensated by inhaling more intensely .
All the while , Imperial Tobacco Canada executives had denied that smoking was addictive or a health hazard , even testifying such at a parliamentary committee hearing in 1987 .
The records are now likely to be used in lawsuits by three Canadian provinces seeking billions of dollars from tobacco firms for smoking - related health care costs .

The spectacles are due to go on sale in Japan in 2010 Spectacles that can provide subtitles have been created by hi-tech firm NEC .
Resembling glasses but lacking lenses , the headset uses a tiny projector to display images on a user 's retina .
NEC said it planned a version that used real - time translation to provide subtitles for a conversation between people lacking a common language .
The firm said the gadget , dubbed Tele Scouter , was intended for sales people or employees dealing with inquiries from customers .
NEC said the Tele Scouter was intended to be a business tool that could aid sales staff who would have information about a client 's buying history beamed into their eye during a conversation .
But , it said , it could also be put to a more exotic use as a translation aid .
In this scenario the microphone on the headset picks up the voices of both people in a conversation , pipes it through translation software and voice - to - text systems and then sends the translation back to the headset .

At the same time as a user hears a translation , they would also get text subtitles beamed onto the retina .
" You can keep the conversation flowing , " NEC spokesman Takayuki Omino told AFP at a Tokyo trade show where the device was unveiled .
Mr Omino said the system could also be used for confidential talks that would be compromised by the use of a human translator .
NEC said the Tele Scouter would be launched in Japan in November , 2010 but would initially lack the translation feature .
A version that can provide subtitles would follow in 2011 , it said .
When it goes on sale , a batch of 30 headsets will cost about 7.5 m yen ( £ 50,000 ) .
The cost does not include the price of the translation tools and software .

Peace Over War
San Juan Island is well known for splendid vistas , saltwater shore , quiet woodlands , orca whales and one of the last remaining native prairies in the Puget Sound / Northern Straits region .
But it was also here in 1859 that the United States and Great Britain nearly went to war over possession of the island , the crisis ignited by the death of a pig .
For the Pakistani army , success in South Waziristan would almost certainly need follow - up operations elsewhere
By M Ilyas Khan
BBC News , Islamabad
The Pakistani army 's push against Taliban and al - Qaeda militants in the Mehsud tribal stronghold of South Waziristan has one paramount objective - to destroy the source of militant attacks in the country .
The ground offensive that it launched in the region on Saturday is viewed by analysts as its most serious attempt so far to liquidate the militant network there .
This conclusion is based on the tactics the army has adopted so far .
Unlike previous operations which were invariably half - hearted , haphazard and abortive , it took its time to plan a thorough operation this time .
Stronghold
The ground offensive comes after a four - month siege of Mehsud lands , during which the civilian population was encouraged to leave the area and the mobility of the militants was restricted .
The army wants to encourage ' soft ' fighters to leave the region
The army also used this time to persuade militant networks in the adjoining Wazir tribal areas of North and South Waziristan to stay out of the conflict .
The army has now started to advance on two axis points from the south - east and south - west with a view to herd the militants into their Makin - Ladha stronghold for a final battle .
At the same time , the army is trying to isolate hardcore militants from the larger body of insurgents and thereby reduce the leadership of the resistance to a bare minimum .
A policy statement of the army says the prime target of the operation would be the ethnic Uzbek militants from Central Asia , followed by foreign fighters from regions like the Middle East and North Africa .
The elimination of local fighters who refuse to lay down arms has been set as the army 's last priority .
Militants ' options
At a news briefing on Monday , the army 's chief spokesman said there were between 8,000 to 10,000 fighters in the area , out of whom around 1,000 were foreigners .
The role of the Mehsud fighters in Afghanistan has been marginal - they have exclusively focused on raids and bomb attacks in Pakistani territory
He further said that not all Mehsud fighters were equally motivated , as many had joined the militants ' ranks under duress or due to outright intimidation .
The message is obviously designed to encourage the " soft " fighters to desert their positions .
The hardcore militants are left with two options .
They can either fight to the bitter end , or they can slip out of the area to fight another day .
For the moment , they have set up entrenched positions along both lines of the army 's advance .
Analysts expect the fighting to be fierce , but few believe the militants will hold out for long against a superior ground force and precision bombing from the air .
The general view is that they will ultimately abandon their positions and resort to guerrilla attacks , as the militants in Swat have done .
But unlike Swat and other parts of Malakand , the militants in South Waziristan will have to battle in a more inhospitable terrain , devoid of water and forest cover .
A large number of them , including the foreigners , are likely to slip out of the area .
The easiest route for them would be to head south across the Gomal pass and disappear into the vast wastelands of Balochistan .
' Sleeper cells '
Others could slip past the adjacent areas of Lakki and Bannu to end up at Mir Ali , where Arab fighters have long kept a base , or further north into Orakzai region where the Mehsud militants have their own bases .
The authorities want to stop the Taliban 's bombing campaign Some Western observers even fear that al - Qaeda 's trained bomb - makers in the area may end up in the worldwide sleeper cells of militants and enhance their ability to carry out militant attacks in the West .
For the Pakistani army , a success in South Waziristan would almost certainly create the need for a quick follow - up operation in the Orakzai - Darra Adamkhel region to prevent reprisal attacks on Peshawar , the capital of North West Frontier Province .
It is still not clear how the government plans to handle the militants that slip into Balochistan .
It is also not clear what it intends to do with the North Waziristan - based Haqqani network and its affiliated groups in the region .
Defence analysts in Pakistan have long seen the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group in North Waziristan , the Mullah Nazir group in the Wazir area of South Waziristan and the Baitullah ( now Hakimullah ) group in the Mehsud area of South Waziristan as offshoots of the al - Qaeda affiliated Haqqani network .
The present operation is confined to the Mehsud area , which is less than one - quarter of the wider Waziristan region and is tucked further away from the border with Afghanistan .
The role of the Mehsud fighters in Afghanistan has been marginal - they have exclusively focused on raids and bomb attacks in Pakistani territory .
By comparison , the other groups of Haqqani network have signed more or less enduring peace deals with the Pakistani army and are heavily involved in operations inside Afghanistan .
There is an understanding here that these groups have agreed not to interfere in the army 's campaign against the Mehsud Taliban .
But what is the quid pro quo and are the Americans on board ?
Apparently , the question of the Haqqani network 's future is more important for the Americans and Nato forces in Afghanistan than the fate of Mehsud fighters .

‘‘I am the leader of the Liberal Party , ’’ Mr Turnbull told reporters at a media conference in Canberra .
‘‘ I was confirmed as such .... just 24 hours ago . ’’
Mr Abbott told reporters it was not a leadership issue but a policy issue .
" This is an argument about policy .
It is not an argument about the leadership , " he said .
He said that he and Senator Minchin had seen Mr Turnbull in his office after question time this afternoon to ask him to reconsider his policy on emissions trading and delay a vote on Labor ’s emissions trading scheme until next year , after the Copenhagen summit .
They had proposed the matter be put to a Senate inquiry but Mr Turnbull had said he was not prepared to reconsider .
" I indicated to Malcolm at the end of the conversation that given his position I could no longer support the opposition ’s policy and therefore could no longer be in the shadow cabinet , ’’ he said .
He had no option but " to take the honourable course " .
" It was a very civil , rational and courteous conversation conducted in a spirit of mutual respect , " said Mr Abbott .
He said in the light of the fact he could no longer support his leader 's policy he had no option but to resign .
" It is a very difficult decision for me , " he said .
" I have always been a very loyal party man . "
Asked if he was going to challenge for the leadership , Mr Abbott replied : ‘‘ I am not going to talk about discussions I might have had with colleagues .
‘‘ I ca n’t say what might happen in the future but as far as I am concerned this is a policy issue not a leadership issue . ’’
Mr Abbott said his office had had an ‘‘ absolute deluge ’’ of critical emails after Mr Turnbull announced the coalition ’s support for the amended ETS .
‘‘ The phone lines have been in meltdown with people saying that the Liberal Party would not be doing its job as an opposition simply to pass this thing without scrutiny ... it demands , ’’ he said .
Liberal frontbencher Sophie Mirabella told Sky News her resignation was not a decision she took lightly but felt she had no option but to resign because she could not vote for the ETS .
She said it was not a matter of leadership and she was prepared to demote herself to vote against the " fundamentally flawed " legislation .
Mr Abbott said it had been a ‘‘ pretty heavy week ’’ for the party .
‘‘ And for someone who has a record of loyalty to the party and to the leader that I ’ve had , this has been an incredibly momentous decision . ’’
: Love was in the air at Parliament House earlier today as the nation 's leaders put aside their differences and reflected on the past year .
Regular business was suspended as politicians thanked everyone they could think of and implored Australians to spend the holiday season with their families .
Fresh from a bruising fight with his own party over emissions trading , Mr Turnbull sniffled while delivering his Christmas message .
The actions of the doomed passengers on the flights involved in the September 11 terror attacks in the United States were a powerful reminder of the importance of love and family , Mr Turnbull said .
When they realised their fate , they got on their mobile phones and called their families .
" And the one thing they all said , just three words , ' I love you , ' " a visibly upset Mr Turnbull recalled .
" Facing death that 's what they said .
The most important thing they could say was ' I love you . '
" It 's a reminder that love and family is all we have .
" It defines our humanity .
Love is what makes us human . "
Mr Turnbull said that so often " we do not love enough " .
" So often we deny and suppress or set to one side our love for each other . "
However , he could n't quite declare love for his " strong and frank " Senate leader Nick Minchin , who has caused him much climate change grief lately .
Family and love were themes on which Prime Minister Kevin Rudd dwelled .
" Christmas is a time of celebration and a time when we all reflect on the absolute importance of families , " he said .
He wanted to put politics aside " and rise above the hand - to - hand combat of the chamber " .
But he could n't resist having a friendly dig at Mr Turnbull , adding " perhaps in recent days , in the case of the Opposition , the hand - to - hand combat within the party room " .
Mr Rudd also made a point of thanking his " united , disciplined and diligent team " .
Mr Turnbull must wish his side had displayed more of those traits .
Looking back on the year that was , both leaders talked of Barack Obama 's victory in the US and the Black Saturday Bushfires in Victoria .
" Nature showed us her worst side and we responded by showing our best side , " Mr Turnbull said of the fires .
" Comradeship , generosity , the extraordinary heroism and the determination to set things right has been a really admirable , beautiful thing to behold . "
Both also spoke about the sacrifices made by Australia 's armed forces .
" Many of those in our armed forces will be serving during the Christmas and holiday season and will not be spending Christmas and the new year with their families , " Mr Rudd said .
Other speakers joined the love - in , thanking everyone in Parliament House from retiring Clerk of the House Ian Harris to the cleaners and security guards .
Even the press gallery got a few mentions .
Loading House leader Anthony Albanese recalled , with a sense of wonder , how he and Treasurer Wayne Swan had drinks with the Queen at Buckingham Palace a few months ago .
And , with equal wonder , how a kid from a single parent family in public housing in Sydney could rise to manage government business in the House of Representatives .

China has rising emissions " because it is making our stuff " Greenhouse gas emissions created by Britons are probably twice as bad as figures suggest , says the government 's new chief energy scientist .
Professor David MacKay told the BBC that reductions in carbon dioxide emissions since 1990 are " an illusion " .
" Our energy footprint has decreased over the last few decades and that 's largely because we 've exported our industry , " he said .
Developing countries now made the goods that Britain buys , he added .
He was speaking unofficially in a previously recorded interview , but his comments will increase pressure on the UK to improve its offer of emissions cuts at the upcoming climate change talks .
" Other countries make stuff for us so we have naughty , naughty China and India out of control with rising emissions but it 's because they are making our stuff for us now , " he said .
" It 's been estimated by Dieter Helm from the University of Oxford that roughly half of our energy footprint actually lives overseas so our true footprint is twice as big as it looks on paper . "
Prof Helm 's paper suggests if the UK counted " embedded " emissions , its total pollution would have gone up not down .
' World polluters '
Prof MacKay 's comments apply to all developed countries whose manufacturing industries have relocated to the developing world .
We are right up there on the winners podium for carbon dioxide emissions per person over the last 125 years
Prof David MacKay
He also tackles sceptics of climate policy who argue the UK's 2 % share of current global emissions is trivial .
If you take into account historic CO2 , the UK is among the top three world polluters , he points out .
" The argument that we are only a small country could be used by pretty much every country on the planet and then we'd all do nothing , " he said .
" Back in 1910 we were burning per capita the same amount as Americans do today so that 's an argument for saying we really have an ethical duty to take a lead and show the way and show that it is possible for a developed country to seriously decarbonise its economy .
" By historical emissions per capita the top three are America , Germany and Britain so we are right up there on the winners podium for carbon dioxide emissions per person over the last 125 years .
" ' Favourable terms '
Prof MacKay started his new job on Thursday , and his new employers at the Department of Energy and Climate Change ( DECC ) do not challenge his figures .
A spokesman said : " While some emission reductions have resulted from the trend for manufacturing to move overseas , it 's internationally accepted that emissions from manufacturing are counted by the country of production . "
If global warming is to be limited , the US and Europe will have to take much more drastic action to reduce those emissions embedded in their own consumption
Prof Dieter Helm
This is convenient for the UK , which also managed to gain very favourable terms under the Kyoto Protocol climate agreement .
Setting a baseline of 1990 for emissions cuts allowed the UK to cut emissions without trying because 1990 was a peak of coal burning in Britain .
A study from the Stockholm Environment Institute estimated when embedded emissions are taken into account , the average UK resident pollutes 15 tonnes a year - almost five times more than the average Chinese person at 3.1 tonnes a year .
The failure to calculate embedded emissions has damaged the reputation of countries such as China which are making goods for export to the West but are then blamed for the pollution that results .
' Recalculating figures ' Prof Helm 's paper says : " If carbon outsourcing is factored back in , the UK 's impressive emissions cuts over the past two decades do n't look so impressive anymore .
" Rather than falling by over 15 % since 1990 , they actually rose by around 19 % .
And even this is flattering , since the UK closed most of its coal industry in the 1990s for reasons unrelated to climate change .
" No doubt , recalculating the figures for other European countries and the US would reveal a similar pattern . "
It is consumption and not production that matters , according to Prof Helm .
" This means that if global warming is to be limited , the US and Europe will have to take much more drastic action to reduce those emissions embedded in their own consumption , " he said .
" Their appropriate emissions reduction targets will have to be based on the consumption of goods that cause those emissions in the first place .
" This not only means that the true scale of required emissions reductions in the Western world will be much higher but that the impact on economic growth and living standards there will also be more severe than so far believed . "

According to Florida law , there are two grounds for dissolving a marriage .
First , the couple or one spouse may claim that the marriage is irretrievably broken .
The second basis is the mental incapacity of one of the spouses .
In order to file for divorce in Florida , either spouse must have resided in Florida for at least six months before the time of filing .
The proceeding must be initiated in the county where the spouse who is seeking the divorce resides .
Florida also requires at least 20 days of a waiting period before a final judgment dissolving the marriage will be issued , subject to some exceptions .
There is a streamlined proceeding to obtain a divorce if the spouses meet certain criteria , but this is not available if any major issues are contested .
Florida law defines child support as the duty to provide financial support to a minor child .
Florida has specific guidelines regarding how the amount of support that a parent must provide is calculated , which takes into account each parent ’s ability to provide support for the child .
Some of the factors that the court will consider when determining a child support award include the number of nights that the child spends at each spouse ’s home , whether the child requires day care , whether the child has medical or dental needs , whether any medical insurance policies may provide coverage for the child , and how much each parent earns .
Support is intended solely for the support of the child and is not intended to support the other spouse .
If there is an issue regarding the enforcement of a child support order , Hollywood family attorney Cindy D. Sackrin can help you go back to court to get this problem resolved .
Under Florida ’s paternity laws , if a woman is married , becomes pregnant , and gives birth , the law presumes that the mother ’s spouse is the father of the child .
If the mother is not married at the time of the birth , however , a paternity proceeding may be initiated through either a court proceeding or a voluntary process .
The latter method requires the mother and the father to sign a Voluntary Acknowledgement of Paternity form and to wait 60 days for the form to become final .
If the parties do not have an agreement about paternity , either party , the Florida Department of Child Services , or the child through a guardian or another legal representative may initiate a court proceeding to have paternity established .
During the paternity hearing , the judge may also issue orders regarding child support , parenting time , and decision - making power for the child ’s care .
Florida law defines domestic violence very broadly , including assault , battery , sexual assault , stalking , kidnapping , and the aggravated versions of each of these incidences .
The persons potentially included within Florida ’s domestic violence protections are similarly broad , including spouses , ex-spouses , co-parents , relatives by blood or marriage , current roommates , and former roommates .
Domestic violence protections also apply to partners in a dating relationship , whether the relationship is ongoing or terminated .
( A dating relationship must have an intimate , romantic , or sexual nature . )
In any of these instances , the court may issue orders protecting a victim of domestic violence , and the state may prosecute persons who violate the terms of a domestic violence injunction .
Florida describes its child custody laws as timesharing laws that involve a parenting plan .
Even when the parents agree about custody of the child , the court will still require the parties to create a parenting plan .
If the parties are unable to agree on a parenting plan , the court will create a plan , but it may not be tailored to the preferences of the parties .
There are specific items that the parenting plan must include , such as how the parties will oversee and share daily care for the child .
There must be a timesharing schedule specifying the time that the child will spend with each parent , designations regarding responsibility for school - related matters and health care , and provisions for how each parent will communicate with the child , including specific technologies .
In some cases , such as when one parent decides to relocate to a distant location , one parent or the other will need to pursue a modification of an existing order .
This may be contested , so it is important to seek legal counsel if you feel that your situation requires a modification .
Alimony may be granted to a spouse in Florida in order to bridge the gap , serve a rehabilitative purpose , or allow the receiving spouse to work toward a financial situation in which they can provide for their own financial needs .
Although many people assume that the payments are only made monthly or bi-monthly , the court has the power to award a lump sum support payment or to use a combination of installments and lump sum payments .
The court will consider a number of factors when making a spousal support award , including non-financial aspects of each spouse ’s situation .
In divorce proceedings , dividing the marital property may be challenging if the parties had a complicated financial situation or substantial assets .
Florida has adopted an equitable distribution approach to the division of marital assets .
This means that the property acquired during the marriage ( with a few exceptions like inheritances ) will be divided equally unless it would be more fair to provide for a different division .
In general , mediation is a process that allows the parties to resolve a dispute with the guidance and assistance of a mediator who is certified by the Florida Supreme Court .
There are specific rules that apply to mediation , including requirements that the mediator remain neutral , refrain from forcing either of the parties to enter into an agreement , and work toward the mutual good of each party .

The World from Berlin ThyssenKrupp ' Had No Choice ' but to Sell Shipyards to Arab Investors
A lack of orders had almost sunk the shipbuilding subsidiaries of German steelmaking giant ThyssenKrupp .
Now , an investor from Abu Dhabi is buying a large chunk of the operation .
German commentators praise the move , but note how the financial crisis has forced Germany to be less picky about foreign investors .
Friday ’s 25 minute in - flight meeting between President Obama ( just returning from what proved to be a failed last minute pitch for Chicago ’s Olympics bid ) and Gen. Stanley McChrystal was more than just the coincidental meeting officials tried to spin it as .
Gen. Stanley McChrystal
Rather officials say that President Obama was “ furious ” with the General following his pointed remarks at a London speech the day prior .
At the speech , Gen. McChrystal mocked Vice President Biden ’s call to scale back the objectives of the eight year long war , saying it would lead to “ Chaos - istan ” and insisting that he would never accept such a plan .
The meeting that followed was reportedly “ awkward , ” and experts say that the working relationship between the president and the commander of the Afghan War is “ not great . ”
Undaunted , however , General McChrystal is said to have spent much of their brief time together emphasizing the increasingly grim situation on the ground and pressing the president to make a decision on his call for additional troops .
The Obama Administration is reportedly unsure what to make of McChrystal , with one adviser saying “ people are n’t sure whether McChrystal is being naive or an upstart . ”
Whatever the case , it is uncharacteristic for a US general to spend so much of his time publicly petitioning for his strategy and attacking the commander in chief for not endorsing it immediately .
“ The Committee vote today is a rifle shot at abusive financial practices , not a shotgun blast that would hit community banks making an honest living from fair lending practices .
It ’s no surprise that the lenders with the worst practices are still fighting tooth and nail against this bill .
The last thing they want is to have to make an honest living . "
“ Protecting consumers is a must in any new financial regulatory system , and the Consumer Financial Protection Agency will help make that happen .
I commend Chairman Frank for his leadership on these issues , and I look forward to working with him and other Members as we move forward in the process to improve not only CFPA , but the rest of the financial regulatory reform package so we can strengthen protections for all consumers , investors and taxpayers . "
Thursday a lot of us may have missed an historic vote in the House Financial Services Committee .
I do n't know if anyone is calling it " bipartisan " just because one Republican , Mike Castle , went along for the ride by Barney Frank 's committee voted 39 - 29 to create a federal agency devoted to protecting consumers from predatory lending , abusive overdraft fees and unfair rate hikes .
One of the strongest and clearest voices on the committee for consumer protection is Florida Congressman Alan Grayson , who sees this as one step in the right direction of establishing a more equitable balance between ordinary working families and powerful corporate entities .
" The entire existing regulatory regime for the banks , " he told us after the vote , " is concerned only with the wellbeing of the banks .
It 's about time that we did something to promote the wellbeing of their exploited , abused customers .
"
Of course , Grayson was hardly the only person pushing for these basic consumer protections .
Obama had asked Congress to address these things and Barney Frank has been adamant .
He seemed elated after the vote as well : " This is a much stronger bill than people predicted months ago and it will only get better going forward . "
He recommended we take a look at remarks that Elizabeth Warren and Travis Plunkett made after the vote .
We all know who Warren is , of course ( Matt Taibbi 's candidate for president ) but Travis Plunkett is with the Consumer Federation of America -- an organization that looks to protect consumers , sort of a good version of the violently anti-consumer U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
First Warren : " I just want to say , when I first came to Washington with the idea of this agency , everyone told me : ' The banks always win .
Quit now , because the banks always win . '
They did n’t win today .
Chairman Frank has done something that is historic here ...
I never thought I would see this day , so I am delighted . "
Plunkett was as enthused as Warren and as overjoyed as the Chamber was bummed .
" We think it 's very significant that the first major hurdle has been cleared for this legislation .
We are on the brink of a monumental achievement for consumers . "
The Chamber called it " a step backward . "
For them indentured servitude would be a step in the right direction .
The Chamber lobbyists were able to hold all the Republicans but Castle in line and they peeled off two of the most reactionary Democrats on the panel , Travis Childers ( Blue Dog - MS ) and Walt Minnick ( Blue Dog - ID ) , two who can always be counted on to vote against the best interests of ordinary working families when those interests are in conflict with banksters .
Even Republicans in serious electoral difficulties because of anti-family voting records -- like Michele Bachmann ( R- MN ) , Lynn Jenkins ( R-KS ) , Thaddeus McCotter ( R - MI ) , Judy Biggert ( R- IL ) , Jim Gerlach ( R - PA ) , and Scott Garrett ( R - NJ ) -- voted against their own constituents .
Lobbyist money was just too tempting for them .
Opposite of these sleazy characters are members of Congress who really want to take the opportunity to make the lives of ordinary citizens better through government action .
Brad Miller ( D - NC ) is a good example :
And not all the Blue Dogs on the committee joined Minnick and Childers in their lobbyist - inspired sprint across the aisle .
Dennis Moore ( D - KS ) was more Democrat and less Blue Dog Thursday :
Labels : Alan Grayson , Barney Frank , credit card companies , federal regulatory agencies , House Financial Services Committee , predatory lenders
Peace signs spray - painted on businesses and homes have evoked more anger than harmony in Denver ’s Capitol Hill and Uptown neighborhoods .
Homes , businesses and bridges in the central Denver neighborhoods were tagged with the universal sign for peace during the weekend .
On Monday , Denver police said they have not identified suspects in the case .
If the total damage to buildings is $ 1,000 or more , the vandals could be charged with a felony .
The city catalogued 51 peace signs in the East 13th and 14th avenue corridors heading east from downtown .
Denver Public
Works spokeswoman
Ann Williams estimated the city will pay as much as $ 2,000 to scrub the symbols off walls .
Inspections are continuing on East 10th , 11th and 12th avenues , Williams said .
Businesses and homes on East 17th Avenue were tagged , too .
“ I ’m all for people making a peaceful statement , but this is a little excessive , ” said Denver resident Christopher Medved .
Medved , 27 , said six peace signs were sprayed on his apartment complex Sunday morning .
The City O’ City restaurant on East 13th Avenue where Medved works also was targeted .
Williams said Denver has not seen a vandalism “ bombing ” of peace signs before .
A bombing is when vandals strike fast and furious , and limit their activity to a particular neighborhood .
Williams said the city will remove the graffiti from private homes and businesses if owners complete a release form .
If the city does not have a form on file , owners will be charged for the cost of removing the graffiti .
Many of the peace signs were sprayed onto brick , which requires one or more power washes to remove .
Patrick Deboar , manager of the Buffalo Exchange clothing store on East 13th Avenue , said he reported peace signs on the storefront Monday morning .
During his 12 years in the Capitol Hill neighborhood , Deboar said , he has seen his share of vandalism .
“ I love a good piece of graffiti done by a good graphic artist , but this is vandalism , ” Deboar said .
He said that he will protect a good piece of graffiti , like one that decorates the back of his building .
Everything else is just a nuisance , he said .
Other business owners on East 13th Avenue said they share Deboar ’s opinion about graffiti versus vandalism .
Felipe Perez , a New York City native and owner of Moxie Hair Company , said that graffiti has developed into a form of art that carries a message .
The only message Perez got from the peace signs on his storefront was annoyance .
“ People may have an idea of peace — do n’t put it on my wall , ” he said .

If you thought tabloid outrage over Nick Griffin 's appearance on Question Time was hypocritical , you were n't alone .
Anton Vowl at The Enemies of Reason blog has produced a very thorough picture essay on the subject , which we repost here in full .
NB : " Today " below refers to Friday 23 October , as that 's when Anton made the original post .
Today 's tabloids express mock outrage at the appearance of N*ck Gr*ff*n on the BBC Question Time programme .
But they have short memories .
Here 's today 's Star :
Hang on , though .
Is n't that the same newspaper that did this ?
And this ?
The Express , meanwhile , is also clutching its pearl necklace , claiming that the party is going to get taxpayer - funded broadcasts at the next election .
Not a big lead on Griffin , because there 's apparently another twist in the Diana saga ( and as ever the stock image of her wearing a seat belt , which would have saved her life in the crash , nutjob neenaw whoop - whoop conspiracy or no conspiracy ) .
But it 's got those because it 's gained votes .
I wonder why ?
I wonder which newspapers are read by BNP supporters ?
Maybe ones that say stuff like this
Or this ?
Or even this ?
And not forgetting the all - time classic :
Not some .
Not five hundred .
Not even a thousand .
Not half .
Not three - quarters .
No. ALL .
IN BIG RED LETTERS SO YOU'RE MADE CLEARLY AWARE THAT IT'S ALL .
Hey , and please let 's not forget this :
I almost did n't include this !
Which is almost the same as this !
But no .
The Express does n't like the BNP .
They just happen to share entirely the same views on immigration , but Griffin is bad , because . . . well .
I have n't quite worked out why he 's bad .
Maybe he does n't hate Muslims enough for their tastes ?
The Mail have also had a bash , but as ever they 're more concerned with attacking their nemesis the BBC than they are about hand - wringing over Griffin :
Having said which , I still think
it 's worth making the point
that the Mail does n't always steer so far away
from using content
which the BNP and " bigot " N*ck Gr*ff*n
might completely agree with
and it's not long
before you might start thinking to yourself
are they really protesting a bit too much ?
And what 's the difference , really , between the BNP bigots and the supposedly mainstream newspaper which claims to distance itself from them so much ?
And you have to start thinking : do these newspapers which select certain types of images of ethnic minorities and use them again and again
really have such different views or agendas from the likes of the BNP ?
It 's all very well people blaming Labour , or the BBC , or whoever , for the " rise " of the BNP .
But if there has been a significant increase in BNP support -- and it has n't translated into votes yet , despite a severe recession and growing unemployment -- perhaps that might have more to do with the legitimisation and absorption of their extreme views by newspapers creating scare story after scare story concerning race and immigration , often baseless stories created simply to scare ?
It 's one thing going to a BNP meeting but it 's quite another to hear exactly the same thing over the breakfast table from a publication which purports to report the facts .
But no .
It 's all the BBC 's fault .
Let 's blame them .

The Executive Secretary , Universal Basic Education Commission ( UBEC ) , Dr. Ahmed Modibbo Mohammed has said that Basic Education is not only paramount to National Development , but for development to be sustained , it has to be anchored on sound and relevant Education .
The Executive Secretary disclosed in a paper he delivered to the participants of the Executive Intelligence Management Course II at the Institute for Security Studies , Lower Usuman Dam , Bwari Abuja .
The Executive Secretary who spoke on â€ œthe Falling Standard of Education in Nigeria : Â Implication for Developmentâ€  stressed that the â€œFalling Standard in Educationâ€  is a symptom of inadequacy or crudely put falling standard in the inputs from the economic sector into the education sector whose further manifestation is falling standard of processing ( teaching and learning ) and the completion of the Vicious Circle with inadequately prepare students Â and graduate performing sub-optimally in the various sectors of the economy as employees .
According to him , Education reduces child mortality , improves maternal health , control population growth and equips the citizen to effectively manage the economy of the Country .
â€ œWith Education , we can reduce or eliminate the vicious circle of illiteracy , poverty , disease , hunger and underdevelopment and if education is able to develop the mind which is the central hob ofÂ development , then every other development indices , productivity and per-capita income environmental sustainability , innovation and charge and healthy transmission of societal values to the next generation is guaranteed , â€  he said .
Dr. Mohammed said Education constitutes the core of human development and also a vital tool for transformation and the key to sustainable development of a nation .
He said that besides the achievement of Universal Primary Education as a principal goal among the eight Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) , education account significantly for the totality of the MDGs .
Dr. Mohammed maintained that meeting basic education needs is a sure step to meeting basic sustainable human development needs .
He noted that Nigeriaâ€™s ability to adequately empower her citizenry , diversity and strengthen the national economy , institutionalize democratic ideals and ensure peace and security depends largely on the performance of the education sector .

Re : Monday Memo
Washington ( CNN ) --
It is a busy week ahead , to say the least , and perhaps a telling one in the health care debate .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is said to be close to settling on a health care bill that includes a government insurance option , but does allow states to " opt out " if they do n't want to participate .
" I think we 're very close to getting the 60 votes we need to move forward , " said New York Democratic Sen .
Chuck Schumer , a key Reid deputy , on NBC's " Meet the Press " Sunday .
Close , but not there , which makes it a risky strategy .
Not only does Reid not have commitments for the 60 votes he would need to clear Senate procedural hurdles , the " opt out " approach also is unacceptable to Sen.
Olympia Snowe of Maine , the only Republican to vote for the Senate Finance Committee 's health care proposal .
So Reid risks losing Snowe and angering the Obama White House , which very much wants Snowe 's vote so it can call the plan " bipartisan . "
And he risks losing if he can't win over some reluctant moderate and conservative Democrats -- like Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska .
" I have made no promise , " Nelson told us Sunday .
" I can't decide about the procedural vote until I see the underlying bill . "
Senate leadership sources have been down this road with Nelson before , and believe he can be swayed .
But it 's a fluid situation -- and packed with drama .
Also of note in the week ahead :
• President Obama hits the campaign trail Tuesday at Old Dominion University , looking to rally African - American turnout for Virginia gubernatorial candidate Creigh Deeds , who trails heading into the final 10 days .
• A number of congressional hearings exploring the economy , jobs and the potential impact of " green jobs . "
The impact of the stimulus legislation , for example , will be debated at a Thursday hearing of the Joint Economic Committee .
• The Conference Board weighs in with new consumer confidence data on Tuesday , and the government 's data on new home sales and third - quarter gross domestic product will be closely watched for clues of recovery .
That GDP report is due Thursday , which just happens to be the 80th anniversary of the 1929 " Black Tuesday " stock market crash .
And lastly , the NBA season kicks off this week and the World Series is scheduled to get under way .
Just in case you need a break from politics for a few hours .
Enjoy the week .

It Takes a Thief
There is no such thing as a burglar - proof home .
What there is , however -- using a burglar ’s double criteria of speedy entry and not attracting attention -- are homes that are too difficult to break in to .
The enemies of the burglar are time and attention .
The longer it takes to enter and the more noise he makes increase his chances of being seen and caught .
Homes not easily and quickly broken into are most often bypassed for easier targets
Although the main focus of this is to deter burglars , what is talked about on this page is an example of " walk - aways " mentioned on the Pyramid of Personal Safety page .
The same issues that will deter a burglar will also serve to stop a break - in rapist or stalker .
Officer Ken Pence from the Nashville police force has created a " Rate Your Risk " quiz to assess your risk of being burglarized .
We suggest you follow this offsite link and take the test .
Tip # 1
Make your home security system like an onion , not an egg .
Layers upon layers are not only the best deterrent , but the best defense against break ins .
Reason :
It is easy for a criminal to bypass a single line of defense .
Multiple layers not only slow him , but serve as a means to alert you or your neighbors that someone is trying to break in .
Doing these " layered walk - aways " makes it more difficult for a criminal to meet his criteria of quick and unobserved entry .
If , like the tip of an iceberg , enough of these deterrents are visible , most of the time the would - be intruder will simply choose not to even try .
If he does try , then the layers he did not see will impede him .
A good example of a layered defense is rosebushes outside the window , double - locked , barred and safety coated side windows and something difficult to climb over inside under the window .

Tip # 2
Pretend to be a burglar
Walk around your property and ask yourself :
How would I break in ?
Examine your house from the street , where are the blind spots ?
What are the most vulnerable areas and , therefore , likely to be attacked ?
Stand outside the windows and look in , make sure no valuables , like expensive electronics or artwork , are visible .
If you can see your belongings doing this , so can criminals .
Reason :
We do n't tend to think of our homes in these terms .
So spend just a few minutes doing this .
Find where " blind spots " are ( areas where a criminal can work without being seen or would be screened from view of a neighbor looking to see what that loud noise they just heard ) .
Also look for " weaknesses " ( easy access points ) are ( for example , sliding glass doors , doggy doors or louvered windows ) .
These are the areas that will be " attacked " by the criminal .
That is also where you must focus your defenses .

Tip # 3
Consider the area that the lock sits in
A lock is not enough , you must also address the area around it .
You need to extend your thinking about security measures to 18 and twenty four inches around the lock itself .
That is the area you must protect .
Reason : A burglar does n't care how much damage he causes getting in .
The best locks in the world will do no good if he smashes the door in .
A pinewood door frame will splinter and give way after a few savage kicks .
The backdoor deadbolt can often be bypassed by just breaking a window and reaching through to unlock it .
Windows can be broken and locks undone .
Many locked gates can be opened by simply reaching around and over .
A hasp - and - lock will swiftly yield to blows from a even a small sledgehammer .
Return to top of page
Tip # 4
As well as locking something , you must also protect the lock and its components
A common combination of cheap locks and small construction flaws , that we tend not to notice , often give criminals the " cracks " in security they need to break in .
Reason :
Many home doorlocks can be quickly bypassed with a knife or screwdriver slid in the gap between door and frame .
After that the criminal can easily work the tongue of most cheap locks out of the door frame .
A thin kitchen knife slid between sash windows can " tap " a normal window lock open .
Hasps and locks can be hammered or twisted off in a few blows , or simply cut off with bolt cutters .
Many sliding windows and doors can simply be lifted out of place .
Door : Look at the gap between your door and your door frame from the inside - can you see the lock 's tongue ?
All it takes is a flip of the criminal 's wrist while holding a screwdriver while on the outside to break away the thin doorjamb molding and expose that same gap .
From there , it is another simple wrist gesture to jimmy the tongue out of the faceplate .
Total elapsed time for break - in , about 10 seconds -- with minimal noise .
On ALL outside exit doors , buy locks that have locking tongues .
Test this by holding the door open and locking the knob .
Then attempt to depress the tongue into the door with your finger .
Better locks will have a secondary tongue that does n't move .
The best locks will have entire tongues that do n't move .
Window : Put " window stops " on the first floor and basement window frames .
These often functionally amount to secondary and tertiary locks .
The best kind are those that go through a moveable frame and lock it into place .
Something as simple as drilling a hole through both frames when the window is closed and placing a nail in the hole will lock the windows in place .
Other :
Use hasps with protective shrouds .
These make it harder for the criminal to hammer away the lock .
If for some reason you have an outward swinging door , not only get the best lock possible , but place a safety plate ( a small formed sheet of metal ) over the tongue so it cannot be seen or easily manipulated
These slow down the criminal and make him work hard to get in .
This entails him making more noise for longer periods of time , thereby increasing his chances of being detected .

Tip # 5
Brace doorframes and put multiple locks on all outside doors
What he does n't know * will * hurt him .
With a little extra work , the bracing can be hidden behind the doorframe 's internal molding and will not be noticeable from either inside or outside .
For the burglar , this is like unexpectedly hitting an invisible wall .
Reason :
The most common means of breaking into homes is simply by kicking in the door .
Most doorframes are made of 1 inch pine which saves the contractor money .
This makes them vulnerable to this basic assault .
Multiple locks and bracing under the molding make this kind of entrance unlikely and will not destroy the beauty of your home .
Bracing :
Take between a 2 and 3 foot piece of flat steel stripping ( 1/8 x 2 inches is good ) and drill a staggered series of holes down its length .
When you take the interior molding off the door -- in most houses -- you will see the 1x6 " ( or 1x5 " ) pine plank of the doorframe .
That is nailed to the 2x4 " studs of the wall .
( You may or may not be able to see the studs because of drywall , but they are there ) .
That thin 1 inch piece of cheap wood ( it is usually pine ) is all that was between your possessions and a burglar .
A few savage kicks , and it usually breaks off in a 2 - to - 3 foot sliver and the door swings open .
Fast and more secure version :
On the inside wall , where the molding was , position the steel strip so that all the lock strike plates are behind it and its edge is along the edge of the 1x6 .
Screw it into place with long screws -- leaving a few holes open .
The staggered drill pattern should result in the screws seating into both the 1x6 and the 2x4 studs .
Take the molding and shave or chisel out the thickness of the metal strip in the proper place .
Replace the molding , using the remaining holes to tack it down over the strip .
Putty and repaint .
Slower , better looking , but slightly less secure :
This version looks slightly better , but requires some precision Dremel or chisel work .
Instead of abutting the strip to the exact edge of the 1x6 , seat it between 1/16 to 1/8 of an inch away from the edge .
When carving your groove in the molding , leave the same sized tongue running down the doorside edge .
This seats over and covers the steel , making it invisible .
Repaint .
Strike plate : Just assume that they did it wrong -- and odds are you will be right .
Using the same length of screws that you are using for the steel strip , remove the shorter screws that are in the door frame strike plate and replace them with the bigger screws .
It is not uncommon for short screws of less than a half inch to be used ( or come with the lock assembly ) , such short screws are easily ripped out after a few kicks .
On the other hand an 1 1 / 2 or 2 inch set of screws that reach into the house 's very framing is not going anywhere quickly -- no matter how hard you kick it .
Multiple locks : Deadbolts , rim locks and floor locks are your friends .
All outside doors should have at least two separate locks .
Doors that are on the blind side of the house or homes in high - risk areas should have more .
The deeper the tongue goes , the better .

Tip # 6
Find alternatives to normal deadbolts in doors that have windows ( or windowed frames )
Talk with a locksmith about what is available .
Reason :
Most burglaries occur during the day when you are away at work .
Unfortunately , many back doors are decorative and windowed .
It is easy for a burglar to punch out a small window , reach in and unlock the door .
Since they are off the street and out of view this is why most break - ins occur through the back and side doors .
A single - key deadbolt has a key on one side and a handle on the other .
After punching out a window a burglar can reach in and , with ease , open the deadbolt then the doorknob - elapsed time five seconds .
Placing a secondary lock ( i.e. , a floor lock ) outside of the reach of the windows is recommended .
If that is too much , a double - key deadbolt is recommended for non-primary access doors .
This secures the door while you are not at home .
If fire safety concerns you ( and it should ) at night put your keys in the deadbolt .
This not only allows you immediate exit should a fire occur , but you will also always know where your keys are .

Tip # 7
Treat inside garage doors the same as an outside door : multiple locks and bracing .
Even though it is inside your home , it must be able to withstand a full out assault .
Often , the doors that access the house from the garage are hollow - core and have cheap locks ( if they are locked at all ) which is why break ins through garages are so common .
Reason : Criminals often cruise neighborhoods looking for open garage doors .
Once an open garage door is found , they pull in , close the door , park their car and then start piling your possessions into it .
Although they might still do it occasionally , criminals no longer need to cruise the neighborhood with a stolen garage door opener and pushing the button to see whose door will open , and incredible number of people just leave the door wide open for them when " just running down to the store . "
For criminals on foot , the side door of a garage is a prime target , as it is often easier and offering better ease of access / escape than a back door .
This is why you must treat the door into your home from the garage like an outside door .
If the inner door is locked it is usually hollow core and with minimal locks .
Realize that with the garage door closed the criminals can unleash a sustained full out assault against that inside door .
Usually the door will give way .
By bracing it and replacing hollow core doors with solid core ones , you significantly lessen the chances of that happening .
It should also be noted that many home invasion robberies come through open garage doors and these inner doors .
More so than the front door .

Tip # 8
Plant rosebushes or cactus in front of all vulnerable windows .
Thorny landscaping not only adds beauty to your home , but makes even getting close to such windows an unappealing prospect
Reason :
The second most common way of breaking into homes is through rear or side windows .
A thief can work on such windows with little chance of detection .
Standing in the middle of a thorn bush to do it , however , is not a pleasant experience .

Tip # 9
Look into safety - coating the most vulnerable windows .
Safety coat is an adhesive plastic sheeting that makes breaking out windows difficult .
Reason :
It 's not going to be fun for him , standing in a rosebush only to discover that the window is n't easy to break either .
Instead of a quick pop , he now has to stand there and repeatedly pound before he can even reach the lock .
Wait until he discovers that the window has window stops as well .
If you can afford it , there are many quality windows that are not only good to keep inclement weather out , but provide serious burglar protection , as well .

Tip # 10
Put a secondary lock that prevents the panel from being moved on all windows .
This is repeating what was mentioned earlier , but it is important enough to warrant such emphasis .
Reason :
Put stops on the frame on all sash windows .
This allows them to be opened , but only so far .
On sliding windows and doors , the best type of lock is a pin that goes through both frame and sliding part .
This prevents the window from being lifted out .

Tip # 11
Get and close heavy drapes -- especially on rooms where there is expensive equipment .
Thin , sheer drapes -- although attractive -- also allow burglars to look inside .
Reason :
It is often amazing how often a home intruder will walk up and look through the windows of a home to see if there is anything worth stealing .
Sheer curtains allow him to do this .
He knows what he wants to steal before he even breaks in .
Getting into the habit of closing heavy drapes not only keep your home warmer in winter but lessen the chances of your home being targeted by a burglar .
Without this ability to see into the home , there are less guaranteed results for him , which helps to serve as a deterrent .

Tip # 12
In really bad neighborhoods , get safety bars on the windows .
In so - so neighborhoods , you might want to consider putting them on side windows -- especially ones that are perfect break - in spots .
Reason :
When it comes down it windows are always breakable .
A set of regular bars on high risk , non-bedroom windows are not likely to destroy the looks or value of your home .
And the added security is well worth it .
On bedroom windows , it is advisable to spend the extra money and get the releasable bars that can be jettisoned in case of fire .

Tip # 13
Make sure sliding glass doors and windows are installed correctly .
Not everyone in the construction industry is a rocket scientist .
And their incompetence and laziness can cost you plenty .
Reason :
An estimated one quarter of all sliding glass doors and windows are installed backwards ( so the sliding part is on the outside track ) .
This allows the criminal to simply lift out the panel and enter

Tip # 14
If you use a pole in the track to secure sliding doors and windows make sure it is the right length .
It should be within a ?
- inch of the track ’s length .
Reason :
If the pole is not long enough to keep the criminal from slipping his fingers in , it is of no use .
Staple or tape a piece of string to the pole to make it easy to pull out when it is in the track .
Better yet get a " track stop " or " track lock " that you can put in the tracks .
They are far better than the " poor man 's version " of a dowel .
Better yet get sliding window / door bar ( jamb bar ) .

Tip # 15 Install motion detectors in areas where no one should be .
This way , you know something is n't right when they go off .
Reason :
Most people put safety lights where they do the least good .
While they illuminate your approach as you pull into your driveway , such lights are often hard to see if you are indoors .
Put them along the side of the house or back , so that someone lurking there sets them off .
Position them so you can see when they go on .
The lights are adjustable , so even if you have a blind wall you can turn the lights so they will both illuminate an area and attract your attention .
Put them high enough so that they can not be knocked out of service by someone jumping .
Look into low voltage and / or solar powered outdoor lighting .
This kind of lighting illuminates your property at very little cost .

Tip # 16
Get a dog .
A barking dog , whether inside the house or in the yard is proven as the best deterrent to burglars .
Reason :
It does n't have to be a 250 - pound Rottweiler named Spike , even a smaller yappy dog serves as an early warning system .
Not only does the intruder risk a bite , but the barking attracts attention .
And there is no such thing as a stranger intimidating a dog into silence .
We do n't recommend dog doors .
It is not uncommon for thieves to bring small children and send them through these and have the child open the main door .
Also , since many burglars are , in fact , teenagers , it is also common for them to bring a younger child with them to do this .
If you do have a dog door already , either a ) put the dog out and lock the door during the day or b ) make sure the access gates to your yard are locked .
That way the criminals cannot simply walk by , open your gate to let the dog out and then return when the dog has wandered away .
The truth is a dog , even a small dog , inside a house is not something a burglar wants to to deal with .
Getting bit is not fun .

Tip # 17 Create a neighborhood watch on your block .
Even just the signs often send would - be burglars elsewhere .
Reason :
An alert and involved community is the criminal ’s nemesis .
It is often reason enough for him to try business elsewhere .
Even if you can't create an organized program , get to know your neighbors , especially retired folks who are home all day .
Let them know who belongs there and who does n't .
Have them watch your property and pick up your newspaper when you are on vacation .
It is also a good idea to hire a trustworthy preteen / young teen neighbor to do such mundane jobs as mowing your lawn or taking out the trash .
Such kids then have vested interests in your property and they are home to watch your property when adults are n't .
The kids like it because they get spending money and you get to watch TV on the weekend instead of doing lawn work .
Return to top of page
Tip # 18
Make sure the gates are locked if you have a fence .
This is especially important with accesses to the alley .
Reason : Each layer serves as a deterrent .
The more layers and hard work the criminal has to do , the more likely he is to pass by your home .
A locked fence is something he must climb over while carrying objects .
If the gate is left unlocked , however , he can just walk right through it .

Tip # 19 Leave the stereo / TV on
An empty house " feels " empty .
There is no vibration or noise inside that indicates someone 's presence .
Put the " vibes " in .
Reason :
Although this is not a guaranteed deterrent , it can serve as a " bluff " to young , inexperienced prowlers .
Even though they have " checked " to see if anyone is home ( e.g. knock on the door ) , the unexpected noise , especially from the back or upstairs ( any place they can't look into ) , indicates that they made a mistake on their primary recon .
Maybe someone is home and just did n't hear the doorbell .
You might especially want to consider this strategy for vacations .
Close the drapes , turn the stereo / TV on in the room where the criminal is most likely to try to break in .
Return to top of page
Tip # 20 Etch your name on all electronic equipment TV / stereo / computer and then tape it
Etching , in and of itself serves as a deterrent in case of a break in , failing that it greatly assists the police in the recovery of your property
Reason : Items with your name and address cannot be easily sold .
The reason for this is that anyone buying them is buying something that can easily be proven to be stolen property and they know it .
What protects most buyers of stolen goods is the fact that it is difficult to prove something is stolen property .
However , a name and address on an item combined with a police report is a fast way to end up in the county jail for possession of stolen property -- even if the person who has it bought it off the burglar .
As such , why steal something that you a ) can't sell , b ) if you are caught with you 're definitely going to jail for ?
Although it is better to record serial numbers , a faster way to assist the police in recovery is to video tape every room and all the items in them .
As you tape say what it is ( for example Sanyo TV , Hitachi DVD player , etc. , ) Title the tape something like " Family Reunion " or something you will remember and put it in your video collection .
This way , if items are stolen you can give the tape to the police , video and the etching will identify your property when the police encounter it .
Which quite often they do , being called to homes where stolen property is present , but without a means to identify it as such , they can not prove it .
Also send a duplicate copy to a relative .

Tip # 21
Get a safe !
It 's not just cash and jewels that need to go in there , but your important paperwork .
Reason : Identity theft is the fastest growing crime in the US .
Although many people think burglars are going to go for jewelry , silverware or electronics , what most people do n't realize is that the greatest damage to you will be if the criminal gets access to your personal identification and financial records !!!
A criminal can clone your identity and steal everything you have , up to an including selling your property .
Passports can sell for as much as a thousand dollars .
And a passport and your checkbook ... kiss all that money good - bye .
Make sure the safe is bolted through the floor and cannot be carried out .
If you are in a situation where you cannot use such measures ( such as an apartment ) then invest in a large , heavy duty filing cabinet with locks .
Do NOT leave the keys nearby .
Tip # 22
On top of everything else , get an alarm system .
This is another layer of the onion .
You can go anywhere from a basic system to incredibly high tech .
Reason :
Now that you 've made it slow and difficult for him to get inside , an alarm is far more effective since it gives the cavalry a chance to arrive in time .
In addition , burglar , carbon monoxide and fire alarms do wonders to keep your home owner 's insurance down .
Know however , that the bread and butter of most security companies is the service they sell you in support of the alarm system ( calling the police , paging you if there is a problem or even sending their own guards ) .
While shopping around is important , do your homework on security systems , providers and services first .
And remember , you are investing for the long term .
That is how you must think when investing in an alarm system .

The opium poppy was introduced to Afghanistan more than 2,300 years ago by the armies of Alexander the Great .
His forces were eventually driven out , like those of every would - be conqueror since .
The poppy has proved more tenacious .
On Monday , three U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents — Forrest Leamon , Chad Michael and Michael Weston , all from the Washington area — were killed in a helicopter crash in western Afghanistan .
U.S. officials have released few details about the incident .
The Times of London reported that the aircraft was shot down following a raid on the compound of a prominent Afghan drug lord .
On Wednesday , The New York Times reported that the CIA has been making regular payments to a suspected major figure in the Afghan opium trade : Ahmed Wali Karzai , the brother of President Hamid Karzai .
The newspaper quoted sources alleging that Ahmed Wali Karzai — who denies any involvement in the drug business — collects “ huge ” fees from traffickers for allowing trucks loaded with drugs to cross bridges he controls in the southern part of the country .
So is it our policy to attack the Afghan drug trade while we also line the pockets of one of its reputed kingpins ?
Who is going to explain this to the families of agents Leamon , Michael and Weston ?
Afghanistan ’s status as a narco - superpower is another reason why President Obama would be wrong to deepen U.S. involvement .
Opium is the one booming sector of the Afghan economy : Poppy fields in the south and west of the country produce the raw material for an estimated 90 percent of the world ’s heroin .
Money from the opium trade supports the resurgent Taliban , which is fighting to expel U.S. and NATO forces .
Therefore , a blow against the drug business is a blow against the enemy .
Except when it is n’t .
Except when the “ good guys ” who are supposed to be our allies — and many of the Afghan citizens a counterinsurgency strategy would try to protect — are dependent on the drug trade as well .
Except when the corruption that is an intrinsic element of the drug business not only blurs the line between friend and foe , but also obscures the difference between right and wrong in a thick fog of moral ambiguity .
As The Washington Post ’s South America correspondent during the administration of George Bush the Elder , I watched firsthand our government ’s costly and futile crusade against the cocaine industry .
We tried attacking the problem in the coca fields — I visited a U.S. - financed military base in Peru ’s Upper Huallaga Valley , where at the time 60 percent of the world ’s coca was grown .
We tried going after the processors — in Colombia , police took me to a jungle camp where chemists had been hard at work just hours earlier .
We tried breaking up the trafficking cartels — I was served lunch at a Medellin prison by three cocaine bosses whose comfortable incarceration was almost like an extended stay at a hotel .
Nothing worked .
All the U.S. managed to do was shift the coca fields from one valley to the next and break the big cartels into smaller ones .
Profits from the drug trade still sustain a guerrilla insurgency in Colombia that has controlled huge swaths of the countryside for more than four decades .
Meanwhile , cocaine is readily available throughout the United States .
The illegal drug industry is driven by demand :
As long as some people want drugs , other people will find ways to supply them .
DEA officials have said they are sharply increasing the agency ’s presence in Afghanistan .
Wisely , the Obama administration is abandoning the George W. Bush - era strategy of trying to eradicate the poppy fields ; eradication , which robs rural communities of their only livelihood , may be the quickest and surest way to turn apolitical farmers into anti-American insurgents .
The focus now is on the middlemen who buy , transport and process the drugs — which creates a different kind of problem .
Those middlemen logically seek , and obtain , official protection .
In Latin America , they approach police and government officials with an offer of plata o plomo — silver or lead — meaning the officials can choose to accept the bribes they are being offered , or they can choose to be shot .
In a country as poor as Afghanistan , with such weak central authority , the U.S. - backed government is vulnerable to bribery at almost every level .
The inevitable future is one in which we attack and support the Afghan drug trade at the same time .
Is this a policy for which we can ask DEA agents to give their lives ?

Is Red Hat making a play for the open source database market ?
Linux leader Red Hat ( NYSE : RHT ) is investing in open source database vendor EnterpriseDB , the official announcement is set for release on Tuesday October 27th .
The official press release does not disclose the exact amount that Red Hat is investing , but it is part of a $ 19 M series C round of funding .
EnterpriseDB is one of the leading commercial backers behind the PostgreSQL ( also known as Postgres ) database .
While the Red Hat investment in EnterpriseDB maybe new , EnterpriseDB and Red Hat are hardly strangers .
EnterpriseDB 's president Ed Boyajian is a former Red Hat exec .
Red Hat is also no stranger to PostgreSQL either .
The Red Hat Network Satellite , which is Red Hat 's key Linux management platform is moving to PostgreSQL as its back - end database away from Oracle .
With Oracle 's pending acquisition of Sun and with ( likely ) MySQL there is even further incentive for Red Hat to take a more active role in the open source database market .

Update ( at bottom ) : Senator Dodd calls for credit card rate freeze until new rules take effect
Did you pay your bills on time this month ?
Avoided taking on unnecessary debt ?
Well , there ’s a fee for that .
Anticipating the implementation of the Credit Card Accountability , Responsibility and Disclosure Act in February of next year , big banks are stepping up their aggressive treatment of those who hold cards that may be deemed too generous , or those who are studious in making payments .
ADVERTISEMENT
Specifically , if a customer receives significant benefits from their credit card — like frequent flier miles or other incentives — but still manages to pay off their balance at the end of every month , their likelihood of being charged extra is going up .
“ Starting next year , Bank of America will charge a small number of customers an annual fee , ranging from $ 29 to $ 99 , ” USA Today reported .
“ The bank has characterized the fee as experimental .
But card holders who have never carried a balance or paid late fees could be among those affected . ”
Additionally , Citibank introduced a new fee in August targeting customers who do not charge over $ 2,400 in a year .
For not leaning on debt , account holders could be charged up to $ 90 .
The bank is also handing skyrocketing rates to customers ahead of the new credit card regulations — including customers who have never carried balances month to month .
“ Basically , if there ’s money to be made via some new fee or strong - arm practice , the banks have done it , ” Los Angeles Times writer David Lazarus summarized .
“ Tony Soprano and his crew pretty much operated the same way . ”
Ed Myska , an executive vice president with El Segundo ’s Bank of Manhattan , told the Times that even with his sterling credit history , he too was a victim of Citibank ’s rates , with his own card jumping up to 30 percent interest .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Fortunately , if you ’ve paid off your balance on time every month , you probably have a good credit score , ” USA Today noted .
“ And when you have good credit , you have more choices . ”
The San Francisco Chronicle on Monday carried a number of useful tips for credit card customers .
First , shop around for a new card .
Cardratings.com lets you search for cards based on rewards still offered , frequent - flyer miles , low interest or balance transfers .
Second , cancel your credit cards and live without them .
Since one of the side effects of the pending Credit Card Accountability , Responsibility and Disclosure Act has been a reduced number of premiums on credit cards ( i.e. fewer “ points , ” lower rebates on balances , a more difficult time cashing in frequent - flyer miles ) and since deadbeats are now fair game for the fee racket , it might make sense to go all - cash , all the time .
Most bank debit cards are associated with Visa or Mastercard , so you ’ll be able to use them for e-commerce .
And yeah , credit cards can be convenient for travel , but you do n’t necessarily need a credit card to rent a car .
Third , realize that credit history is largely based on your behavior as a borrower — i.e. the length of time banks have been extending credit to you , how timely your payback history is , and how much you ’ve borrowed versus how much you could borrow .
So you can always work to build up your credit using a ) a checking and savings account that you keep in good standing ( no overdrafts ! ) , and b ) a small consumer loan that you pay back regularly and on - time .
An example of this type of loan : a car loan , a student loan , or a consumer loan through your bank .
ADVERTISEMENT
Senator Chris Dodd ( D - Conn. ) , seemingly in response to reports of credit card companies hiking rates on otherwise responsible customers , introduced legislation Monday that would temporarily freeze rate hikes and fees until the new rules take effect in late February .
“ Senator Dodd , the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , said his bill was necessary because banks were raising rates ‘ to squeeze customers , ' ” The New York Times reported .

“ At a time when families are struggling to make ends meet , jacked - up rates can quickly create crushing debt , ” Dodd reportedly said .
“ People need to be responsible with their money , but they should n’t be taken to the cleaners by outrageous fees . ”
P2P use is down this year , possibly thanks to the growing availability of online video .
Network equipment provider Sandvine observed these two trends in its " 2009 Global Broadband Phenomena " report ( via Broadband Reports ) , noting that there was a " dramatic increase " in realtime video consumption while users are moving away from bulk downloads that they can't consume right now .
While this does n't mean P2P is dead just yet , it reflects a shifting user focus as more content providers give people what they want the legal way .
" Realtime entertainment traffic " — which includes video and audio streaming , Flash media , and other various webcasts — grew to more than 26 percent in 2009 , according to Sandvine .
This reflected a 12.6 percent growth , or a near doubling of the numbers from last year .
YouTube , of course , remains a top destination for those looking for video entertainment , and North Americans consume the most videos ( per subscriber ) globally .
Europeans , however , consume the most YouTube minutes out of any region .
Comparatively , filesharing over P2P has dropped by 25 percent year - over - year , now accounting for a hair over 20 percent of all broadband traffic .
According to Sandvine 's analysis , the decline was most prominent in Latin America and the Caribbean ( 30 percent ) , while North America only experienced a 20 percent decline .
In all of these areas , however , there has been an increase in real - time entertainment consumption as well as plain vanilla Web browsing — people appear to be losing patience for big downloads ( legal or not ) when they can get more and more of the same content instantly somewhere else .
( The company also noted that BitTorrent " emerged " as the leader in this area — frankly , there has n't been a time in recent years when this was n't the case — though there are still a few other players like Gnutella and Foxy . )
This shift from P2P to video is nothing new — if anything , it 's just getting more dramatic now that there are even more options available to the average user .
The popularity of Hulu and YouTube are a given , but other streaming applications have also exploded in popularity , including Last.fm , Pandora , NPR , BBC iPlayer , and more .
As we observed in 2008 , if this shift continues , it will benefit content owners and users alike by offering more legal — and therefore money - making — options to everyone .
There 's one lingering concern , though , and that is the level of traffic being sucked up by these new ( and old ) media consumption mediums .
Heavy users are still consuming large chunks of broadband traffic compared to everyone else , whether they 're watching YouTube or downloading on BitTorrent .
Sandvine says that the top 1 percent of subscribers account for 25 percent of total Internet traffic , while in the upstream direction , those same users suck up a full 40 percent .
In a larger sense , the top 20 percent of broadband subscribers are responsible for a staggering 80 percent of total Internet traffic .
" A heavy user is responsible for more than 200 times the total bytes of an average subscriber , " reads the report .
50 Mbps , anyone ?
Every cyclist has been there : Standing on a street , looking for a rack to secure their steed with nothing in sight but a parking meter .
Grrrrrrrrrrrr !
Fixcity.org is changing that by tapping the cycling community to identify prime locations for bike racks .
The experiment in crowdsourced cycling infrastructure is run by the Open Planning Project , which is testing it out in Brooklyn 's Greenpoint - Williamsburg neighborhood before rolling it out elsewhere in the Big Apple and perhaps beyond .
" We 're currently still working to get FixCity working for all of NYC , but would love to expand it to other cities as well , ” spokeswoman Lily Bernheimer said .
So how 's it work ?
Let 's say you think there oughtta be a bike rack outside that taqueria down the street .
Click Fixcity.org 's " Suggest a Rack " link to mark the spot on the map , then upload photos of appropriate locations .
The next step is verifying the rack will actually fit in the spot you want it – for example , it 's gotta be 15 feet from a crosswalk or bus stop , 8 feet from a fire hydrant and so forth .
Verifying your location is a snap because Fixcity provides handy guidelines you can print out ( .pdf ) and consult while doing recon .
Still need help ?
There 's a – video you can watch to walk you through the process .
Although Gotham has seen a big increase in bicycling , a dearth of secure , legal bike parking keeps many from city trekking .
Transportation officials running the CityRacks program no longer accept one - off rack requests from the public , making it tough for individuals to take action .
But with Fixcity bringing together community organizations and individual riders to suggest and verify locations , the city can accept " bulk orders " for racks spanning several neighborhoods .
More than one hundred rack sites have been suggested to far , and there 's a push to get 300 racks mapped out in Brooklyn .
FixCity launched earlier this fall and says it can take up to six months for CityRacks to approve and install racks once it gets a bulk order .
Want to launch FixCity in your city ?
Bernheimer suggests doing some homework first .
The first step is ensuring the requirements for bike rack placement in your town are the same as those in New York .
Then you 've got to figure out how racks are installed in your city , whether there 's already a mechanism for suggesting rack locations .
A local variation of FixCity would have to be adapted to suit your city 's regs

The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee next week will review how the distribution of permits to cover carbon emissions could affect energy prices under a controversial climate bill that remains on a slow - walk in the Senate .
The issue of allowances is particularly important to the ultimate success of climate legislation , since lawmakers want to do all they can to keep energy costs from rising , particularly in their neck of the woods , even as they try to move away from fossil fuels that release carbon dioxide but are often cheaper than renewable and nuclear alternatives .
ADVERTISEMENT
The likely bill produced by Congress would force companies to hold permits , or allowances , to cover their emissions .
Initially the bulk of these credits would be distributed for free to help moderate costs .
Companies can buy and sell the allowances on an open market as needed to cover their emissions .
Each year , the government would give away fewer and fewer allowances , requiring companies to buy them instead in an auction .
A bill that would actually reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions is the purview of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee .
The Senate Finance Committee also has jurisdiction over the allocation of permits .
Although it lacks jurisdiction , the Senate energy panel includes a number of key players in the debate , including several Democrats who have raised concerns to varying degrees about the effect a climate change bill will have on energy prices and by extension jobs .
These include Sens. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota , Evan Bayh of Indiana , Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas andof Louisiana .
The committee will review the allocation of allowances at a hearing on Wednesday .
“ One of the critical components will be to understand the economic impacts of policies on consumers and the sector in general , ” committee spokesman David Marks said in an email .
“ Because of the relationship between energy and climate policy , many members have expressed a great deal of interest in getting educated on these issues .
” At a hearing this week on the costs of the climate change bill , Landrieu worried that it would force refiners in her state out of business .
She does n’t believe they receive enough free emissions allowances in the House bill to offset the higher compliance costs .
Foreign companies that sell gas in the United States will have to account for the emissions of their products just like domestic refiners would .
But critics of the House climate bill say it gives importers an advantage because they wo n’t have to account for emissions at their manufacturing facilities too , unlike U.S. refiners .
Some Midwestern utilities , meanwhile , want the formula for distributing allowances to the utility sector changed because they say it disadvantages power producers that rely heavily on coal .
The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee examining the allocation issue on Wednesday has already released an energy bill that includes a new renewable energy mandate , more support for energy efficiency programs and expands offshore drilling .
Although a committee has yet to review the details of a climate bill in the Senate , , the chairwoman of the Senate EPW committee , reported behind - the - scenes progress this week in a build - up for a series of hearings her committee will hold the week after next .
A mark - up , where committee members approve or disapprove a bill , will be held in early November , Boxer has said .
Home sales have been boosted by tax credits
The annual rate of US new home sales fell unexpectedly in September , raising doubts about the strength of the housing sector 's recovery .
The Commerce Department said sales fell by 3.6 % to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 402,000 homes , down from a revised 417,000 in August .
This marks the first fall in the rate of home sales since March .
The median sales price of $ 204,000 ( £ 124,000 ) was down by 9.1 % from $ 225,200 a year earlier .
Tax credits
Some analysts argue that the housing sector has been supported by the $ 8,000 tax credit for first - time buyers introduced by the government to boost demand for houses .
They argue that the latest figures simply reflect the fact that the credit is due to run out on 30 November .
Some are afraid housing will fade in 2010 .
That will not happen unless the labour market fades or does not improve
Cary Leahy , Decision Economics Bernard Markstein at the National Association of Home Builders said the Commerce Department figures " demonstrate the power of the first - time home buyers tax credit " .
" We just have n't got the economy back to the point where we can step back and say the housing market does n't need any more support , " he added .
He believes that home buyers may be wary of buying this close to the deadline in case they do not finalise the purchase in time to qualify for the credit .
Brad Hunter at real estate research firm Metrostudy said : " If they do n't extend [ the deadline ] then I think the pullback could be quite significant . "
But others are rather less concerned about the end of the tax credit .
" There are some distortions because of the home buyer tax credit , but we can say that housing sales have bottomed , " said Cary Leahy at Decision Economics .
" Some are afraid housing will fade in 2010 .
That will not happen unless the labour market fades or does not improve . "
Economic recovery
New home sales are the second set of downbeat figures released in the US in the past two days .
On Tuesday , official figures showed a sharp fall in US consumer confidence , raising concerns about the strength of consumer spending in the run up to Christmas .
However , GDP figures released on Thursday are expected to show that the US economy started growing again between July and September .

With the USA in uncertain economic straits , you would think American parents would be looking more closely at their children 's civic education .
Despite an ever increasing availability of data , media and technology , however , our kids often develop warped perspectives because they are not being exposed to the range of views present in " reality " .
This will affect their health , wealth , well - being and political views and will shape America 's future .
The problem is that " learning " today is less about going to school or reading and more like negotiating a super - barrage of media inundation where money trumps accuracy .
Fake news and slanted discussion is churned out to sell us on political narratives using the emotion - tugging methods perfected by the manipulative geniuses in advertising , marketing , mass - messaging and mutant hybrids thereof .
Many Americans do n't realize the effect the multimillionaires secretly exert on public debate of issues .
Today 's talk radio industry has made propaganda a part of everyday life , expanding political speech we used to see only in campaign ads fully into the content of three - hour shows .
But unlike truth - in - advertising regulations that mandate accuracy or balance ( as in pharmaceutical ads ) , nothing compels hosts , producers or execs to be honest - there are no industry guidelines and no legal requirements anymore .
So America 's top-rated talkers exaggerate , obfuscate and deceive our citizens every day as they ironically claim both patriotic and spiritual high ground , contradicting not only America 's noblest responsibility , but updated " sin " canons issued by the Pope in 2008 including " social injustice which causes [s ] poverty or the excessive accumulation of wealth by a few . "
During the Bush era , many of the biggest debates concerning our security and domestic policy have been hijacked by monied minorities with hidden agendas buying high - visibility messaging from friendly media surrogates .
Corporate cash translates very easily into air time , whether it 's George Soros or the secret financiers behind the Swift Boat ads .
Ping Pong Politics
There is no question the right and left battle for the hearts and minds of the electorate using propaganda instead of open discussion .
Each accuses the other of it , but neither admits any fault .
There is a difference for the critical thinker , however , and especially for responsible , no - nonsense parents .
We can either accept the current climate of dueling right vs. left spin machines , or start to insist on a shared open dialogue where accusations can be corrected - on the record - where they originated .
When Sean Hannity stacks the deck by arguing important issues without taking on any qualified adversaries , he weaves a daily narrative that assaults my morals as a citizen , teacher and a dad .
Because Hannity 's broadcasts lack basic journalistic balance , kids who listen are getting short - changed -- if not brainwashed .
With Hannity and Rush Limbaugh representing the most listened - to talk radio hosts ( by far ) , we must consider our minimums for ethics - in - broadcasting because , shamefully , these industry leaders have shaped political discourse to deeply divide the U.S. , while reducing our ability to make sound decisions because available facts are missing .
This , at a time when we need our best - ever ideas .
Hannity is clear in stating he believes in tax breaks for the wealthy so they can create jobs for the rest of us .
Thus , Hannity is a never - ending infomercial for those in the highest tax brackets , sharing his airwaves with Karl Rove , Oliver North , Newt Gingrich , Dick Morris , Jerome Corsi and a parade of the hottest neocon luminaries , but shuns all guests he knows will pop his fake plastic " torpedos of truth " .
Hannity 's core sponsors include the radically partisan Heritage Foundation ( one could easily mistake a Hannity rant for a paid ad on his show ) .
Heritage founder Paul Weyrich memorably stated : " I do n't want everybody to vote .
Elections are not won by a majority of people , they never have been from the beginning of our country and they are not now .
As a matter of fact , our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down ... "
Hannity 's artful genius is the way he gets so many middle class listeners to vote to actually lower taxes for the extremely rich , but this may not be so easy if pressure was brought onto Hannity to allow calls and guests in realistic proportion to the actual population .
No , Hannity 's show is about repetition and moving along quickly when someone tries to bring facts into this neocon bubble .
How is this different from Keith Olbermann or the left ?
It 's very different for the critical thinking American parent .
If one pundit includes the perspective of his opponent to openly make a case against it , it is not the same as another pundit who plays dumb , pretending counter - arguments simply do n't exist .
Whether it's about the economy , terrorism , war , health care , national polls or the real grit and criminality behind American politics , Hannity cherry - picks and hides key facts all day .
include Hannity 's statements in point - by - point , openly reasoned arguments against them for all to see online .
Hannity never discusses these reports on air , hoping listeners will not notice .
If informed , articulate callers do get by his By contrast , Hannity - watchers such as Fox Hounds or Media MattersHannity 's statements in point - by - point , openly reasoned arguments against them for all to see online .
Hannity never discusses these reports on air , hoping listeners will not notice .
If informed , articulate callers do get by his picky screeners to challenge him , he shifts the discussion , conveniently goes to a break , cuts them off , drowns them out , shouts over them , hangs up , interrupts them or just deletes them entirely using the delay button .
This is why you 've never heard any of a number of scandals or important stories on Hannity 's broadcasts : the Downing Street memos , the orders to illegally torture and sexually humiliate detainees , the Italian letter , the Ohio 2004 election fraud case , vote caging lists , violations of the Presidential Records Act , the DC Madam call lists , Abramoff 's payoffs , Halliburton 's fraud / negligence and countless other major stories which completely expose Hannity as a loyal neocon stooge , floating on a raft of glaring political hypocrisies .
Frequent guest Karl Rove , George Bush , Dick Cheney and other Administration cronies find comfort with Sean because he does n't bring up the criminal accusations .
Worst of all , Hannity advocates expanding war today without taking a grain of responsibility for hard - selling it for over eight years based on " bad intel " , even after top - level defectors have confirmed Bush 's Iraq team deliberately perpetrated a hoax on the USA .
The Fake Equivalency Trick
Left - wingers Rachel Maddow and Keith Olbermann therefore do not " do it too " as these talk radio hosts assert .
There is a huge difference between Hannity and Maddow 's methodology , the way she provides relevant background on issues before introducing opinion or analysis , or airs corrections when proven wrong .
Rachel Maddow also has made multiple open calls for right - wingers to appear as guests in civil debate on her MSNBC show and airs their refusals to appear as proof of greater journalistic even - handedness .
Even Ann Coulter deserves more credit for courage than Hannity or Limbaugh who cower from smart liberals .
In this rare unscripted exchange you 'll see Bill Maher coaxing Ann Coulter to admit George Bush 's presidency had " big problems " to the delight of the liberal audience .
As a concerned parent , I want my children to witness balanced discussion like this so they can learn and make their minds up .

Damn , the economy 's getting to everyone these days .
Even the lord and savior of a bunch of people , Jesus Christ ( 33 ) , who apparently endorsed Riverview Community Bank only to see it shut down , reports Minneapolis ' Citypages .
Holy shit , holy bummer .
No , seriously : this guy Chuck Ripka of Otsego , Minnesota was once in the news for advocating prayer in the workplace .
He wrote a book about how God told him to open his bank , and that God would " take care of the bottom line . "
The above picture was placed prominently in their offices .
And yesterday , Ripka 's bank was shut down by the Minnesota Department of Commerce regulators after screwing themselves via mass real - estate lending .
It 's been bought out by another bank already .
This was sometime after a gas leak killed three bank workers in one of Ripka 's offices a few years back .
Lesson learned : if Jesus saves , he does n't do it in Minnesota .
Or he wo n't be doing it anymore .
Meanwhile , watch Ripka in action below , and decide exactly how godless you prefer your finance professionals to be next time .
Global handset leader Nokia announced Thursday it has filed a lawsuit against rival Apple , alleging that the iPhone infringes on GSM and wireless LAN related patents owned by the Finnish company .
The cell phone maker has alleged that Apple has violated ten patents owned by Nokia .
Specifically , the company claims ownership of technology relating to the Global System for Mobile communications , or GSM ; wireless local area network , or WLAN ; and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System , or UMTS .
In a press release , the world 's largest cell phone manufacturer said it has invested more than 40 billion Euros in research into research and development in the last two decades , earning it one of the " strongest and broadest patent portfolios in the industry . "
Nokia said it has entered into license agreements with about 40 companies for these patents .
" The basic principle in the mobile industry is that those companies who contribute in technology development to establish standards create intellectual property , which others then need to compensate for , " said Ilkka Rahnasto , vice president of Legal & Intellectual Property at Nokia .
" Apple is also expected to follow this principle .
By refusing to agree appropriate terms for Nokia 's intellectual property , Apple is attempting to get a free ride on the back of Nokia 's innovation . "
The ten patents relate to devices compatible with GSM , UTMS ( 3G WCDMA ) and wireless LAN standards , and cover wireless data , speech coding , security and encryption .
Nokia has alleged that all iPhone models released since 2007 infringe on these patents .
The suit was filed in a U.S. District Court in Delaware .
Analyst Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray reacted to the news Thursday with a new note to investors .
He said that Nokia 's endgame with the suit is patent royalties from Apple .
" We believe that Nokia is not seeking an injunction ; rather , we believe that the company has been in talks with Apple concerning a patent royalty payment for over a year , " Munster said .
" With today 's announcement , it appears that the companies have not come to a resolution and Nokia is attempting to hasten the process .
Nokia is likely looking to obtain a patent royalty of 1 % - 2 % ( $ 6 to $ 12 ) on every iPhone sold in compensation for its IPs concerning GSM , 3G and WiFi technologies on mobile devices . "
He went on to say that the most extreme scenario of $ 12 per iPhone is unlikely , and any unfavorable resolution for Apple would not change his stance on the stock .
Piper Jaffray has an overweight rating on AAPL with a price target of $ 277 .
As the iPhone has grown in popularity , Nokia has retained its status as market leader , but has lost significant share of the market it has dominated .
As recently as August , Nokia 's Symbian mobile platform was said to have a 50 percent market share , well down from the 72 percent the platform had in 2006 .
In the second quarter of 2009 , the iPhone represented 14 percent of global smartphone sales .
These week , everyone 's trying to get a piece of the " Twilight " action .
And while parodying the Stephenie Meyer vampire saga is nothing new , we 're sure the great brains at the Harvard Lampoon ( an undergraduate humor publication and social organization founded in 1876 at Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts ) will do something original with their first novel in 40 years , " Nightlight . "
The book , published by Random House 's Vintage Books imprint , will hit your local bookstore on November 3 .
According to EW.com , it will focus on a young lady named Belle Goose , who is described as " pale and klutzy . "
When she moves to Switchblade , Oregon , she meets a fellow high school student named Edwart Mullen .
Belle , who has an obsession with vampires , convinces herself that the " super - hot computer nerd with zero interest in girls " is one because does things she considers supernatural like leaving his Tater Tots untouched at lunch and saving her from a flying snowball .
The last time Harvard 's undergraduate humor magazine published a satirical novel was in 1969 when it published the " The Lord of the Rings " spoof " Bored of the Rings . "
" ' Funny ' might get you a blog post these days , but it 's the Lampoon - level of satire that makes ' Nightlight ' worth every pseudo - bloodsucking , angst - ridden page , " says a statement from Vintage .
" ' Nightlight ' stakes at the heart of what makes ' Twilight ' tick ... or , really , cuts to the core of it .
...
Brooding and hilarious , let ' Nightlight ' be your guide through the ' Twilight ' fandom that has eclipsed the mind of every teenager you have ever met . "
Notes of Anatoly S. Chernyaev
Shevardnadze :
In the country and in the provinces they created authoritative organizations for reconciliation .
They are working actively .
There is a special committee for refugees .
Many [ rebel ] bands — although they are not big — stopped armed struggle .
Najib leaves a very good impression .
However , not everybody supports him , even in the leadership .
Some people are vacillating .
But , as he rightly puts it , he does not have different people .
He has taken the initiative into his own hands .
I think that the leaders of the mojahadeen made a miscalculation having declined reconciliation .
The economy of the country is in a state of destruction .
Very little is left of the friendly feelings toward the Soviet people which existed for decades .
Very many people have died , and not all of them were bandits .
Not a single problem was solved in favor of the peasants .
In essence , [ we ] waged war against the peasants .
The state apparatus is functioning poorly .
Our adviser assistance is ineffective .
Najib was complaining about the petty patronizing on the part of our advisers .
I am not going to discuss now whether we did the right thing by going there .
But it is a fact that we went there absolutely not knowing the psychology of the people , or the real situation in the country .
And everything that we were and are doing in Afghanistan is inconsistent with the moral face of our country .
Gromyko : Inconsistent — that we went in ?
Shevardnadze :
And that too .
The attitude toward us is more negative that we think .
. .
It is good that we sent agencies to Afghanistan .
But we need a political decision .
Otherwise we will reap the fruits of a serious political and military defeat .
Now the factor of time decides everything .
Najib is counting days — how many are left ?
And we spend 1 billion rubles a year on all this .
The sum is enormous , and we have to take responsibility for that .
And [ we need ] to count once more in all details , how much Afghanistan costs us right now , at this moment .
Nikolai Ivanovich does not have such data so far .
In the United States they counted that the war costs us 2 billion rubles , and the Japanese think that it costs us 3 billion rubles per year .
I am not even talking about the human lives .
Gorbachev :
The Indians think that we should not withdraw our troops completely , or in any case , to “ move fast without rushing . ”
Shevardnadze :
The words addressed to the people do not reach the people .
The people do not have radios .
. .
In a word , it is still not too late to make a final determination .
The main thing is material and political support for Najib .
There is no other solution .
Gorbachev :
We are not going to discuss now how did their revolution emerge , how we reacted , how we went back and forth — to introduce the troops or not to introduce the troops .
Gromyko :
Yes , yes .
Gorbachev :
Now we have to start from what we have there and what measures we should take .
Gromyko : I agree with the characterization of Najib .
A hired army is an unknown quality .
Our material assistance will not bring any substantial changes in the situation .
Assistance and the troops — yes .
And after we withdraw .
. .
We have to weigh what kind of assistance will we provide then .
We have to do everything to withdraw .
But what will happen to the revolution and to Najib ?
I do not believe that the question of Afghanistan is being decided in Islamabad .
It is being decided in Washington .
We have to start a conversation , a closed one , with the Americans , about the Durand line .
[ We ] should not stop contacts with India on this issue .
. .
There is very little that we can achieve here with China .
Probably , with Najib ’s consent , we should make an effort to create some kind of coalition government acceptable to us .
. .
Recall the advisers who are not appropriate for implementing our new line .
Ryzhkov : Eduard Amvrosievich ’s report gives us a realistic picture .
The past information was not objective .
The situation forces us to approach this problem seriously once again .
We should not simplify anything .
Najib ’s personality is of course important .
. .
But. . .
The society is illiterate .
The revolution resulted in the deterioration of the situation for the people .
We have to take a firm line to withdraw from there within two years .
It is better to pay in cash , in kerosene , not in men .
Our people do not understand what we are doing there .
Why are we sitting there for seven years .
We cannot just leave and throw everything to its fate .
This would repulse many countries from us .
We have to undertake [ certain ] steps so that when we leave , the course would lead to a creation of a neutral friendly Afghanistan .
What steps should we take ?
The Army .
Why not a hired army ?
What would prevent them from deserting ?
Good money .
They do not believe in slogans .
. .
All in all , I would not reject the idea of a hired army out of hand .
I support the proposal to invite Keshtamand ( the Prime Minister ) .
To listen what requests they have .
And to count how much overall we spend for Afghanistan .
It would be better for us to give them weapons , ammunition .
And let them fight on their own , if they want .
And in parallel to actively lead the [ process of ] political reconciliation .
We should utilize everything : the contacts with Pakistan , with the USA .
And to follow our line , without retreating .
Ligachev :
We cannot bring them freedom by the military way .
We have suffered defeat in this case .
And Eduard Amvrosievich ’s information is for the first time objective , even though it is a hard one .
Somehow we did not think about the consequences , and relied on the military approach .
I believe the policy of national reconciliation is the right one .
The first day has shown that it was the right step .
The preparations have begun .
We have already gained some things .
Of course , we should leave in such a way so as not to allow a destruction of the progressive forces .
We have to make all efforts to help them create an army .
The thought of a hired army is acceptable .
If we pose this question to the people : what is better — to let the men die , our soldiers , or to give them all kinds of assistance ?
I think all to the last man will speak in favor of the second way .
We have to undertake work to organize the economic life of that state .
Revitalize their economic life .
To propose a plan , and not just a one - time assistance .
Because in the years of the war , we have not created anything there .
. .
And to work on the direction of Pakistan , with India , with China , with America .
But to leave like the Americans left Vietnam — no , as the saying goes , we are not yet “ ripe ” for that .
Marshal Sokolov :
The military situation has deteriorated recently .
The number of shelling of our garrisons has doubled .
They are mainly shooting from the hamlets , calculating that we would not fire at the settlements in response .
The recent days have shown that the reaching out to people with the idea of national reconciliation has been lagging behind the development of the situation .
There is no work being done with the population .
This war can not be won militarily .
There are some individual cases when small bands stop their military ambushes .
They sense that the people are tired of the war .
We can take advantage of this to push through the idea of national reconciliation .
It is too early to dramatize the situation .
Too few days have passed from the moment when the idea was put forward .
The first task is to put pressure on the Afghan leadership to reach out to people with the program of national reconciliation .
If that does not happen — the army will not achieve anything there .
The Afghan army costs us 3.5 billion rubles .
And 1.5 [ bln rubles ] more is planned for this year .
They have everything to fight as they should .
. . .
To withdraw three regiments , but , as some people propose , to continue aerial attacks from the Soviet territory ?
One is inconsistent with the other .
The 40th army has already lost 1,280 men in 1986 .
. . .
The decision to withdraw should be implemented firmly , but meanwhile , we should utilize all other means — diplomatic , along the KGB lines , public relations , political [ means ] , and material assistance .
And not to retreat from the adopted line .
We have to sort out the economic assistance : they are asking for three times more than they need .
Yes , we will have to help .
But — so that there is [ some ] benefit .
In 1981 , we gave them 100 mln. [ rubles ] of free assistance .
And all of that went to the elite .
And there was nothing in the hamlets — no kerosene , no matches .
Chebrikov :
We are discussing the Afghan question more than other [ issues ] .
Comrades have figured it out well .
It seems like we received a lot of new material .
However , if you look at the [ previous ] documents , all this has been already presented before .
There are no new discoveries about the situation .
All this , Mikhail Sergeyevich , you have already said to Karmal .
That ’s how the idea of national reconciliation emerged .
The knowledge of the situation was always there .
But we did not always act right — so that it would produce some way out .
Najib has agreed to this step ( national reconciliation ) finally .
We pressured Karmal to do it for a whole year , and with no result .
Big changes have taken place in Afghanistan after January 15 .
We should not discount the importance of the fact that some bands are stopping military actions .
Today in Pravda , there is a report about 400 representatives , who came to Kabul .
Refugees started returning .
Although Pakistan does not let them through .
The refugees are saying that they are tired of living in exile for eight years .
We should take advantage of this moment .
Gorbachev : Maybe it is for the better that it ( Pakistan ) does not let them ( refugees ) through .
Najib does not know what to do with them .
And they are a factor of concern in Pakistan and Iran .
So , we confirm out firm line .
Not to retreat since we started [ this ] .
It is hard to draw conclusions from the steps we have taken recently .
Our principal decisions that encompass all the problems will push the process forward .
I told Najib that they have to strengthen the army , that we will support it , and that they should talk with the traders who receive our goods , so that the population saw that it is our goods , our assistance .
[ Let us ] act on all directions .
Figure out seriously where [ to send ] and how to use our assistance , to launch foreign policy mechanisms through Cordovez , through Pakistan .
To try [ to talk ] with the Chinese , and of course to work for an agreement with the Americans .
There is the tiredness of Afghanistan everywhere — in Afghanistan itself , and in Pakistan , and in our country , and in the entire world .
When we went into Afghanistan , we were bound by ideological aspects , we assumed that it was possible to jump up three stages at once — from feudalism to socialism .
Now we can look at the situation openly .
And [ let us ] carry out a realistic line .
We have accepted everything in Poland — the Catholic church , the individual peasant agriculture , the ideology , and the political pluralism .
Reality is reality .
The comrades are right in saying : it is better to pay cash than the lives of our men .
[ Let us ] push Najib and to finish it all in two years .
We entrust the Commission ( for Afghanistan ) to draft our decisions .

Eva Mendes was in New York last night for a screening of ‘ Bad Lieutenant : Port Of Call New Orleans ’ , and if someone wanted to make the case that she ’s the best looking person on earth , I would find it hard to argue .
What helped is that she did n’t wear a bra and her shirt was held in place with little more than optimism .
Predictably , that did not work , so the pictures you really want are about halfway through the gallery .
Sometimes I feel pictures like this are the only reason you come here .
What happened to the quiet mornings when we would just sit on the back deck and read the paper together .
Answer me .
ANSWER ME !
* brendon runs away crying , slams the bedroom door *
( this post took forever because I started yelling at my monitor for hollywood to kiss my ass .
do n’t hit the “ read more ” .
you ’re not gonna care . )
On a side note that no one but me will care about , I sure do hope this movie is filled with condescending accents .
Because I grew up 20 minutes from New Orleans , and I find it real flattering when Hollywood makes movies about people in the south , and then they have every single person – gang members , students , white , black , professors , judges , doctors – all talk in the same cadence as Forrest Gumps black friend .
It ’s so accurate , it ’s like I ’m staring into a mirror !
It ’s just like how every single person in LA talks like Bill and Ted , and every single person in New York talks like Joe Pesci .
Ellen DeGenneres is from New Orleans .
Reese Witherspoon is from Baton Rouge .
Jared Leto , Ian Somerholder and Ashley Scott are all from Louisiana too .
James Earl Jones is from Mississippi .
David Cross is from Georgia .
George Clooney and Nicole Scherzinger are from Kentucky .
Megan Fox is from Tennessee .
You may notice NO ONE here actually from the south sounds like EVERY ONE from the south according to Hollywood .
I ’m gonna write a TV show about an all black law firm in Beverly Hills , where all the lawyers went to Yale and Stanford , but then for some reason every single one of them talk like Katt Williams and Eddie Griffin .
“ DA BITCH IS CRAAAZZY , DAS WHY !
AND SHE DONE DID IT !
SHE TOOK DIS GUN , AND SHE SHOT DAT MOTHAFUKKA ! ”
And when the highly educated layer in the 5000 dollar suit says “ shot dat mother fukka ” he ’ll stamp his foot on each new word to emphasize it .
A show like that should be fine right ?
From what I can tell labeling huge groups of people based on a small minority is perfectly fine .

The claim that Apple is a monopoly is gaining momentum .
Just recently , the smartphone giant was sued by a group of developers .
They claim the company ’s iOS app store is a monopoly .
That ’s because it has banned rivals from distributing its iOS apps .
Notwithstanding , Apple has done well as a company .
It has a penchant for producing premium quality products , which are second to none .
But these claims of them being a monopoly could bite hard on their reputation .
So the big question is ;
Is Apple a monopoly ?
Here ’s what you need to know .
Looking at Apple ’s market share in the mobile phone market , you will understand that the company is n’t big enough to be a monopoly .
For a company to have that status , it needs to be able to dictate or influence the prices of the said products to a greater extent .
Apple ’s market share in the mobile phone business is only 12 percent .
Nevertheless , it ’s safe to say that the company ’s app store is a monopoly .
That ’s because they have been able to knock down other competitors from the market for reasons they claim are the best for iOS device users .
Read further to get more information about this topic .
Apple And Its Monopoly Status : What ’s A Monopoly ?
Before we discuss further on Apple assuming a monopoly status , let ’s define what being a monopoly is .
This definition will enable us to conclude whether Apple is a monopoly or not .
So what ’s a monopoly ?
A monopoly refers to a company that stands as the only one offering a product or service .
No close substitute exists in the market .
That ’s the definition of a monopoly .
In a monopolistic market , there ’s only one player .
The company is the only one offering a particular service or product .
So , interested consumers can only buy such products or get the needed services from the said company .
Another thing that defines a monopolist is that they have the power to dictate prices .
In other words , they can decide they want to sell their products for XYZ amount , and interested consumers would have no other option but to comply .
The company might decide to peg the price of its products at a certain amount that would cause them not to incur a loss .
But if there were to be a competition , the cost of the product might reduce .
And this would favor the consumers and result in a healthy economy .
So , monopoly eliminates competition .
It is also not the best option for a country interested in building a healthy economy .
That ’s why it is discouraged in most countries .
How Do Monopolies Originate ?
You might be wondering how monopolists do get their status .
Here ’s the thing ; companies that become monopolists set barriers that make it difficult or impossible for other companies to gain access to the same market .
The reason they create this barrier is to prevent competition .
These monopolists know that offering other companies a chance to enter into the market will cause them to lose control over the price of their product .
And that , of course , could affect their revenue drastically .
Let ’s take a look at other reasons a monopoly exists .
The Government Franchise :
It ’s difficult to presume that the government would be responsible for creating a monopoly , knowing that it eliminates competition and does n’t encourage economic growth .
Notwithstanding , the government could create a monopoly .
It could give a government - owned or private company the sole right to conduct businesses or offer a specific product in the said niche .
The national railways ’ transport service is an example of a government - owned company that operates as a monopoly .
The company may have the sole right to offer transportation services to passengers throughout the country .
In these types of cases , companies interested in entering the business needs to seek permission from the government .
And even when granted , they are only allowed to offer other passenger train services , and not compete with the government - funded company that ’s already in operation .
On the other hand , the government could grant a private company the right to produce and sell certain products in the market .
Such monopolies could be as a result of special interests or corruption on the path of the government .
Some monopolies lead to innovation .
So , let ’s not get it twisted .
Owning a critical resource :
We have seen companies that hoard knowledge regarding the production of a specific product .
No one can force them to share the knowledge of what they know .
It ’s their sole right .
Let ’s use the production of a specific drug as an example .
If company ABC knows the main ingredient to produce a drug considered acceptable for the treatment of a particular disease , then it could create a monopoly over that ingredient .
Other companies do n’t know the ingredient and thus cannot produce a drug considered acceptable for the treatment of the condition .
So , this case can give rise to a monopoly .
Securing a patent or copyright :
Intellectual property can be anything .
It could be software , music , product , or idea that belongs to a person .
The individual can approach the government and get his or her concept patented or copyrighted .
Copyright or patent grants an individual the right to produce and sell certain products in the market .
The only thing of concern about these monopolies is that they are temporary .
In other words , an individual can only hold on to copyright or patented product for specific periods .
An example is Amazon ’s 1 - Click technology , an innovation that made the company an e-commerce giant .
Amazon applied for the patent in 1997 but got the approval in 1999 .
However , the patent expired in 2017 .
When a product , technology , or idea has a patent , any other company that uses it without seeking permission from the patent holder might be sued by the owner of the patent .
Characteristics Monopoly Market Structures Have
Before concluding that Apple is a monopoly , let ’s take a look at the characteristics monopoly market structures possess .
In other words , what are the factors that define a monopoly market ?
Here they are ;
Competition
One of the characteristics you will observe in a monopoly market is the lack of competition .
The product of the monopolist does n’t have close competition .
Profits
Another characteristic that defines a monopolist is profit .
You may think that all is rosy with such a company , but that might not be the case .
In other words , a monopolist could turn out to be a revenue - maximizing or loss - generating venture .
Fixing prices
When you are the sole owner of a product , you might be forced to fix the price you want .
That ’s the case with monopolists .
They are price makers because they believe their products do n’t have a close substitute .
No substitute
Apple has been in this position before , particularly in the tablet market .
The company was the only producer of the iPad , a product that was a must - have for many .
The thing is products that lack substitutes are always very unique .
And that ’s the case with Apple ’s iPad .
Single seller
A monopolist handles the responsibility of producing the entire output for specific service or good .
The whole market receives products or services from that single firm .
Barriers to market entry or exit
A monopoly protects the market for that specific good or service .
Such a firm can set barriers that would make it difficult for other companies to enter the market .
The reason is to eliminate competition and become the sole distributor of the said product .
These barriers can be created via various means , such as resource ownership , copyrights , and patents , a decrease in average total cost , higher start - up cost , government franchise , or license .
Let ’s take Feet - First Pharmaceutical as an example .
The company does have a few of the barriers mentioned above favoring it .
Amblathan - Plus is the company ’s product to which it holds an exclusive patent .
The government has made it known that only Feet - First Pharmaceutical is allowed to produce and sell the drug .
Feet - First Pharmaceutical also faces a barrier to leave the market .
Because it ’s product is highly beneficial for public health , the government could block every move the company makes to stop producing the drug .
How Monopoly Derives Its Power
A monopoly generates power to control the market through various means .
These include ;
Legal barriers
Economies of scale
Capital requirements
Lack of substitute goods
Technological superiority
Network externalities
Deliberate actions
Natural resources control
Conclusion
Is Apple a monopoly ?
That ’s the question .
In terms of market share for mobile business , Apple does n’t have the power to monopolize the market .
But when you consider the iOS App store , the company calls the shot .
No other company is competing with them for the distribution of iOS apps .
In short , they have banned all rivals , a move which is starting to anger most developers who have their apps in the Apple app store .

Enlarge By Damian Dovarganes , AP People shop at the Costco Wholesale store in Burbank , Calif .
Costco said Oct. 28 it will start accepting food stamps nationwide after testing them in New York .
KIDS ON FOOD STAMPS KIDS ON FOOD STAMPS FOOD STAMP ELIGIBILITY FOOD STAMP ELIGIBILITY
Food stamp eligibility for a family of four : • Monthly gross income : $ 2,389 or less • Cash resources , such as a bank account : $ 2,000 Source : U.S. Department of Agriculture Half of American kids will live in households receiving food stamps before age 20 , according to a study reported Monday in Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine .
Although one in five children rely on food stamps for years , many more live in families who turn to food stamps during a short - term crisis , says author Mark Rank of Washington University in St. Louis .
He analyzed 30 years of data from the University of Michigan 's Panel Study of Income Dynamics survey .
RETAILERS : Costco to accept food stamps nationwide VIDEO :
Healthy breakfast on $ 1 HEALTHY LUNCH :
On just $ 2 " This is what children can expect over a period of time , not just during a recession , " Rank says .
" It shows that the period of childhood , rather than a period of safety and security , is really a time , for a lot of kids , of economic turmoil and risk . "
Rank says his study , the first of its kind , may underestimate how many families struggle with grocery bills .
Only about 67 % of people who are eligible for food stamps actually receive them , the Department of Agriculture says .
Good nutrition in childhood is crucial , doctors say .
Nutritional programs such as food stamps — officially known as the USDA 's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — improve children 's health and help them do better in school , says James Weill of the advocacy group Food Research and Action Center , who was n't involved in the new study .
More than 35.8 million Americans used food stamps in July — nearly 6.8 million more than a year earlier , Weill 's group says .
About half of food stamp recipients are children , Rank says .
" There is a large pool of people who are poor or who are living close to poverty at any given time , " Weill says .
" People do n't like talking about it .
They do n't tell their neighbors , ' I was on food stamps 10 years ago . ' " Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation , a Washington think tank , says the study design and survey data are solid .
But he says the findings are neither surprising nor troubling .
" That 's effectively like saying that at some point in a 20 - year period , a parent would be unemployed for a month or so , " Rector says .
" There 's no evidence that even consistent poverty in the U.S. produces a nutritional risk , " he says , noting that rich and poor children tend to have about the same intake of protein , vitamins and minerals .

wtf ?
This is one of the reasons I can't bear a lot of pro-abstinence types .
There really is a LOT to be said for waiting ... but these people make it look so stupid .
@tracer : No , at least most of the teens who are pro-abstinence are serious .
I live in a very conservative area ... I went to HS with a bunch of people who talked about it , and I knew some of them well enough to know that they meant it .
As a " young adult " myself , I have to say that the appeal of this stuff is obvious .
AIDS etc. are * frightening * , and it's true - trivially - that if everyone waited till marriage and was monogamous , those things would die out .
The problem is that you 'll never get everyone to agree to do that ... it 's human nature .

When additional factors turn a drunk driving charge into a felony DWI , it becomes even more important that you do everything you can to build the best possible defense .
You want an attorney who knows the court system and has fought complex cases beyond drunk driving charges .
At the Dallas Law Offices of Randall B. Isenberg , we handle major felony DWI cases , including intoxication assault , and vehicular manslaughter .
What Can the Right Defense Do for You ?
Contact the Law Offices of Randall B. Isenberg to Find Out how a Dallas DWI lawyer can help you !
There are a number of specific circumstances that can turn a normal DUI into a felony DWI .
The most common felony DWI charge stems from the accused having two prior DWI or DUI convictions .
These convictions could have happened anywhere and at any time .
Other additional circumstances that can lead to a felony alcohol intoxication assault including :
Vehicular Homicide
Intoxication Manslaughter
Intoxication Assault ( drunk driving accident with serious bodily injury ) .
Child under 15 in Car at Time of DWI
With 30 years of criminal law experience , attorney Randall B. Isenberg has won felony DWI trials in Dallas County and Collin County .
We know how to build a strong and comprehensive defense strategy .
In addition to the traditional DWI defense strategies , such as challenging the initial stop , and breath and blood tests , we will pursue strategies specific to felony DWI charges .
We will focus on the parts of the indictment that must be proved in order to convert the DWI misdemeanor into a felony .
Known as enhancement paragraphs , our goal is to find triable issues where guilt beyond a reasonable doubt will be difficult to prove .
Phone records reveal that a very narrow set of financial firms have the Treasury Secretary 's ear .
We hear a lot of generalized complaints that Wall Street or the banks have captured the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve .
These have a ring of truth to them in the way that all heavily regulated businesses tend to control the arms of the government that officially oversee them .
But these generalized claims miss something important : not all banks are equal in the eyes of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner .
Today the AP revealed that Geithner does n't give equal access to all of the banks , or even all of the largest banks .
Likewise , being one of the biggest , most well - connected investment banks does n't get you close to Geithner .
Instead , it 's a small select group of financial firms that have Geithner 's ear , at least judging by a review of his phone records .
Who is Geithner chatting with on the phone .?
Goldman Sachs
JP Morgan Chase
Citigroup
Most obviously left off the list are Bank of America , Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley .
" Geithner 's phone calls were primarily to and from people he knew well already - who had cultivated a relationship with him over the years , shared nonprofit board memberships , and participated in the same social activities , " Simon Johnson writes at Baseline Scenario .
" These are close professional colleagues and in some cases , presumably , friends . "
Here 's the whole AP report :
WASHINGTON ( AP ) --
Even during his most frenzied days , when Congress is demanding answers or the president himself is calling , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner makes time to talk to a select group of powerful Wall Street bankers .
They are a small cadre of businessmen who have known and worked with Geithner for years , whose multibillion - dollar companies all survived the economic crisis with help from U.S. taxpayers .
When they call , Geithner answers .
He has spoken with them immediately after hanging up with President Barack Obama and before heading up to Capitol Hill , between phone calls with senators and after talking with the Federal Reserve chairman , according to a review by The Associated Press of seven months of his appointment calendars .
The calendars , obtained by the AP under the Freedom of Information Act , offer a behind - the - scenes glimpse at the continued influence of three companies -- Citigroup Inc. , JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. -- whose executives can reach the nation 's most powerful economic official on the phone , sometimes several times a day .
There is nothing inherently wrong with senior Treasury Department officials speaking regularly with industry executives , or even with the secretary keeping tabs on the market 's biggest players , even though critics say Geithner risks succumbing too much to these bankers ' self - interested worldview .
" It 's appropriate for Treasury officials to keep in touch with those who work in the markets every day , particularly when the economy and the markets are so fragile , " Treasury spokesman Andrew Williams said .
What the calendars show , however , is that only a select few can call the treasury secretary .
After one hectic week in May in which the U.S. faced the looming bankruptcy of General Motors and the prospect that the government would take over the automaker , Geithner wrapped up his night with a series of phone calls .
First he called Lloyd Blankfein , the chairman and CEO at Goldman .
Then he called Jamie Dimon , the boss at JPMorgan .
Obama called next , and as soon as they hung up , Geithner was back on the phone with Dimon .
While all this was going on , Geithner got a call from Rep. Xavier Becerra , a California Democrat who serves on committees that help set tax and budget policies .
Becerra left a message .
In the first seven months of Geithner 's tenure , his calendars reflect at least 80 contacts with Blankfein , Dimon , Citigroup Chairman Richard Parsons or Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit .
Geithner had more contacts with Citigroup than he did with Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , the lawmaker leading the effort to approve Geithner 's overhaul of the financial system .
Geithner 's contacts with Blankfein alone outnumber his contacts with Sen. Christopher Dodd , D - Conn. , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee .
Partly this is explained by the extraordinary clout of these companies .
Goldman , JPMorgan and Citigroup are among the dominant players on Wall Street .
Their executives can move not just markets but entire economies .
Treasury invested heavily in all of them to keep the industry afloat .
But size does not tell the whole story .
Treasury has a huge financial stake in North Carolina - based Bank of America Corp. , but CEO Ken Lewis appears on Geithner 's calendars only three times .
Morgan Stanley CEO John
Mack also appears three times .
Geithner 's relationship with Goldman , JPMorgan , Citigroup and their executives dates to his tenure as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
As one of Wall Street 's top regulators , Geithner worked closely with executives and built relationships he brought with him to his corner office at the Treasury Department .
The prominence of those relationships is clear by the company they keep on Geithner 's calendars .
On March 24 , just after Geithner announced plans to help banks sell off toxic debts left over from the housing market meltdown -- which stood to be a boon for big banks -- his calendars reflect a busy morning .
He had a briefing on terrorism financing , a meeting on tightening financial regulations and a prep session for congressional testimony .
Geithner emerged to take just three phone calls , from Vice President Joe Biden , New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and shortly before heading to Capitol Hill , from Dimon .
Officials at JPMorgan , Citigroup and Goldman had no comment on Geithner 's calendars .
Geithner 's predecessor at Treasury , Henry Paulson , similarly kept in close touch with Wall Street power brokers .
Though his calendars showed many contacts with bankers at the height of the banking crisis , they showed frequent calls with Blankfein at key times .
Paulson came to Treasury from Goldman .
At the New York Fed and then at Treasury , Geithner helped put together multibillion - dollar taxpayer bailouts for Wall Street investment firms , including Goldman , JPMorgan and Citi .
Even banks that have repaid the money still enjoy massive subsidies .
Their quick returns to record profits and million - dollar bonuses sparked outrage .
Critics said the government was too quick to help the banks and was unwilling to let them suffer the consequences of their bad bets .
Geithner 's calendars could contribute to the perception that the treasury secretary is too close to Wall Street , said Simon Johnson , a former chief economist with the International Monetary Fund and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management .
" Your worldview in the middle of a crisis depends on whom you talk to and what their perspective is , and you need a broad cross-section of opinions to truly understand what 's happening , " Johnson said .
By seeking information from such a narrow group of contacts , Johnson said , Geithner risks limiting his exposure to the views of his trusted banker colleagues .
Geithner must believe he can set aside their inherent biases , he said , adding , " I do n't see how you do that . "
In my last post , I used barriers and shared channels to write a simple program for performing force - based graph layout .
There were two things lacking in that example : firstly , repulsion between unconnected nodes and secondly , some cool videos .
I ’ve now solved both of these shortcomings .
In order to implement repulsion between all nodes , each node must know the position of all other nodes at every time - step .
I could implement this with message - passing , but that would be O ( N^2 ) communications each phase , which is n’t very efficient , and at that point , message - passing is probably not the right design .
We need some shared variables instead .
Software Transactional Memory ( STM ) provides a nice way to do shared variable concurrency in Haskell , so we will use that .
The idea is that we will have a transactional variable ( TVar ) per node , holding the node ’s position .
Every time - step , each node will read from all the TVars to discover the positions of all the other nodes , and will then update its own position based on the other nodes .
If we are not careful , we will have the same race hazard that I warned against last time : one node could update its position before all the other nodes have read its previous position .
Or , if left totally unconstrained , one node could perform several updates before other nodes have even performed one .
To prevent these problems , we will again use barriers to break up the simulation into two phases : discover , and act .
This means that we will be combining CHP and STM : using barriers from CHP to regulate access to shared variables from STM .
All the code before the node process is exactly the same as last time , except that I now import Control .
Concurrent .STM and Control .
Parallel .
Strategies ( for some strict application ) — and I ’ve made the nodes a bit smaller .
Our node process no longer takes channels as its parameters , but TVars instead .
It takes a list corresponding to the other nodes , of pairs of booleans ( indicating if the other node is connected to this one ) and transactional variables ( to read the other node ’s position ) .
It also takes a single transactional variable , which it should use to write its own position to :
node :: NodeInfo -> [ ( Bool , TVar NodeInfo ) ] -> TVar NodeInfo -> Enrolled PhasedBarrier Phase -> CHP ( ) node start neighbours me bar = node ' start where ( connected , tvs ) = unzip neighbours node ' cur = do Discover <- syncBarrier bar neighbourPos <- liftSTM ( mapM readTVar tvs ) let new = updatePos ( zip connected neighbour Pos ) cur Act <- syncBarrier bar liftSTM ( writeTVar me ( new `using` rnf ) ) node ' new
You can see that the node process is a bit simpler .
In the Discover phase it reads from the TVars and in the Act phase it writes to its own .
It is immediately apparent that the reads and writes are thus segregated .
liftSTM is defined below ( it is essentially the atomically function ) , and the `using` rnf is a strictness thing that you can ignore .
The updatePos function is now more complicated as we have added repulsion ( though it is all irrelevant to the concurrent logic ) :
updatePos poss cur = sum [ cur ,0.05 * sum [ let v = p - cur in v - ideal * normalise v | ( True , p ) <- poss ] -- connected nodes , 0.000002 * sum [ let sc = ( p `from` cur ) ^^ ( - 2 ) in NodeInfo sc sc * normalise ( cur - p ) | ( _ , p ) <- poss ] -- all nodes ] where ideal = 0.02 ( NodeInfo x2 y2 ) `from` ( NodeInfo x1 y1 ) = sqrt $ ( x2 - x1 ) ^ ^2 + ( y2 - y1 ) ^ ^ 2 normalise ( NodeInfo x y ) = fmapNodeInfo ( / mag ) ( NodeInfo x y ) where mag = sqrt ( x*x + y*y ) instance NFData GLfloat instance NFData NodeInfo where rnf ( NodeInfo a b ) = rnf a > | rnf b liftSTM :: MonadIO m => STM a -> m a liftSTM = liftIO .
atomically
I ’ve also had to add an instance of NFData to use rnf ( strict evaluation ) on NodeInfo , and the simple liftSTM function for executing STM transactions in the CHP monad .
The draw process only has one change ; instead of reading from a list of channels , we now read from a list of transactional variables :
drawProcess :: [ TVar NodeInfo ] -> Enrolled PhasedBarrier Phase -> CHP ( ) drawProcess tvs bar = do displayIO <- embedCHP_ $ do syncAndWaitForPhase Discover bar xs <- liftSTM $ mapM readTVar tvs liftIO $ do startFrame mapM_ draw xs mapM_ ( drawEdge xs ) edges endFrame ...
Last time , I only had four nodes in my example , which was fairly boring .
This time I have one hundred nodes , connected in a 10 × 10 grid .
To make the demo interesting , all the nodes start with random positions :
startNodes :: IO [ NodeInfo ] startNodes = replicateM ( 10*10 ) $ lift M2 NodeInfo r r where r = liftM ( fromRational . toRational ) $ randomRIO ( 0 :: Float , 1 ) edges :: [ ( Int , Int ) ] edges = across ++ down where across = [ ( x+10*y , ( x +1 ) +10*y ) | x <- [ 0..8 ] , y <- [ 0..9 ] ] down = [ ( x+10*y , x+10 *( y+1 ) ) | x <- [ 0..9 ] , y <- [ 0..8 ] ]
Finally , our slightly adjusted main process :
main :: IO ( ) main = runCHP_ $ do nodes <- liftIO startNodes vars <- liftSTM $ mapM newTVar nodes enrollAll_ ( newPhasedBarrier Act ) ( drawProcess vars : [ let edgesOut = filter ( ( == i ) . fst ) edges edgesIn = filter ( ( == i ) . snd ) edges connectedNodes = map fst edgesIn ++ map snd edgesOut conn = [ ( ind `elem` connected Nodes , tv ) | ( tv , ind ) <- zip vars [ 0.. ] , tv /= mytv ] in node n conn mytv | ( n , mytv , i ) <- zip3 nodes vars [ 0.. ] ])
There are not many changes from my previous shared channel - based version to use STM instead .
My continued use of barriers alongside STM shows that you can mix STM and CHP quite nicely if you want to .
Now , here ’s what you ’ve been waiting for — a video of the graph layout in action , first on my grid graph as defined above :
Choose from WMV format ( suitable for Windows ) or MPEG format ( suitable for Linux , etc ) .
I also ran the algorithm on a simple loop graph :
Choose from WMV format ( suitable for Windows ) or MPEG format ( suitable for Linux , etc ) .
The two videos have the algorithm running at 10 iterations per second , as that seems like a nice speed to view them at ( and apologies for the slight garbage down the right - hand side of the videos ) .
The grid example was inspired by an original example in the Java version of the Prefuse toolkit .
Prefuse is an incredibly cool visualisation toolkit ; some Java examples can be found online but more impressive are the more recent ActionScript examples .

An exciting night of fights at UFC 105 has quickly been overshadowed by serious concerns over Brock Lesnar ’s health .
He was recently diagnosed with glandular fever , but it now appears that something else has been discovered that is a cause for greater concern .
Speaking at the UFC 105 post fight press conference Dana White told the assembled media , “ I am worried about it .
I ca n’t really talk about it right now , but ( Lesnar ) is in rough shape .
He ’s in really bad shape . ”
White said that Lesnar had collapsed while taking time out in Canada recently and was rushed to hospital where a number of tests were carried out .
“ He does n’t want to talk about it publicly , but he ’s in bad shape .
He ’s not well , ” White told reporters .
“ He ’s not going to be getting well anytime soon . ”
This latest news will send shockwaves throughout the MMA community and beyond .
Brock Lesnar has quickly become both the heavyweight champion of the UFC and the sports biggest PPV draw .
When asked what would happen with the heavyweight title if Lesnar is out for a considerable period of time , White had no definitive answer .
“ If it ’s a long wait , we ’re gong to have to do something , ” he said .
“ We ’re going to have to – the last thing I ever want to do is strip a guy who won a title .
That ’s the last thing I want to do .
I do n’t know if we ’ll have to do an interim or what we ’ll do to fix it . ”
With Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira now confirmed out of UFC 108 with a staph infection and Shane Carwin undergoing knee surgery it may be some time before a legitimate interim fight can be established .
For the mean time such matters are inconsequential , Lesnar ’s health must be everyone ’s first concern .
White confirmed that the UFC will do all they can for the fighter .
“ I ’ve got to get him to one of these really good hospitals with really good doctors to figure out what ’s wrong and how we get him better , ” he said .
UPDATE ( 15th Nov ) :
After speaking to members of Brock Lesnar ’s camp , MMAWeekly are reporting that Lesnar ’s illness is not life threatening , but there are “ complications with his illness and he had to be hospitalized for antibiotics . ”
it may be some time before we get a clear understanding of what is wrong with lesnar but we will of course keep you updated with any further information on his health in the coming days .

Sher Ahmed Khan , a Pakistani subsistence farmer and day labourer , is 35 , but his red- rimmed eyes and thinning hair make him look older .
When he relates what happened to his family on 28 April this year , you begin to understand why he seems weighed down by care .
" We knew the army was about to attack the Taliban , but we did n't understand what that would mean , " he said .
" I was working when the operation started , and people escaping the fighting told me my house had been hit .
I found my four - year - old son Bilal dead .
My wife and the other four children were wounded .
The house was destroyed , and everything was soaked in blood . "
A rocket - propelled grenade fired by the Taliban at a military helicopter had missed its target .
After two months in a camp , the family returned to their village in Buner district , but their lives remain shattered .
" We are all living in one room , I do n't have the money to rebuild any more of the house , " said Sher Ahmed .
" I used to sell milk from our cow and hire out my horse and cart , but my animals were also killed .
Now and then I can earn about 250 rupees [ less than £ 2 ] a day unloading goods in the market . "
To most people in the West , the battle against al - Qa'ida and its allies seems remote .
But Sher Ahmed Khan and his family are among millions of ordinary Pakistanis to whom the struggle has meant death or terror , as well as the loss of homes and livelihoods .
While Britain and America applaud Pakistan 's President Asif Ali Zardari for finally cracking down on creeping extremism within his country 's borders , many innocent civilians are caught in the middle .

This year 's Christmas appeal by The Independent on Sunday is in support of the work of ActionAid in Buner and Swat , two districts in north - west Pakistan that were engulfed in this year 's fighting which drove nearly two million people from their homes .
Though most have since returned , they often found their houses looted or in ruins .
Farmers have lost their crops and livestock , hundreds of schools and clinics have been bombed or trashed , and official food handouts are reaching only a fraction of the population .
A cash - strapped Pakistani government has promised 25,000 rupees ( about £ 180 ) in compensation to each family , but Sher Ahmed has yet to see it .
Nor can the situation in Buner and Swat be called stable , even now .
Pockets of militants remain in the mountains , and in many areas people hear shooting at night .
The army maintains a 6 pm to 6 am curfew in Buner , hampering the work of farmers .
They have also been forbidden to plant maize , a staple crop in the region , because the military says the tall stalks could hide Taliban infiltrators .
Above all , there is still pervasive fear .
Particularly in the Swat valley , which suffered for years from the ambivalent attitude of the previous military government towards the Taliban – vacillating between half - hearted attacks and attempts to buy them off – people are terrified that the militants could come back , so they measure their words with extreme caution .
" The scales are in favour of one side now , but who knows what will happen in the future ? " asked one man in Mingora , the capital of Swat .
Zohra Bibi , 49 , a widow in Buner , was one person unafraid to speak out .
" My husband and I were very much against the Taliban , because they have destroyed the peace of our land , " she told me .
" He hated them so much that you could n't mention the Taliban in front of him . "
A bitter irony , then , to learn that Bakht Karim Shah , a 52 - year - old secondary school principal , was killed not by the extremists , but by the army .
" Karim was acting as an external examiner at another school , and was driving home , completely unaware that the soldiers had declared a curfew , " said Zohra , who has been left with 10 children , the youngest aged three .
" When he passed a checkpoint without stopping , an armoured vehicle opened fire on the car .
He bled to death on the spot , because no one was allowed to give him first aid . "
The army had never apologised .
" They said it was a difficult time , he had violated the curfew , and for all they knew , he could have been a terrorist , " Zohra added .
A week earlier in a village a few miles away , 44 - year - old Tajori 's husband was killed by the Taliban .
Gul Saeed , 49 , was one of six policemen shot by the extremists to terrorise the population of Buner .
" He told us that the Taliban might come , but never spoke of his own fears , " said Tajori .
Their eldest son Iqrar , 23 , added : " I begged him not to go to work that day , but he said he had to do his duty . "

The army operation of April and May halted a nightmare process lasting several years , in which the extremists extended their influence from the mountains of northern
Swat into the plain , and southwards into Buner , only a couple of hours by road from the capital , Islamabad .
Many people I spoke to said that initially they sympathised with the Pakistani wing of the Taliban against the unpopular , unelected government of Pervez Musharraf .
" It was only this year that we saw the Taliban 's true nature , " said one .
The catalyst for that was a disastrous attempt by President Zardari to compromise with the militants , who were allowed to introduce their version of Islamic law ( sharia ) in the Swat and Buner valleys in return for an agreement to disarm , which was never honoured .
Instead women were forced into the burqa , girls ' schools were bombed along with music and video shops , and barbers who continued giving their customers shaves and haircuts – Islamist zealots insist on untrimmed beards and hair – had their throats cut and their bodies strung up .
In the spring , the government lost patience and launched an all - out military assault , preceded by heavy airstrikes and artillery barrages .
As an elected administration it could claim popular support , but the operation killed scores of civilians and caused 90 per cent of the population of Buner and Swat to escape to camps and relatives ' homes in other parts of Pakistan .
Now they are back , they face a harsh winter with scarce resources .
People here know all too well what lies ahead in South Waziristan , where some 350,000 civilians have fled the latest offensive , and where ActionAid is also preparing to help .
With the international spotlight having moved away from Buner and Swat , however , there is a danger that the ordeal of its inhabitants will pass unnoticed .
A fertile region , once prosperous by Pakistani standards , with a thriving tourist and honeymoon trade founded on Swat 's mountainous scenery , has been left devastated .
Zohra Bibi did not learn her husband was dead until half an hour before he was buried , such was the haste of her entire village to flee the fighting .
" I have never recovered , " she said .
" As I looked at his body I wondered , 'What is the future for my children ? ' "
The family is grateful to ActionAid and its local partners , which have given them a cow .
" Even if the younger children have nothing to eat , they at least have milk , " said their mother .
With your support , Actionaid can send help to many more victims of the conflict , such as Sher Ahmed Khan .
He said : " We are still in shock .
At night I cannot help but think about what happened to the family , and the son we lost .
Whenever the other children hear a helicopter , they are terrified .
They will remember this all their lives . "
What your money buys
The Independent on Sunday 's Christmas appeal is for the work of ActionAid in Pakistan , where millions of innocent civilians have lost their homes and livelihoods in the battle against al - Qa'ida and its allies .
Your donations to ActionAid , which has been working in the country since 1992 , will help these people rebuild their lives .

" He said Muslims should stand up and fight the aggressor and that we should not be in the war in the first place . "
He said that Maj Hasan said he was " happy " when a US soldier was killed in an attack on a military recruitment centre in Arkansas in June .
An American convert to Islam was accused of the shootings .
Is there room in the Republican Party for genuine moderates ?
Truth to tell , the GOP ca n’t decide .
More precisely , it ’s deeply divided over whether it should allow any divisions in the party at all .
That ’s why the brawl in a single congressional district in far upstate New York is drawing the eyes of the nation .
Conservatives are determined to use the race to prove that there is no place in the party for heretics , dissidents or independents .
President Barack Obama set up the fight by nominating the district ’s former representative , John McHugh , as his Army secretary .
Maybe Obama is as fiendishly clever as his more paranoid opponents believe him to be .
When local Republicans picked a moderate , Assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava , as their candidate for the Nov. 3 contest , many on the right rebelled .
They are backing a third - party conservative , Doug Hoffman , and he may well drive Scozzafava into third place .
For the moment , at least , polls show that Bill Owens , the Democratic candidate , has jumped into first place on the split .
Demonstrating just how far right some Republicans have moved is the fact that former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is on the moderate side of this civil war against his old nemesis Dick Armey , who served under Gingrich as majority leader .
Gingrich , who backs Scozzafava , always understood that he would never have become speaker without help from Republican moderates .
Armey prefers ideological purity and , like fellow members of the tea party movement , is supporting Hoffman .
The GOP ’s battle of Plattsburgh and Oswego underscores a little - noticed truism of American politics in 2009 :
While the Democrats are a coalition party uniting moderates and liberals , Republicans threaten to become a party of the right and only of the right .
That means ( as we are seeing with health care ) that many of the big arguments take place inside the Democratic Party .
Democrats won their majority in Congress by uniting and firing up their base ( George W. Bush helped a lot ) and by winning over moderates and independents , often by running moderate candidates in conservative districts .
These candidates were typically to the left of the Republicans on economic issues , but to the right of , say , Berkeley and Cambridge .
In the meantime , middle - of - the - road voters who had populated the moderate Republican heartland , notably in suburban areas of the Northeast and Midwest , shifted steadily Democratic , turned off by the increasing dominance of Southern conservatives in the party of Lincoln .
Such voters threw solid Republican moderates out of office — among them Connie Morella in Maryland , Jim Leach in Iowa and Chris Shays in Connecticut .
In the Maryland , Iowa and Connecticut cases , this did not occur because those three champions of the middle way were disliked but rather because they came to be seen as enablers of a right - wing congressional majority .
If you take conservatives aside quietly , they will often acknowledge all this .
For next year ’s Senate races , party leaders have already welcomed the emergence of moderate candidates , notably in contests for the seats once held by the current president and vice president of the United States .
Republicans have a decent shot in Delaware because Rep. Mike Castle , who leans toward the center , has decided to run for Joe Biden ’s old seat .
In Illinois , Rep. Mark Kirk , despite some opposition on the right , offers the Republicans their best chance of capturing the office Obama gave up to pursue other interests .
But this strategy wo n’t work if staunch conservatives insist that in the crunch , there is no space in the party for anyone to Dick Armey ’s left .
“ We win when we are us , ” Armey told the right - wing blog Red State in explaining his support for Hoffman .
It ’s a revealing statement .
The “ us ” Armey has in mind is n’t big enough to encompass people like Castle and Kirk , let alone the scores of moderate suburbanites who once felt comfortable in the Republican Party of George H.W. Bush .
In fact , “ us ” is getting to be a small , comfy group .
The Washington Post - ABC
News poll this week found that only 20 percent of adults identify themselves as Republicans , the lowest single number in Post - ABC polls since 1983 .
Only 19 percent had confidence in congressional Republicans “ to make the right decisions for the country ’s future . ”
Even congressional Democrats got 34 percent on that question , and Obama scored 49 percent .
With the moderate Scozzafava ’s support in apparent collapse , Hoffman has a chance to win next month .
Right - wingers would cheer , but such a result would be bad news for the GOP .
A Hoffman victory would keep Republicans on a path that Newt Gingrich knows is unsustainable , even if Dick Armey does n’t .

If anyone wants to know why CNBC anchors are so pale and nervous these days , look no further .
As Comcast CEO Brian Roberts considers what to keep and what to , well , cut , post his digestion of NBC Universal ( assuming deal rumors are true naturally ) his eyes likely cast casual nervous glances at Nielsen reports of CNBC viewership .
Yet his nervousness is quite minor compared to what actual employees must be feeling after Nielsen reported a 50 % plunge in CNBC vierwership in October year over year .
Specifically , CNBC has experienced a massive 52 % decline in overall viewers during business day hours ( 5 am - 7 pm ) , and a not much better 49 % drop in its demo ( 25 - 54 ) in the month of October as compared to last year .
Specific shows that are likely to follow the fate of Dennis Kneale 's recently cancelled 8 pm gobbledygook are likely the Kudlow Report and Mad Money , which are down 59 % and 56 % , respectively .
While one can speculate about the causes of the drop ( call it readers who can read between the propganda teleprompter lines ) , one thing the drop does explain is why CNBC has had to recently resort to advertising products for incontinence among other bodily malfunctions .
As always , Zero Hedge wishes the network a speedy recovery and a return to what it does best : reporting the news , without bias , without propaganda , and without an agenda .
Once that happens CNBC and its new / old owners may be surprised how quickly its rating will return to normal .

About Doc's Orders ==================
It all started with " Captured Caroline " my long term project for A.S.S.
Because of various rewrites I had a number of scenes left over , scenes that it was impossible to reuse in the current CC storyline .
So I created " Scattered Scenes " a methord of reusing these scenes by tying them together into a single independant story .
The first of these call " The Hitch Hikers Guide to Slavery " deliberately finished part way through a story .
This is because " Scattered Scenes " were never meant to be complete but like Suki's Images just bit 's and pieces of erotica .
But enough people wrote in wanting more .
So I 've expanded " Hitch Hikers " Into Doc 's orders .
Enjoy .....

Doc's Orders by Quin ==================
Chapter 1 " The Hitchhikers Guide to Slavery " =====================================
I was returning from Vermont cursing Doc and his timing .
I admit I * had * promised to look after his delivery problems personally .
I can even vaguely remember taking his retainer but I had n't agreed to work Easter week and especially not during my first vacation in three years .
For God sake my new Snowboard had hardly even been christened .
I told myself that whatever the job was it had better be good .
I wondered just why I had dropped everything to head back .
I could still remember Doc 's phone call that morning , his British accent so polite yet so demanding .
" But Charles old boy I thought we had a deal .
You know that I would n't ask if the assignment did n't require your special flair .
Besides I believe Kitten is preparing a special dinner and you * know * how much she looks forward to having you over .... "
Kitten , he knew I could n't refuse her .
She was my invisible leash , his guarantee that he could reel me back at any time .
So here I was cruising the back roads of Worcester County MA on an cold overcast Easter evening wondering just why he needed me so desperately .
I was so caught up in events that at first I did n't even notice them .
I suppose we 've all seen hitchers from time to time , huddled by the side of the road waving those pathetic little signs .
They look at you with such hope as you approach that it 's almost impossible to drive away without feeling a complete heel .
I mean , most of the time when I 'm working I 'm simply not allowed to stop , but somehow that does n't make me feel any less guilty .
I moment I saw those two I could tell there was something odd about them .
There was no sign , no warm clothes , hell they did n't even signal until I was almost past them .
I glanced in my mirror .
Two young girls alone and in the middle of nowhere .
In some countries it would be a trap , an obvious ploy of carjackers or robbers but this was New England and I doubted it was anything that crude .
Still , five years of Advanced Recon teaches you to take nothing at face value .
I pulled up a good distance ahead of them and picked my spot so that any potential ambusher would have to break cover to reach me .
In my mirror I watched as they ran up .
The leading girl looked to be sixteen or seventeen , well built , perhaps five nine with shoulder length blonde hair .
She was dressed in a waist length leather jacket and a knee length plad skirt .
There seemed something familiar about the outfit but in the dimming light I could n't make it out .
In any case I doubted that it was very warm .
Still , at least she'd thought to wear a sensible pair of shoes .
The pack she carried was small , good for perhaps a couple of days and the lack of a bedroll or obvious tent confirmed that these were not ardent outdoors men .
Off in the distance her friend seemed to have prepared a little better .
I got the impression of a mop of dark hair over a yellow waterproof jacket , below that she wore jeans and a pair of ankle boots .
I swear that I stopped purely for humanitarian reasons , I would n't have left a dog out on a night like that .
However , by the time they reached me I admit I 'd started to see the possibilities in the situation .
I watched in the mirror as the blonde drew level ; I could tell what she was thinking , youngish guy on his own in a large old car .
She hesitated , stopped and looked back towards her friend .
I knew this area quite well , Doc 's place was a few miles away .
This road was quiet , I figured they 'd probably been here a while .
As her friend came up I decided to up the pressure .
I wound the window down .
" You girls are lucky I came along , " I said in a friendly voice , " Not much traffic comes this way after dark and that storm will be here real soon . "
The blonde looked up .
It was overcast , showers were a certainty though I think the word * storm * would be pushing things .
While she thought about it I looked her friend over .
The large brown eyes and curly dark brown hair betrayed her Latin ancestry , her skin however had a pale almost porcelain quality .
I guessed she was about the same age as her friend though the serious expression on her face made her appear more mature .
The blonde looked at her friend obviously waiting for her opinion .
The dark girl glanced at me suspiciously .
She seemed the practical one of the pair something she confirmed a minute later when she silently shook her head .
Time for more pressure , " Do n't have all day ladies , hell you have n't even said were you want to go . "
" W...worcester , " The blonde stammered .
" I 'm going to Bolton , " I said firmly as if I expected them to argue , " But I could drop you by I - 91 .
You can get a lift into Worcester easily from there . "
I looked around , " Well it would be easier than gettin ' one around here . "
The blonde looked beseechingly at her friend .
I watched as the dark haired girl did the calculation .
Two of them , one of me .
I got the feeling that if she 'd been on her own she'd have waited for something less risky , but her friend was already cold and if they stayed here much longer they would get wet .
She nodded , proving that perhaps she was n't that smart after all .
The blonde sighed thankfully and headed towards the trunk .
" No good going there sweetheart , " I said , " The trunk 's full .
You 'll have to put your stuff on the back seat . "
She flushed a little when I called her " sweetheart " and she seemed to hesitate a moment .
I smiled , " You can dump those packs on the seat behind me .
One of you ride up front , makes it easier to talk . "
They looked at each other .
I could tell that neither really wanted to talk , but if that was the price of the lift ....
The blonde glanced at her friend .
The brunette nodded again .
The packs were thrown on the back seat as I suggested and the blonde came forward to the passenger door .
Part one was complete ; I had separated them .
The blonde struggled out of her jacket and dumped it on top of the packs , underneath she wore a tight polo neck sweater in a dark brown color .
Once I saw the complete outfit I immediately recognized it as the uniform of an exclusive Catholic boarding school .
The sweater may have been the regulation style and color but she 'd obviously taken some trouble to ensure it flattered her figure .
I waited expecting the brunette to do the same but the yellow coat stayed firmly in place .
She waited until the blonde had got in next to me then opened the back door and slipped into the seat behind her friend .
I could see she was going to be difficult .
" Hi , " I said offering my hand to the blonde .
" Charlie Parker . "
She did n't take the offered hand but instead looked me over .
" Beth , " She said at length , " And that 's Maria . "
No comments , no jazz fans here I thought .
I also noticed that she did n't give any surnames .
I glanced over at Maria who just nodded politely , her body tight and weary .
If what I was planning was going to work I needed to get Maria off her guard a little .
I noticed that she 'd positioned herself close to the door though she 'd been sensible enough to use the seat belt .
I smiled .
" Does n't say much your friend . "
I said as we pulled away .
" We had a bad experience a couple of hours ago .
A truck driver ....
He said he'd give us a lift but ... "
" Oh I see .
I was going to ask how two nice young ladies from Saint Mary 's came to be so far from the beaten track . "
They both stiffened , " Saint Mary's ? "
Interesting reaction I thought ; I decided to probe a little further .
" Yes I recognized the uniform .
You * are * from there right ? "
The tension seemed to mount even more , in the corner of my eye I saw the glances back and forth .
Something was going on between these two , something that had led them to a back road miles from Boston .
Whatever it was they did n't want to be identified with it , had hoped for some anonymity .
" You recognized the uniform ...? "
Beth began .
I could tell that she was about to deny it , claim I 'd made a mistake .
Saint Mary 's was an exclusive school , the kind of place that the daughters of congressmen and diplomats attended .
Such girls have been told all their lives that they are better that the rest of us , taught to use their wits and breeding against their enemies .
I 'd found that out from bitter experience .
I decided I needed to take the upper hand .
Time to head her off .
" My wife 's an old girl . "
I said sweetly , " The uniform 's been updated a little since her day but the Tartan in the skirt is unmistakable . "
" Tartan .... "
Beth began .
The plad was distinctive , the family Tartan of one of the schools founders .
Few outside the Ivy League
Set even knew the school existed never mind be able to identify the Tartan on sight .
I could feel Beth looking me over .
St. Mary 's girls go on to marry into the best families in the country , I did n't seem to fit the part .
Still it 's hard to tell these days , I once stood next to Bruce Willis in a store in San Fran and I was probably better dressed than he was .
I could be a rock star , a corporate robber baron slumming at his New England retreat , any number of things .
I felt the tension in the car increase still more , was I * somebody * .
Time to let her off the hook .
" Check the yearbook for ' 82 when you get back .
Her maiden name was Jennifer O'Neil .
Pretty redhead , do n't think she got any special distinctions .
She was a day girl there for four years . "
Beth relaxed a little , day girls were usually on scholarships , normal middle class Boston girls that the school took in to maintain their Christian piety .
Beth did n't say anything but her body language spoke volumes .
She 'd been afraid .
Afraid that we'd meet at some Alumni party , afraid that perhaps I moved in the same exclusive circles she did .
Afraid that their presence here might somehow make it back to the school or daddy ??
Seemed reasonable .
She cleared her throat .
" Your wife was a day girl ? " I caught that tone in her voice , that upper - class whine .
Five minutes ago she'd been a little girl freezing her butt off by the side of the road , an object of some pity even for me .
Now after a few minutes in the warm all her old instincts were reasserting themselves .
My heart hardened and the fate I 'd decided on for these two was set .
" Yes that 's right , " I said , " She was on a scholarship .
She says that it 's a great school , though she did take some ragging . "
I watched her reaction , feeling the tension bubble burst .
I was no one important , there was little chance that I would mention their presence here to anyone they needed to worry about .
My suspicions confirmed I felt it was time to change the subject .
" So this trucker gave you a bad time ? "
Now her temperature was back up Beth 's ego was back with a vengeance .
" He was an awful man , said that he'd take us to Worcester straight away but once we were out of town he started to change .
He pulled off the Interstate and started making lewd suggestions .
When we would n't do what he wanted he threw us out . "
I took this in for a second .
The place I 'd found them was quiet and there were large numbers of wooded side roads big enough to take a semi .
Friend trucker probably thought he had a party on his hands and tried to get some privacy .
I had no doubt that these two had led him on .
Despite what you see on TV truckers are not usually random maniacs .
Most work for big companies and those companies run a virtual cartel .
No working Joe was likely to risk being blacklisted for two little tarts like these .
If he 'd turned off it was because * someone * had given him the idea that he would be rewarded .
Still I kept my thoughts to myself .
" So what kind of lewd suggestions did this guy make ? "
Beth seemed uncomfortable , " Well you know ? " I shrugged .
" I 'm afraid I do n't , " I said , " The only young lady * I * make lewd comments to these days is my wife .
I take it from your reactions that these were of a sexual nature ? "
Beth nodded indignantly .
" And how old are you girls ? " " Sixteen , " Beth said .
I sounded shocked .
" I hope you took the guy 's number , " I said , " He sounds a complete sleezeball . "
" We did , " Beth said proudly , " And when we get back we intend to send his company a letter . "
An anonymous letter I thought .
After all they would n't want to have to explain what they were doing hitchhiking to Worcester .
Doc's was now only twenty or thirty miles away .
Soon my relationship with these two charming ladies would have to get a little unpleasant .
I intended to put that off as long as possible , every mile closer to Doc 's was a bonus .
To keep them distracted I started chatting , asking about the school , dropping the names of a few of the teachers that had been there when I 'd lived nearby .
As I 'd expected Maria said nothing , she just sat behind watching .
Beth was a fountain of information and though I got no closer to the underlying mystery of what they were doing here or exactly who they were she dropped enough clues for me to start piecing things together .
Beth 's father was a lawyer , some medium ranking partner in a large Boston firm .
Not especially ambitious he seemed content to bide his time and wait for his more senior colleagues to die .
Maria 's father was a banker of some kind , working out of the country for Chase Manhattan .
I felt the disapproval from Maria as Beth let that slip but there was little she could do .
Beth had been raised in an world were what you did was n't so important as who you were and who you knew .
Name dropping was like second nature to her .
Too young to have much influence herself she relied on hints about her access to power to impress .
I glanced at her .
She was a little silly cunt who was about to forefill a fantasy I 'd had for twenty years .
I started to move towards Doc 's place .
Having been in the Service I tend to think that everyone has the same sense of direction that I do and I confess that I 'd expected some comment .
However , they did n't seem to notice , at least Beth kept talking and Maria kept silent as before .
I was starting to think I could take them all the way to Doc 's door when Maria spoke .
" We should have reached the Interstate by now ! "
It was an accusation , a challenge of sorts .
To some extent I liked Beth , she was stupid , arrogant and vain but was n't really that unfriendly .
Maria seemed to be a complete bitch , a real ball breaker , it would be interesting to see what happened with her .
" Yep , " I said but kept driving .
Beth turned towards me eyes wide with fear .
" Relax , " I said , " I 'm not like your trucker friend .
I 'm not about to leave you two by an on ramp in the middle of nowhere .
There 's an oasis a few miles further down the Interstate you can wait in the warm there and you 'll have a better chance of getting a lift on to Worcester . "
Beth , the stupid bitch , really wanted to believe , " An oasis ? " " A truck stop .
Hell I could n't go back to the wife and tell her that I left two St. Mary 's girls to fend for themselves on a night like this . "
Beth was satisfied but as expected Maria was more cautious , " If this place exists why not use the Interstate to get to it ? " she asked .
I shrugged .
" That section 's a toll road , " I said .
" I 'm willing to help you girls out but I do n't see why I should pay for doing it ! "
That shut Maria up for now but I could tell the honeymoon was over .
The next time I needed to adjust the lights I reached over and threw an unmarked switch near the driver 's door .
From now on the clock was ticking , it would only take them a few minutes to realize what I 'd done then all hell would break loose .
Fortunately I knew of a perfect place not so far from here .
It was quiet and private and if I could reach it my troubles would be over .
If ........
If is a million dollar word , it sometimes means yes , sometimes no .
In this case it seemed to mean * yes * because despite deviating from the route the girls did n't notice .
In fact it was only when I pulled off into the woods that they finally realized their danger and of course by then it was far too late .
Surprisingly it was Beth who reacted first .
" What the ...
What are you doing ? " she demanded .
I smiled , " End of the line ....... "
Beth struggled .
Her hand flashed down to the release button of her seat belt .
I watched as she pressed the little red button .
Nothing happened .
She tried again , and again .
I watched amused as she pounded it harder but still it did n't release .
About this time she tried to move forward , but the seat belt reel was locked and she was pinned to her seat .
I glanced at Maria who was starting to come to the same realization , that the seat belts were somehow locked and effectively strapped them to their seats .
That 's when the screaming started .
Beth let rip , no surprise there I 'd marked her as a mouthy bitch from the start .
The big surprise was how little fuss Maria made ; she just looked on with hollow eyes .
I suppose it 's the problem with being too cerebral , you can't deal with sudden changes that well .
Still it gave me a little more time so I endeavored to use it .
I reached under my seat and found the small cloth bag I 'd velcro'd there .
I do n't think Beth even saw the handcuffs until it was too late .
She was so busy thrashing about and pulling on the belt .
I had her first wrist locked before she even knew she was in trouble .
She struggled a little as I passed the other bracelet through the lap belt and caught her free hand but by then it was over .
With her hands chained to her waist she could n't stop me from forcing the ball gag into her screaming mouth .
I tightened the strap and the car was suddenly quiet .
She made a few muffled sounds and I could hear Maria whispering a prayer but compared to seconds before all was silent .
Beth started to weep .
Facing me she tried to say something but all that emerged from behind the gag was a muffled nonsense .
I could n't tell what she said but her body language , hands clutched together , eyes wide told me the story .
Beth was begging for her life .
I felt a wave of satisfaction .
Still she could wait for now .
My first priority was making Maria " comfortable " .
The seat belts had been rigged by a friend of mine .
Tiny solenoids activated by the dashboard switch locked the buckle and reel mechanisms on all the passenger belts leaving the driver free to move .
I 'd only used it once before on more than one girl and that experience had led me to ask for a number of refinements .
Leaving the car I walked around to Maria 's door .
Maria was still struggling , though being an intelligent girl she probably only did it out of habit .
If she 'd wanted to she could have reached over and ungagged Beth , but she did n't probably because she knew it would n't do any good .
Beth had been very vocal for most of the last five minutes .
No one had come .
The bag had one more gag and three pairs of cuffs left .
I got some cuffs ready then opened Maria 's door .
Pushing a button on my key fob I was rewarded by a loud click as Maria 's seat belt disengaged .
For a second she paused , then with remarkable speed she sprang from the car .
I grabbed but caught the coat .
We struggled for a second then she managed to slip out of it and ran for the trees .
Throwing the coat aside I started after her .
I was n't worried , her only chance was to make for the road and hope she could find someone to flag down before I got to her .
She was heading the wrong way .
She was good , probably a track star at school , but here she was in my world .
No amount of sand track practice can prepare you for running on broken ground at night .
She 's almost made the trees when an exposed root brought her down .
I needed no further encouragement , I was on her in an instant and her hands were cuffed behind her before she 'd taken her first breath .
Only then , when all else was lost did she start to scream .
Even then it seemed a half hearted effort .
Like her struggles in the car I felt it was as much to be doing * something * as it was a serious attempt to escape ..
I forced the ball gag into her mouth and tightened the staps .
Now she finally admitted defeat and stopped struggling .
We waited a few minutes to get our breath back .
Then I pulled her up and dragged her back to the car .
As we got closer I could hear Beth 's muffled sobs .
Now they were both gagged I doubted any sounds could carry beyond the first line of trees .
Beth looked up and I smiled at the look of despair that flickered across her face .
I think she really believed Maria would get away .
The two girls held a brief gagged " conversation " that became rapidly boring .
Smiling at Beth I dragged Maria towards the back of the car .
I paused by the trunk and opened it .
There was my bag and snow board which I tossed aside for the moment .
Maria struggled but I was no longer in a mood to play so I slammed the heel of my foot hard against the back of her leg hearing the muffled squeal and feeling her collapse to the ground .
Next to the spare wheel was a larger bag with more supplies .
Plucking it out I turned to find Maria trying to crawl away .
Grabbing her by the shoulders I carried her the few feet to her discarded coat and dumped her on it .
Then I opened my bag and went to work .
I used a couple of straps to fasten her legs together temporarily at knees and ankles .
This was just to stop her struggling too much as I applied the duct tape .
I started at her ankles winding the tape tightly around her legs until I reached the knees .
These I left free as I wanted to be able to bend her legs but I wrapped another band of tape halfway up her thighs to pinion the top of her legs .
Wrists and forearms were similarly bound .
Like Beth , Maria had been wearing a polo necked sweater underneath her raincoat and while duct tape over jeans made a viable bond I was a little worried about the wool stretching .
So recovering the straps from her legs I reused them above and bellow her elbows to strengthen her bonds .
Maria had nice tits and now that her arms were pulled back they were thrust out in a most appealing way .
I paused a second to have a quick grope and listened to her muffled protests .
She was still a little too loud for my taste .
Rolling her over I removed the ball gag and replaced it with an inflatable bladder .
I used a small pump to inflate this until her cheeks were distended and her eyes bulged .
Satisfied , I secured it in place first with layer after layer of duct tape and finally with a tight Ace bandage .
Another grope test found Maria very effectively silenced .
I finished up by using a couple of straps to hog - tie her wrists to her ankles .
She complained a little , or at least tried to but Maria was a realist , despite her little show of defiance she 'd realized it was over the moment she 'd been unable to unfasten the seat belt .
All she wanted now was to survive all this .
I admit she gave me some problems when she realized she was destined for the trunk but hog - tied she was in no position to stop me .
Once I 'd got her nicely tucked away inside I threw her coat on top and closed the lid .
My bags and snow board joined their packs on the back seat and I turned my attention back to Beth .
I 'd left the Service just after Desert Storm following a fraternization problem between myself and a female Navy officer .
We are n't talking Tailhook here , in fact she outranked me .
To be honest as we were on our own time and there were no husbands or wives to get hurt I never saw it as anyone 's business but our own .
They say that dress whites and Marine green do n't mix but we did ok there for a while .
Still the Brass did n't see it that way and decided someone had to pay .
I was on my final tour intending to Re-up later that year so I was the obvious candidate .
She was young and ambitious I was old and cynical so I cut a deal with the Brass .
No charges , I just left at the end of my final tour and saved her from the scuttlebutt .
When I got out I 'd kicked around for a while but to be honest I 'd been in too long to be good at anything else .
Mercenary work just did n't interest me .
Hell , I 'd fought and some of my buddies had died to make the New World Order and I did n't feel like helping to break it up again .
I came across Doc in a gambling house , the old bastard was one hell of a poker player , and we'd got to talking .
Well , he 'd been buying so I did most of the talking .
In the end he asked if I wanted to make some good money for a simple delivery job .
I 'd thought he meant drugs and had been a little reluctant to agree but I was low on funds by then .
In the end I just figured that anyone taking that stuff deserved what they got so I 'd agreed .
We went back to his hotel room were he introduced me to a beautiful Asian girl called Mi Lin .
I figured Mi was a hooker he'd hired for the night so was n't so surprised when he offered me her services .
I admit that those little oriental chicks always pushed my buttons and this one was so willing .
I 'd been around the world many times and used the local pro's in just about every country you can imagine but none were as eager to please as Mi Lin .
Some do n't to oral , some do n't do anal .
Mi never said no to anything and in addition she had this cute habit of calling me * Master * all the time .
She was literally the best fuck I 'd ever had .
The next day Doc turned up and I figured it was time to pay the piper .
I 'd expected him to give me a briefcase or something .
Instead he told me to deliver Mi Lin to a cat house in New Mexico .
It would take two or three days and of course I could use her as I saw fit during that time .
I 'd expected Mi to object but she seemed quite happy .
It was then that Doc told me what he did for a living .
Doc was a trainer of slaves .
He could take any normal healthy woman and turn her into an obedient sex machine in a little under six weeks .
It was hard to believe but Doc claimed Mi was living proof .
I do n't know what Mi had been doing two months before but now she was content to fuck and suck ; all night if necessary .
I 'd taken her on the trip to New Mexico half expecting her to jump ship at the first opportunity but she seemed happy to be going along almost as if she looked forward to life as a cheap whore .
At first I could n't see how Doc 's business worked .
I 'd been around a bit and knew the score .
Hundreds of runaways flood into New York every year and there are pimps and pushers at every street corner just waiting for them .
Want a sex slave ?
Just pluck a girl off the street , beat her a little , pump her full of smack until she 's hooked and put her to work .
That first year all I did was deliver slaves and Doc paid me a fortune to be a glorified taxi driver .
I could n't see how he made his money .
Who would pay for such a thing when junk and intimidation was cheaper ?
Then as I experienced more of Doc 's girls I began to see .
First they were so willing , so responsive to a man 's needs .
While you 're with them you are literally the center of their world .
They loved sex , in fact they seem to physically * Need * it .
When they look at your dick the hunger in those eyes is real .
When you fuck them , they really do enjoy it , really do cum and cum .
There is no deception , she is n't faking or making out her shopping list while you fuck her .
Doc 's girl 's like you , like what you say and who you are , are happy just to be with you .
Any man no matter what he looks like feels like a prince .
Then of course there 's the sex .
In terms of oral , they have mouths more talented than those of twenty year Las Vegas strip girls , they can hold a man at the edge of ecstasy for a lifetime .
When they fuck it 's like nothing you 've ever known , they know how to use their body weight and internal muscles to best effect sometimes overloading you with sensation .
Best of all of course they 'll do anything you say .
I began to see how a brothel owner could corner the market , reach the point where he could force his competition out of business .
Best of all Doc 's girls could continue to command top dollar for years after a normal girl would be forced to retire .
They may be initially more expensive but Doc 's slaves outlasted dozens of drugged up runaways .
After I 'd been working for Doc for about a year he asked me if I wanted to try recruiting , that is finding women and girls for Doc to process .
We usually picked runaways or prostitutes , women who could go missing without being noticed .
Occasionally though we got special orders though Doc 's contacts .
Men who wanted their ex-wives , jilting lovers or pushy bosses turning into fuck toys .
Because of the risks these jobs often paid better that providing a fresh slave .
I pulled twenty three kidnappings last year , none of which have ever been reported .
I 've become the ultimate predator , like a big jungle cat I know my territory and my prey , know what to risk and when .
And like a cat I sometimes play with my victims .
The moment I 'd seen Beth in the full St. Mary 's uniform some twenty year old feelings of pain and anger had been rekindled .
I knew that somewhere God was laughing .
The years disappeared in an instant and I 'd known immediately that I had to take them .
It may seem unfair that they should pay for someone else 's mistake but it did have a certain symmetry .
Besides every St. Mary 's girl I 'd ever met was a total bitch and these two were unlikely to be different .
I smiled at Beth who shuffled in her seat as much as the belt would allow .
I had something special in store for her and it started with a gag .
I reached into the bag and found what I wanted .
It was a rubber mouthpiece shaped at the front a little like a boxer 's gumshield .
One of Doc 's perverted friends was a dentist who we called in if a slave needed dental work .
Once in a drunken stupor I 'd explained this idea to him and the next time I 'd visited Doc 's a parcel had been waiting for me ......
Carefully I filled the gumshield with a special resin .
She watched silently probably trying to figure what I was doing .
When I was ready I took a strap from the bag and slipped it loosely around her neck .
She panicked .
She started shaking her head blabbering and crying .
It took me a while to understand .
" Stop it !
I have no intention of strangling you , that is n't what the strap is for .
Now cut it out or I 'll hit you . "
She stopped , eyes full of fear .
Quickly I unbuckled the ball gag and before she had time to respond shoved the rubber mouthpiece between her teeth .
As she shook her head and tried to spit it out I forced one end of the strap under her jaw and the other over her head .
Then I tightened it clamping her teeth down on the gumshield .
She blubbered , but she could n't get her mouth open .
Next came the cuffs .
Up front was good , behind was better .
I released her seat belt then one wrist .
She tried to resist but her position was hopeless .
I pulled a small loop of fishing twine loose from the seat and threaded the cuffs through it before refastening her wrist behind her .
She tugged for a while but there was no give .
Her hands were fastened behind her to the seat .
I replaced the seat belt and pushed the magic button to lock it .
She tried to move forward but found that she was strapped to her chair once more .
Reaching into the bag I took out a leg clincher , a device that straps around the thighs and clamps the legs together .
She struggled and as her legs were n't currently bound it proved quiet an effort to get the clincher on and tightened .
However once it was done the effect was perfect .
Beth 's upper legs were completely immobilized .
Lower legs were more of a problem .
I have some special boots at home that are ideal for this but of course they are never around when you need them .
Instead I had an interesting device .
This was a length of a rubber material the outside of which was covered in cotton cloth , the inside with Velcro .
Reaching down I wrapped it tightly around her lower legs just above her ankles .
Pulling her legs back I fastened an eye on the device to a small hook under the seat .
She moaned a little but now she could n't move her legs at all .
Then I removed the chin strap , sitting back so I could see her reaction .
For a second her eyes bulged , then she gurgled .
I smiled .
The resin had set , cementing her teeth to the gumshield and locking her jaws closed .
Still her gurgles were too loud .
Forcing her lips apart I located the small valve set in the front to the gumshield and inserted the pump I 'd used earlier with Maria .
As the bladder in the mouthpiece started to inflate Beth 's cries became more and more muffled .
When I determined she was quiet enough I removed the pump and did a grope test to confirm .
Satisfied , I stuck a strip of flesh colored tape over her mouth being very careful to work it around her lips .
The tape was thin and but for color differences it was hard to tell were her skin stopped and the tape started .
Despite her struggles I managed to apply a layer of foundation makeup to her face and the tape .
After a few threats she held still enough for me to apply the next layer .
I finished by painting a pair of pouty lips on the tape with lip gloss .
Even sitting next to her I could n't see the join .
The tape was invisible , the gloss lips looked like they were her own .
Even a few feet away it would be impossible to tell she was gagged .
The mouthpiece and tape together were almost a 100 % effective you could stand a few feet away and hear nothing .
I pulled the plad skirt down over the leg clincher then got out and walked to her door .
I glanced inside .
Her cuffed hands were behind her back and out of sight .
The leg clincher was hidden by the skirt , the binder at her ankles looked like knee socks and of course there was no sign of the gag .
A casual observer could see nothing strange .
I smiled then got back inside , as a final thought I pulled out a long dark wig and put it on her head .
I doubted anyone would remember her but it did n't hurt to make her look a little different .
Satisfied I started up and headed for the road .
Reaching over I found Beth 's breast though the sweater and started to massage it .
I became aware of a very faint muffled protest but the engine covered it completely .
" Tell me Beth was this what the impudent trucker wanted ? "
Of course she did n't answer .
" Now come on Beth , " I said , " You can nod and shake .
I 'm sure you can answer simple questions .
You 're helpless , you must realize that .
The only hope you and your friend have is to please me and it would please me if you answer .
Understand ? "
She nodded .
" Good girl , " I said encouragingly .
" Now I 'll repeat the question .
Was this what the trucker wanted ? "
She nodded and looked down .
" Bet he wanted a blow job too did n't he ? "
She nodded again .
" Thought so .
You see I doubt his schedule would leave him the time to fuck even one of you so he'd have to take a couple of quickies .
Funny is n't it , if you had n't been so high and mighty and had actually sucked the poor bastard you'd be safe in Worcester by now . "
She nodded and looked at the floor .
A couple of hours ago she'd been horrified at the prospect of giving some poor trucker a blow job .
Now I think she 'd suck the whole Teamsters Union just to be safe in Worcester .
" Tell me Beth do you want to suck me ? "
She nodded frantically .
It had n't escaped her attention that I 'd have to remove the horrible gag for her to blow me .
" What about fucking me .
Do you want to fuck me Beth ? "
She hesitated , I smiled .
She did n't want to go that far .
" Well I 'm afraid you are going to fuck me Beth and suck me and do whatever else I want do you want to know why ? "
Getting no response I decided to tell her anyway .
" You see Beth back in '76 I was just a little older than you are now and living just a few miles from your Alma Mater . "
She looked up .
" That 's Latin for St. Mary's . " I smiled .
" Anyway I met this girl , let 's call her Jane .
She looked a lot like you , about the same size , same blonde hair , same uniform .
I loved her .
You know they say young love burns the hottest .
Are you in love Beth ? "
She shook her head .
" Shame , " I said , " Young love is a wonderful thing .
You see my mother died when I was very young so when I fell for this girl I fell real hard .
We had sex day and night almost continuously every opportunity we got .
Jane was one randy bitch , she was never satisfied .
Cunt , ass , mouth . "
I smiled evilly , " You 'll see .
I wanted to marry her but when I suggested it she backed away and would n't even answer my calls .
She was real hard to get to while she was at school so I waited for the Easter break .
It must be close to twenty years ago today , I 'm sure you can see the symmetry Beth .
I was just amazed .
Anyway I went to her families place in Boston to confront her .
She laughed in my face , told me that I was just a toy .
A blue collar boy she could just use and discard , worse her father was there and he offered me money to get lost .
Told me to take it and blow or he'd get his friend the police commissioner to have me picked up .
I left with them laughing at me Beth , feeling helpless and alone .
Just as helpless and alone as you feel now . "
Several cars had passed I 'd watched her reaction , felt her despair at knowing that the other drivers could see nothing wrong .
" I joined the Marines .
Got involved in Recon , did my share of black ops .
When I left the service I met this guy .
He trains slaves , claims he can turn any woman into a sex toy in a few weeks .
Once he offered to make a slave for me , sort of a Christmas bonus .
He said if I chose the woman he would do the rest .
So I went out to find Jane , it was n't difficult , her face was in the society columns almost daily .
Trouble was that she was married , had a couple of kids .
Kids need a mother Beth , growing up without one I realized that .
I could have taken her , could have used her as a plaything as she used me but then her kids would have suffered .
It did n't seem fair somehow so I let her go .
My friend 's offer still stands though and all I need is a girl .
You are going to be that girl Beth .
In a couple of weeks you 'll be sucking and fucking like a good little whore . "
We passed through a small town and I watched as Beth tried desperately to attract someone 's attention with the little movement she had , she got a few strange looks but no one realized what was going on .
I smiled .
By the time we left town she was weeping .
I felt her despair and knew Doc would be pleased , the first stage of processing had already begun .
About an half hour later and still a few miles from Doc 's I pulled over and went around to her side .
Doc has a rule , one that we who work for him rigidly obey , no slave will ever know the exact location of Doc 's house .
Doc supplies girls all over the country and once they 've left him he can no longer be certain how secure they 'd be kept .
It was possible that despite his training a girl could get away and alert the authorities .
Our clients always work through a chain of intermediaries and do n't know our location but the girls * have * to be brought here for training .
I lowered Beth 's seat letting it recline down as far as I could .
Reaching into the bag I took a small tube of cream and told her to close her eyes .
She jumped a little as I applied the cream to her lashes , but she would see the reason soon enough .
Very gently I stuck an oval of surgical tape over each eyelid sealing them closed .
Satisfied she could see nothing I took a simple sleep mask like the ones you get on long distance flights and fastened it over her eyes .
Closing the door I cast a critical eye at the scene but could see nothing suspicious .
How many times on a long trip does your passenger try to sleep ?
It was dark and quite late and my passenger tired of being woken by the light was using a sleep mask to try and get some rest .
Satisfied I checked on Maria .
The girl looked up the moment I opened the trunk .
She tried to say something but of course it was pointless .
A quick check of her bonds found she 'd been unable to budge a single one .
Maria would probably only see a brief glimpse of the place between trunk and dungeon .
Still a rule is a rule .
The quick application of a padded leather blindfold ensured she would see nothing when we took her out .
Satisfied that my guests were comfortable I pressed on to Doc's .
Every mile brought me a little closer to Kitten and by the time I was entering the lane I was very , very hard .
It 's said that even a craftsman can make a mistake and Kitten was mine .
I 'd come across her in a New York alleyway on a cold December day five years ago .
I could see that she was young , though the grime and the smell kept me from realizing just how young .
She was just sitting in a corner starving , contemplating whether to sell her blood or her virtue first .
Then I came along and made that decision for her .
She was the easiest capture I ever made though I feel she 'd probably have willing signed up for slavery if it meant 3 squares and a warm bed .
She traveled to Doc 's in my trunk very securely bound and gagged but it proved unnecessary as she gave me no trouble .
It was only later while we were cleaning her up that we realized the truth .
Kitten was only thirteen years old .
Now neither Doc nor myself are pedophiles and we do n't deal with anyone that is .
That meant that we had a slave who was a good three years ahead of her sell by date .
We discussed it , even contemplated throwing her back but it was far too risky .
Besides as we watched her wolf down that first meal we realized what a hard time she 'd had .
It took little encouragement for her to tell us her story .
Her mother had been a Pro in Pittsburgh , she had n't known her father .
She 'd been taken into care at age nine when her mom had been put away for the third time .
Somehow her mother had got an early parole but had died of a drug overdose before she could reclaim her daughter .
Kitten had been in and out of foster care since then finally ending up in a children 's home .
She did n't want to say much more but Doc 's examination had revealed the truth .
At thirteen Kitten was no longer a virgin and had n't been for some time .
In the end the solution to the Kitten problem was obvious .
Doc lived alone except for various " guests " and to be honest he was n't as young as he was .
So Kitten became his house slave , cooking , cleaning and looking after the old man 's needs .
He now claims that he called her Kitten because of the way she likes having her hair stroked but I can remember what he really said that first time .
After all Kitten is as good a name as any for a little pussy :-)
At fifteen Kitten 's sexual side started to assert itself and with some reluctance Doc started teaching her the various tricks he taught his sex slaves .
She proved to have quite an appetite and on her sixteenth birthday , when she was beyond Doc 's taboos , she had taken him to bed and virtually raped him .
I used to have trouble explaining to others just who she was .
She was Doc 's slave , lover , housekeeper , nursemaid , assistant , companion ........ granddaughter ???
In a strange way maybe so .
In the end Doc gave me the definitive answer .
" Sorcerers apprentice ! " he said with a smile and from then on it was settled .
I bumped down the drive the final few yards to Doc 's door .
I kept asking him to get it surfaced but he just smiled .
The noise , he said , was an extra warning of visitor in case his numerous electronic systems broke down .
As I neared the door I heard his voice from inside .
" Charles , old boy , before you come in go to the beer cooler and bring me a couple of cans .
Take what you want while you 're there . "
An old wood and wire cooler sat on the porch , it had no refrigeration other than the cold New England air , but that seemed to be enough .
I knew what I 'd find inside , cans of British beer sent to Doc by one of his European customers .
Grabbing a couple more for myself I went inside .
" You should put these in the refrigerator " " Dear me Charles , whatever for ? "
" Sorry I forgot .
You drink English beer warm . "
Doc smiled , and combat began .
" Not at all dear boy .
Warm British beer is I 'm afraid an American exaggeration .
Beer should be kept at the * right * temperature .
In my youth it used to be hand pumped from vats in the pub cellar .
Britain is a cold country , dear boy , I assure you it arrives anything but warm .
The problem you have here is that you overcool your beer .
It 's a man 's drink not some fizzy beverage , it should be treated with respect . "
" Still as grouchy as ever I see . "
" One of the benefits of age I 'm afraid .
In another fifty years you 'll see it 's attractions . "
I poured the beer into the glass he offered and sat back .
" Well you wanted me and I 'm here .
So what 's so damned important ? "
" Ah yes .
I 'm sorry to drag you from your holidays but something of an emergency has come up .
I 'm doing a special job for one of our New York clients , two girls to be prepared in advance of some office outing .
Very good money obviously but due to some mix - up the date 's been brought forward . "
I sipped the beer , " Are they ready ? "
" Oh yes , have been for a few weeks I 've been holding them here until the client was ready .
It 's sort of a strange deal , he wants them to do something at this party of his , then he want 's us to dispose of them . "
" Dispose ? " " Juan will take them no problem .
Teressa has also expressed an interest though I do n't know yet if she wants both .
As you 'll see they 're more valuable as a set but there are problems with Mexico at the moment .
Still with the training paid for we could almost afford to give them away ..... "
" Seems straight forward , " I said , " Ca n't see that there is too much of a problem . "
Doc shuffled uneasily .
" Truth is that there are some problems . "
" Oh ? " " You are familiar with my techniques Charles .
You know that some have taken fifty years to develop .
I admit to having some failures in the past but for perhaps the past thirty years I 've been sure enough of my findings to be able to draw up certain axioms . "
I nodded , when he first told me what he did I 'd not really believed him .
In the Marines I 'd been through special training , tortured by professionals to find my breaking point and give me the tools to resist torture by the other side .
With constant physical and mental abuse almost anyone will break , the trainers job was to gauge that point before the subject was irreversibly damaged .
Compared to Doc those guys were in the Stone Age .
I 've picked up a runaway and two months later seen the same girl turned into a accomplished whore .
Doc 's girls are n't just obedient , they are so compliant , so willing .
Doc claims his technique makes the slave actively need sex , they have an enormous appetite and seem to genuinely enjoy every moment .
Pleasure , he says , is much more effective persuader than pain .
Hurt someone and all they 'll do is try and avoid what caused the pain .
Pleasure someone and they will actively seek out more .
Doc scratched his nose , " The problem is this .
Our client wanted one of the girls to maintain most of her original personality .
That is , he wanted her aware of what she was doing and able to respond in a characteristic way to her environment .
Now as you know this implies that rather than break the girl we should condition her with various desired responses .
This means that she would appear as normal but when given a trigger event or an order from the master she 's been conditioned to obey she would perform the desired task . "
I nodded .
After six years I understood * that * much .
" All my research shows such a thing requires between three and six months depending on subject .
I 've * never * produced such a girl in less time , not with total success anyway .
The problem is that our client 's time scale has left a little under six weeks for training .
That was barely enough time to break her friend .
I 've made a start , I feel that she 'll do the job he requires but our control of her is very unstable .
I 'm afraid for the most part you must consider both of them hostile and transport them accordingly . "
New recruits were " hostile , " that meant that if they were n't tied down they would try to run away .
Usually transporting one of Doc 's girls after processing was easy .
No escape attempts , no bonds , you just drove them somewhere like they were regular people .
In fact the only downside was that if you did n't fuck them every night they had a tendency to be moody in the morning .
Tough job but someone has to do it .
" What about this " party " if she gives us problems there We could have witnesses ? "
Doc smiled , " I 've thought of that .
I 'll give you a drug , it 's a will suppressant , inject her with it about twenty minutes before you arrive and she wo n't give you much trouble for the next few hours .
Let the girls do their thing , then pack them up , ship them back and let me worry what to do with them . "
The plan seemed reasonable , though the risks involved in transporting an unstable slave must be worth double .
Then I remembered .
" Doc , you remember you offered to process a slave for me ? " " Yes ? "
" Well I 've found one .
I recruited a couple of hitchers tonight and one of them is perfect . "
" Recruited ?
Not around here I trust ? "
I smiled , " Twenty , thirty miles . "
I heard Doc breath in , " Charles , how many times do I have to tell you .
We do not recruit around here .
For God sake not even a dog pees in his own basket . "
" I did n't intend to take them !
When you see her you 'll understand . "
" Very well .
I suppose if they 're here it 's a little too late .
We 'll need Kitten .
You 'd better get her . "
" Where is she ? "
" In her basket . " " Basket ? " I was surprised , " Is she being punished ? "
" No , our little Kitten has a few more kinks than even we knew .
Go get her and you 'll see . "
Doc keeps his slaves in hidden underground cells and dungeons .
In fact nothing to do with his illicite career exists above the surface .
This means that if we got unlucky and the place was raided it was unlikely to yield any clues .
However Kitten had been a problem .
A house slave has to wash and clean and look after her master which is fine except a sudden raid was likely to find her above ground .
With this in mind we had built Kitten 's " Basket " a small hidden cell concealed within part of the fireplace .
At night she had slept underground with the others , but during the day when she was n't needed or if the security system warned of a sudden visitor she would be locked up in the basket until Doc was ready to let her out .
Doc had been a cautious man , despite Kitten 's good will he had still kept her bound and gagged for much of the first three months .
It had n't been uncommon to see the girl naked but for her bonds struggling to clean the floor with her hands tied .
Doc had kept her naked not for any sexual reason but because the lack of clothes and the cold weather outside discouraged escape .
Gently I pushed the hidden latches and swung the basket 's door open .
Kitten was inside dressed in a leather basque and bikini brief set .
Stockings and high heel pumps were a must of course as that was one of Doc 's favorite fetishes as were the long leather opera gloves .
The room , which had been large enough to take a bound thirteen year old was now barely big enough for Kitten to lie down it .
She was gagged with a large leather pad gag of Doc 's patented design , her ankles fastened to a spreader .
I could n't see her hands but figured they were bound behind her .
A length of white cotton rope had been used as a crotch strap wrapped once around her waist then passing between her legs pushing the leather panties deep into her damp twat .
I noticed the small movement of the knots she 'd tied as they teased her clit through the panties , the other end of the strap was probably tied to her wrist in some way .
The whole thing looked frustrating , I doubted that she could ever get off on her own .
" She did it herself a few hours back , " Doc said , " I think it 's her way to get you to fuck her .
I 'll go out and see to that girl of yours .
You 'll find the keys on the small table , a condom too .
Please use it Charles old man , not that I do n't trust you but remember you are peeing in the well I drink from . "
Kitten 's eyes twinkled , she 'd been leading me on for months , cock teasing me until I could think of nothing else .
Doc ran an open house policy .
The few of us in direct contact with him had almost unlimited access to the slave pens .
The only exceptions tended to be if a client specified that they wanted exclusive use or if sex would somehow interfere with training .
Other than that any girl in the place was fair game .
Except for Kitten .
As part of her strange status Kitten only fucked the men Kitten wanted to fuck .
Oh I have no doubt that Doc could order her to do it , after all she was still a slave , but I doubted he ever would .
So Kitten had played with me for the last few months and this was the payoff .
I could n't see the bondage angle though .
Doc keeps all his girls bound and gagged as a security measure , and all of his slaves have been fucked in bondage at least once .
Kitten was the exception though so I could only figure that this kink was entirely of her own choosing .
By now I 'd got my pants off and was trying with trembling hand to roll on the condom .
Kitten just watched amused , tugging occasionally on the crotch strap to keep things cooking .
At last I was ready .
I used a knife to cut the cord above her snatch and slowly pulled the strings to release the bikini briefs .
Kitten moaned as I removed the panties ; Doc 's gags are very effective and I doubted she would get much louder .
She trembled with anticipation and the overpowering smell of her sex hit me making my rubber coated cock swell even more .
I felt I would have to start soon or pass out so I put my cock on the entrance of her womb and pushed .
She gave a muffled squeal .
Even though she was well lubricated she was impossibly tight .
I paused , concerned that I may have hurt her .
I heard the spreader drag for a second as she adjusted her position .
Then she thrust up engulfing me in a tight warmness .
Her muffled scream sounding surprisingly loud in the tight confines of the basket .
She thrust again and I finally got the point .
I started fucking her in earnest feeling her muscles at they grasped my cock and pulled me deeper inside .
The tightness was incredible it was almost as if we were joined at the waist .
I felt her orgasm building deep inside her body feeling it wash over my buried cock like a tidal wave .
She came and her hot cunt sucked deeply on my cock , pumping , draining me dry as I seemed to cum for hour after hour .
I fell back feeling relieved I still had some body fluids left and wondering for some strange reason if Mi Lin knew what had happened , as if a woman can somehow know when she 's suddenly no longer " the best . "
I managed to stagger to my feet and get the keys , one for the spreader , one for the cuffs and one for the gag .
I freed her slowly allowing myself the opportunity to tease her bound body before finally letting her go .
I left the gag ' til last so that I could remove it when she was standing .
I pulled the mouthpiece free .
She licked her lips .
" Hi Master Charlie , " She said , voice hoarse and sexy .
" Hi Kitten . " I did n't know what else to say .
It was pointless asking if it was good for her , the volume of her cries despite Doc 's special gag had proved that .
It was pointless to say that I loved her because she belonged to someone else , literally .
In the end Doc interrupted the moment .
The door opened and in staggered Maria .
she " looked " around the room with her blindfolded face .
Her gag and the bonds around her upper body were still as before and swatches of cut duct tape still adhered to her jeans .
She was joined a second later by Beth .
Doc had removed the leg bindings and the sleep mask for some reason .
She stood there looking oddly normal save for her taped eyes .
Kitten recovered the bikini briefs and I put on my pants .
Doc appeared behind the two girls and pushed Maria forward .
The helpless girl staggered and almost fell making a little mewing sound behind her gag .
" Ah Kitten , all finished are we ?
Good girl .
Now take this one down and start processing her straight away .
I want a full workup , virginal swabs , urine test and a blood sample for the HIV test . "
Kitten sighed , from bondage babe to private nurse in a few minutes .
She flashed me a smile then grabbing Maria 's arm she started to pull her towards the hidden dungeon door .
Doc pointed at Beth 's concealed gag .
" Not still doing this are you .
It 's going to get you caught one of these days . "
" I think it 's pretty good myself .
Squeeze a nipple if you do n't believe me . "
Doc shook his head , " I have no doubt that the gag is effective and I agree that it is n't easily noticeable but the fact remains that while a slave is in public view she has too many opportunities to draw attention to herself . "
" First up , I only use it at night and even then only for short trips .
Second the alternative was to put her on the back seat .
I accept that there is less chance of her being seen but if someone does see a girl bound and gagged in the back of your car they * will * notice . "
" And if you 're stopped ? "
He persisted .
" If she 's tied up in the back it 's all over anyway !
This way I just show her the gun and make it clear that if she draws attention to herself the cop dies .
In poor light you can't easily notice it even close up . "
Doc shook his head , I do n't think he 'll ever be convinced .
" This is the one you want processed ? " he said .
I nodded .
" How much ? "
" Full treatment , the works . " " Expensive ! " " So your offer was only good for a six week fuck toy ? " I asked innocently .
He scowled , " Full treatment it is then . "
He reached over and pulled off the wig letting Beth 's natural blonde hair cascade down .
" Is n't .......? " he began .
I put a finger to his lips silencing him .
Beth " looked " around disorientated and scared .
" We had better get Kitten up here to process this one , " Doc said .
I shook my head .
" I want to save the uniform , " I said , " That means we need to actually strip her rather than just cutting the clothes off .
Kitten can't manage that on her own . "
Doc smiled , " Never underestimate Kitten , Charles .
She 's far more talented than you can imagine . "
We took Beth down to a dungeon room and stripped her ourselves .
She struggled of course but still blindfolded and gagged she was too disorientated to put up a spirited resistance .
I showed Doc the special solvent solution that allowed the hidden gag to be removed and even he had to admit it was ingenious .
When we were finished Beth hung from the ceiling , arms and legs separated by spreaders , blindfolded with a conventional leather blindfold and chewing happily on one of Doc 's gags .
Satisfied that she was ready for Kitten we headed off in search of Maria .
Doc smiled , " Charles old man I must confess I never realized you were so ruthless .
You can't take the mother so you take the daughter ?
I am right ?
Beth is Jane 's daughter ? "
I nodded , " You can imagine my reaction , and tonight of all nights .
I did n't realize until she took her jacket off and I saw her in the full uniform .
I mean it 's been four years since I last checked up on Jane , Beth was just a little kid then .
You must see why I took her , it seemed like fate .
I can't imagine what Jane Walters daughter would be doing hitching to Worcester .
It was so bizarre , so perfect ..... "
Kitten appeared in the corridor .
" I think I can answer some of your questions , if you 're interested ? "
We walked into another dungeon area to find Maria hanging naked From the roof .
She was bound identically to her friend with blindfold , gag and spreaders .
Over the years Doc had developed a set of standard practices .
Binding the girls like this allowed for a full medical exam with minimal fuss .
Kitten gave Doc a clipboard and pointed to some results .
" HIV and micro bacteriology will have to wait of course , but this bitch is definitely pregnant . "
I watched Maria stiffen .
Doc checked the clipboard , " You checked ? "
Kitten shrugged , " Twice , she 's either pregnant or has some form of ovarian cyst .
Given her age the later seems unlikely . "
I looked at Kitten amazed .
Doc noticed the look , " Come now Charles you should n't be that surprised .
Surely you did n't think I 'd developed the technology just to have an endless supply of willing pussy ? "
In fact I * had * thought that but I kept silent for now .
" The same techniques I use to make a sex slave in two months can make a pretty good doctor in a couple of years . "
" Pretty good ? "
Kitten said , " You know my grade point average . "
" Yes my dear but it does n't count unless you actually graduate medical school . "
Kitten pouted and stormed back towards Maria .
I watched her go amazed .
Doc bent over and whispered conspiratorially , " Told you not to underestimate her ..... "
Kitten removed Maria 's gag .
" Ok you bitch who got you up the spout . "
Maria seemed confused .
" Up the spout ? " I whispered to Doc. " Pregnant .
I 'm afraid too many years living with an Englishman has played havoc with Kitten 's idioms . "
" Let me go you bitch ! " Maria screamed .
I saw Kitten stiffen .
Kitten tutted , " Wrong answer and wrong name .
You are the * bitch * .
You will call me * mistress * or by God I 'll make you suffer ! "
I felt my blood run cold .
" May I suggest that we adjourn off to the snug for a whisky ? "
Doc suggested .
" I get the feeling things are about to get a little unpleasant .
I let Kitten do most of the discipline these days because quite frankly she has a certain talent for it . "
" Please stay , " Kitten said , " This really wo n't take a second . "
She turned and grabbed Maria 's nipple twisting viscously .
Bringing her head close she hissed in Maria ear in a voice so cold and viscous I found myself with the chills again .
" Hungry bitch ?
Arms getting a little tired ?
I 'm the one who decides when you come down .
* I* say when or if you eat .
So tell me slave what do you say ? "
She gave another twist and Maria 's will dissolved .
" S...sorry . " I smiled .
It was n't easy for a St. Mary 's girl to apologize , that is n't the way they are brought up , but Maria was a realist and survival meant not messing with Kitten .
" Sorry what ? "
Kitten asked .
" Sorry Mistress . "
" Good girl ! " Kitten said .
She turned and smiled .
" See that did n't take long did it . "
Turning back to Maria she gently massaged the injured nipple " So tell us about how you got yourself pregnant . "
Even with half her face covered by a blindfold Maria looked sheepish .
" Carl .... a .. a boy who works on the grounds .
We took precautions I bought him condoms and hid them .
There must have been a defect . "
She slumped down miserable .
Then I suddenly realized , " You were going to Worcester for an abortion were n't you ? ? "
She nodded and sniffed , " One of the girls knew of a guy .
We could n't use a legal clinic , they have to take your name ...
I 'd have to have my parent 's approval ....
They 'd have to know .
We thought using one outside of town was better but we did n't have transport . "
" And Beth , " I asked .
" The girls said someone would have to come with me , in case there were problems .
They drew straws ...... "
And suddenly a thousand to one shot became ten thousand to one .........
I cleared my throat , " This guy you were going to see , what was his address ? "
A plan had started to form in my mind , a way to shift suspicion away from here and back towards Worcester .
" In my jeans pocket ..... "
Kitten had cut the jeans off with a knife but fortunately the pockets were intact .
Kitten reached down and picked up the remains working her was through the pockets methodically .
Finally she found a piece of paper which she handed to Doc who read it and winced .
" My dear young lady I know that things may seem quite desperate for you now but I can assure you that you 've had a fortunate escape .
This man is a scoundrel , a quack and a butcher !
I shudder to think what would have befallen you at his hands . "
Maria " looked " up .
" Really ? "
She asked weakly .
" Really , " Doc said firmly , " Kitten , help our young mother down and find her a nice private cell away from the others .
Minimal bonds , no gag and double rations .
She is eating for two after all . "
" Two ? " Maria whispered .
" Yes my dear I think we will let you come to term on this one .
Do not fear both myself and Mistress Kitten are well qualified , you will get the best in private care . "
" B... but I do n't want the baby . "
Doc smiled , " No but we do .
Now hurry along Kitten dear and do make sure that our mother to be is nice and warm . "
I watched as Kitten dragged the still reluctant Maria away .
" * You * want the baby ? " I asked .
" Oh yes , " Doc said , " Good healthy white baby can easily pull in twenty thousand if you can find the right adoptive parents .
That 's a tidy profit on nine months room and board .
Further it will establish Maria as having a good reproductive track record .
There are societies were that is a highly valued property in a slave . "
" You 're a bastard you know . "
Doc smiled , " And your point is ?
Anyway , while we 're here I may as well introduce you to your cargo . "
We wondered through the pens .
Doc 's place was built to handle twenty girls or more , but that had been in the sixties when there had been an almost infinite number of Flower Children to choose from and HIV was a far off nightmare .
These days he keeps perhaps ten at a time , a number he and Kitten can handle easily between them .
The corridors are always quiet , Doc keeps his girls bound and gagged at all times to " discourage mischief " .
I must admit it works .
It 's hard for the girls to plan a mutiny when they can't talk to one another .
We stopped at a cell occupied by two girls .
Unlike the occupants of some of the other cells these two wore clothes .
The older woman was in her mid thirties with long brown hair and dark brown eyes .
She was dressed in a fairly expensive female business suit complete with stockings and sensible pumps .
She mumbled something into her gag and tried to move forward .
The steel collar around her neck stopped her getting any further .
Doc pointed to her .
" That 's the one we were talking about , " he said , " Her name 's Myra . "
" This one , " He said pointing to the younger blonde girl , " Used to be called Joanne but these days we call her JoJo . "
JoJo was dressed in the most incredible outfit I 'd ever seem .
A latex lace up basque , latex thigh high five inch heeled boots and shiny latex gloves .
" This is their outfit for the party , we kept them in it after today 's practice so that they can give you a demonstration . "
He handed me a key and nodded towards Myra then started to unfasten JoJo .
" Right ladies go to work . "
Myra sat as if she was at a desk .
A pair of glasses had appeared from somewhere and she sat pantomiming reading papers .
Pausing she pressed a button on an invisible intercom .
" JoJo come in here please . "
JoJo flounced over .
There was something in the way she moved , in the vacant look in her eyes that told me she was a six week special .
Doc had broken her , destroying completely the woman she used to be and programming the husk as a simple sex toy .
I could see how Myra could be a problem , there was still a flicker of self awareness behind those brown eyes but for JoJo it was all over .
All she could wish for now was a kind master and an easy life .
It was unlikely she 'd have either .
" JoJo !
Fine personal assistant you are I was looking through these accounts and I 've found a problem . "
" Really miss what 's wrong ? "
Even her voice lacked any personality .
" There 's still money in them you little bitch !
Why do I employ you ! "
JoJo squirmed pushing her latex covered cleavage in the older woman 's face .
" I dunno .
Because I lick slit good ? "
Myra stood up threw off her jacket and the glasses and then Doc pressed a button and the music started .
I 'd seen lesbian displays before , most erotic dance shows have at least one if they can get away with it .
Most are quiet boring as you soon get the feeling that the girls are just play acting .
This was different , it had an energy and rhythm about it that was unmatched in my experience .
Each woman latched on to the other , licking , fingering , teasing in time to the music .
Methodically they stripped each other , though in fact Myra ended up taking the most off .
Underneath blouse and skirt was a latex top and a pair of matching bikini briefs .
This left both women dressed almost identically at which point the lesbian foreplay became more spirited .
There was a strange urgency to it all as each woman tried desperately to bring the other off .
I looked at JoJo , the vacant look had been replaced by a desperate unearthly hunger .
I saw it 's reflection in Myra 's eyes but I also saw something more , a horror , self loathing and disgust .
It hovered just below the surface suppressed by Doc 's conditioning but it was there .
Somewhere the real Myra was aware of what she was doing , aware but unable to stop .
Then suddenly JoJo came , and moments later Myra followed her with a screaming mind stunning orgasm that left her twitching on the floor .
I helped her up .
The vacant look had crept into her eyes as if the orgasm had somehow crushed the last vestige of her personality .
She did n't struggle as I rebound her and shoved the gag back into her limp mouth .
We went back upstairs in silence .
" What was that Doc ?
What have we got ourselves into ? "
" That was one hundred percent what the client ordered , " Doc said defensively .
" He even scripted it and chose the music .
You see there is a gimmick .
I 've made it so that each woman has an orgasm that is perhaps a tenth of it 's usual potency .
Except , if she cums just after another woman then it's more like ten * times * the usual potency . "
" So each tries to make the other cum first ! " " Right !
If you cum first you get a little tremble .
Cum second and the world explodes . "
" So Myra won just now . "
Doc smiled , " She usually does , one of the advantages of not having been broken yet .
The whole setup was the client 's idea he just asked if it was possible . "
" But why ? "
Doc handed me a whisky , " Myra worked for a major Manhattan bank in their foreign trading desk .
Quite senior , a VP I believe .
Joanne was her PA .
Our client was another VP who 's department used the Foreign Desk a lot .
He started to notice some irregularities which at first he put down to some over ambitious trading .
Gradually though he started to find evidence of a widespread securities fraud being run from somewhere inside Myra 's department .
As was common procedure at the bank he approached the board in Myra 's absence and was ordered to investigate fully .
One weekend he and some of his people entered Myra 's departmental records and started to do an audit . "
I could see where this was going , " And the culprit turned out to be Myra . . "
" Exactly !
She had embezzled several million dollars in the past three years and he was able to prove it .
He called her in and asked for an explanation and she just laughed in his face .
Told him not to be a stupid little boy , that they could n't go to law because after Barrings and that Tokyo scandal any publicity would bring down the bank .
She even threatened to go public herself if he pushed it .
She handed him her resignation and just left laughing at him as she went and taking Joanne with her . "
" So he hired you to get revenge . "
" In a way , " Doc said , " You were in London that week so Martin and Ray picked up our two young friends .
The bank has managed to bury the loss through some careful accounting .
The office has a tradition of going out to a cabaret evening once a year .
This year our man will provide the entertainment . "
" How 's he going to explain it ? " I asked puzzled .
" He 'll claim that Myra agreed to do it in exchange for not being sued for breach of contract . "
" Seems a little thin , " I said , " If I 'd stolen a few million I 'm sure I could find a better way out " Doc shrugged .
" Ultimately it does n't really mater , " Doc said , " He 'll get his few minutes of revenge and the public humiliation of Myra and he 'll be happy .
Let him explain it . "
I was n't satisfied but I let is ride .
" Anyway the party is tomorrow night in a club in Manhattan . "
Doc said , " You will take them to the show and bring them back here afterwards . "
I confess I did n't like it and I told him so but I think he felt I was overplaying things as a bargaining ploy .
In the end we agreed on a price .
Doc paused .
" By the way Charles , in nine months it will be Christmas I believe . "
" About then . "
I agreed .
" Lets have a party of our own then !
Maria will be having her baby and in nine months I can turn your Beth into the most perfect slave you 'll ever see ! "
" Sounds good , " I said standing , " But right now I need to get some sleep if I 'm driving tomorrow . "
I headed down to the dungeon to say goodnight to Kitten .
That look in Myra 's eye still bothered me .
I had a friend who worked one summer in a slaughter house .
He had no problems " processing " hundreds of cows a week , hell he even joked about it .
Then one day he just upped and left .
When I asked him why he told me about an accident they'd had , of a cow that had somehow survived the killer and how he'd watched it die in agony fully aware of what was going on .
Usually I did n't think about those we processed , it was quick and simple and there seemed to be little pain .
Myra was different .
We were slowly destroying her and like that poor cow she was aware of what we were doing to her .
I shuddered .
Kitten was in the dungeon with Beth .
The girl 's position had hardly changed since I left her though her shaved cunt showed that Kitten had been busy .
Slaves have no sexual contact until the results of the health checks came back , but of course this did n't include mechanical items .
When I arrived Kitten was just about to fit Beth with a large vibrator .
Not wanting to interfere I waited until Kitten had finished .
Kitten looked up , " Slave , your * master * is here to see you . "
She reached down and switched the device on .
Beth moaned behind her gag .
" He gives you this gift of pleasure in recognition of your obedience , " Kitten intoned , " And the gift of pain if you disobey . "
Beth 's hips quaked as she tried to get a better position and her moans increased in volume .
Kitten walked over .
" Come to see how she 's coming along , " She asked lightly .
" Actually I came to see you . "
" Doc told you then ? "
" Told me what ? "
" That I'm to supervise the processing of your slave ? " " You ? "
" Yes * me *
You have n't been here much master , I do most of the training these days . "
So Doc had n't been kidding when he'd called her his apprentice ......
" It 's about that girl Myra .
Do you know who the client is ? "
She shook her head .
" Doc works on a need to know basis and I did n't * need * to know .
Even if I did I could n't tell you .
Compartmentalization is essential if our security is to be maintained . "
" The intermediary , you must know * him * . "
" Master please , you know I can't say so why ask ? " " Kitten ! "
She rolled her eyes , " Ok , but if I end up scrubbing kitchen floors naked again * you* will be responsible . "
She sighed , " It 's Sam Turner . "
I kissed her and we made love then and there .
Above us and in a world of her own Beth swung backwards and forwards , moaning into her gag and thrusting her hips as she chased that illusive orgasm .

Doc's Orders by Quin ======================
Chapter 2 " New Beginnings and Loose Ends " =====================================
Next morning I woke refreshed .
I 'd gone to bed with the germ of an idea that had slowly blossomed into a fully fledged plan .
I 'd been up at six thirty and in search of Kitten .
I had no doubt that she would be up .
Slaving is like any other form of animal husbandry , up at dawn , down at dusk .
She was in the kitchen having breakfast .
The leather outfit of last night replaced by a cute latex French maid 's outfit which was probably for my benefit .
It seemed the teasing was on again .
She was reading a book but when she saw I was up she quickly put it down and headed for the stove .
" Sunny side up !
Right Master ? "
I nodded , the Marines had got me used to the idea of getting up early but at some primal level my body still did n't like it .
She passed me a large mug of coffee and started assembling breakfast .
I looked at the book " The BIG book of girls names . "
It had a cute picture of a woman playing with a baby on the cover .
" Getting a little ahead of yourself are n't we , " I asked , " She may have a boy . "
" I'm sorry Master ? "
" I was saying , your just a little ahead of yourself with Maria 's baby , " I said holding up the book .
" Oh , that 's not for the baby , " She said putting a large plate of pancakes on the table , " That 's for me . "
" You ? "
" Yes , I 'm choosing my new name .
At the moment I can't decide between Caitlin and Kathryn .
I think Caitlin sounds better but it has all those beach bunny , 90210 connotations .
Kathryn's more stuffy but hey , she 's s Starfleet Captain . "
" I 'm sorry ? " I said and I was , genuinely sorry that I 'd even started this conversation .
" Doc asked me if I wanted a new name . "
" Why ? " I said confused .
She arched her back and sucked her stomach in .
Her breasts were forced out , straining against the imprisoning latex .
Suddenly I was hard again .
" If you have n't noticed Master , " She purred , " I 'm hardly a kitten anymore . "
Now that she mentioned it I realized she was right .
I mean I know she had grown up , I 'd fucked her for God sake , but in my mind there were two Kitten 's , the sex vixen and the thirteen year old girl in that freezing alley .
Finding that they were the same person after all would take some adjustment .
Perhaps a new name was n't such a bad idea .
" What was the second one I asked ? " " Kathryn ?
It 's with a *y*.
Do you like it ? "
" Sorry ?
Err no , not especially , " I said , " Just did n't hear it right .
What are the others . "
She ran through a whole list and it did n't take me long to see the pattern .
" Do all these names shorten to Kat ? "
" I thought I 'd stick with the feline motif , " She said .
" Then why not just stick with Kat ? "
She wrinkled her nose , " It 's a little common do n't you think ?
Bit too much trailer trash ? " I gave up .
" Doc tells me you handle discipline these days ? "
" Ah , ah . " " How good are you at torture ? "
" For pleasure or punishment ? "
She asked handing me a bottle of maple syrup .
" There 's a difference ? " I asked .
" There is if you do it properly Master , " She said suggestively .
" I need to get some information from Beth .
I figure she 's either going to hold out on us or may tell us the wrong thing completely . "
" Like what ? "
" Bank card number . "
I said as I took my first bite of pancake .
Doc was an excellent cook with exceptionally high standards .
It came as no surprise that this was one of the first things he'd taught his young house slave .
Kitten 's pancakes were excellent , equal to the best you could find in the finest restaurant in the world .
" Are they good Master ? "
She asked innocently .
Now she was teasing me with food .
I ignored the obvious trolling for complements .
" About those numbers . "
She wrinkled her nose , " Piece of cake .
Should take about an hour . "
I frowned .
I 'd expected Beth to be more resilient than that .
Of course the money was n't much good to her now but it would be a while before she accepted that .
I realized that painful torture could open anyone 's lips , I knew that better than anybody , but Doc 's treatment was almost painless and the kind of " persuasion " necessary would go against that principle .
" An hour ? "
" Probably less , " Kitten said returning to the stove .
I shook my head .
" Do n't want to question your professional opinion , " I said , mouth full of pancake , " But I know this kind of girl .
Even if you took a whip to her she 's too stupid to know when to give up .. "
" An hour , " she insisted , " * Tops . * " I shook my head .
" If you do n't believe me we could have a small wager .... "
I laughed , " What do you have to wager ? "
Kitten smiled and bent over trusting her latex covered toosh at my face .
She brought a gloved finger up to her mouth and looked at me over her shoulder with a confused expression on her face .
It was an almost perfect reproduction of a fifties cheesecake shot .
" Gee Master , " She said wiggling her ass , " I ca n't think . "
" Ok , I said , " You made your point .
What do you want in return ? "
She smiled a sinister little smile .
" Personally I 've always liked the idea of a boy toy , " She said , " A male slave of my very own . "
I nearly choked on my coffee , " You ca n't be serious ? "
" Not so sure of your Beth after all ? "
Kitten taunted , " Or just not man enough to take the risk ? " I found myself flushed .
This should n't be happening , * SHE * was the slave here .
The idea of being Kitten 's slave did not appeal at all , I 'm too dominant for that , but I 'm too macho to back down .
" No drugs ? " I asked .
She gave me a pained look like I 'd just asked her to heat up a TV dinner .
" No drugs , " she said .
Beth was a Saint Mary 's girl , a bitch of the first order .
I doubted she'd be smart enough to give up that number in an hour if her life literally depended on it .
" Deal , " I said , " Get the number in less than an hour and I 'm yours for * ONE * night . "
Kitten gave an evil feline grin , " No restrictions ? "
" No restrictions , " I agreed , " As long as when you * LOSE * there are no restrictions while you 're mine . "
She smiled .
" Agreed , " She said , dumping ham , eggs and waffles on a plate in front of me , " Now eat up and lets go get our pigeon . "
Needless to say the breakfast was excellent .
We ate in silence but Kitten 's body language told me that she was supremely confident .
I began to feel nervous .
Afterwards we headed down to the dungeons .
Doc had explained the history of the place to me once .
It had been built in the fifties as some kind of Government survival shelter .
The idea was that certain key members of the Massachusetts State legislator would hide here in time of war .
Needless to say it was secret , not only to hide it from the Russians but also to prevent the possibility of the local people trying to break in during an alert .
In '62 the place got it 's first tryout during the Cuban Missile Crisis and was found to be too small for all the politicians and their hangers on and most importantly too hard to get to .
The Federal Government started building a new shelter north of Boston and this one was earmarked to be destroyed .
Somehow in the general confusion following the Kennedy assassination it was missed .
Doc bought it from the government as an undeveloped parcel of land in ' 65 and with a group of slaves built the house and the complex we know today .
We walked down the corridors listening to the muffled sounds of the slaves in their cells .
The design of the cells was a little unusual and reflected some of Doc 's thinking about the training of slaves .
For a start each cell had a section of steel bars about two feet wide and going floor to ceiling just to the right of the door .
This allows air and sounds in from the corridors and lets the slaves see the comings and goings throughout the day .
As the bars were always to the right of the doors and as the slaves are chained to their bunks it is n't possible for a slave to look out into another 's cell .
The slaves remain gagged so it is n't possible for them to communicate but they can hear each others sounds and know that they are not alone .
Doc claims this greatly speeds up the breaking of a slave because they share each others despair without the benefits of any camaraderie .
The slave starts to thinking that if all these others can't escape what chance does she stand , sees the naked , gagged women being dragged past her cell to an uncertain fate .
Eventually it overwhelms her .
By now we had arrived outside Beth 's cell .
Though the cells are designed for double occupancy , Doc always gives a new recruit single quarters for the first few days .
They tend to be noisy and disruptive and Doc does n't think it fair to trouble another slave with their tantrums .
The only exceptions tend to be if girls are recruited together or are being supplied to the same master .
If Maria had n't been pregnant it was likely she would have been Beth 's cellmate .
Kitten picked up a clipboard from beside the door and checked the contents .
" Some of the paperwork has n't been done , " She said , " Want to do it now ? "
I reached for the clipboard but she pulled it back .
" In there , " she said with a smile .
As we entered the cell Beth was struggling to stand .
I had known immediately what to expect , Doc had a standard uniform for slaves that almost all of them wore .
I watched her as she struggled and took in the details .
It started with high heeled ankle boots .
They consisted of a wooden sole attached to a solid platform heel .
The uppers were made of strong black leather , like the stuff they use to make army boots .
The uppers ran from the toes to a broad leather strap circling the ankle .
The strap was really a type of cuff and was fastened with a padlock which effectively made it impossible to remove the boots .
A couple of spare D rings on the cuffs allowed for additional restraint .
At the moment a short length of chain was clipped between them hobbling Beth 's ankles .
The whole look was workmanlike and functional if a little ugly .
The boots were battered and old , countless slaves had worn them through the years and there were probably dozens more in their future .
However they served a useful purpose , not only did they get the slave used to walking in heels they also made escape more difficult .
As they were locked in place an escaping slave could n't discard them easily .
Doc claims that the tendons in the back of the leg starts to shrink if a girl wears heels too long .
While that makes it easier for her to walk in them it effectively means that flats become uncomfortable .
In nine months Beth will have no choice than to be a high heeled slut .
The rest of Beth 's " outfit " was brief .
Around her waist she wore a chastity belt arrangement .
This was basically two wide leather straps .
One was fastened tightly around her waist , the other was attached to the first at the front and back passing between her legs on the way .
A couple of simple locks held everything in place and ensured it could n't be removed .
It was possible to unlock the crotch strap separately and so gain access to her twat .
At cunt level the crotch strap had a small metal plate that allowed for various attachments .
At the moment it was being used to hold a vibrating dildo deep in her twat .
I smiled , I hoped she liked it because something , organic or otherwise , would fill her cunt every second of her time here .
It was yet another of Doc 's training aids .
He says it educates the slave that her natural condition is to have a cock inside her .
He claims that after processing his slaves no longer feel comfortable without something in there .
Beth 's arms were covered in a pair of black latex opera gloves that reached up to just above her elbows .
Doc likes gloves and his conditioning technique ensures that even after they leave the girls continue to wear them even though today they appear a little anachronistic .
Doc says it helps reduce the chance of a stray fingerprint being found .
Two leather cuffs on Beth 's wrists were fastened to the belt locking her arms by her sides .
A further clincher by her elbows had the very desirable side effect of thrusting her wonderful breasts outwards .
Like the other slaves she was naked above the waist allowing easy access to h er charms .
By now she had struggled to her feet and stood looking at me with such hatred in her young eyes .
Bound as she was there was nothing she could * DO * about it but I was still glad that the metal collar around her neck kept her chained to the wall near her bunk .
She tried to say something , but one of Doc 's leather pad gags had been fastened over her mouth .
On Beth the thing seemed huge extending from her chin to her cheeks .
In fact a little dimple had been cut into it for her nose .
Like the belt it had a removable section at the front that allowed for the fitting of various attachments .
Something was stuffed into her mouth at the moment and I knew immediately that it was a penis gag , to get her used to the feeling of a cock in that pretty young mouth .
I turned to find Kitten waiting .
" Shall we begin ? " she asked looking at me amused .
" These are questions about your requirements .
Usually these are passed from the customer by our agent but as you 're here . "
" Oh , err yes , " I said , aware of my huge hardon .
" Slave 's name ? "
She asked , " We have her here as Beth .
Do you want to change it ? "
It was usual for a master to give his slave a new name .
It was as much for security as anything .
In all the years of Doc 's operation not a single slave had been recognized by someone who knew her in her former life .
Most of this is to be expected , slaves are rarely placed near to where they were recruited , but the numbers involved mean that logically there must have been some near misses .
I mean , if you went into a skin joint and the dancer looked like that pretty chick you sat behind in high school you may start wondering .
Of course chances are you 'd probably think it 's a coincidence , that they only look similar , still if she had the same name you may get curious ....
" I have n't decided yet , " I said .
Then suddenly I knew .
" Jane , " I said , " Her name is Jane . "
" Slave Jane , " Kitten repeated making a note on the clipboard .
" Right .
Now color .
She 's blonde at the moment .
You want her brunette or redhead ? ? "
" No . " " Did n't think so , " She said , " But we still have to ask .
Now breasts , we can enlarge them if you want but Doc asked me to remind you that his offer only covers our costs .
Cosmetic surgery and doctors fees are extra . "
I snorted , " After he gets Maria and that valuable baby for free ? "
" That 's a management decision , " Kitten said , " You 'll have to take it up with Doc . " I reached forward to feel Beth 's tits .
She squealed into the gag and started to back up .
Quick as a flash a crop appeared in Kitten 's hand and she brought it down hard on one of Beth 's exposed nipples .
The squeal became a full fledged scream though the gag reduced it to almost nothing .
" Hold still , " Kitten hissed , " This man is you new owner .
He has every right to inspect his property .
Now stand up straight legs apart .
Move again and I 'll be forced to discipline you . "
Beth stood as directed sobbing piteously .
She stiffened but did n't resist as I gently caressed her naked breasts .
I felt a slight tremble as my hand lingered and her nipples started to harden .
Just like her mother I thought , far too sensitive for her own good .
" I think these are fine , " I said , " I 'm not sure about the nose though . "
The only real difference between Beth and her mother at this age was the shape of the nose .
Jane 's had been strong and straight Beth 's was more of a button affair .
I wondered if it was even possible to have your nose enlarged .
Kitten shook her head , " I 'm afraid she 's still a little young for that .
Plastic surgery while the features of the face are n't fully mature is a little risky .
Perhaps in a year ? " I nodded .
Kitten reached down and unlocked Beth 's crotch belt .
She pulled the dildo free raising a groan from her helpless captive .
" Damp one , " She commented .
" As you can see we 've shaved her to our usual pattern with a small tuft of hair for decoration .
Is this acceptable or do you want more or less ?
It 's usual practice to permanently denude all the shaved area for easy maintenance . "
" All of it , " I said , " Completely , permainently clean . "
This raised a stifled noise from Beth .
She was of an age when she could still remember it naked , were she considered pubic hair as some mystical mark of her womanhood .
I reached down and ran my hand over her smooth pubis .
I felt her stiffen but with hands strapped by her side and mouth gagged she was helpless to stop me .
I stroked it gently feeling the faint tremors as her hips shook .
In nine months using electrolysis and hot wax this area would be permainently clear .
I looked into her eyes and saw her silent plea , if I removed it she would be marked as a slut forever .
Every doctor , every lover would know immediately .
" Yes , " I said , " Loose it all . "
Kittens gloved hand stroked Beth 's belly .
" Of course we will put her on a vigorous workout regime to get rid of the last of this puppy fat . "
That raised a muffled protest which Kitten chose to ignore .
" Final extra's .
We have started heel training , is that acceptable ? " I nodded .
" Figure training , piercing , tattoos , special training ? "
" No figure training , " I said , " Silver rings in both nipples , navel , clit hood . "
Beth stiffened .
" I 'd have to see the patterns for the tattoos .
I want the works on the training , both male and female , dancing , oral , etiquette , housekeeping , child care ... "
Kitten scribbled furiously .
" We have nine months , " She said , " Why not sign her up for everything , it saves writing . "
" Ok , " I said , " May as well get Doc 's money 's worth .
Besides it improves her resale value . "
Nothing comes close to describing the look on Beth 's face , the horror , the shock .
To be talked of in the same way that someone might discuss the options on a new car .
To have other people decide how your body will look for the rest of your life .
I think she especially hated the idea of the rings , her body activity , the wiggling and tugging of bonds had increased markedly since that discussion .
Kitten handed me the clipboard .
" Sign , " She said .
I took the clipboard , " I want to talk to her . " " Now ? " Kitten asked .
" Now . " I said and picked up the pen .
As I signed Kitten was reaching behind Beth 's head to remove the gag .
Now would come the moment of truth .
I 'd been a recruiter long enough to know that this was when you found out what you 'd got .
Almost by definition Doc 's recruits were city girls .
His " six week specials " we recruited from the urban poor , most of his " recondition women " worked in business or came from good families .
As Doc 's orders on local hunting meant that we hardly ever operated even in Boston , New York was actually our nearest major hunting ground .
The trip to Doc 's at a nice legal fifty involved at least one layover and at some stage the gag had to come out so that they could drink .
How they reacted told you a lot about how they 'd take training .
The dumb ones start screaming and carrying on , call you names , scream for help etc .
A few quick slaps are usually needed to bring them back in line long enough to feed and water them .
The smart ones say nothing .
They knew that you would n't be doing this anywhere they had a chance of rescue , they do nothing to provoke you , nothing that would risk you killing them .
The real smart ones talk quietly to you hoping to get you on their side , I usually gag them again as soon as possible .
Beth 's gag popped out and she almost immediately started swearing .
" Let me go you bitch , " she demanded .
Kitten 's eyes rolled , St. Mary 's girls seemed somewhat predictable .
Beth turned to me , " Fucking ass hole !
Should have realized you were a prick . "
Kitten smiled .
" We could cut her vocal cords ? "
She offered , " It 's not part of the usual service but it is effective . "
Beth stiffened , her reaction had been one hundred percent predictable , exactly what a St. Mary 's girl spoilt and born to privilege would be expected to do .
Now finally she realized her danger .
" Please let me go , mister .
I wo n't tell anyone .
Promise ! " I tried to look thoughtful , " What about Maria .
My friend wants her baby so badly . "
" You can have it , " Beth offered , " I 'm sure if you let us go she 'll give it to you . "
" But that mean 's we 'll have to wait nine months . "
She looked hopeful , " Let me go now and release Maria later .
I can help you .
I can tell people she 's changed her mind , run away .... "
I was overwhelmed by her loyalty , just like her mother she used people up and spat them out .
I decided it was time to tell her the truth .
" Your mother 's maiden name was Walters was n't it . "
" Yes , but ... " " Jane Walters ... "
Only then did she realize the significance , understood why she was here .
" Oh god ... "
" That 's right slut , the woman I told you about the one who jilted me , was your mother .
You know I really used to like the idea of making your mother my slave , of bringing her up here and having Doc break her for me .
Last night I realized something , I realized that all I wanted from your mother could be done in three days .
I could pluck her off the street take her to a cabin in the woods somewhere and take everything I wanted in three days .
Then I could just bury her up there .
You see it would n't be worth making her a slave .
She 's what , thirty seven now ?
Loose pussy , sagging tits , why waste my time with her .
The girl I really want is your mother as she was twenty years ago , young pussy in her prime .
What do you have to say for yourself * Jane * ? "
" But I 'm ... "
She began .
I nodded to Kitten and the crop struck nipple once again .
This time she did scream and immediately t
How quickly greenhouse - gas emissions need to be reduced in order to avoid what has been termed dangerous climate change is of fundamental importance .
Two papers in this issue tackle the question from different standpoints , yet come to broadly similar conclusions .
Meinshausen et al. relate the cumulative emission of greenhouse gasses by 2050 to the probability of exceeding the 2 °C of global warming above pre-industrial temperatures adopted by more than 100 countries as the threshold of dangerous climate change .
They find that only about a third of economically recoverable oil , gas and coal reserves can be burned if global warming of 2 °C is to be avoided by 2100 , an amount of fossil fuel that would be burned by 2029 if consumption remains at today 's levels .
Allen et al .
use a combined climate and carbon cycle model to produce simulations spanning a range of climate futures consistent with the changes already observed .
The 500 billionth tonne of anthropogenic carbon since 1750 was recently released into the atmosphere , and Allen et al. find that releasing a trillion tonnes of carbon in total is likely to cause a peak warming exceeding the ' acceptable ' 2 °C temperature increase .
Every tonne released thereafter increases the committed maximum warming in a predictable way , regardless of when it is released .
Any effective climate mitigation regime must therefore achieve a cap on cumulative carbon dioxide emissions — one trillion tonnes would be a possible though optimistic target .
In News and Views , Gavin Schmidt and David Archer consider these papers and other recent work focusing on establishing achievable emissions targets .

A&W is the oldest fast food restaurant chain .
Founded in 1919 , A&W started off as a root beer stand .
After the tremendous success of the first root beer stand by Roy W. Allen , he partnered with his former employee Frank Wright to expand their root beer stand business and named their business A&W , using the first letter of their last names .
They started to sell A&W franchises in 1925 , and expanded their menu to include more food items you see in their menu today .
Some may argue that White Castle , founded in 1921 , is the oldest fast food restaurant chain , since A&W started off as a root beer stand .
To this date , this is still a debatable topic .

The Three Wise Monkeys have names .
The set of trio monkeys , or more commonly known as “ See - no - evil , Hear - no - evil , Speak - no - evil ” monkeys , are called 🙈 Mizaru , 🙉 Kikazaru and 🙊 Iwazaru respectively .
In the Buddhism tradition , this proverb teaches us not to dwell on evil thoughts .
Earth has experienced 5 mass extinctions .
The first mass extinction happened as early as 444 million years ago , called the Ordovician - Silurian extinction .
The subsequent mass extinctions are Late Devonian extinction , Permian - Triassic extinction , Triassic - Jurassic extinction , and Cretaceous - Paleogene extinction .
Now , are we in the sixth mass extinction ?
Solitaire was introduced to Microsoft by an intern .
Wes Cherry developed the game while he was interning in Microsoft .
Ever since , this game was pre-installed in all Windows PC , starting from Windows 3.0 .
Oh , how we missed the time sitting in front of our computers , spending hours playing Solitaire , while changing the card backs of our decks .

Moon trees originated from seeds which travelled to the Moon and back .
In 1971 , Stuart Roosa brought hundreds of seeds with him for his exploration to space on Apollo 14 .
The seeds were taken into orbit around the Moon , but they did not land .
They spent 9 days in space before returning to Earth .
These seeds were left to care by the U.S. Forest Service until they sprouted and were given out to be planted as soon as possible .
Unfortunately , not all the moon trees have survived .

Some special editions of Monopoly include Lord of the Rings , Game of Thrones , Frozen , and Naruto .
Alberto Gonzales , pilloried for allegedly misleading Congress about the Bush administration ’s warrantless eavesdropping program , has been exonerated — sort of .
According to public records and interviews with federal law - enforcement officials , the Justice Department has concluded that there ’s insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against the former attorney general .
His critics might groan , but they have some solace :
The Justice Department ’s inspector general , who conducted the investigation , concluded that his testimony before Congress about the eavesdropping program was “ confusing , ” “ incomplete , ” and had the “ effect of misleading ” both Congress and the public .
Surely Jon Stewart can do something with that .
Gonzales also remains under investigation by the Justice Department for matters connected to the wiretaps and the firings , thought to be politically motivated , of nine U.S. attorneys — scandal aplenty .
But it ’s been allegations about his eavesdropping testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee that put him in the greatest legal jeopardy by far .
A major reason he escaped criminal charges , according to people close to the investigation , was that he finally admitted what he never would have before , when he seemed the most loyal of George W. Bush ’s servants : that many of his most controversial decisions ( first as White House counsel , and later , as attorney general ) in authorizing , overseeing , and concealing the eavesdropping program were done at the specific direction of the former president .
In other instances , Gonzales and his attorneys argued that his actions were done in furtherance of the Bush administration ’s policies — meaning , for what it ’s worth , that he did not act with personal intent to do wrong .
“ He was willing to be a lightning rod in the past for the president , ” said one legal source close to the investigation .
“ He has done that during the entire course of his career .
But it was pressed upon him that that was not going to work in this instance — and he did what he had to do . ”
Ironically , in finally talking to investigators about the president , Gonzales might actually have been protecting his old boss , as well as himself .
A senior Bush - administration official familiar with the matter told me that Fred Fielding , the White House counsel in the closing days of the Bush presidency , feared that the Justice Department ’s probe of Gonzales ’s misleading testimony might morph into a special prosecutor ’s investigation not only of Gonzales , but also of the conduct of others in the Bush White House — including perhaps Bush himself .
( The Justice Department can refer an investigation to the attorney general for a criminal or special prosecutor to take over . )
Fielding quietly counseled Gonzales ’s cooperation , and Gonzales ’s legal team , headed by George J. Terwilliger III , a deputy attorney general during the presidency of the first President Bush , made an early decision to fully cooperate with the inspector general .
Fielding declined to comment for this article .
But a former Bush - administration official who worked closely with him said Fielding called the possibility of a special prosecutor investigating the eavesdropping program “ the nightmare scenario . ”
Gonzalez has pulled this feint before :
One factor in his decision to resign in August 2007 , senior Justice Department officials speculated at the time , was to avoid the appointment of a special prosecutor .
Bush ’s “ nightmare scenario ” apparently averted , Gonzales remains under investigation by the Justice Department he once led for two matters : the firings of those nine U. S. attorneys , and — this should sound familiar — whether Gonzales and other government attorneys acted properly in authorizing and overseeing the eavesdropping program .
( The latter case is being brought by the Justice Department ’s Office of Professional Responsibility . )
Little could be learned about those investigations , but it has long been widely believed that Gonzales ’s most serious legal charges were the ones he now seems to have dodged .
Give the guy credit — he ’s a lawyer , after all .

Adult obesity rates in the US have doubled since 1980 from 15 to 30 %
How would you feel if you had studied for your university degree but were unable to graduate because you were overweight ?
This is what some students are facing at Lincoln University in the US which has introduced a unique way of tackling obesity .
In 2006 , the university in Pennsylvania introduced its Fitness for Life programme with the aim of encouraging students to lose weight .
The premise was that if a student had a body mass index ( BMI ) - a ratio of weight to height - of above 30 , then they should take some college - sanctioned steps to show they had lost weight or at least tried .
The course includes walking , Pilates , exercises and fitness games .
But this year , some students have not completed the course , so they may not be able to graduate .
Professor James L DeBoy , head of the Health , Physical Education and Recreation department at Lincoln University , who proposed the programme , says that around 30 students are unlikely to pass .
" Around 15 % of the student population each fall has failed to earn a BMI of less than 30 , " he told the BBC World Service .
So we anticipate two dozen not being able to complete the course . "
' It is ridiculous ' Sharifa Riley , a journalism student at Lincoln University who has been reporting on the uproar amongst students , says that losing weight should not be part of the curriculum .
" The BMI requirement is ridiculous , " she told the BBC's Newshour programme .
" I am fully aware that obesity is becoming a problem , especially among people our age .
Lincoln University is the first known university to introduce such a measure
But students come to colleges to get an education ... and for me to work for four years to get to the end of my course , and for somebody then to tell me that I cannot graduate because of something to do with my weight , I feel that has nothing to do with university .
" It should not be a requirement .
It should be an option . "
But Professor DeBoy says that drastic times call for drastic measures .
" We are in the midst of an obesity epidemic in the United States and we know that obesity is associated with certain co-morbidities such as heart disease , diabetes , strokes , selected cancers and muscular skeletal disorders , " he says .
A growing problem Obesity rates in the US are rising .
At a conference on obesity control in the US in August , Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said that two out of three adults and one out of five children in the US are now obese or overweight .
And according to a study carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the US medical system spends around $ 150bn ( £ 90 bn ) on treating preventable health conditions caused by obesity - which is twice the amount it spends on fighting cancer .
Professor DeBoy believes that universities now have a responsibility to address this .
" We as an education faculty believe that it is our professional responsibility to be honest with students , " he told the BBC's Newshour programme .
" We need to let them know where there might be an impending issue that could put them on a collision course with these health issues down the road .
" And we are responsible for their total well - being , not just the academic , but the emotional and psychological state of our students . "
While the US government has set a target of cutting adult obesity rates in all 50 states to 15 % by next year , a recent report from the Trust for America 's Health has said this target is certain to be missed .

The Republican Party and their GOP operatives have decided that the truth about health care will not be discussed but to continue on a path of lies , deceit , and scare the shit out of the elderly .
To some extent it is working , but the game of voting has not begun in congress and people who want health care reform , across the spectrum are letting their voices be heard .
It is Republicans , like Mike Huckabee , who do n't care about the truth , but about continuing to muddy up the waters , continue misinformation and just attempt to scare the public to death about health care reform .
Remember , these are people who have SIDED with the insurance companies for no change .
Again , if the insurance companies were on the up and up with the American public , we would not even be talking about this .
The 2008 Republican presidential candidate suggested during his radio show , " The Huckabee Report , " on Thursday that , under President Obama 's health care plan , Kennedy would have been told to " go home to take pain pills and die " during his last year of life .
" [ I ]t was President Obama himself who suggested that seniors who do n't have as long to live might want to consider just taking a pain pill instead of getting an expensive operation to cure them , " said Huckabee .
" Yet when Sen .
Kennedy was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer at 77 , did he give up on life and go home to take pain pills and die ?
Of course not .
He freely did what most of us would do .
He choose an expensive operation and painful follow up treatments .
He saw his work as vitally important and so he fought for every minute he could stay on this earth doing it .
He would be a very fortunate man if his heroic last few months were what future generations remember him most for . "

In case we did n't get it the first time last week , Joe Lieberman went on Fox News Sunday and spat in Harry Reid 's face again .
So how 's that promise from Joe Lieberman working out for you , Harry ?
We can trust Joe Lieberman , huh ?
Yeah right .
Transcript from Think Progress :
LIEBERMAN : A public option plan is unnecessary .
It has been put forward , I ’m convinced , by people who really want the government to take over all of health insurance .
They ’ve got a right to do that ; I think that would be wrong .
But worse than that , we have a problem even greater than the health insurance problems , and that is a debt — $ 12 trillion today , projected to be $ 21 trillion in 10 years .
WALLACE : So at this point , I take it , you ’re a “ no ” vote in the Senate ?
LIEBERMAN :
If the public option plan is in there , as a matter of conscience , I will not allow this bill to come to a final vote because I believe debt can break America and send us into a recession that ’s worse than the one we ’re fighting our way out of today .
I do n’t want to do that to our children and grandchildren .
The first data was sent over the net just over 40 years ago
Progress towards making the net more multi-lingual is welcome says Bill Thompson .
It is 40 years to the week since the first data packets were sent over the Arpanet .
That was the research network commissioned by the US Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( Arpa ) to see whether computer - to - computer communications could be made faster , more reliable and more robust by using the novel technique of packet switching instead of the more conventional circuit switched networks of the day .
Instead of connecting computers rather as telephone exchanges work , using switches to set up an electric circuit over which data could be sent , packet switching breaks a message into chunks and sends each chunk - or packet - separately , reassembling them at the receiving end .
Late on October 29 1969 Charley Kline sat down at a computer in the computer laboratory at UCLA , where he was a student , and established a link to a system at the nearby Stanford Research Institute , sending the first data packets over the nascent Arpanet .
This will finally allow users of these domains to have a domain name that is entirely in characters based on their native language , and marks an important point in the internationalisation of the whole internet .
Bill Thompson
Later in the year permanent links were made between four sites in the US , and over the following years the ARPANET grew into a worldwide research network .
Arpanet was one of the computer networks that coalesced into today 's internet , and the influence of the standards and protocols established there can still be seen today , making this anniversary as important for historians of the network society as July 's celebration of the 1969 Apollo 11 landing is for those who study space science .
Technology does not stand still , and over the years the way computers communicate with each other has changed enormously .
Early Arpanet computers used the Network Control Protocol to talk to each other , but in 1983 this was replaced with the more powerful and flexible TCP / IP - the transmission control protocol and internet protocol .
Today we are in the process of migrating our networks from IP version 4 to IP version 6 , which allows for more devices to be connected to the network and is more secure and robust , but work continues to improve and refine all aspects of the network architecture .
One area that is changing is the domain name system , DNS .
This links the unique number that identifies every device on the internet with one or more names , making it possible to type in " www.bbc.co.uk " and go to the right web server without having to remember its number .
Designed by engineer Paul Mockapetris in 1983 , DNS is a vital component of the network as well as the web , including e-mail and instant messaging .
Every time a programme uses a name for a computer instead of a number , DNS is involved .
However DNS , like so much of the network 's architecture , was developed by English - speaking westerners , and its original design only allowed standard ASCII characters to be used in names .
ASCII , the American Standard Code for Information Interchange , is a way of representing letters , numbers and punctuation in the binary code used by computers , and was originally based on old telegraphic codes .
It works really well for English , but had to be extended and updated to cope with other alphabets , and has now been replaced by the much more powerful and capable Unicode standard , able to represent non-Latin languages as well as those based on the Latin alphabet .
Being able to write in your own language is one thing , but it's also important to be able to have e-mail or website addresses that use it .
Unfortunately the way DNS was rolled out means that key applications would not work with anything other than ASCII , making it impossible to simply add in Chinese or Arabic characters to domain names .
China already has the biggest net using population
As someone has pointed out to me that DNS itself is happy with any character set - it 's the way e-mail and web browsers work that 's the real problem .
Work has been going on since the mid 90's to change this and provide what are called " internationalized domain names " , and many organisations are now able to have websites and e-mail addresses that include Chinese , Cyrillic , Hebrew , Arabic and many other alphabets .
The process took a significant step forward this week when Icann , the international body that looks after domain names , fast - tracked a proposal to provide internationalised versions of two letter country domains , such as .uk and .jp .
This will finally allow users of these domains to have a domain name that is entirely in characters based on their native language , and marks an important point in the internationalisation of the whole internet .
It has taken a long time to make this happen , but the problems of re-engineering such a key part of the network infrastructure without breaking anything are enormous , and anyone who reads through the technical documentation will see just how complex the process has been .
And it was definitely necessary to do it properly - the fuss over the recent retuning of Freeview boxes in the UK was bad enough , but trying to persuade a billion internet users to update their software to support a new form of DNS would have been impossible .
Over the next five years the majority of new internet users will come from the non English - speaking world .
It 's good to see that those of us who have helped build the network so far are making it more welcoming for them .

La liquidación de la empresa Luz y Fuerza , que controlaba de manera omnipotente la distribución , comercialización de la energía eléctrica en cinco entidades del centro de México y daba servicio a casi el 40 % de la población nacional , ventiló la manera como un sindicato , en este caso el Mexicano de Electricistas , abusaba de sus agremiados , de los usuarios y de quien se les pusiera enfrente .
Si había historias de terror sobre aquellos que en un año no pudieron lograr que le conectaran el servicio , o a los que les pedían dinero para atenderlos o acelerar sus solicitudes de conexión o mantenimiento , las revelaciones de los últimos días sobre la forma como los líderes hacían uso de los dineros sindicales , contribuyeron para que la decisión del gobierno contara con la aprobación de la mayoría de los ciudadanos , que no siente pena , en tiempos de crisis , porque 40.000 trabajadores se fueran , en una noche , a la calle .
Los excesos de sus líderes fueron grotescos .
Un rancho con finos caballos y autos de lujo , propiedad de su dirigente .
Miembros del comité ejecutivo nacional pagando notas de comida de 2.000 dólares .
Privilegios por contrato , como pagas adicionales por presentarse a trabajar , o por llegar temprano .
Sistema de ascenso basado en antigüedad y no en productividad .
Venta de plazas de nivel medio por el equivalente a 30.000 dólares .
Toda una pesadilla .
La sociedad se escandalizó , no sin razones , y convirtió al Sindicato Mexicano de Electricistas en el villano de moda .
Muy pocos cuestionaron que si este sindicato pudo acumular tanto , se debió a que la administración de la empresa pública lo permitió .
Y la administración lo hizo porque si lo enfrentaba , temía , se podría quedar sin luz más de una tercera parte del país .
Visto está , no fue así .
El Sindicato Mexicano de Electricistas tenía el monopolio eléctrico en toda una amplia región del país .
Al desaparecer la compañía de Luz y Fuerza , se evaporará el sindicato , que tenía en esa empresa su única fuente de trabajo .
Será absorbida por la Comisión Federal de Electricidad , otra empresa gubernamental , con lo cual el duopolio eléctrico pasará a ser un monopolio .
Esta es una palabra muy utilizada en México para describir a los verdaderos dueños de México , los que controlan el consumo y la vida de los mexicanos , los que impiden la competencia justa , los que reducen la competitividad y frenan el desarrollo .
Son los que en buena manera han logrado que un país que tiene tanto potencial , se quede en el arrancadero del desarrollo , observando cómo lo rebasan cada año .
Afirma el Foro Económico
Mundial en su último informe sobre competitividad que abarca el análisis de 132 países , que México está en el lugar 60 , abajo de Chile , Puerto Rico , Costa Rica , Brasil y Panamá , entre las naciones latinoamericanas .
Pero está en el lugar 101 en ineficiencia de instituciones públicas , en el 115 en cuanto a rigidez laboral , y en el 74 por la mala educación superior , incapaz de proveer mano de obra de calidad al mercado de trabajo .
Este es el verdadero paisaje nacional , el de los grupos de poder , públicos y privados , que marcan la hora mexicana y manipulan el destino .
Los monopolios son una pesadumbre que no se siente cotidianamente , pese a que se les denuncia frecuentemente .
La educación primaria por ejemplo .
El Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación es utilizado como grupo de presión política y como divisa de cambio en tiempos electorales , pero la educación primaria en México , bajo todos los estándares internacionales , está reprobada .
Maestros pobres , líderes ricos , con su dirigente perpetua con residencias en Estados Unidos y aviones privados , ropa de Louis Vuitton y zapatos Prada .
El sindicato petrolero tiene en jaque a Pemex , una empresa petrolera que aún en los tiempos en que México tenía una de las reservas probadas más grandes del mundo , perdía dinero .
País pobre y líderes ricos , con autos de lujos , relojes Audemars Piguet de oro de 18 kilates y casas en Vail .
Pero ya lo dijo el presidente Felipe Calderón : la acción contra Luz y Fuerza y el sindicato no tendrá réplica en ninguno otro más .
Tranquilos y a seguir trabajando .
Los dueños de México no tienen problemas con el Estado salvo ocasionalmente .
El presidente Calderón dijo , incluso antes de tomar posesión , que el desmantelamiento de los monopolios sería parte de su cruzada para modernizar el país y detonar el desarrollo .
No ha podido ni ha querido .
El crecimiento de México está por debajo no sólo de la media mundial , sino se encuentra en los sótanos entre sus pares en América Latina .
El principio del despegue de la crisis tomó al gobierno mexicano en el cabús del ferrocarril del desarrollo , sin muchas posibilidades de ir avanzando en los vagones , menos aún para colocarse en la punta de la locomotora .
Los grandes grupos de interés lo tienen dominado y frenado .
México es el país de los monopolios .
El magnate Carlos Slim es el arquetipo , con su dominancia en el sector de las telecomunicaciones .
Tiene bajo su control al 80 % de la telefonía fija y mantiene bajo su férula más del 70 % de la telefonía móvil .
Las tarifas , casi parece pleonasmo señalarlo , se encuentran entre las más altas del mundo .
El grupo que encabeza ha estado dando una batalla para impedir que el conglomerado de comunicación , Televisa , pueda entrar al mercado de la telefonía fija .
Hay mucho temor , pues con el dominio del 70 % de las pantallas de televisión en México , la propiedad del sistema de cable más grande del país y del sistema de televisión por satélite dominante , la comercialización en paquete sí representarían un desafío empresarial para Slim .
Pero al mismo tiempo , Televisa presiona para que el gobierno no le autorice a Slim un canal de televisión , quien ya tiene 36 canales en operación , semiclandestinos en Internet , en espera de la señal pública .
Es la lucha de colosos en un bosque donde hay muy pocos gigantes .
Un solo grupo , Cemex , controla el 90 % de la producción y el mercado de cemento .
Otro más , Peñoles , domina el 100 % de la producción y el mercado de la plata .
Cervecería Modelo , que vende 10 marcas de cervezas - entre las que se encuentra Corona - , domina el 65 % del mercado , dejando el 35 % a Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma , que es filial del conglomerado Femsa , que además de las cervezas , domina el 60 % de las refresqueras ( soft drinks ) .
Bimbo domina el mercado del pan , y Gruma el de maíz .
En cada uno de esos rubros , el precio al consumidor es más alto , en función a su poder de compra , que en muchas partes del mundo .
Todos los organismos internacionales han venido señalando desde hace tres años la necesidad de que el gobierno se decida romper los monopolios .
Desde entonces , el gobierno del presidente Calderón ha dicho que así será , pero no lo es .
Hay una retórica muy fuerte en esa dirección , pero la voluntad política es sumamente débil .
Hay una leve esperanza de que en el tiempo que le queda a Calderón al frente del gobierno - menos de tres años- , se decida a abrir la competencia por la vía del ataque a los monopolios .
Se ve difícil .
Cada mes que pase , se irá debilitando .
Reformas importantes y cambios de política de largo plazo , dicen los clásicos , se hacen en el inicio del gobierno , no al final .
Pero acaba de liquidar a Luz y Fuerza y se enfrentó a un sindicato con la fama de ser el más combativo de todos los sindicatos mexicanos .
Hasta ahora las cosas , en términos políticos y para incrementar su popularidad , le están funcionando de acuerdo con sus deseos .
Pero Calderón no es de los que engañe con la verdad .
Lo más probable es que su lucha antimonopólica , pese al éxito , se la herede al próximo gobierno .
In light of a weakening Case Shiller housing index , fears rise that Home Prices May Be Nearing a New Dip .
Two price indexes released Tuesday indicated that the momentum the housing market showed over the late spring and summer is faltering , even as the government said the economy grew at a slower pace in the third quarter than previously reported .
The Standard & Poor ’s / Case - Shiller home price index , a closely watched measure of the housing markets in 20 metropolitan areas , barely rose in September , rising 0.3 percent from August on a seasonally adjusted basis .
Prices fell for the month in nine cities in the index , including Boston , New York , Seattle and Charlotte , N.C .
A report from the Federal Housing Financing Agency showed that prices were flat in September from August .
The housing market is confronting an abundance of inventory , high unemployment , fearful consumers and devastated family balance sheets .
“ There is no clear , easy way out for housing , ” said John Silvia , chief economist at Wells Fargo .
“ Contrary to my hopes , housing prices and the housing market in general will weaken again . ”
He forecast a new decline in prices of as much as 10 percent , which he expected to shave a half - point off the nation ’s economic output just as it emerges from the recession .
The Case - Shiller index , which covers about 45 percent of the United States housing market , is a three - month moving average .
Since July and August were relatively strong , the weak September report could indicate a plunge in prices .
The 20 - city composite index is off nearly 10 percent in the last year and 29.1 percent since its 2006 peak .
Pay Option Arm Time Bomb
I ’ve been trying to make the point for some time that the Wells ’ Option ARMs that it inherited in the purchase of Wachovia ( Wachovia came by them via its purchase of World Savings ) are not an immediate threat to the bank .
The terms of the mortgages were more lenient in the amount of negative equity that would cause an automatic recast of payments and the recast feature does not automatically trigger until the ten - year anniversary as opposed to the five - year featured in most other Option ARMs .
Wells Fargo , who holds more Option - ARMs on its books than any other institution , states in their last 10 - Q filing :
Based on assumptions of a flat rate environment , if all eligible customers elect the minimum payment option 100 % of the time and no balances prepay , we would expect the following balance of loans to recast based on reaching the principal cap : $ 4 million in the remaining three quarters of 2009 , $ 9 million in 2010 , $ 11 million in 2011 and $ 32 million in 2012 …
In addition , we would expect the following balance of ARM loans having a payment change based on the contractual terms of the loan to recast : $ 20 million in the remaining three quarters of 2009 , $ 51 million in 2010 , $ 70 million in 2011 and $ 128 million in 2012 .
Given that we ’re talking about a portfolio of over $ 100 BILLION of these loans , this means ESSENTIALLY NO LOANS WILL RECAST due to the negative amortization limits or contractual terms before 2012 .
Both assumptions seemed suspect , yet , they are in fact true .
Looking at page 55 of the Golden West 10 - K from 2005 we read :
… most of our loans are scheduled to have a payment change without respect to any annual limit in order to reamortize the loan over its remaining life at the end of the tenth year or when the loan balance reaches 125 % of the original amount .
We term this reamortization a “ recast . ”
Historically , most loans in our portfolio have paid off before the loan ’s payment is recast .
11 % Decrease Forecast For 2010
The Fiserv Case - Shiller Home Price Index forecasts that average single - family home prices will fall another 11 percent over the next twelve months , with declines expected in about 90 percent of the more than 350 metro areas tracked by Fiserv .
Steep home price declines are expected to continue in markets that have been hurt most by the housing crisis , including metro areas in California , Nevada , Arizona and Florida .
“ Large supplies of foreclosed properties and extremely weak job markets will continue to put downward pressure on home prices , ” said David Stiff , chief economist , Fiserv .
“ Many temporary factors that were partly responsible for strong spring and summer real estate markets , including the first - time homebuyer tax credit and Federal Reserve actions to drive down mortgage interest rates , will no longer be bolstering demand .
Consequently , home prices will resume falling again before they stabilize in 2010 . ”
One - time bubble markets in Florida , California and Arizona , which have already seen home values fall 40 percent to 60 percent since prices peaked in 2006 , are showing no sign of moderation in declining prices .
Cumulative Declines
Extend And Pretend
Twilight and True Blood can just shut the hell up , because this scene from early - 80s New Wave vamp flick The Hunger is the sexiest , coolest , blood - soakingest best vamp moment ever .
This is the opening scene of the film , when we 're first introduced to the stylish , bloody ways of our heroes .
Directed by Tony Scott , who later went on to direct Top Gun ( I know - WTF ? ) ,
The Hunger is based extremely loosely on a Whitley Strieber novel .
Catherine Deneuve plays a hot vampire lady , thousands of years old , whose lover is a delicious - looking David Bowie .
They rampage through the city , eating cute club kids , when ( uh oh ) Bowie suddenly starts aging .
Trying to cure him , Deneuve visits a snacky Susan Sarandon , a scientist who studies the link between sleep and aging .
Unfortunately Bowie is n't curable , but Sarandon is so hot that Deneuve realizes she can at least get a hot new vamp girlfriend out of the deal .
What will happen when Deneuve makes her move on Sarandon ?
What 's going to happen to Bowie ?
I do n't want to give you too many spoilers , but let 's just say there 's some smokin ' hot vampire girl love , and ankhs are unsheathed more than once .

Wondering how rescuing and harvesting works in BioShock 2 ?
Look no further than this video …
Researcher Mohd Abubakr says that his circular periodic table is better than Mendeleev's .
I 'd have given him the Nobel in chemistry — if Obama had n't got it first for mixing himself a whiskey with Red Bull onboard Air Force One .

Abubakr — who works at Microsoft Research in Hyderabad — says that if you arrange the table in circular form it gives you an idea of the size of the atoms .
The closer to the center , the smaller the atom element would be .
That 's why hydrogen and helium — with less atomic weight — are the nearest to its center .
His table also preserves the periods and groups , and manages to look neat and pretty at the same time .
The Physics arXiv Blog at MIT 's Technology Review disagrees .
They said that the table is flawed because it can only be read by rotating it — which does n't make much sense , since you can easily rotate an image on the screen .
Their other criticism is valid , however :
They say that the genius of Mendeleev 's table is that it can " predict the properties of undiscovered elements , " arguing that Abubakr 's table is not as intuitive .

Whatever MIT people , you chemistry dorks you , I just like how it looks .
[ Technology Review ]
Though the Iraq War has long since become an after - thought amid Obama Administration claims that the “ drawdown ” in on track , the Pentagon is reporting today that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has approved a request to send about 1,000 additional troops to Iraq .
The latest report comes less than a week after it was revealed that the Pentagon has added thousands of additional contractors to Iraq , ostensibly to replace US troops during the drawdown .
But of course the drawdown is n’t actually happening .
President Obama inherited a war with roughly 135,000 troops in Iraq , and today there are 131,000 and thousands of contractors .
Officials have previously insisted there will be no meaningful troop level changes until at least 60 days after January ’s parliamentary elections .
Now , over two and a half years after the “ surge ” in Iraq , troop levels are still above pre-surge levels and apparently will be rising in the near term .
Ambassador
Hill may claim the US is sticking to its timetable , but it seems that at some point such a highly touted withdrawal will have to involve the removal of some actual troops .
Yesterday afternoon , I gave a lecture to my first year communications class on George Lakoff ‘s idea that our thinking is fundamentally rooted in metaphor .
Lakoff explains that the underpinnings of how we structure our understanding of the world is metaphorical .
He gives the example of “ Time is money ” – a metaphor that expresses a principle which guides us to use our time parsimoniously .
He also says , in Metaphors We Live By , that “ Argument is war ” is the metaphor that governs how we interact when we debate a point .
Lakoff asks us to think about what the world would be like if we lived by the metaphor that “ Argument is dance . ”
It would certainly change the way we speak about debating and how we behave while debating .
For example , we would no longer say things like : “ I shot down his argument . ” or “ I really clobbered him with that point ! ”
After class , I was walking in the rain back to my cozy mustard yellow corner office in Togo Salmon Hall .
A couple of students , excited by the ideas presented in lecture , were walking with me .
But I was a little distracted .
In fact , I was thinking about how metaphor structures political communication in Canada .
We have seen a marked decline in parliamentary courtesy and civil discourse – both in the House , during Question Period , in the media , and in attack ads .
Why is this so irksome , when we have been watching the same thing evolve below us in the US for decades ?
I think there is an answer that many may have overlooked .
Marshall McLuhan suggested , in Medium is the Message that the United States is a society that was a product of the printing press , like France – a society where the uniform communications permitted by printed media enabled a “ legalistic ” system of government .
One that depended on rules .
Now , Canada comes from a different tradition .
Our Parliament is part of the Westminster system , like the United Kingdom .
The Westminster system was not born during an age of industrial mechanization and laws .
It was born during a feudal time in the midst of an oral culture where relatively few things were written down .
This required a much more consensus - based system of political communication where people built the national narratives through storytelling and tradition .
These national narratives that would later become – through the power of precedent – principles that would guide political function .
This is completely different from the American or French systems , which depend on laws and the interpretation of the judiciary .
On top of this , let us consider John Ralston Saul ’s argument , laid out in his latest book , A Fair Country , that our culture is actually a Métis product – a negotiated hybrid of British , French and First Nations culture .
The British culture was oral and precedent - based , First Nations culture was oral and precedent - based .
And , remember that French Canadian culture was developed in pre-revolutionary France ( which was a feudal society ) – so French Canadian culture was also oral and precedent - based .
This meant that the thrust of our politics has been to encourage negotiation , compromise and continuity .
In these oral , precedent - based cultures , “ Argument is dance . ”
What we are seeing , in the change of tone of our political communication toward warlike aggression , partisanship and spiteful attack , is fundamental change toward a more “ legalistic ” or “ structured ” society .
We might call it Americanized , because it is becoming more and more similar to the American model and they are the greatest cultural influence we face .
The fact is , though , that it represents a fundamental change in our political culture – a shift away from our roots in oral cultural traditions .
An oral cultural tradition which necessitates that “ argument be dance ” because of our mutually shared responsibility for telling the national story and keeping it alive , renewing it with ever more subtlety and nuance – human nuance – which is inherently subjective and flexible .
We are shifting toward a national definition captured in a set of laws that we write down , print out and hammer into shape – and then fight over .
We are seeing the ideas on which our culture is based move away from storytelling , toward objectification and rules .
I think it ’s a sad development .
I love the stories and myths of our past – Paul Bunyan , Louis Cyr , Gitche Manitou .
Canadians chafe at the ideas of laws – they ’re constraining .
So let ’s decide to be civil .
Maybe we can shake hands over it and give one another our word .
At least then we will be true to our historical roots in oral culture .

One of the most fascinating discoveries in the Dublin Archdiocese report was that of the concept of “ mental reservation ” which allows clerics mislead people without believing they are lying .
According to the Commission of Investigation report , “ mental reservation is a concept developed and much discussed over the centuries , which permits a church man knowingly to convey a misleading impression to another person without being guilty of lying ” .
It gives an example .
“ John calls to the parish priest to make a complaint about the behaviour of one of his curates .
The parish priest sees him coming but does not want to see him because he considers John to be a troublemaker .
He sends another of his curates to answer the door .
John asks the curate if the parish priest is in .
The curate replies that he is not . ”
The commission added : “ This is clearly untrue but in the Church ’s view it is not a lie because , when the curate told John that the parish priest was not in , he mentally reserved the words '… to you ’ . ”
Marie Collins , who was abused by a Dublin priest , “ was particularly angered by the use by the Church authorities of ‘ mental reservation ’ in dealing with complaints , ” the report said .
It continued that Cardinal Desmond Connell had explained the concept to the commission as follows :
“ Well , the general teaching about mental reservation is that you are not permitted to tell a lie .
On the other hand , you may be put in a position where you have to answer , and there may be circumstances in which you can use an ambiguous expression realising that the person who you are talking to will accept an untrue version of whatever it may be – permitting that to happen , not willing that it happened , that would be lying .
It really is a matter of trying to deal with extraordinarily difficult matters that may arise in social relations where people may ask questions that you simply cannot answer .
Everybody knows that this kind of thing is liable to happen .
So mental reservation is , in a sense , a way of answering without lying . ”
Example of how they experienced the use of such ‘ mental reservaton ’ by Church authorities in Dublin were supplied to the commission by Mrs Collins and fellow abuse victim Andrew Madden .
In Mrs Collins ’s case , the Dublin archdiocese said in a 1997 press statement that it had co-operated with gardai where her complaint of abuse was concerned .
She was upset by it as she had reason to believe otherwise .
Her support priest Fr James Norman made inquiries and later told gardaí he that when he did so , the archdiocese replied “ we never said we co-operated fully ” - placing emphasis on the word ‘ fully ’ - with gardaí .
In Mr Madden ’s case , Cardinal Connell emphasised he did not lie to the media about the use of diocesan funds for the compensation of clerical child sexual abuse victims .
He explained to Mr Madden he had told journalists “ that diocesan funds ARE ( report ’s emphasis ) not used for such a purpose ; that he had not said that diocesan funds WERE not used for such a purpose .
By using the present tense he had not excluded the possibility that diocesan funds had been used for such purpose in the past .
According to Mr Madden , Cardinal Connell considered that there was an enormous difference between the two . ”
In May 1995 , Cardinal Connell denied that diocesan funds were used in paying compensation to abuse victims .
When it emerged on RTÉ in September that year that Ivan Payne was loaned € 30,000 by the archdiocese to pay compensation to Mr Madden , Cardinal Connell still insisted this was not compensation by the archdiocese .
He threatened to sue RTÉ , but did not do so .

You probably know that getting enough fiber in your diet can keep constipation at bay and it can lower high cholesterol levels , too .
Now Australian researchers have found another reason why the indigestible part of plant - based foods , known as roughage , is good for you -- it plays an important role in keeping your immune system healthy and in preventing specific diseases .
When fiber moves through the digestive tract it remains mostly unchanged , working as a type of internal broom .
Then , in the colon , bacteria interact with roughage .
Fermentation takes place , producing compounds called ( SCFAs ) which are known to help soothe ulcerative colitis , an inflammatory gut condition .
Probiotics and prebiotics , beneficial bacteria found in kefir , yogurt and nutritional supplements , affect the healthy balance of gut bacteria and have been documented to help the symptoms of two other inflammatory diseases , asthma and rheumatoid arthritis .
But what is the connection between fiber , " good " intestinal bacteria and the healing of disorders marked by inflammation ?
In a study just published in the science journal , Sydney - based scientists say they 've found the answer to that question .
They 've discovered a mechanism that explains how a plant - based diet rich in fiber works with beneficial gut bacteria and the immune system to promote health and potentially prevent a host of diseases .
Kendle Maslowski , a PhD student , and Professor Charles Mackay from the Garvan Institute of Medical Research , working in collaboration with the Co-operative Research Center for Asthma and Airways , have demonstrated that a molecule dubbed GPR43 expressed by immune cells and previously shown to bind SCFAs reduces inflammation .
They found that mice lacking the GPR43 gene have increased , unresolved inflammation in their bodies because their immune cells can't bind to and use SCFAs .
So how does this information translate into helping human health ?
Maslowski explained in a statement to the press .
" Changing diets are changing the kinds of gut bacteria we have , as well as their by - products , particularly short - chain fatty acids .
If we have low amounts of dietary fiber , then we 're going to have low levels of short chain fatty acids , which we have demonstrated are very important in the immune systems of mice .
" Professor Mackay pointed out in the press statement that the notion what you eat might have profound effects on immune responses and inflammatory diseases has never been taken seriously enough .
" We believe that changes in diet , associated with western lifestyles , contribute to the increasing incidences of asthma , Type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases .
Now we have a new molecular mechanism that might explain how diet is affecting our immune systems , " he stated .
The scientists conclude that their current research provides compelling reasons to eat a diet rich in unprocessed whole foods such as fresh fruits , vegetables , grains , nuts and seeds .
" The role of nutrition and gut intestinal bacteria in immune responses is an exciting new topic in immunology , and recent findings including our own open up new possibilities to explore causes as well as new treatments for inflammatory diseases such as asthma , " said Professor Mackay .
Kucinich : ‘ Will we stand for the people or the insurance companies ? ’
As evidence mounts that the public option faces an uphill battle in the Senate , its supporters are drawing a line in the sand and saying the Senate should not pass a watered - down health reform bill for the sake of drawing 60 votes .
“ The mere fact that there ’s a bill on the floor is not enough for me to vote for it , ” Sen .
Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) told MSNBC ’s Willie Geist on Wednesday morning .
“ It certainly would n’t match the historical moment to do something that ’s just health care reform in name only .
We need to do something real .
We need to do something to stop the insurance companies ’ dominance over the checkbooks and health care of Americans .
And that means doing something significant . ”

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Monday that the health reform bill he will bring to the Senate floor will include a public option to compete with private health insurers .
But no sooner had the Nevada Democrat made his announcement than reports began to spread that the public option does n’t have enough support in the Senate to overcome a Republican filibuster .
All 60 members of the Democratic caucus would have to vote together to break a filibuster .
The likelihood of that happening was reduced on Tuesday when Sen. Joe Lieberman , an independent who caucuses with the Democrats , announced he would support an expected Republican filibuster of Reid ’s bill .
On Wednesday , supporters of the public option raised the stakes , pressuring the Democratic congressional leadership to stand by plans for an alternative to private health insurers .
House Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) issued a challenge to Democrats to stand up to the health insurance companies working to block reform .
“ This is a moment of truth for the Democratic Party , ” Kucinich said in a statement .
“ Will we stand for the people or the insurance companies ? ”
Said Kucinich : “ We compromised on [ a ] single payer [ health care system ] by backing a public option , and now we are being asked to compromise the public option with negotiated rates .
In conference , we will likely be asked to compromise negotiated rates with a trigger .
In each and every step of the health care debate , the insurance companies have won .
If they get hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxpayer subsidies , they get to raise their premiums , and increase their co-pays and deductibles , while the public is forced to pay for private insurance , then the insurance companies win big .

“ If this is the best we can do , then it is time to ask ourselves whether the two - party system is truly capable of representing the American people or whether the system has been so compromised by special interests that we ca n’t even protect the health of our own people , ” Kucinich stated .
Progressive activists joined the chorus of political pressure as well .
Jane Hamsher , founder of the FireDogLake blog , said Reid will “ pay a price ” with his home - state voters in Nevada if he allows Lieberman to side with the Republicans and block the health care bill .
“ It ’s never happened before that one party had — technically , in the caucus — a filibuster - proof majority and one of the members went to join over with the opposition party , ” Hamsher told MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow .
“ You have to ask yourself , ‘ What were they thinking when they let Joe into the caucus and did n’t get him to agree to join with them on procedural votes ? ' ”

But in his MSNBC interview on Wednesday , Feingold praised Reid for even managing to keep the public option alive in the Senate for as long as it has been .
“ A lot of people thought we would n’t even have a public option being discussed at this point , ” Feingold said .
“ It ’s only because of the courage of our majority leader , who I believe is doing this on principle . ”

Researchers at Queen ’s University Belfast are pioneering a new technique for the use of banana plants in the production of plastic products .
The Polymer Processing Research Centre at Queen ’s is taking part in a € 1 million study known as the Badana project .
The project will develop new procedures to incorporate by - products from banana plantations in the Canary Islands into the production of rotationally moulded plastics .
In addition to the environmental benefits , the project will increase the profitability of the plantation owners and help job security for those working in the area .
Mark Kearns , Rotational Moulding Manager at the Polymer Processing Research Centre in Queen ’s School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering , said : “ Almost 20 per cent of the bananas consumed in Europe are produced in the Canary Islands , with around 10 million banana plants grown annually in Gran Canaria alone .
“ Once the fruit has been harvested , the rest of the banana plant goes to waste .
An estimated 25,000 tonnes of this natural fibre is dumped in ravines around the Canaries every year .
“ The Badana project aims to find a use for these plants .
The natural fibres contained within them may be used in the production of rotationally moulded plastics , which are used to make everyday items such as , oil tanks , wheelie bins , water tanks , traffic cones , plastic dolls and many types of boats .
The banana plant fibres will be processed , treated and added to a mix of plastic material and sandwiched between two thin layers of pure plastic providing excellent structural properties .
The project gives a whole new meaning to ‘ banana sandwich ’ .
“ This new technique will have substantial environmental benefits .
It will hopefully result in a substantial reduction in the amount of Polyethylene used in the rotational moulding process , ushering in a new and more sustainable era in the production of rotationally moulded plastics .
The research and development of this new approach will help create jobs and the banana plantations will ultimately benefit financially from the sale of the remains of millions of harvested banana plants , which would otherwise go to waste . ”
“ It is testament to our expertise in rotational moulding , and strong links with several Spanish Universities , that the Polymer Processing Research Centre has been asked to contribute in this groundbreaking project . ”
The funding for the Badana project has been provided by the European Union ’s Seventh Framework Programme .
Kostenexplosion im Gesundheitswesen Krankes System mit Knalleffekt

Editor 's note :
This is one of a group of individual accounts of racial profiling by Sheriff Joe Arpaio 's forces .
The bleeding kept her up all night , drenching her black - and - white - striped jail uniform .
Alma Chacón feared her baby would arrive early .
Her nightmare had started with a traffic stop a day earlier .
She 'd been weeping since .
" What if the baby is born here , in the jail ? " she thought .
In the afternoon , she was shackled and transported to Maricopa County Medical Center , where she gave birth in a " forensic restraint . "
She could n't hold her baby daughter or kiss her .
She could only watch as hospital personnel carried the infant out the door .
She would n't see the baby for 72 days .
Info Are Your Papers in Order ?
For more stories in the " Are Your Papers in Order " series , visit this " Are Your Papers in Order ? " page .
Her case raises questions about the use of racial profiling by Maricopa County sheriff 's deputies during traffic stops , but , most importantly , sheds light on the mistreatment of unconvicted immigrants inside county jails .
Chacón retells her story inside her trailer home in Queen Creek .
Outside , her children play in the shell of a home under construction .
It 's Chacón 's dream townhome , and she 's been building it a block at a time .
She looks younger than 35 ; her long , black hair rains straight to the small of her back .
The immigrant from Durango , Mexico , has quiet tears .
She came to America when she was 16 on a tourist visa and never looked back .
No one promised it would be easy .
Tamale sales and housecleaning have barely enabled her to feed her children .
The father of the first four of her kids died six years ago in a car accident .
Fear of deportation was always a normal part of Chacón 's life in Queen Creek .
The town , with a population of 23,000 on the outskirts of Maricopa County , has a contract with the Sheriff 's Office for police services .
Like many immigrants , she drives slowly so she does n't attract suspicion .
But that did n't help the afternoon of October 12 , 2008 , when she came head to head with a sheriff 's deputy .
It was a Sunday and she was on her way to cash a check at the grocery store .
Giselle , her 8 - year - old , was along for the ride .
" He looked at me , did a U - turn , and got behind the car , " she said of the sheriff 's deputy .
" There was n't time to check my plates . "
When he came to the driver 's - side window , she handed him her Mexican consular card .
" When are you due ? " the deputy asked in English .
" October 21 , " she answered .
Minutes later , he put her in handcuffs .
There were two warrants for her arrest .
Turns out Chacón owed more than $ 1,000 in fines for driving without a license and had a misdemeanor shoplifting charge .
She said that because she is n't allowed to get a driver 's license because of her undocumented status , she was n't able to earn money to pay the fines .
She had to drive , she said , to work and support her children .
She said even the shoplifting charge came because , after her husband died , she was desperate and stole food to keep her children alive .
" If someone does n't come and pick up your daughter in 30 minutes , I 'll call CPS [ Child Protective Services ] , ' the deputy told her .
A neighbor picked up a sobbing Giselle .
" That 's when the nightmare inside the nightmare began , " she said .
She spent her first night at the Fourth Avenue Jail on a cold cement bench .
The following day she was taken to the Estrella jail .
During her second night behind bars , the bleeding started .
On the morning of October 14 , she felt contractions .
Her hands and feet shackled , she was in labor and ushered into a paramedic 's van by a detention officer who restrained her to the stretcher .
" That 's not necessary , " the paramedic told the officer .
" It 's my job , " the officer responded .
The guard was a Latina .
She thought she would be released from the shackles once she arrived at the hospital , but she was n't .
The officer chained her ankle to one leg of the hospital bed .
A nurse requested that she be freed to get a urine sample .
But the officer suggested instead that her bed be dragged over to the bathroom .
Later she was changed from her jail uniform into a hospital gown .
" The officer chained me by the feet and the hands to the bed , " she said .
" And that 's how my daughter was born . "
Baby Jaqueline was delivered at 9:25 p.m. and weighed 6.28 pounds .
Chacón stared at her daughter as nurses cleaned her .
It was a precious eight minutes , she said .
But they did n't allow her to hold the baby .
When questioned later about the incident , Sheriff Joe Arpaio said , " I was n't the one who kept her from holding the baby .
Ask the hospital . "
Sheriff 's
Office policy states that jail inmates be restrained for " security reasons in an unsecured facility , " said Jack MacIntyre , an MCSO deputy chief .
McIntyre said a 12 - foot chain link was attached to Chacón 's leg .
" Let 's assume someone is faking labor — that 's a hypothetical — and she then chose to escape and hit or assault the hospital staff , " McIntyre said .
" She could do that easily because it's an unsecured area . "
Sentenced , pregnant state prison inmates are treated better than un-sentenced ones in Maricopa County jails .
Arizona Department of Corrections policies state : " A pregnant woman will not be restrained in any manner while in labor , while giving birth , or during the postpartum recovery period . "
Hospital records mentioned that Chacón had a forensic restraint on her ankle .
Doctors turned down a request from New Times to talk about her case , even after Chacón gave consent for the release of her medical files .
Over the following weeks , after she was back in the county lock - up , her breasts swelled and hurt .
Jail guards would n't give her a breast pump .
Nor would they give her enough medication to make the pain stop .
She got one dose of pain medication a day , no matter how extreme her discomfort .
She worried about her four children , who were left alone in the care of her 17 - year - old son , William .
She said the baby 's father , her boyfriend , had left her after he found out she was pregnant .
" I felt so sad to see her children alone , " said Chacón 's mother , Maria Gómez , who arrived from Durango , Mexico , with a visa four days after her daughter was arrested .
Gómez took care of Chacón 's new baby , who had been picked up at the hospital by a family friend .
On October 29 , a judge let her go but told Chacón she'd be on probation for two years , during which time she must pay all her remaining fines .
She waited 14 extra days in jail to be picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
" [ ICE officers ] took me to the Florence Detention Center , where they treated me much better , " she said .
" At least not like an animal . "
There , she refused to sign a document for her voluntary removal from the country .
The story of an immigrant mother 's struggle to care for her children was told repeatedly on Spanish - language radio .
People in her community raised $ 3,000 needed to make the bond set by an immigration judge , and she was released from custody .
Chacón 's hopes are up these days .
After almost 20 years in the country , she may have a strong case to stay with her five children — who are all U.S. - born and therefore American citizens .
Her attorney filed a motion to cancel her deportation , and now she 's hoping to get a work permit .
It 's been a year since the arrest ( baby Jacqueline just turned 1 ) .
" I 'm not afraid to come out with my story , " she said .
" But I 'm disappointed to see that not much has been done to stop [ Joe Arpaio ] . "

This apparent engineering sample was leaked by Vietnamese site , Tinhte.com , and appears fairly legit .
It suggests the Streak has an 800 by 480 touch screen , 5 - megapixel camera with dual LED flash , microSD card storage , and a 1,300 mAh battery .
As you can see in the video , it also looks like there will be a front - facing camera for video calls .

Deploying Django sites using RPM
Why ?
Django is a great framework for developing websites but as with most projects there is n’t a particular focus on the system administration side of running a real site .
There are great instructions describing the source - level changes you ’ll want to make and what you ’ll need to configure your webserver to do but … what about afterwards ?
The process of deploying any site has a few basic steps : update the code , apply any database changes and reload the running site .
How people choose to do this varies wildly but in the Python world it tends to involve a lot of manual work setting up the Python environment and running commands by hand or using a tool such as Fabric or Buildout to run those commands for you .
This approach works but it has a few drawbacks :
If you ’re installing anything which uses a native library ( images , databases , clients for things like memcache , etc. ) you ’ll need install a ton of extra dependencies on your production servers : gcc , development headers , etc .
It ’s extremely slow compared to normal Linux software installation
You ’re exposed to failures in outside services such as PyPI , Sourceforge , Github , Bitbucket , etc .
This can be a problem if you ca n’t download the package and disastrous if the upstream source has updated to a newer version which you have n’t tested
Adding a second server requires you to duplicate everything , which is time consuming , and you then have to apply your changes in lockstep across every server to avoid requests being processed depending on which server handles the request
It ’s hard to tell in advance what you ’ll need to install an application unless you tediously compare the installed dependencies on a known - working server
You can have silent failures which only show up in production - the classic example being the Python Imaging Library , which can install “ successfully ” without optional components like JPEG support if it fails to detect them , which will only show up the first time someone attempts to use a JPEG file with your site .
None of these are new problems - in fact , the BSD and Linux communities have been working on package managers for the last decade or two , which is why you can install a brand new Linux system with hundreds of applications in less time than it takes to bring a large Python website up on a new server .
How
UPDATE : This has turned into a Github project and the latest version of these instructions are on Github pages .
Structuring the application
A well - behaved application is going to do a few things :
Install in a well - defined location not used by other applications - i.e. / opt/ my_app rather than / var / www / html .
rather than / var / www / html .
Provide a clean way to customize your app with server - specific settings ( e.g. file locations , database info , etc. ) which does n’t involve editing the packaged files - otherwise they ’ll be overwritten on the next release .
This also makes it easy to cleanly install the same package on development , test , and production servers .
For Django apps , I ’m using the following conventions :
Everything installs in / opt / my_app - this includes a virtualenv which is pre-loaded with our dependencies , avoiding the possibility of conflicts between projects .
Want to have a Django 1.1 app installed on the same server as an older Django 1.0 app ?
This makes that easy .
- this includes a virtualenv which is pre-loaded with our dependencies , avoiding the possibility of conflicts between projects .
Want to have a Django 1.1 app installed on the same server as an older Django 1.0 app ?
This makes that easy .
Apache configuration is split into a separate common configuration ( e.g. WSGI config , media expiration , etc ) designed to be included by a server - specific file which specifies things like hostnames , SSL config , etc. : < VirtualHost example.org:80 > ServerName example.org ErrorLog logs / my_app .errors.log CustomLog logs / my_app .access.log combined LogLevel info SSLEngine on SSLProtocol all - SSLv2 SSLCipherSuite ALL : !ADH :!EXPORT56 :+HIGH :+SSLv3:+TLSv1 SSLCertificateFile " /etc/httpd/ssl.crt / my_app .crt " SSLCertificateKeyFile " /etc/httpd/ssl.key / my_app .key " Include /opt / my_app /deploy/apache_common.conf </VirtualHost >
Django customization is managed by a local_settings.py file which is imported by settings.py .
try : import local_settings except ImportError : logging .
warning
( " No local settings - running in development mode " )
This is where you put things like database username and password , production email contact addresses , etc .
Building an RPM
Setup your RPM build environment Create your specfile ( see below ) in SPECS / my_site.spec
Create source archives for everything you need to install : this be as simple as downloading a tarfile from the library provider or creating your own from your version control system :
Git archive :
git archive -- format=tar -- prefix= my_app - 1.0 / my_app - 1.0 | gzip - 9 > ~/rpmbuild/ SOURCES/
my_app - 1.0.tar.gz
Subversion :
svn export .
/tmp/my_package
tar -C /tmp - cjf ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/my_app.tar.bz2
Now you ’re ready to compile the actual RPM :
rpmbuild - ba -- clean SPECS/my_site.spec
Install the RPM on your test server
If you want to see what files your RPM will install , use RPM ’s query options : rpm -q -- fileprovide -p RPMS/noarch/my_site.rpm
For future releases the process is simple : update the specfile if you ’ve changed your dependencies ( add , remove , change versions , etc. ) and recompile .
Here ’s an example project containing an RPM specfile and the general recommended site structure .
There are a few key things you will want to customize :
“ Texaco used to pay for the Metropolitan Opera to exist .
Armstrong
Tile used to pay for Jacques Cousteau .

If American Express said that they wanted to take care of Mad Men , not put any ads in it , and say , “ American Express presents Mad Men , ” and even have Don Draper throw the card around once in a while , that incredible purple card , the one Eisenhower had — that is the past of advertising , not the future of advertising .
As a content provider , I look at the networks and say their desire to reach this mass audience to preserve their advertising dollars is half the reason why their content slid .
It ’s insane .
It ’s insane to guess what people want .
It ’s a joke .
If you have no personal opinions , you should not be involved in the content business .
You ’ve got big businesses and they ’ve got lots of money at stake and they have stockholders , and I understand why things move the way they move .
When I look at digital , the dark side of it for me is the physicality that ’s being presented alongside the Internet .
I think about that movie The Matrix , and about these bodies that are human batteries that support computers .
I met this guy who was creating software where you could watch Mad Men and you could chat with your friend while you ’re watching it , and things would pop up , and facts would pop up , and I said , ‘ You ’re a human battery .
Turn the fucking thing off !
You ’re not allowed to watch the show anymore .
You ’re missing the idea of sitting in a dark place and having an experience .

The Naked Truth : Gay Man Strips for George Clooney at Press Conference Man posing as journalist strips for Clooney at film festival press conference .
Sept. 10 , 2009  --
Rock stars are used to have undergarments thrown at them while on stage , but most actors do n't encounter a similar situation while speaking at a professional press conference .
Then again , not all actors are as irresistible as George Clooney .
Clooney has proved that he 's a red hot sex symbol all over the world , for both women and men .
And some of the Irish - American actor 's admirers will go to extremes to show their love for him .
Take the gay Italian man who decided to strip off his clothes and offer himself to Clooney in the middle of a press conference at the Venice Film Festival .
Clooney is in town to promote his new film , " The Men Who Stare at Goats . "
While chatting with the press on Tuesday , one " journalist " in the back of the room stood up to ask a question , but ended up performing strip tease instead .
" I did n't see your movie yet , but I saw you , " the man told his idol .
" I am gay , George . "
Clooney , who seemed completely unfazed by the situation , calmly stated " Here it comes . "
His enthusiastic suitor went on to profess his deep passion for the actor , saying : " I think I 'm in love with you .
George , please take me .
Choose me George , please .
" George may I kiss you please , just one kiss ? "
Now if this were an American press conference , the cops would have been on this guy in a second , but random , crazy declarations of love are a bit more acceptable in Venice – the man 's microphone was taken away , and in just a tie and a pair of tighty whities , he continued to yell to George from the back of the room .
Clooney responded to the unusual situation in his usual charming way .
The actor laughed it off , saying : " It 's hard when you take a big chance and it does n't really work .
It 's always embarrassing . "
A few days ago I announced a quick poll to find out what editor or IDE people are using when writing Perl code .
The poll is now closed .
There were 3,234 answers but as multiple answers were allowed the number of people is lower .
The data of the poll can be found under Perl IDE and Editor Poll , October 2009 on the Perl IDE web site along with the raw CSV files .
It does not allow deep analysis so just a few quick observations .
The traditional Unix editors ( vi / vim / gvim and emacs ) got almost 50 % of the answers .
Taking into account that the number of people who answered is probably considerably lower than the number of answers this means a lot more than 50 % of the responding people use either of those editors .
For example I marked Padre and vim and I know I was not alone with this .
On the other hand I assume - without any proof - that vim and emacs use is much higher in the core Perl community than among people writing Perl in companies without a connection to the community .
As quite likely more " community people " answered the poll than " non-community people " this skews the data in favor of vim / emacs .
I was surprised to see Padre getting 101 votes .
I did not think so many people already use Padre .
Padre got more or less the same number of " votes " as TextMate and Komodo Edit which probably means that for all the other editors only a small fraction of the users voted while for Padre every one of its users voted .
I do n't think that 3 % of the people writing Perl are using Padre .
I do n't think 3 % even heard of it .
Anyway , some more thought is required on how to understand this data .
For the next hour or so , a receptionist watched as Dreier paced the pension fund ’s lobby , obviously waiting for someone .
This is where things got strange .
At one point , a man emerged from the elevators and moved toward the receptionist ’s desk .
Before he could reach it , however , Dreier cut him off .
The man was Howard Steinberg , the Fortress executive who had come to sign the note .
He was to meet with Michael Padfield , the same attorney Dreier had just seen .
Dreier introduced himself as Padfield , handed him Padfield ’s business card , and guided Steinberg into the same conference room where he had been waiting .
Everything appeared to be going smoothly until Steinberg suddenly asked if Dreier knew “ Tom ” ’s extension — apparently the two men were acquainted .
Dreier reluctantly read off the number , at which point Steinberg rose , asked for a moment , and stepped outside .
Dreier realized he was about to call “ Tom , ” who of course knew nothing about the meeting or the note ; if the two men spoke , it was all over .
Dreier watched as Steinberg began dialing a phone in the lobby .
As he did , Dreier yanked up a conference - room phone and , in a bid to somehow prevent the two from speaking , dialed “ Tom ” as well .
“ He called the guy , I called the guy , ” Dreier recalls with a sigh .
“ He beat me to it . ”
He cut off his call , knowing the end was near .
When Steinberg returned to the conference room , Dreier says , “ I could see he was suspicious .
It was the questions he asked me and the look he gave me .
He asked several questions about personnel at Ontario Teachers ’ , which indicated he was suspicious . ”
Sensing the worst , Dreier hurriedly signed the legal papers , then excused himself for a moment .
But instead of returning , he headed for the elevator and left the building .
After a few minutes , Steinberg emerged from the conference room .
“ Was that Michael Padfield ? ” he asked the receptionist .
“ No , ” she said .
Dreier ’s plane was waiting .
He had just boarded when his phone rang .
It was a Fortress executive , informing him there had been “ some kind of problem ” at Ontario Teachers ’ .
The Fortress man , not knowing Dreier was in Canada , much less that he was behind the “ problem , ” explained what little he knew .
Dreier feigned astonishment .
Moments later , his phone rang a second time .
This time it was Peter Briger Jr. , Fortress ’s co-chairman of the board .
“ We do n’t know what ’s going on , ” Briger told Dreier .
“ But we think there ’s some kind of impersonation going on . ”
“ I played dumb , ” says Dreier , “ and said I would look into it . ”
When Dreier concluded the call , his mind raced .
At that point , 9 out of 10 men would have simply fled back to New York .
For some reason , Dreier returned to his limo and had the driver take him back to the pension fund ’s offices .
“ I was 90 percent sure I would be caught when I went back , ” he says .
“ I was not thinking clearly .
I was desperate .
Clearly , there was a part of me that just wanted this to be over .
I knew I was defeated .
I went back knowing I would probably never leave that building [ a free man ] . ”
Once he was back in the Ontario Teachers ’ offices , an attorney asked him to wait in the conference room .
By and by , security guards appeared and told him to wait for the police , who appeared not long after and arrested him .
Dreier went without resistance .
There ’s a Moral to Draw
It was over .
Canadian authorities held Dreier for four days , then put him on a plane back to New York ’s La Guardia Airport , where U.S. marshals took him into custody , just as Dreier suspected they would .
He did n’t bother with denials for long .
He would admit everything : four long years of fraud , 80 or more bogus notes , 13 hedge funds and four private investors , $ 380 million — everything .
His glorious new life , the firm , “ the Dreier Model ” — it had all been built on lies .
Within days , attorneys began resigning from Dreier L.L.P .
At one point , Dreier ’s 19 - year - old son , Spencer , barged into a meeting there and attempted to rally the assembled lawyers to his father ’s defense ; he was hooted out of the room .
Ten days after Dreier ’s New York arrest the firm declared bankruptcy .
By that point almost every attorney had left .
Dreier L.L.P. simply imploded .
In the days after Halloween , everyone is asking everyone , “ what did you do ? ” Regardless of what shenanigans you got yourself into in your sexy nurse / kissing booth costume this year , you might want to mark your calendar to spend next year in the place where class meets crass – the culture - laden party town of Santa Barbara .
This wine - country college town goes off each year on the 31st ( and for a few days before and after ) , but it ’s got more going for it than just partying .
Here are 5 reasons SB kicks butt in the Halloween department – as well as a few others .
5 . The partiers .
Maybe everyone we ran into was just having a good night , but it seems like the relaxed atmosphere in SB makes strangers a little nicer , bartenders a little friendlier , and friends a little easier to come across – especially when they ’re dressed like horny flashers .
( Yeah , we remember you , dude . )
If you ’ve never hung out with a couple of Ninja Turtles and the cast of Sesame Street , or made friends with someone who was dressed as binary code , it ’s not something to pass up .
It also could have been the alcohol .
( But we doubt it . )
4 . The proximity .
If you live in LA ( if you do n’t and you ’re still reading this blog , you are awesome ) , Santa Barbara is only a little farther than you ’d drive to get to Disneyland or Magic Mountain .
It takes less time than it takes to go to the DMV , and the scenery is a bit nicer .
Allow for a buck 30 after you get off work , and you ’re on vacation before it even gets dark .
And yep , the bars will still be open .
3 . The town .
Strangely enough , the world still exists during the day on Halloween weekend , and Santa Barbara still has stuff to do to fill those long hours of daylight while you ’re waiting for the next adventure of inebriated thrift - store Batman .
You can rent bikes at the top of State Street , check out the sidewalk art show on Cabrillo , eat at one of the seafood places on Harbor Way , patrol the shops downtown , or even try out some of the town ’s renowned wine - tasting rooms .
Just make sure the head start you ’re getting from that wine does n’t turn into a brick wall at sundown , pardner .
2 . The collegiate costume innovations .
We ’ll just list the best ones we saw : Keith Richards , Horny flasher ( with moving part ) , Inspector gadget complete with Gadget copter , sexy stewardess with molesting pilot , creepy Alice in Wonderland cast , Tootsie Pop owl , actual Tootsie Roll , binary code , case of Pabst , Charlie Chaplin , dead Disney princesses , Mario and Luigi , Mr. Peanut , Satan on fire , Grover and Elmo , the Ninja Turtles , Aladdin , swine flu and about 400 baby - toting bearded guys from The Hangover .
1. Isla Vista .
Everything listed above is part of the regular , downtown part of Santa Barbara .
We were n’t even in this place ( so it could n’t have been that cool ) , but if Isla Vista , next to the UCSB campus , is known as the Mardi Gras of Halloween , you can imagine what it ’s like .
Partiers travel huge distances and rent out all the hotels in the area just to take part in the craziest holiday known to the college world .
If downtown SB is too tame for you , this place should be right on the mark .
Happy next Halloween .

In the long - running battle between cable television and satellite , the cable TV industry is quietly trying to persuade the Legislature to levy a tax on its competitors .
With just six days left in the legislative session , cable advocates in Sacramento want lawmakers to slap a new 5 % tax on satellite service to match the 5 % franchise fee that cable companies pay to string or bury their wires across public property and into homes .
Cable companies argue that it ’s matter of fairness .
They say it is not right for them to pay a fee , while fast - growing satellite providers -- DirecTV and Dish Network -- do n’t have to pay anything for the right to beam their signals into people ’s homes from space .
Satellite companies disagree , saying such a tax discriminates against their 3.6 million customers in California , especially rural residents living in remote areas not served by cable .
Satellite providers should n’t be penalized with a tax because they use innovative technology and do n’t have to dig up the streets or people ’s backyards , DirecTV says .

Discussion of the proposed satellite TV tax has been mostly hush - hush in Sacramento , with no bill actually being written and no committee hearings held .
But consumers , when told about the proposal , were critical .
Rick Okikawa , a Sacramento lawyer who is shopping for basic digital TV service , said he does n’t think “ it ’s fair to tax someone for the use of satellite ” when it does n’t encroach on public property .
Cable is getting a valuable benefit for its franchise fee , the right to run wires that carry television , Internet and telephone signals , to people ’s homes , he said .
The drive by the cable companies mirrors similar proposals debated in several other states .
So far , it ’s passed in Massachusetts and failed in eight other states , said Larry D. Hunter , the chief executive of El Segundo - based DirecTV .
Some lawmakers say the California effort may have to be put on hold until next year .
Cable ’s tax - the - other - guy proposal is being shopped to legislators with the idea of adding it to a noncontroversial bill , currently focused on Indian gambling , that is close to winning final passage and being sent to the governor .

“ This is a competitive issue for our industry , ” said Carolyn McIntyre , president of the California Cable and Telecommunications Assn .
Forcing satellite companies to pay taxes could pump $ 170 million a year into the coffers of local governments that have been hard hit by the economic recession , she argued .
The satellite advocates are fighting back , aiming to stop a last - minute effort to tax them this year and stake out a defensive position for a likely , more protracted battle next year .
The proposed sales tax is “ a bailout for a cable industry that is losing ground in the marketplace , ” said DirecTV ’s Hunter .
Even some cable customers are n’t buying the cable industry ’s arguments for taxing satellite providers .
“ I think this whole level - playing - field argument is fallacious reasoning , ” said Larry Stanfill of Sacramento .
Satellite companies should n’t be punished for developing a new technology , said Stanfill , a fan of high - definition TV , who has used both cable and satellite systems .

Cable ’s effort to push through a satellite TV tax is known to Capitol insiders as a “ gut and amend . ”
The maneuver allows them to ignore parliamentary rules and deadlines so that a bill can be approved with minimal review by lawmakers , interested parties or the public .
“ Gut - and - amend bills are by definition an attempt to avoid public scrutiny , ” said Richard Holober , director of the Consumer Federation of California .
A decision to move the bill forward is up to Sen. Roderick Wright ( D - Inglewood ) , the chairman of the committee that has jurisdiction over the measure being considered as a vehicle for a possible satellite TV tax .
For now , “ there ’s no movement on this , ” said Fahizah Alim , a spokeswoman for Wright .
“ There ’s just discussion . ”
The cable industry ’s McIntyre concedes that it ’s late in the year to move a tax bill that would have to win approval from two - thirds of both houses of the Legislature and be signed into law by the governor .
In the meantime , she said , her group is looking ahead and “ talking to folks ” about the benefits of treating cable and satellite TV providers equally and the extra revenues that would go to local governments .

If campaign contributions are any indication , the cable companies should n’t have trouble getting a hearing in the statehouse .
Between Jan. 2 , 2008 , and June 30 , the cable association gave $ 340,000 , according to reports filed with the secretary of state .
Three top cable companies -- Comcast Corp. , Time Warner Cable and Cox Cable -- contributed $ 994,500 .
DirecTV reported only $ 741 in that period .
Dish Network , none .
Moving forward on the tax bill , whether this month or next year , is consistent with efforts by the cable business to put new taxes on satellite services , McIntyre said .
The cable companies are putting a new twist on the practice of promoting special - interest bills , said Dan Schnur , director of the USC Unruh Institute of Politics .

“ Normally , you look for tax breaks for your own industry and do n’t worry about the competition , ” he said .
“ But , when the state is dealing with budget deficit , if you ask for a tax break , you ’re being greedy .
“ If you ask for a tax increase on someone else , you ’re thinking about the greater good for the state and its people .
Substantively , there ’s no difference at all , but it sounds a lot better . ”

( This post is about Haskell , but unrelated to CHP . )
A little while ago , Bryan O’Sullivan was developing his Criterion benchmark suite , and had trouble with using the Text .
Printf module in a monad transformer on top of IO .
I thought I knew how to solve this , but my first idea did n’t work — and nor did my second or third .
Eventually I figured out how to do it , and the patches made it into the new Criterion release .
I ’m posting about it here in case anyone else has the same trouble in future .
My solution achieves two things .
It allows the use of ( equivalents to ) printf and hPrintf in the monad ReaderT Config IO , but also allows you to decide whether to print based on that Config item — for example , based on a verbosity level stored in the config .
If you had StateT Config IO , or various other transformers and combinations thereof , this approach should still work .
So , why is this problematic in the first place ?
If you are willing to annotate every use of hPrintf with liftIO , you get the first behaviour already :
liftIO $ printf " String : %s , Int : %d " " hello " 42
However , you ca n’t just define a helper :
my Printf = liftIO .
printf
Because that breaks the magic of printf .
Printf works by letting the return type of printf " some string " vary ; it can either be IO a , if there are no more arguments to feed to printf , or it can be a -> r , where a is the type of the next argument to printf , and r is again a varying type .
So adding liftIO . on the front forces printf to have the IO a type straight away , thus breaking the vararg tricks .
We must add a new type - class with the same basic idea as printf , but with some adjustments .
This is made harder because the implementation of printf and hPrintf ( which we still want to use , rather than re-implement ) is hidden in the Text .
Printf module and is unavailable to us .
What we do is construct something a bit like a list fold .
Here is the type of the standard foldl function , with some more descriptive type names than usual :
foldl :: ( agg -> listItem -> agg ) -> agg -> [ listItem ] -> agg
We can conceive of a slightly different interface :
data Fold agg listItem = Fold agg ( listItem -> Fold agg listItem ) foldl :: Fold agg listItem -> [ listItem ] -> agg
The data - type Fold contains the current aggregate value ( the first item of Fold ) to use if there are no more list items , and a function that , given the next list item , will return the next Fold instance ( the second item of Fold ) .
We can create an analogous type for printf ( if you think of printf doing a left fold over its variable number of arguments ) :
data PrintfFold = PrintfFold ( IO ( ) ) ( PrintfArg a => a -> PrintfFold )
( Note that this requires Rank2 Types . )
The first item , of type IO ( ) , represents the “ print now with all the arguments you ’ve got so far ” item , whereas the second , of type PrintfArg a => a ->
PrintfFold is the “ here ’s one more argument , now give me a new PrintfFold ” item .
To implement our wrapper around printf that supports varargs , we will need our own type - class that is based around this PrintfFold type :
class PrintfWrapper a where wrapPrintf :: ( Config -> Bool ) -> PrintfFold -> a
The wrapPrintf function takes a decision function ( given this config , should the item be printed ? ) , our PrintfFold and becomes the type that is the parameter to the class ( this part mirrors printf ’s vararg magic ) .
The base instance , for acting in the ReaderT Config IO monad , is :
instance PrintfWrapper ( ReaderT Config IO a ) where wrapPrintf check ( PrintfFold now _f ) = do x <- ask when ( check x ) ( liftIO now ) return undefined
This checks , based on the value of the config , whether to print the item — the printing is done using the now action from our PrintfFold type .
Finally , we return an undefined value , which is what printf does too ( printf allows its return type to vary to avoid upsetting the type inference ) .
Our instance for when another argument is passed is very simple :
instance ( PrintfWrapper r , PrintfArg a ) => PrintfWrapper ( a -> r ) where wrapPrintf check ( PrintfFold _now f ) x = wrap Printf check ( f x )
This just continues the pseudo - fold by adding this argument .
The final piece of the puzzle is the top - level new printf function .
We can use this one new type - class defined above to write replacements for printf and hPrintf ; I ’m showing the hPrintf version :
chPrintf :: PrintfWrapper r => ( Config -> Bool ) ->
Handle -> String -> r chPrintf check h s = wrapPrintf check $ make ( hPrintf h s ) ( hPrintf h s ) where make :: IO ( ) -> ( forall a r. ( PrintfArg a , HPrintfType r ) => a -> r ) ->
PrintfFold make as Is oneMore = PrintfFold as Is ( \x -> make ( oneMore x ) ( oneMore x ) )
The interesting bit here is the make function that constructs a PrintfFold .
It takes two arguments : the action to execute if there are no further arguments to printf , and the function to get a new fold when you feed it another argument .
These two arguments always come from the same code , but the code can take on the two types because of the way printf can have these two different types .
Our new chPrintf function can be used just like hPrintf , but in the ReaderT Config IO monad :
data Config = Config {decide :: Bool} main :: IO ( ) main = flip runReaderT ( Config True ) $ do chPrintf decide stdout " String %s , Int %d " " hello " ( 42:: Int ) chPrintf decide stdout " No Args "
If you change that True to False , the text will not be printed .
It should be easy to see how an instance could be defined to use my approach with the StateT Config IO monad or similar .
It is also possible to define an instance to use the exact same chPrintf function in the normal IO monad ( which will ignore the check based on the config , since it has no config item available to check ) :
instance PrintfWrapper ( IO a ) where wrapPrintf _check ( PrintfFold now _f ) = now >> return undefined
This is useful if in some places in your code you want to use a wrapper function based on the chPrintf function in the IO monad ( Criterion does this in a couple of places ) .
Now that you have chPrintf , it becomes easy to define a wrapper function that prints some vararg bits when the verbosity is above a certain level ; here is some code from Criterion that does just that :
note :: ( PrintfWrapper r ) => String -> r note = chPrintf ( (> Quiet ) . fromLJ cfgVerbosity ) stdout
This can then be used like printf :
note " bootstrapping with %d resamples
" numResamples
Other variations on the pattern presented here are possible ; the Handle could be retrieved from a StateT monad ( if you make both the items in the PrintfFold take a Handle as a parameter ) , or a standard prefix added to all printed text — where the text is similarly taken from some reader or state monad transformer .
The good thing from a code standpoint is that I did n’t need to duplicate any of the printing functionality from the Text .
Printf module , nor did I need anything more than its normal publicly visible interface ; I just needed to arm - wrestle the type system for a while — and use Rank2 Types .
Interview : Roy Bennett
One man stands at the heart of a power struggle for the future of Zimbabwe .
His name is Roy Bennett , and he is literally fighting for his life .
The white former landowner and member of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) is standing trial for trumped - up terrorism and treason charges — proceedings that began Nov. 9 .
Zimbabwe ’s attorney general , Johannes Tomana , is leading the prosecution himself .
How this plain - spoken , sturdily built , third - generation Zimbabwean ended up on trial has much to do with his position as a practitioner in the country ’s most politically controversial industry : agriculture .
Bennett was a coffee farmer , running one of Zimbabwe ’s many prosperous outfits until President Robert Mugabe ’s ruling ZANU - PF Party government confiscated the land in 2003 .
The seizure was part of Mugabe ’s larger " land reform " scheme , officially intended to give land back to the black Africans deprived of it during colonization .
In reality , the campaign resembled more closely what the country ’s own minister of justice , Patrick Chinamasa , called it — a kind of punishment for white farmers ’ forefathers being " thieves " and " murderers . "
But it was n’t only Bennett ’s farm that landed him in his current predicament .
Bennett was a parliamentarian and a key player in the MDC , which he joined in 1999 .
Being in the opposition made Bennett unpopular from the start , but things became worse after the land seizure , and especially after Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai ’s chose him for deputy minister of agriculture in the power - sharing government that took shape in the spring of 2009 .
Mugabe refused to swear Bennett in to his post , citing Bennett ’s ongoing trial — a refusal that featured high on the list of grievances that inspired Tsvangirai to boycott the power - sharing government in October .
The prime minister has since returned to negotiations , with a looming deadline in early December to sort out disagreements with Mugabe .
Attorney General Tomoma ( appointed by Mugabe ) is accusing Bennett of providing $ 5,000 to purchase weapons in a conspiracy to overthrow the president .
The defense says that the key witness , a former , legal arms dealer named Peter Michael Hitschmann , tried in 2006 on the same charges , was tortured into implicating Bennett .
( Hitschmann was writing an affidavit claiming he had no reason to implicate Bennett in October , but the lawyer helping him was arrested and later released on bail . )
If found guilty , Bennett faces life in prison or the death penalty .
With December looking ever closer and the coalition government dangerously near collapse , the conclusion of this trial will serve as a litmus test .
At stake is whether the MDC and its supporters can work with ZANU - PF and its founder , Mugabe , a man who has proudly compared himself to Adolf Hitler .
Bennett , for one , is confident that Mugabe ’s reign of terror will end , though not necessarily anytime soon .
Speaking to journalist Laura Wells , Bennett explains why Mugabe is a racist , why Tsvangirai ’s wife may well have been killed thanks to foul play , and why , nonetheless , the opposition keeps fighting .
Foreign Policy : When Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai left the power - sharing agreement with Mugabe last month , he cited the government ’s treatment of you as one of his reasons for leaving .
He has recently returned to the government and you are still on trial .
Can Tsvangirai help you ?
Roy Bennett : No , I do n’t think he can at all .
Mugabe is still fully in control .
[ His party , ] ZANU - PF , is still fully in control .
The MDC has pulled out of that government to show that , unless we were taken seriously within the cabinet and there was definite power - sharing , we would no longer be part of that government or part of any dealings with ZANU PF .
I am one of those outstanding issues ; I need to be sworn in [ as deputy minister of agriculture . ]
FP : What do you think will happen to the current power - sharing agreement ?
RB : You ca n’t have an agreement where one side is doing what you ’ve agreed to and the other side is totally intransigent , totally unreliable , and totally deceitful .
Unless the sincerity and the proper [ political ] will to make this work come from above in ZANU - PF , [ that is , from Mugabe , ] this thing will never move forward or succeed .
It will all fall apart .
FP : Do you ever expect to be sworn in as deputy minister of agriculture ?
RB : No , definitely not .
I am everything he [ Mugabe ] hates , and I think it is a very big thorn in his side that I could be sworn in the agricultural portfolio , where I could expose a lot of the corruption , rampant corruption , theft , and bad policies that are taking place there .
FP : As a part of Mugabe ’s " land reform , " the government has confiscated many , mostly white , landowners ’ property , including yours .
In a 2004 session of Parliament , Minister of Justice Patrick Chinamasa justified land reform on the basis that your forefathers were " murderers " and " thieves . "
How does this happen ?
RB : [ Mugabe ] has used the land and the race [ issues ] as a front to destroy opposition figures , to intimidate opposition figures , and to destroy an opposition constituency .
You take my farm , for instance , and where I was .
I was a senior leader within the Movement for Democratic Change .
I had a farm that was under the Zimbabwean Investment Center , which gave it special protection , because I had an external partner through the export processing zone .
One Easter , in 2004 , when my wife and I were with friends on holiday in Mozambique , [ Mugabe ] moved the military in and took over my farm .
I ’ve never set foot back there .
They took everything I own — even my clothes , my children ’s clothes .
Since then , I ’ve been in prison on three occasions ; I ’ve been arrested on more than 11 occasions .
I ’ve had my home searched for arms of war more than 15 times .
I ’ve had my workers killed .
I ’ve had my workers ’ daughters and wives raped .
FP : You have spoken about racism against whites within the current government .
How deep - seated is it ?
RB : The current government , especially under ZANU - PF , is full of hate .
We [ whites ] do n’t see ourselves as whites ; we see ourselves as Zimbabweans , and fortunately , the majority of people in Zimbabwe see it the same way .
It ’s a small echelon of the ruling ZANU - PF and Robert Mugabe .
But he , himself personally , is an avid , avid racist .
FP : You are now on trial for terrorism and treason .
What evidence do they have ?
RB : They have absolutely no evidence whatsoever .
The whole issue is premised on the arrest of one Hitschmann in 2006 , along with 12 other people .
He was charged with exactly the same charges I ’m being charged with , and so were the other 12 .
It was established in court that the warn and caution statement [ a signed statement made under police interrogation ] that he had given had been obtained under duress .
It had also been proven under doctors ’ reports that he had been tortured .
So that warn and caution statement was thrown out of the courts .
All the terrorism and treason charges were dropped .
They were dropped against all 12 of them .
Hitschmann was then charged under a completely different offense .
In his trial , I was never mentioned .
And since then , he has contacted his own advocate and given an affidavit to say that he had absolutely nothing to say against me or to involve me in the proceedings of what I am being accused of .
FP : The current administration has put you in jail off and on during the past year , even against high courts ’ and the Supreme Court ’s rulings .
How can they do that ?
RB : There is no rule of law in Zimbabwe ; there ’s selective application of the rule of law .
Patrick Chinamasa , who is the minister of justice , destroyed the independent judiciary .
When he was sworn in as the minister of justice , [ he ] interfered with the judges , forced them to resign and leave — any independent judges , replaced the judges with political appointees who he gave farms for patronage to make sure they would remain loyal and have the rulings that he wanted .
And you can see even with my case , his interference is there the whole time .
FP : If the current President and his political allies have not treated you fairly before , how can you receive justice this time around ?
RB : There will be no justice .
You know , I do n’t know how they are going to do it .
When Hitschmann gets into the stand and completely denies everything , and makes him [ Attorney General Johannes Tomana ] look stupid , I do n’t know what they are going to do or what their next move is .
I honestly believe , in my case , that they are using me .
I am very sure they will sentence me .
And once they have gone ahead and sentenced me , they will go back to negotiate with my party to have an amnesty in order that their people that have done the murders and the killings during the last elections , when over 200 MDC people were killed , their eyes gauged out , their throats cut , killed in the most brutal manner .
The perpetrators are known , and those perpetrators were instructed by Robert Mugabe himself to carry out those actions .
I honestly believe that ’s what this whole thing is about , is to use me as a bargaining point for amnesty in order that those people will say , " He ’s on death row .
Now he ’s going to hang , unless you agree to amnesty , across - the - board amnesty . "
FP : You are potentially facing a death sentence or life in prison .
How are you feeling about your trial ?
RB : You know , when you enter into a struggle , and you genuinely believe in what you are doing , and you live under injustice , and you live under a regime that is dictatorial and oppresses people , there have to be sacrifices .
I have a constituency that has placed me where I am .
I have entered into this foray of my own will .
And if I have to sacrifice by going to prison or whatever that exposes and shows this regime for what it is , so be it .
FP : You have said you ’d be willing to die if that ’s what Mugabe and and his ZANU - PF want .
Do you think it will have to come to that ?
RB : It could easily come to that .
You ’re dealing with total , total thugs and mafia - type people .
They do n’t care .
Right now it ’s the looting of the Marange diamonds .
It ’s Robert Mugabe ’s wife together with [ Reserve Bank Governor ] Gideon Gono that are taking the gold , the diamonds — it ’s all about money .
There is a company that has the claim to those rights .
The high courts of Zimbabwe have ruled that that company can run that mine , yet the government has taken the mines in partnership with a South African company .
They are illegally mining diamonds on somebody else ’s claim .
The whole thing is so rotten , it ’s disgusting .
FP : Prime Minister Tsvangirai has seen many attempts on his life , suffered torture during multiple jail sentences under weak charges at best .
He has lost his wife in a suspicious car accident in which he was also injured .
Though he nominally has more power than President Mugabe , do you think Mugabe will defeat Tsvangirai ?
RB : Definitely not .
Mugabe and ZANU - PF ’s days are over .
It ’s a process , and it ’s a matter of time for them to go .
And it depends on how brutal they become and how willing they are to take Zimbabwe to the brink .
But definitely , they will go .
There is absolutely no doubt that Robert Mugabe and ZANU - PF have lost the popular support of the people of Zimbabwe .
And the more they become intransigent , the more they become vicious and try to repress people , the more it turns people against them and the less chance they have of ever holding onto power .
They are just making it harder and harder for themselves while being intransigent and trying to force the fact that they must remain in power .
FP : Speaking of Tsvangirai ’s deceased wife , Susan , how do the investigations stand , and do you believe foul play was involved ?
RB : I , personally , definitely believe that foul play was involved .
There is no doubt about it in my mind .
But , again , you know , that just shows the greatness of a man like Morgan Tsvangirai .
The people in the country of Zimbabwe come first .
He knows full well what happened to his wife .
But it makes us closer together as colleagues and makes you more determined .
FP : Do you think Mugabe will ever be brought to justice ?
RB : I sincerely , from the bottom of my heart , hope so .
Because one evil , evil man has destroyed a beautiful country that was the jewel of Africa .
He ’s destroyed it ; [ there are ] millions of people in abject poverty and suffering , and it ’s through his doing .
So , at some stage , he ’s accountable for that .

Gordon Brown is facing demands to change the rules of the Iraq inquiry this weekend amid fears that the most explosive documents explaining why Britain went to war will not be made public .
As the inquiry enters its second week , the prime minister is under pressure to make key evidence relating to secret government discussions public , including minutes showing how the then attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , changed his mind about the legality of the war .
The demands are made in a letter to Brown from the Liberal Democrat leader , Nick Clegg , who insists that unless the lid is lifted on secrecy , the Chilcot inquiry will fail to satisfy the public 's demands for honesty .
Last night the Mail on Sunday claimed Goldsmith wrote to Blair in July 2002 , eight months before the war , telling him that deposing Saddam Hussein was a blatant breach of international law .
The intention was to make Blair call off the invasion but he ignored the advice , the newspaper says , and banned Goldsmith from attending cabinet meetings .
The letter has been handed to the inquiry and both men are expected to be questioned about it in the new year .
The row between Clegg and Brown has escalated the day before Sir David Manning , Tony Blair 's former foreign policy adviser , gives evidence to the inquiry about a meeting between George Bush and Blair in January 2003 when they are alleged to have agreed to go to war regardless of whether weapons of mass destruction had been found .
Clegg writes :
" The full truth can not be known unless the presently undisclosed legal advice given to the government by the former attorney general Lord Goldsmith in the lead - up to the war is made public , as well as emails and other communications surrounding his summons to Downing Street on 13 March 2003 which preceded his rewriting of his earlier opinion on the legality of the war . "
He also demands that Brown allow publication of papers relating to the meeting between Blair and Bush at which Manning was present .
It follows a week when critics of the war , including relatives of the 179 servicemen and women who have died in Iraq , have expressed their anger at the power of civil servants to block vital documents .
" Protocols " – measures used to control the release of information – give civil servants and witnesses nine separate grounds on which to block publication of damaging details .
Clegg writes that such powers are draconian for a government that has pledged to allow the truth about Iraq to emerge .
" The restrictions on information released by the inquiry are greater than those which apply under current freedom of information rules , " he writes .
" Unless you provide Chilcot with the freedom you claimed he has across the floor of the Commons this week , public trust in the final outcome of this review will be deeply damaged . "
According to reports , a five - page secret document known as the Manning memo records the White House meeting on 31 January 2003 .
It allegedly shows that Bush and Blair made a secret deal to carry out an invasion regardless of whether weapons of mass destruction were discovered by UN inspectors .
It appears to contradict statements Blair later made to parliament that Iraq would be given a final chance to disarm .
The memo also apparently discloses that Bush floated the idea of letting a spy plane in UN colours fly low over Iraq to provoke Saddam into having it shot down , providing a pretext for invasion .
Under current rules , the inquiry could be prevented from disclosing the Manning memo could be blocked from the inquiry .
Other papers can be blocked if they contain commercially sensitive information , which might make it possible for Mr Brown to stopblock the release of papers relating to the procurement of equipment for the armed forces before the war .
That process is widely believed to have cost the lives of British troops who were left without vital kit such as body armour , because the contracts were concluded too late .
The revelation comes after a week in which senior civil servants have given damning evidence to the inquiry which appeared to show that Tony Blair misled the public about the Iraq war .
The migration continues .
Motorola has proclaimed an aggressive move to adopt Android as their smartphone platform of choice and HTC is clearly in robot mode as well .
It sounds as if Samsung will join that bunch as they increase their Android lineup at the expense of Windows Mobile .
More specifically , Android will compose 30 % of their phone portfolio in 2010 and beyond ( rumor ) .
I ’m a bit surprised that the “ beyond 2010 ” does n’t account for even MORE Android considering how aggressively the company looks to be cutting back on WinMo devices .
According to HMC Investment Securities Analyst Greg Noh , here is how much of their lineup will feature Windows Mobile phones :
80 % in 2009
50 % in 2010
30 % in 2011
20 % in 2012
Or for the graphically inclined :
Sounds terrible for Microsoft but the fate of Symbian is even worse – by 2011 the manufacturer wo n’t produce any phones with the Symbian operating system .
Ouch .
So why would n’t Samsung ramp up their Android production levels even further ?
A new proprietary Samsung OS should arrive next year and gradually form about half of all the company ’s smartphone sales .
Doubtful .
That is assuming that their Samsung OS phones sell well compared to their Android Phones , which I do n’t see happening .
Regardless of the ratio of Samsung OS models to Android Phone models they make , unit sales are a figure only the market can determine .
And right now , the market is really , really liking Android .
Somehow they have their own proprietary OS eating into Android sales from 2011 into 2012 .
What do they know that we do n’t ?
If their Android Phones strongly outperform devices running their own proprietary OS , any good business person would skew production towards Android .
So I ’m wondering what the heck this optimistic SammyOS is all about .
The original article / note was found at TelecomsKorea.com but has since disappeared .
Props to Electronista and JKonTheRun for nabbing the story before the plug was pulled .
Keep in mind this is n’t official word from Samsung , this is rumored and speculative information and up to this point , we do n’t have any feedback or comments from Samsung themselves on the matter .
México no patenta sus ideas
Pie de foto , Las empresas mexicanas prefieren tecnología extranjera antes que ideas nacionales , dicen especialistas .
Recientemente científicos mexicanos desarrollaron una tortilla de maíz de alto contenido energético , y con un bajo costo ambiental en su elaboración .
Durante varios meses trataron de conseguir apoyo de empresarios del país para comercializar el producto , pero a ninguno le interesó .
Al final una compañía estadounidense compró el invento ... con todo y la patente .
Ahora , los mexicanos que deseen tortillas energéticas deben comprarlas a la empresa extranjera .
Un ejemplo que se repite con frecuencia en México , que según cifras oficiales tiene uno de los registros más bajos de patentes propias en el continente .
Y no es que haya pocos inventores , dicen especialistas , sino que existe poco mercado para productos y tecnología desarrollados en el país .
Es un círculo vicioso que no ha podido romperse , pues ante la falta de estímulos se reduce el desarrollo de tecnología propia .
“ Hay investigación de nivel mundial en algunas áreas , pero las empresas mexicanas no tienen capacidad para aprovecharla .
Muchas patentes se pierden por su desinterés ” , le dijo a BBC Mundo José Mustre , académico de Física Aplicada del Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados ( Cinvestav ) .
No hay dinero
De acuerdo con el gubernamental Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial ( IMPI ) , que lleva el registro oficial de las patentes , en lo que va de este año se han otorgado 161 licencias a inventores de este país .
La cifra representa menos de la mitad de las autorizadas en 1993 , cuando el IMPI otorgó 343 registros .
El camino va en sentido contrario al de otros países .
De acuerdo con la Oficina de Patentes y Marcas de Estados Unidos , el año pasado ese país registró 77.501 patentes , mientras que en Japón se otorgaron 145.040 licencias .
Las solicitudes mexicanas de patentes son incluso menores a Brasil , que obtuvo 233 registros .
Los números revelan la falta de apoyo en México para el desarrollo de inventos propios , según ha reconocido el director del IMPI , Jorge Amigo .
“ No hay financiamiento para apoyar a los inventores , y cuando tienen una patente tampoco existen fondos para llevarla al mercado ” , dijo a diarios mexicanos .
Apoyo escaso
Los especialistas consultados por BBC Mundo afirman que existe un alto nivel de desconfianza hacia los científicos mexicanos , especialmente de las grandes empresas que prefieren comprar tecnología en otros países .
Al mismo tiempo , son pocas las universidades públicas donde la investigación científica se concentra en necesidades reales del mercado , señaló el académico Mustre .
Y , por si fuera poco , en las últimas décadas el sistema educativo mexicano ha fomentado poco la creación de tecnología propia .
“ Hay una escasa cultura de la innovación , no existe en las instituciones públicas ni privadas una política de fomento a la creatividad ” , le dijo a BBC Mundo Víctor Castaño , director del Centro de Física Aplicada en Querétaro de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México ( UNAM ) .
Así , el resultado ya es evidente .
US special forces are supporting anti-Taliban militias in at least 14 areas of Afghanistan as part of a secretive programme that experts warn could fuel long - term instability in the country .
The Community Defence Initiative ( CDI ) is enthusiastically backed by Stanley McChrystal , the US general commanding Nato forces in Afghanistan , but details about the programme have been held back from non-US alliance members who are likely to strongly protest .
The attempt to create what one official described as " pockets of tribal resistance " to the Taliban involves US special forces embedding themselves with armed groups and even disgruntled insurgents who are then given training and support .
In return for stabilising their local area the militia helps to win development aid for their local communities , although they will not receive arms , a US official said .
Special forces will be able to access money from a US military fund to pay for the projects .
The hope is that the militias supplement the Nato and Afghan forces fighting the Taliban .
But the prospect of re-empowering militias after billions of international dollars were spent after the US - led invasion in 2001 to disarm illegally armed groups alarms many experts .
Senior generals in the Afghan ministries of interior and defence are also worried about what they see as a return to the failed strategies of the Soviet Union during its occupation of Afghanistan .
Thomas Ruttig , co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network , said the US risked losing control over groups which have in the past turned to looting shops and setting up illegal road checkpoints when they lose foreign support .
" It is not enough to talk to a few tribal elders and decide that you trust them , " Ruttig said .
" No matter how well - trained and culturally aware the special forces are they will never be able to get to know enough about a local area to trust the people they are dealing with . "
Another controversial aspect of the programme is the involvement of Arif Noorzai , an Afghan politician from Helmand who is widely distrusted by many members of the international community .
Although many western officials want to sideline Noorzai and give oversight to the Afghan army and police , some of the CDI militias will build upon the 12,500 militiamen in 22 provinces Noorzai helped to set up this summer in the run up to the presidential elections on 20 August , an official said .
Despite the lack of any announcement about the programme , which could radically affect conditions in unstable areas across Afghanistan , it has begun in 14 areas in the south , east and west , but is expected to extend far beyond that .
Another diplomat in the south - east of the country said in the last six weeks special forces have held several meetings with elders in restive districts in Paktia , close to the Pakistani border , seeking to embed themselves with the local people .
The diplomat said : " It is not clear anything has happened yet , but the elders in the area are all seeing dollar signs and very much want to qualify for this programme . "
According to some western officials , the US government will make a pot of $ 1.3 bn ( £ 790 m ) available for the programme , although the US embassy said it could not yet comment on CDI .
A US military spokesman also declined to comment saying the programme was still in its early phases and public discussion could jeopardise the lives of some of the Afghans involved .
The plan represents a significant change in tack from a scheme promoted just last year by General McChrystal 's predecessor , David McKiernan .
The Afghan Public Protection Force ( APPF ) was piloted in Wardak province and involved the rigorous vetting of recruits who were then given basic training , a uniform and came under the authority of the Afghan police .
" McChrystal was always quite dismissive about APPF , " a senior Nato official in Kabul said .
" It was too resource - intensive and so slow we would have lost long before it had been spread to the whole country . "
He added : " He wanted to move to a much more informal model , which is far less visible and unaccountable , using Noorzai to find people through his own networks and then simply paying out cash for them to defend their areas . "
The US has shared few details of its plans with its allies .
The programme is controlled by a newly created special forces group that reports directly to McChrystal as head of US forces in the country , but which sits outside the authority of the International Security Assistance Force , the Nato mission in Afghanistan .
Few trees are as well suited to the hyperarid ecosystem of the Atacama - Sechura Desert , nestled between the Andes and the Pacific .
The huarango captures moisture coming from the west as sea mist .
Its roots are among the longest of any tree , extending more than 150 feet to tap subterranean water channels .
The resilience of the huarango and its role in taming one of the world ’s driest climates have long beguiled this country ’s poets .
Schoolchildren here , for instance , recite the words of José María Arguedas , a leading 20th - century writer : “ The huarangos let in the sun , while keeping out the fire . ”
But poetry is one thing .
The necessities of human civilizations , and their capacity to wreak havoc on the ecosystems on which they depend , are another .
A team of British archaeologists described in a groundbreaking study this month how the Nazca , who etched their lines in the desert a thousand years before the arrival of the Spanish , induced an environmental catastrophe by clearing the huarango to plant crops like cotton and maize , exposing the landscape to desert winds , erosion and floods .
David Beresford - Jones , an archaeologist at Cambridge University who was a co-author of the study , said that perhaps the only fragment of old - growth huarango woodland left is in Usaca , about a five - hour drive from Ica , where there are still some trees that were alive when the Incas conquered the southern coast of Peru in the 15th century .
“ It takes centuries for the huarango to be of substantial size , and only a few hours to fell it with a chainsaw , ” Mr. Beresford - Jones said .
“ The tragedy is that this remnant is being chain - sawed by charcoal burners as we speak . ”

McClatchy reports that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met a rebuff in Moscow on Tuesday from Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on the issue of further United Nations sanctions on Iran .
Lavrov said of Iran , “ We are convinced that threats , sanctions , or threats to use pressure are counterproductive in the present situation . ”
This language closely echoes that of China .
It also reflects the position of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , who had said in September that “ any use of force , delivering any kind of strike , wo n’t help , wo n’t solve the problem .
On the contrary , it will hurt the entire region .
As for sanctions , they wo n’t bring the desired effect . ”
In contrast , Russian president Dmitry Medvedev had seemed more open to further sanctions , though he may have thought them farther off than did Washington .
Lavrov ’s remarks are further proof , if any were needed , that Putin is still calling the shots in the Russian Federation .
Russia Today has video of the Clinton / Lavrov press conference :
The USG Open Source Center translated Lavrov ’s remarks on Iran from Vesti TV :
‘ Lavrov said the Russian and US positions on the Iranian nuclear issue coincide , but he believed imposing sanctions would be counterproductive at this stage .
He said : “ We are not asking anything of each other regarding Iran , because it would be strange to ask for something on an issue where our positions coincide .
We want to resolve all issues relating to Iran ’s nuclear program , so that that country can make full use of its rights as a non-nuclear member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty , and of all opportunities arising from this connected with the use of peaceful nuclear energy , but at the same time ensuring that the non-proliferation regime is in no way violated .
“ And this is absolutely firm ground on which Russia and the USA , along with our European partners and the People ’s Republic of China , are promoting their proposals for talks with Iran regarding the settlement of all the existing issues . ”
Lavrov went on to say that Russia was “ fully committed to the two - track approach ” to the settlement of Iran ’s nuclear issue , stressing that the second track [ i.e. economic sanctions ] only has “ an auxiliary function , that of influencing Iran with a view to achieving success on track one . ”
“ Today we have , albeit not 100 - per-cent , still quite good chances of achieving progress on the first track , ” he said .
Referring to agreements reached at the 5+1 meeting [ with Iran ] on 1 October in Geneva , Lavrov said : “ We have agreed today that all those agreements should be implemented in full .
We expect that at the specific contacts planned for this month , practical work to implement those agreements will begin in all three areas ( resuming talks on Iran ’s nuclear program , inspections of the Qom uranium enrichment plant , and supply of low - enriched uranium to the Tehran research reactor ) .
“ So we base our position on this , and also on the fact that at this stage all efforts should be employed to maintain the negotiating process which began on the first track .
We are convinced that threats , sanctions , or threats to use pressure are counterproductive in the present situation . ” ‘
Meanwhile , PM Putin was in Beijing doing economic deals that included Chinese loans to Russian banks and Russian help in building a petroleum refinery near the Chinese capital , according to FT .
I am of a generation whose mind is boggled at the idea of China lending money to Russian banks .
Putin had hoped to nail down a Chinese agreement to import natural gas from Russia , but made little progress beyond a meaningless memorandum of agreement .
China does not need to import much natural gas , in contrast to petroleum ( it imports nearly 4 mn. barrels per day of oil ) , and still has not gotten the terms from Russia it is seeking .
Putin ’s initial approach to China with regard to natural gas exports created fears in Europe , which is heavily dependent on Russian gas , that their supply might be reduced in favor of Beijing .
These anxieties and considerations around energy supplies are likely to drive geopolitics in the 21st century .
In any case , Russia ’s tightening of ties with China is of a piece with its Iran policy , which mirrors that of Beijing , and the congruence is unlikely to be accidental .
The Russian - Chinese cooperation is given institutional form by the Shanghai Cooperation Council and seems pretty explicitly aimed at excluding the US from hegemony in Central Asia .
Keeping Iran from being crushed by US - led sanctions would be consistent with that approach .
Of course , neither Russia nor China wants Iran to develop nuclear weapons , and evidence that it was doing so might change their minds on sanctions .
After years of running interference for North Korea , China has this year proved more willing to back strict sanctions against Pongyang after N. Korea tried its patience once too often on the nuclear issue .

President Obama and his allies in Congress are doing everything they can to rally 60 senators behind health care reform .
But , for one red - state senator , even 60 " yes " votes wo n't do .
It has to be 65 .
" I think anything less than that would challenge its legitimacy , " he said in late September .
It 's a ludicrously high standard for passage -- the sort you 'd expect from a Republican opponent .
But this comment came from Democrat Ben Nelson .
And , while Nelson may be an extreme case who revels in opportunities to buck his party , he's not the only conservative Democrat arguing that health care reform -- even the scaled - back version moving through the Senate Finance Committee - - may be too much , too fast .
Even though the bill , as constructed , would leave millions uninsured and millions more with scant coverage , several of Nelson 's Democratic colleagues have talked about weakening the bill even more , by further reducing its funding .
They say they 're worried about controlling the cost of medical care , and yet , they 've eschewed obvious ways to cut costs , such as taking more money from the drug or hospital industries .
And they oppose a voluntary public insurance plan , which is among the most efficient ways of delivering affordable , reliable coverage .
What are their motives ?
The charitable explanation is that Nelson and his allies are acting out of principles they come by honestly -- that they simply can't abide even this modest expansion of government .
But sincerity does not guarantee good public policy .
And , in this case , their opposition would n't seem to serve their constituents well : 12.8 percent of Nelson 's Nebraska constituents lack health insurance , as do 17.5 percent of Blanche Lincoln 's in Arkansas and 20.2 percent of Mary Landrieu 's in Louisiana .
Many additional people in those states are " underinsured , " meaning their coverage does n't meet their needs .
Because the Senate Finance bill does not offer financial assistance to people making more than three times the poverty line -- and because the insurance it guarantees is less protective than what other , more expensive versions of reform would require -- many of these people will remain exposed to the severe financial , not to mention medical , risks of inadequate coverage .
More generous reform would ameliorate that problem , and few of its beneficiaries would bear the price , since the money to pay for it would likely come from taxes on the rich and on expensive benefit plans .
A less charitable explanation for the obstructionism of red-state Democrats is that they are trying to curry favor with health industry interests that help finance their campaigns .
( Nelson has always been a favorite candidate of the health insurance industry , for example . )
But there 's a political cost to watering down reform :
It might produce a bill that voters do n't like .
A reform crafted to appease the health care industry would extract minimal concessions from it :
It would let drugmakers and hospitals get off with minimal sacrifice , even as both stand to gain the business of millions of new customers .
Such reforms would do little to tamp down the skyrocketing prices of drugs and hospital stays ( and , for that matter , the prices of devices and doctor visits ) .
Insurers would have more leeway to raise their own prices and treat their sicker patients badly .
Employers would continue to operate with minimal interference , which would mean fewer guarantees for Americans who get insurance through their jobs .
By insisting that reform conforms to the interests of these groups , conservative Democrats can perhaps secure their campaign contributions -- but only at the risk of alienating constituents .
Lincoln will have Wal - Mart .
But will she win her next election ?
To be fair , Nelson , Lincoln , and others do have constituencies that express some seriously right - wing views .
And , while polls sometimes show that conservatives support reform , voters in these states may well be skeptical .
Perhaps what these senators need is a clever way out of their political dilemma - - a way to produce change without supporting reform that is perceived as too liberal .
Fortunately , the procedures of the Senate allow for just such a convoluted arrangement .
Obama and his allies are focused on getting 60 votes because that 's what it takes to break a filibuster .
But a senator can vote to break a filibuster without voting for the bill being filibustered .
Nelson and others can simply support cloture and then vote " no " on the final bill ( or merely abstain ) .
As long as Democrats have 50 " yes " votes -- and they almost surely do -- the bill will pass .
The chief of an endangered Amazon tribe will unveil today the product of an unusual partnership with Google Inc. that pairs high tech with indigenous knowledge in an effort to rescue ancient rain forests and a dying culture .
Almir Surui , speaking at the 20th annual Bioneers Conference in San Rafael , plans to showcase Google Earth images years in the making that throw into sharp relief the rapid encroachment of illegal mining and logging onto his people 's 600,000 - acre reserve .
The data - rich maps include layers of videos , pictures , text and historical markers gathered by tribe members .
It promises to underscore the importance of the land and propel the Surui people 's efforts to become self - sufficient .
" Right now , under current development models , a standing forest is always worth less than its extractable parts , " Chief Almir , 35 , a stocky man with a bulldog head crowned by a feathered Amazon headdress , said through an interpreter .
" Forests are very important for the welfare of the indigenous people and for the world , " he said .
" We want to show concretely , practically that you can have quality of life and economic development , with an intact forest . "
The Google Earth updates will become viewable later this week .
The 1,300 - member Surui tribe was 5,000 strong in the late 1960s , when it first came into contact with outsiders as construction began on the BR - 364 highway through nearby Cacoal , Brazil , about 125 miles from the northwest border of Bolivia .
The ensuing decades brought disease , crushing poverty and continual clashes with plunderers .
The Brazilian Constitution grants indigenous tribes the right to their traditional lands , but the government has n't backed the policy with the necessary resources to halt the incursions , environmental groups allege .
11 chiefs shot , killed
Eleven chiefs of Surui and neighboring tribes have been shot and killed this decade , deaths members attribute to loggers and miners and see as clear warnings for others who would obstruct their efforts .
Almir , an outspoken activist for nearly two decades and the first member of his tribe to graduate from college , has been cautioned there 's a $ 100,000 bounty on his head .
Amazon Conservation Team of Arlington , Va. , which funded and provided technical equipment for the mapping project , evacuated Almir to the United States for his safety in 2006 .
The following year , they took him to Silicon Valley to appeal directly to Google for help .
Almir had discovered Google Earth in an Internet cafe and , like most people , began by zooming in for a bird 's - eye view of his own home .
He saw a green peninsula dangling into a sea of clear - cutting , a striking juxtaposition that he believed could awaken the world to the Surui 's plight .
Employing technology
He pleaded his case to members of Google Earth Outreach , the philanthropic arm of the Mountain View search company 's satellite imaging division .
It had previously partnered with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum to pinpoint ravaged villages in Darfur , Sudan and with the United Nations Environment Programme to highlight receding glaciers , deforestation and other environmental hot spots around the globe .
" He seemed to have a very clear sense of the appropriate use of technology for indigenous people to help them bridge that gap from their traditional ways to engaging with the modern world , " said Rebecca Moore , manager of Google Earth Outreach .
" We thought it would make sense for us to help . "
The company agreed to provide high resolution satellite images of the region and train the Surui people to survey their lands and document their culture , using tools like Google Earth , Google Maps , Blogger and YouTube .
They 're in the process of providing mobile phones with Google 's Android operating system that include new software to automatically tag photographs with locational information and upload to Google Earth .
Ethnographic mapping
The tribe adopted Amazon Conservation Team 's methodology for so - called ethnographic mapping , which has been used to chart more than 40 million acres of rain forest .
Members interviewed their elders , photographed their territory , and plotted out more than 2,000 important sites using GPS tools , including : ceremonial lands , hunting grounds , fishing spots and stands of the three tree types necessary to make their arrows .
" It shows how they use the land , their history on the land , the stories related to each point and also the spiritual side , " said Vasco van Roosmalen , Brazil director for the Amazon Conservation Team .
All the data have been embedded into the Google Earth images that Chief Almir will unveil today , and will continue to be updated in the years ahead .
The overarching hope is that stark pictures of deforestation 's devastation will grab the world 's attention and enlist new allies in the Surui 's struggles .
Texas - size swath gone
To the extent that the project saves the Surui , it also helps preserve the rain forest , a critical factor in the battle against global warming , said Mark Plotkin , president of the Amazon Conservation Team .
Since 1970 , more than 232,000 square miles of Amazon rain forest have disappeared , nearly the size of Texas , according to environmental site Mongabay.com .
Another 3,860 square miles of rain forest is expected to be destroyed this year .
With it goes incalculable biodiversity , cultural diversity , and one of the most effective counterweights to climate change .
Google Earth 's high - quality satellite images make it easier to monitor and defend the land from loggers and miners .
Over time , it can also track positive developments , including the preservation of threatened rain forest and the ambitious plan to replant 7,000 hectares of trees .
This " Surui carbon project " could funnel money to the tribe through global cap and trade programs .
It 's one plank in Almir 's " 50 - year plan " to help the Surui people become financially self - sufficient , engaging with the outside world without relinquishing their identity or exhausting their resources .
Other tribes seek help
Time and again , the best defense against deforestation in the massive , unmonitored Amazon jungles has proven to be native people willing to stand their ground , Plotkin said .
" If you do n't have Indians , you do n't have rain forests - and vice versa , " he said .
As word spreads about the Surui project , Google has engaged in similar discussions with indigenous tribes around the world , including the Mâori of New Zealand , the First Nations in Canada and the Masai of East Africa .
The company is already working with other native Amazon groups on mapping projects .
" We see this as a model , " Moore said .
" Many of these tribes have similar interests and challenges and goals , in terms of wanting to tell the world their story .
" I sometimes think people are more aware of polar bears under threat than entire tribes , " she said .

R ecently at one of my favorite sites , RealitySandwich.com , I came across a short but interesting article entitled , “ Hallucinating In The Dark . ”
It stated ,
“ A new study , published in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease , reveals that participants of normal health could achieve visual hallucinations after only 15 minutes of sensory deprivation .
Interestingly , nobody pressed the panic button that was available to end the experiment . ”
The article does n’t describe what type of hallucinations they are .
So I will make a comment on two things :
Sensory deprivation is known for causing out - of - body - experiences ( OBE ) and wake - initiated lucid dreaming ( WILD ) .
If that is the case for these hallucinations then they are probably generated in the upper visual cortex regions .
The optic nerve and primary cortex will only have limited activity in this process .
However , more than likely we are talking about “ geometric hallucinations ” which are often due to phosphene , or what I like to call “ neural static . ”
The brain is always firing neurons regardless of the presence of stimuli or not , you can actually detect this activity in your eye if you become aware of it and hold your attention .
It is always there .

The idea of using sensory deprivation techniques as a tool for exploring consciousness has fascinated me ever since I first watched Joe Rogan ’s explanation of his isolation tank .
I also believe that these exact states can be achieved with meditation , deep sleep hypnosis , and any other mental skill that allows an individual to put their body to sleep while keeping their mind – or more specifically consciousness – intact .
The best way to describe it is like slipping into a lucid dream , but it is less expected and it is easier to get overexcited and wake yourself up .

Hetty Bower , 104 , says nothing has been learnt from the two world wars
As the war in Afghanistan enters its ninth year , thousands of people have gathered in central London to protest against what they say is a futile and unwinnable conflict .
The organisers of the march say the protest reflects a sea change not only in public opinion , but in the views of military rank and file , who now want UK troops brought home , they claim .
The Stop The War Coalition says there is deep resentment among the lower ranks who feel they are locked into a war that has no clear justification or exit strategy .
Soldiers and their families were with those gathered at Speaker 's Corner in Hyde Park at the start of the march .
Among them was L / Cpl Joe Glenton , who defied orders from his commanding officer to become the first serving soldier to openly attend a national anti-war demonstration .
Manipulated Hugged closely by his wife , L / Cpl Glenton stood quietly in the thin autumn drizzle as a statement from him was read out .
" When I went to Afghanistan I was proud to serve the Army and to serve my country , but before long I realised the government was using the Army for its own ends .
" It is distressing to disobey orders , but when Britain follows America in continuing to wage war against one of the world 's poorest countries I feel I have no choice .
" Politicians have abused the trust of the Army and the soldiers who serve .
That is why I am compelled and proud to march for Stop The War Coalition today . "
I 'm not saying we should be out there , but I 'm saying once we 're there we support them
Philip Taylor
Also at the demonstration was 25 - year - old Paul McGuirk , who served in Helmand until April 2008 , but left the Army because he could not support the war in Afghanistan .
Speaking above the sound of protest chants , he said : " I just left the Army last month because I think it 's ridiculous we are there .
" I think the government should stop pretending it's a just war and wasting the lives of our guys , and stop pretending it's a winnable war . "
This sense of futility was a theme returned to again and again by the protesters .
' Nothing changes ' Joan Humphreys ' grandson , 24 - year - old Kevin Elliott , was one of the 222 soldiers killed since the invasion .
The 62 - year - old from Dundee said quietly : " My grandson was killed 54 days ago on 31 August in Afghanistan .
" Nothing 's going to be achieved .
I 've read back from 1840 to now , all the different conflicts [ in Afghanistan ] until now - and there have been a lot - and everyone has left without anything improving . "
The organisers believe the majority of people in the country now share these attitudes .
Paul McGurk said he believes the war in Afghanistan is un-winnable
They point to opinion polls such as a YouGov survey for Channel 4 News that found 62 % of those questioned wanted British troops withdrawn in the coming year at the latest .
Of 2,042 adults questioned , 6 % said that British troops were winning the war , compared with 36 % who said they were not winning yet but eventual victory was possible , and 48 % who said that victory was not possible .
However , despite the survey evidence , the demonstration had only a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands of people that turned out to protest against the invasion of Iraq .
' Ashamed '
By midday , some 500 people were gathered good - naturedly at Speaker 's Corner , the crowd swelling to about 2,000 as the march moved off towards Trafalgar Square .
The one dissenting voice came from 55 - year - old Philip Taylor , who said he believed that now the troops were in Afghanistan it was a betrayal not to support the mission .
He said the demonstrators should be " ashamed of themselves " .
" People are out there dying for this country .
I 'm concerned that our Army is out there fighting a war for this country and these people betraying our forces .
I just want my great - grandchildren to grow up in a world where war is past
Hetty Bower " I 'm not saying we should be out there , but I 'm saying once we 're there we support them . "
But of all the marchers it was the oldest protester who made the most poignant comments .
Hetty Bower , 104 , has lived through both world wars and says she feels nothing has been learnt .
As a nine - year - old she remembers cheering young men as they marched to the trenches , and then seeing their broken bodies return .
" It did n't take long before we saw those men coming back missing legs and missing arms , totally blind and war was no longer fun .
" I think I was 10 years old when my hatred of war began and I 'm 104 and still marching .
" I just want my great - grandchildren to grow up in a world where war is past . "

Unless something happens soon , Israelis , Palestinians and other Arabs may squander the best chance for Middle East peace in nearly a decade .
President Obama is committed to serious negotiations and , for now , there is a lull in regional violence .
But all of the region ’s major players are refusing to do what is needed to keep their own people safe and move the peace process forward .
Mr. Obama has called on the Israeli prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , to freeze all settlement construction as a way to demonstrate his government ’s commitment to trading land for peace .
Mr. Netanyahu , who accepted the idea of a two - state solution only grudgingly , has hinted that he might agree to a temporary freeze .
In the meantime , his government has approved 455 new permits for construction in the West Bank and said that work on 2,500 units now in progress must also be completed .
That may play well in Israeli polls , but it has given Arab leaders a powerful excuse to do nothing .
Mr. Obama has been urging Arab states to demonstrate their own commitment to a peace deal by signaling a greater acceptance of Israel  by granting overflight rights for Israeli commercial planes or opening consular or trade offices in Israel .
University of Bristol
David Nutt , a professor of pharmacology who was forced to resign on Friday as the head of an independent panel of experts set up to advise the British government on drug policy , accused Prime Minister Gordon Brown of overstating the dangers of cannabis and ecstasy to impress voters and suggested that drug laws should be written by scientists , not politicians .
Last Thursday , in an opinion essay on The Guardian ’s Web site ( which was adapted from a lecture published on the Web site of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies ) , Professor Nutt had argued against the government ’s decision to treat cannabis as a more dangerous drug .
The next day he was asked to resign by Alan Johnson , the British home secretary .
In a letter to The Guardian published on Monday , Mr. Johnson wrote that “ Professor Nutt was not sacked for his views , ” but “ because he cannot be both a government adviser and a campaigner against government policy . ”
Mr. Johnson also took issue with the arguments in a satirical essay Professor Nutt wrote earlier this year for the Journal of Psychopharmacology , in which he mocked media hysteria over the risks associated with taking ecstasy by pointing out that more Britons die while riding horses each year than taking ecstasy .
In terms of danger , he wrote , “ there is not much difference between horse - riding and ecstasy . ”
In an interview with the BBC , Professor Nutt said that the problem was not his behavior but that Mr. Brown ’s government had decided to increase penalties for the sale of cannabis and ecstasy , despite evidence that both drugs are less harmful than alcohol and tobacco .
Professor Nutt claimed that “ this is the first government that has ever , in the history of the Misuse of Drugs Act , gone against the advice of its scientific panel . ”
Government ministers , he charged , “ are making scientific decisions before they have even consulted with their experts . ”
Pressed to accept that his role as a scientific advisor was merely to present evidence to the politicians who then set policy , Professor Nutt suggested that perhaps the solution was to change the equation and remove politics from the process entirely .
He told the BBC that drug policy should be set the same way interest rates are set , by experts :
[ T ] here are some aspects of science which should not be subject to petty party politics and I think the drug laws are one of them . [… ]
With drugs particularly we have to educate the public about the harms of drugs , we have to give a very clear message which is based in science , and if we do n’t do that , we ’re wasting our time .
So there ’s no point in having drugs laws which are meaningless or arbitrary — just because politicians find it useful and expedient occasionally to come down so - called hard on drugs — that ’s undermining the whole purpose of the drugs laws .
And just as we took out from party politics the regulation of interest rates and gave that to the Bank of England , surely what we should be doing regarding drugs laws is taking them out of party politics , setting up an independent committee that decides on drug harms , ranks drugs … and then puts that into legislation .
In an interview with Britain ’s Channel 4 News on Monday , Les King another member of the advisory panel who quit in protest after Professor Nutt was forced out , agreed .
Mr. King said :
Drugs classification has become a political football , because the Home Office is taking more recognition of what it thinks public opinion is than the scientific advice it receives from the advisory council .
I do n’t necessarily think that the public is always well - informed , and I ’m not suggesting that the government is always taking a consensus view on public opinion , but rather certain sections of the public , and certain sections of the public view represented by certain sections of the media .
On Monday , Professor Nutt told Nature.com :
BERLIN — Tucked away in one of Germany ’s finest wine regions close to the border with Luxembourg is the Büchel Air Base .
Its perimeter is heavily guarded by the German Luftwaffe , or air force .
And no wonder .
Up to 20 nuclear weapons are stored in underground vaults , all in the custody of the 702nd Munitions Support Squadron , a U.S. Air Force unit , according to security experts .
No U.S. , NATO or German Defense Ministry official will confirm or deny the existence of these weapons — at least not on the record — even though President Barack Obama has pledged to reduce and even rid the world of nuclear arms .
“ This issue is highly classified information , ” said a U.S. diplomat .
“ We simply do not discuss it .
You can ask questions and raise hypothetical scenarios , but I will circumvent them . ”
But Germany ’s new foreign minister , Guido Westerwelle , has taken a different view on the continuing presence of these weapons on German soil .
In a bid to distinguish himself as quickly as possible in his new job , he called Saturday — the day Chancellor Angela Merkel clinched an accord with her new coalition partners , the Free Democrats — “ for a country free of nuclear weapons . ”
But he refrained from saying where the weapons were located .
On the face of it , no issue could be better suited to Mr. Westerwelle who , as leader of the Free Democrats , has made this his foreign policy priority ( and not Russia or Afghanistan ) .
It is popular with a public staunchly opposed to nuclear weapons .
All Mr. Westerwelle has to do , with support from Mrs. Merkel , is to ask the United States to remove the weapons when he visits the United States next month , days after Mrs. Merkel holds talks in Washington .
And if Mr. Obama is true to his word , there is no reason why the United States could not take them out , as it has quietly done over the past few years from other locations in Germany and other West European countries belonging to NATO , according to German defense experts .
The strike is causing inconvenience to the passengers
India 's second - largest private airline Jet Airways has cancelled nearly 120 flights , following a protest by hundreds of pilots who reported sick .
At least 35 flights from the financial capital Mumbai and 18 flights from Delhi have been cancelled .
Hundreds of passengers have been stranded at various airports , leading to angry confrontations .
The pilots are protesting against the dismissal of two senior pilots last month by the airline .
The pilots ' union , the National Aviator 's Guild , has been demanding the reinstatement of the pilots .
" Jet Airways has been in a conciliation process with the pilots .
The Regional Labour Commissioner had categorically stated that any strike by pilots during this ( period ) would be deemed an illegal act , " news agency Reuters quoted from a statement issued by the airline .
" Regrettably , a section of the pilots has resorted to a simulated strike by reporting sick , " it said .
The strike would " damage the airline 's operations and inconvenience the travelling public " , the statement added .
A spokesman for the pilots ' union said the protest would continue until their demand was met .
" All we want is that they give us in writing that the two sacked pilots will be reinstated .
Management also has some responsibility in meeting us half - way , " Reuters quoted spokesman Girish Kaushik as saying .
The strike has led to the cancellation of flights from airports across India .
The airline cancelled at least six flights from the southern city of Madras and four from Calcutta in the east .
The airline has been mired in controversies in recent months .
Last year , it announced plans to lay off 1,900 staff to cut costs .
But after days of protests by employees , the government persuaded the airline to take them back .
India 's once - booming aviation sector has been hard hit by soaring costs , mainly due to global fuel - price rises .

Apple has won a landmark victory against Mac clone maker Psystar , though it does n't spell doom for the rest of the hackintosh industry just yet .
US District Judge William Alsup ruled late last Friday that Psystar had violated Apple 's copyrights when distributing Mac OS X with its machines , and that the company was also in violation of the anti-circumvention provisions in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
As a result , Judge Alsup dismissed Psystar 's counterclaims and ruled in favor of Apple , but Apple still has a long road ahead if wants to shut down other hackintoshers .
The legal battle between Apple and Psystar began more than a year ago in July of 2008 , several months after Psystar introduced its first bargain - basement Mac clone for $ 399 that could run Mac OS X 10.5 ( Leopard ) .
Since then , the legal fight has been a drama - filled soap opera — Psystar 's original countersuit was thrown out completely , followed by a bankruptcy filing that revealed that Psystar owed its law firm more than $ 88,000 .
In July of 2009 , Psystar changed its mind on the whole bankruptcy angle — which Apple believed was a stall tactic to begin with — and switched to Jammie Thomas lawyer Kiwi Camara .
All the while , Psystar has been selling its products and even marketing new ones , such as an Xserve clone and an EFI tool meant to help individual users put Mac OS X on their hacktintoshes ( a tool met with much skepticism by the Internet at large ) .
Clearly , the company had confidence enough to poke the Apple fate bear , but that confidence was apparently misplaced .
In his Friday ruling , Judge Alsup upheld Apple 's claims that Psystar was guilty of copyright infringement .
This is in part due to the restrictions the Mac maker has in place ( and Psystar circumvented ) that prevent Mac OS X from being installed on non-Apple PCs .
Judge Alsup did note that Psystar did n't specifically modify Mac OS X , but instead installed the circumventing software on its own machines sold with the operating system .
Still , this action constituted " facilitation of circumvention " and was a violation of Section 1201 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the DMCA .
Additionally , Psystar had argued that it was protected by the doctrine of first sale ( which says the original creator can't decide what someone does with a product after it was sold the first time ) , but Judge Alsup did n't buy it .
" [ First - sale doctrine ] provides immunity only when copies are ' lawfully made . '
The copies at issue here were not lawfully manufactured with the authorization of the copyright owner , " Alsup wrote .
( Even though Psystar includes an original Mac OS X DVD with every machine , the version of OS X installed on the computers is not the same version on the DVD . )
Although Alsup handed Apple a major victory in this fight , it 's not entirely over — for Psystar or the rest of the industry .
Apple had made other claims against Psystar — including breach of contract , trademark infringement , trademark dilution , and unfair competition — that were not addressed in this particular ruling and will " remain for trial . "
The two companies are scheduled to hold briefings through the month of November to discuss what , if any , relief ( * bling bling * )
Apple may get as a result of the ruling , and a final hearing will be held on December 14 .
Psystar has a ray of hope left in this case , but the ruling 's language indicates that the clone maker 's success on the remaining claims is unlikely .
Psystar did not respond to our request for comment , but the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's Fred von Lohmann does n't think this is necessarily a death blow to the hackintosh industry as a whole .
" While the ruling is a serious setback for Psystar , I do n't see it having much impact beyond the facts of that case , " von Lohmann told Ars .
" On a number of important points , the outcome was driven by Psystar - specific factors , such as Psystar forfeiting one of their strongest defenses by failing to plead it in time .
Moreover , my understanding is that the commercial ' hackintosh ' industry has moved on to selling software that enables the user to bring their own PC and OS X DVD , rather than selling a pre-installed solution like the one at issue in the ruling . "
Indeed , that 's the angle Psystar is going for with its aforementioned EFI bootloader tool that it 's selling for $ 50 .
Although various parties have been critical of the software , it seems that this is where the industry might focus once the Psystar case is over .
Another company called EFi-X attempted to market a similar booatloader that would enable individual users to install OS X on their PCs ( UPDATE : a reader pointed out that EFi - X's new US distributor is ExpressHD ) .
For now , other hackintosh enthusiasts may want to turn to the open source world to get their fix , but we may soon see more companies trying to sell software that makes DIY hackintoshes easier .
Simon Phipps of Sun Microsystems recently proposed that the Open Source Initiative ( OSI ) formalise a scorecard " which articulates a holistic vision of software freedom against which businesses can be benchmarked , " to determine whether a company is justified in describing itself as open source .
The logic for such a proposal is that " open source " has become a victim of its own success .
As Phipps observes " ... having businesses identify ' open source ' purely on the basis of one ' input ' - using an OSI - approved licence - is no longer adequate , because the success of the open source approach has led so many different companies to want to exploit the name . "
Free and open source software is about more than a licence , and although there are clear differences in emphasis between free software , as represented by the Free Software Foundation , and open source , as represented by the Open Source Initiative , the differences on the ground are often less than some of the protagonists would have you believe .
A social movement The Free Software movement emerged from Richard Stallman 's project to create a a UNIX - like free operating system in September 1983 .
' Open Source ' emerged much later , in 1998 , after Linux and free software had begun to amass a substantial following among users and developers and had made significant inroads into the computer industry .
Some saw ' open source ' as a radical departure from the objectives of free software , but many saw it as a rebranding which made it easier to sell free software to a business audience , shorn of the political trimmings that gave the free software movment its edginess .
The Open Source Definition took its substance from the Debian Free Software Guidelines .
" Open source is a development methodology ; free software is a social movement , " wrote Stallman .
" For the free software movement , free software is an ethical imperative , because only free software respects the users ' freedom .
By contrast , the philosophy of open source considers issues in terms of how to make software ' better ' , " which for Stallman , is an incidental by - product and a side issue .
" It 's not about money " , Stallman has said , " it 's about freedom .
If you think it 's about money you 've missed the point .
I want to use a computer in freedom , to cooperate , to not be restricted or prohibited from sharing .
The GNU / Linux system is catching on somewhat more now . "
He continued : " The system is becoming popular for practical reasons .
It 's a good system .
The danger is people will like it because it 's practical and it will become popular without anyone having the vaguest idea of the ideals behind it , which would be an ironic way of failing . "
Lip service
Obviously , this is a view that does n't cut much ice with many business people , but has helped to define what is meant by both open source and free software to its primary practitioners - the developers who have chosen to contribute their code .
Whether a project defines itself as ' open source ' or as ' free software ' is largely political .
Developers on free and open source projects may or may not care about the ins and outs of which licence is used or the issues that surround that choice , but are likely to care that the code remains free for others to use , improve or re-use .
In the real world , there is often very little difference and many developers use the terms interchangeably , but the definitions matter - which is why the Free Software Foundation has invested so much effort in clarifying the definition of " Free Software " .
What is meant by " Open Source " is less clear , although it is apparent that open source has become a successful model for promoting software and an increasing number of parties want a piece of the action - lip service is paid to the concept of " open source " although the reasons why it works are sometimes forgotten .
Software development companies choose to be " open source " because it brings advantages , existing software libraries and tools , economies of scale , reduced costs , collaborative potential and input from independent developers , but most of these advantages are predicated on the trust and good will of the developers .
A company that sees open source as the fast route to quick riches still has to take its developers with it .
The collaborative trick
The popularity of Open Source as a business model is founded on the success of GNU / Linux among the hardware companies , who had their fingers burnt with the fracturing of Unix and " open " standards during the eighties and nineties .
Solaris was n't like Irix , which was n't like HPUX , AIX or Tru64 , and none of them necessarily played well together ...
Unix had been touted as the universal operating system , and each of these companies was pouring huge resources into developing proprietary versions of the same operating system at the expense of the hardware , services and userland software that were their core business .
Linux offered something different , a ready made developer community that had formed around the software , and a collaborative philosophy which owed much to the framework of the GPL ( GNU General Public Licence ) .
Not only did the GPL protect free software and keep it free , but it opened the door for a community to form around the software in the knowledge that contributions were fed back into the original body of code .
The contributors owned the copyright to the bits of code they wrote , and willingly contributed their work under a common licence , but nobody owned the Linux kernel .
The companies that have generated revenue by selling Linux , Red Hat , Novell , IBM or HP do not own the code .
The open source development model worked to the advantage of the corporate interests that later became central to the push of GNU / Linux into the enterprise , and they pushed their own enterprise features into the code , sharing their investment with rivals in the knowledge that what they gave would come back to them in other ways .
Contributing to Linux removed the cost and liability of developing a proprietary alternative from scratch .
Linux replaced proprietary UNIX because the community guaranteed the independence of the code , and Linux guaranteed freedom from the factionalism that had formed around UNIX .
Free and open source software was good for business , the licence and the community worked for everybody , and it made sense to apply the model to other areas of the enterprise .
A sense of belonging Phipps suggests a checklist of the characteristics that would allow a project or business to describe itself as bona fide open source .
These include : - Is the licence OSI - approved ? -
Is the copyright under diverse control ? -
Is the community governance open ? -
Are external interfaces and formats standards compliant ? -
Does your community operate under a patent peace arrangement ? -
Are trademarks community controlled ?
To some of the more recent start - ups who describe themselves as " open source " some of these notions are problematic , because as they see it , they inhibit companies ' ability to ' proprietise ' and ' monetise ' the developers and the code , which misses the point that ' open source ' is as much about community and ownership as it is about the visibility of code .
Earlier tonight at a press event in San Francisco , Valve unveiled a brand new multiplayer ( versus ) mode to be included in Left 4 Dead 2 .
Scavenge is the name of the game ; and if you thought your L4D experiences were frantic before , well .. you had every right to , it ’s not like you knew about this yet .
Onward to the details !
Scavenge has one team play as the four survivors scrambling to collect gas cans from various spots in a small location in an effort fuel up a generator before a two - minute timer hits zero .
There are 16 cans total and 20 seconds are added to the clock for each one that ’s successfully retrieved .
Think timed , goal - oriented Survival mode with an end point that is n’t necessarily your death–though that ’s certainly one of the few conclusions .
That ’s where the other team of up to four comes in .
In control of Special Infected and backed by relentless zombie hordes , the group must do their best to stop the cans from reaching the goal .
Two of the new Specials announced have great advantages in the mode : Spitters can set dropped cans on fire , and Jockeys can leap onto the shoulders of a survivor , directing them away from there intended destination .
That ’s basically it !
Best two - of - of - three with half time ’s where teams switch sides .
Valve has confirmed that all six L4D2 campaigns have their own unique Scavenge map , nice .
Left 4 Dead 2 will hit shelves PC and Xbox 360 November 17 , and it sounds like it ’ll be packing a helluva lot more content than the first game offered upon release .
Scott Wright was fixing the emergency brake on an old Cadillac in a parking lot near Willow Glen last year when the San Jose police rolled up .
Within minutes , he had been shot with a Taser and beaten with batons , breaking his arm .
The cause of the trouble ?
Wright reached into his van to wash his greasy hands .
Police said they feared he was going for a weapon , but no weapon was found .
Wright was charged with resisting arrest , but the district attorney dismissed the case before it got to trial .
What happened to Wright is no isolated event .
Hundreds of times a year interactions between San Jose police and residents where no serious crime has occurred escalate into violence .
Many times the reason for the encounter is as innocuous as jaywalking , missing bike head lamps , or failing to signal a turn .
But often , as the incidents develop , police determine the suspect is uncooperative and potentially violent and strike the first blow .
While many of those incidents raise questions about whether the police response was excessive , the department almost always dismisses such complaints about its behavior and limits public scrutiny of the cases , moves that tend to heighten distrust of the department , particularly in minority communities .
Last week , the Mercury News disclosed the existence of a cell phone video documenting one such confrontation between police wielding batons and a Taser and college student Phuong Ho , who police said was resisting their instructions .
It is rare for such a video to come to light , but allegations of excessive force are far from uncommon .
In recent months the Mercury News has reviewed 206 court cases in which the most serious charge against the defendant was a violation of California Penal Code section 148 , the misdemeanor crime of resisting arrest or delaying or obstructing a police officer .
Of those , 145 — 70 percent of the cases — involved the use of force by officers .
The review was launched following the April disclosure by the newspaper that San Jose charges far more people with resisting arrest , compared with its population , than any other major California city , and that a disproportionate number of those charged are Latino residents .
State and county statistics show San Jose police charge people with resisting arrest , as the primary charge , three times a day on average .
Police chief Rob Davis and other officials defend the department practices and say their officers are trained to show restraint .
They caution that comparisons with other communities can be misleading .
The review included more than half of the San Jose police court cases filed last year in which resisting arrest was the primary criminal charge .
The examination of those cases — together with a review of civil lawsuits and interviews with police , suspects , their lawyers and national experts on police practices — provides the most detailed public portrait of the San Jose police use of force ever developed .
It omitted what may be the most egregious cases — those where the district attorney refuses to file charges requested by the police .
Such cases are closed to public scrutiny .
The Mercury News review also found :
Concern from experts
There is no widely used and uniform method of publicly reporting incidents of police force , and no state agency requires them to be reported , preventing easy comparisons to other departments .
But outside experts who reviewed a dozen troubling cases selected by the Mercury News expressed alarm at the pattern they saw .
“ In almost all of them , there is an underlying questionable or even illegal activity , ” said Sam Walker , a criminologist at the University of Nebraska and the author of 11 books on policing , criminal justice history and policy , and civil liberties .
Penny Harrington , the former police chief of Portland , Ore. , said it is important to remember that many people confronted by police are on drugs or alcohol , or have mental illnesses , conditions that may be spurring them to react with violence toward law enforcement .
But Harrington added : “ If a person is going to resist arrest it is usually for something very serious that they will go to prison for . ”
Given the large number of incidents in San Jose where the only crime is resisting arrest , or resisting arrest together with minor crimes such as traffic violations , “ then I would be very concerned . ”
San Jose police said they would not respond to questions about individual cases , even those already closed .
But former Santa Clara County prosecutor Terry Bowman , who is representing one of the officers in the Phuong Ho case , said the cases she reviewed for the newspaper showed officers engaged in an “ evenhanded attempt to get suspects to toe the line . ”
She said statistics showing high numbers of resisting arrest cases reveal nothing more than “ good public safety - based law enforcement . ”
The police accounts of individual cases included in this article were drawn from statements in court cases .
San Jose police have historically made little information available about cases in which officers use force .
Last month , at the urging of police , the City Council rejected the proposal by a community task force that police disclose the reports they prepare documenting each case in which force is used .
At that same meeting , the council also suspended production of an annual statistical report about instances in which force is used ; the police complained that report , which was last released in the summer of 2008 , could be misleading to the public .
Police defend actions
Police officials say their officers use force only when they must , to protect themselves and others in complex situations that can quickly turn violent .
They say that their internal reviews establish that San Jose police act with restraint , and cite the low number of citizen complaints about excessive force .
And police captain Gary Kirby told a City Council committee this year that after reviewing more than 100 resisting arrest cases from the past two years , he came to a clear conclusion :
There is no problem .
“ We are very proud to have one of the most professional departments in the country , ” said Police Chief Davis .
But , he added , “ our officers are given an immense amount of power .
It is important for us to make sure that our officers are using that power appropriately .
We can always continue to improve . ”
San Jose police recruits spend more than 100 hours at the academy getting extensive training about using force .
Once on the job , they get refresher courses every two years .
As part of the refresher , each officer uses a force options simulator , a kind of computer game that tests officers in how quickly , and how severely , to use force in situations mirroring life on the street .
The training educates officers in federal and state laws that require them to limit use of force to what is reasonable to gain control of a situation and accomplish an arrest if the officer has probable cause to believe the suspect committed a crime .
That standard is intentionally loose , depending on the facts of a situation :
How severe is the crime ?
How big and strong is the suspect ?
What is the suspect ’s history ?
San Jose local policies further restricts officers .
They are expected to first use verbal warnings , and persuasion , unless that appears ineffective .
“ Our basic philosophy is , if you need to use force to effect an arrest , then you use the lowest use of force you can , ” Davis said .
The department already is initiating a number of steps to respond to community unrest stemming from the high rate of street arrests on discretionary crimes .
Supervision and training have been stepped up , and the department has volunteered to be the first in the country to test a new commercial device officers would wear that records sound and visual images from encounters .
But on the street , officers are still left to make split - second decisions regarding how much force is reasonable , and often , what ’s reasonable is in the eye of the beholder .
Resisting arrest allegations , more than many other crimes , hang on the word of police officers against the word of those they ’ve taken into custody .
The Scott Wright incident , like many of those reviewed by the Mercury News , shows just how much those perspectives can vary .
Very different accounts
When four police officers responded to a report of potential car burglars on Shadow Dance Drive near Willow Glen , they found Wright and Mark Schleicher standing in a parking area next to Schleicher ’s car .
The officers separated and questioned the two men .
Wright told the officers he wanted to wash his hands , and said later that he believed one officer shrugged permission .
In the police version , the officer told Wright not to reach inside the van , and Wright became combative , telling an officer he would “ kick your ass ” if the officer touched him .
Whatever was said , as Wright reached into the van , an officer struck and broke his left arm with a baton .
Wright fell inside his van .
As he flailed , he was hit with batons several more times .
One officer used a Taser on him .
Police say the force was justified because Wright could have been reaching for a weapon .
After the violence ended , police arrested Wright and sought charges of assaulting the police and resisting arrest .
Prosecutors declined the assault charges , and filed only a charge of resisting arrest .
Before the date for trial , Wright ’s lawyer asked the judge to review internal police department records of three officers to explore any history of using excessive force or making false statements .
After conducting the review , the judge ruled that records in at least one of the officer ’s past merited disclosure .
The charges were later dropped , court records show , “ in the interests of justice . ”
Tracking the arrests
Across the country , resisting arrest charges have raised concerns inside and outside police departments , because of allegations that they have been misused by officers to justify unwarranted force .
As a result , and often in response to legal challenges , cities from Schenectady , N.Y. , to Los Angeles closely monitor cases where such charges are filed .
“ I think such reviews are a best practice now , ” said Gerald Chaleff , police administrator for the LAPD , which has had its supervisors sign off on all such busts since the department agreed to federal oversight after an officer corruption scandal nine years ago .
“ A department needs to have the confidence of the community it is policing . ”
Chief Davis and other police officials present for an October interview said the department will now begin tracking incidents of resisting arrest .
The officials said the new policy did not suggest the department sees any problem with how it handles resisting arrest charges .
Under California law , “ resisting arrest ” is something of a misnomer — the charge is for resisting or interfering with an officer .
“ Some people have a problem with authority and that ’s OK , ” said Bowman , the frequent lawyer for police .
“ But that does n’t mean that you have the right to be a problem for authority . ”
On some occasions the charges develop after officers wade into fights or respond to domestic violence or other potentially hazardous situations .
But on many other occasions reviewed by the Mercury News , the violent confrontations seem to develop almost out of nowhere .
Seven began as pedestrian incidents such as jaywalking .
Eleven sprang from traffic stops for minor infractions , such as burned - out license plate lights .
In eight cases where force was used , the incidents began with officers spotting riders on bikes without head lamps .
In many cases included in the newspaper review , minor incidents turned violent after suspects challenged officers ’ authority .
In 30 of the cases , police reports mention the suspects mouthing off before force was used .
In 19 of the cases , officers detail the use of a specific four - letter word .
There is a well - known term for charges brought against suspects whose arrests follow defiance by the suspects , which is not in itself illegal , said Paul Chevigny , a New York University law professor and author of books on police force :
Their real crime , he said , is known as “ contempt of cop . ”
Consider the example of Daniel Duran , who mouthed off as he and his fiance , Cindy Guizar , came upon a group of officers trying to calm a 2005 street disturbance in the downtown San Jose entertainment zone .
“ It was not a smart thing to do , ” said his attorney , Sharonrose Cannistraci , even if it was not illegal .
Duran and Guizar went inside a bar and were seated on a couch when five officers came inside .
One grabbed Duran , according to federal court documents .
Before it was over , both Duran and his fiance were on the ground , and officers had fired their Taser guns repeatedly .
Guizar was charged with assaulting the police and resisting arrest , charges that were later dismissed .
Duran was charged with being drunk in public .
That charge was also dismissed in return for his guilty plea to the misdemeanor crime of disturbing the peace .
In 2006 , Duran and Guizar filed a federal civil rights complaint against the city .
Duran ’s attorney , Cannistraci , is a former deputy district attorney who describes herself as “ very pro law enforcement .
But I ’ll take a case when officers clearly step over the line .
And in this case , what happened was clearly wrong . ”
In 2007 the city paid $ 120,000 to settle the lawsuit .
‘ Pretext ’ stops
Sometimes , minor incidents turn violent when police pull over suspects they actually want to question for more serious reasons — gang members or people they have encountered in the past .
Such “ pretext ” stops are legal , as long as the minor transgressions exist .
And San Jose police say the stops give them a chance at catching people with outstanding warrants , drugs or weapons .
These stops have a high potential to end in force , both because the suspect may be belligerent and because , as NYU ’s Chevigny notes , police are more likely to use extreme force against unsympathetic suspects .
In the case of Danny Piña , whom police identified as a gang member , the suspect suffered a broken nose and dislocated arm in an incident that began when police stopped him last April near his house because his bike was missing a headlamp .
Police say Piña resisted being detained .
But neighbors heard Piña asking “ Why did you hit me in the head ? ” and “ Why did you punch me ? , ” according to police reports — questions that left outside experts wondering whether Piña was indeed resisting arrest .
The district attorney declined to file charges against Piña .
Citizen complaints about force
Police officials cite the low number of complaints over excess force as evidence that officers do their difficult job well .
But community groups say San Jose discourages aggrieved citizens from complaining .
A 2007 Santa Clara County civil grand jury report cited widespread community concern about racial profiling and other issues , stating : “ A number of citizens do not have the confidence to report perceived officer misconduct . ”
Michael Morgan says that police tried to intimidate him out of filing a claim after they arrested him in 2006 .
The confrontation began when Morgan was stopped for not having a front license plate , and police indicated to him they suspected him of drug use .
It turned rough , with Morgan claiming police manhandling aggravated a back injury , and Morgan told police he intended to file a complaint .
Before Morgan was released from custody , he said , the arresting officer told him : “ If you think you still want to file that complaint , you can go ahead and try all you want . ”
His attorney , Robert R. Powell , said his client “ understood he was being threatened with further harassment if he pursued a complaint . ”
The criminal charges were dropped after a drug test came back negative .
Morgan then filed a complaint that was resolved last October , when the city agreed to pay him $ 20,000 .
Critics say complaints also are discouraged by how routinely the city rejects them .
The city ’s failure to sustain a single complaint of excess force in 2008 was unusual , but not by much ; in 2007 , when 117 complaints also were filed , the department sustained two cases , according to the Independent Police Auditor .
A complaint is sustained when the department determines it is more likely than not that excess force was used .
A U.S. Department of Justice study found large departments — those with more than 100 officers — sustain on average about 8 percent of citizen complaints of excess force .
Nebraska professor
Walker said of the city ’s failure to sustain a single complaint in 2008 : “ It raises a red flag .
There are red flags when you see sustained rates of 5 percent .
Something like 12 to 14 percent is very common .
When you see zero , there is a problem . ”

Dell will release its new super slim laptop , the Adamo XPS which is 1 cm thick .
The release date , price and specs are not disclosed by dell yet .
Dell is only teasing with pictures of this awesome machine .
Mind you that this laptop will be thinner than MacBookAir whose thickness varies from 0.4-1.94 cm .
The main challenge for dell is to squeeze a long - lasting battery into this thin space which is very difficult .
Of course , this product will be very expensive but what ’s the point of buying when you do n’t get a good battery time .
I think a battery time of at least 6 hours at max use will go good with this slim laptop and that will make it the most ultra portable laptop .
In the picture above , the laptop looks like a paper .
It ’s really very thin and hopefully light weight .
If dell manages to keep it under $ 1500 , it will be a good choice for portability .
Dell has not revealed any of the specs yet but hopefully it will be powerful as compared to MacBookAir .
The previous version of Adamo is 16.5 mm in thickness and has a core 2 duo processor in it .
Update : Unofficial Specs :
1.4 or 1.9 GHz dual core Intel Processor
Integrated X4500MHD graphics
4GB of DDR3 RAM
128 or 180GB SSD
13.4 inch screen size
Okay , I ’ve been working out some aspects of Dell Adamo to decide whether it will be a success or not .
A buyer needs to keep following things in mind before going for this product .
It ’s thinner than Apple ’s MacBook Air .
The previous Adamo is 16.5 mm in thickness yet provides very powerful specs .
Let ’s hope this one is more powerful .
It should have a battery time of at least 6 hours minimum to be declared as the ultimate portable machine .
It should come with Windows 7 and SSD like previous Adamo .
Basic things like Bluetooth and Webcam should not be missing .
It should weigh less than 2 Kg like previous Adamo
The price should not exceed $ 2500 at start and $ 2000 after few months .

In nearly nine months in office , President Obama has found time to meet with Hugo Chavez , Daniel Ortega and Vladimir Putin .
But this week he wo n't see the Dalai Lama , a peaceful religious leader who has long been a friend to the U.S. and an advocate of human rights for China 's six million Tibetans .
Software Design Review
" There is n't any documentation , " replied the business guy who had created the idea and written the checks to the programmer .
Queries to the programmer revealed that he was almost as ignorant of the answers to the preceding questions as his boss .
He knew that he was using Ruby on Rails and MySQL , but not how many gigabytes of data were required to produce all of the public pages of the site .
Philip eventually was able to get some good information from the hosting service 's sysadmins , e.g. , the size of the MySQL database and the amount of RAM on each virtual " slice " being used to run the HTTP servers and the RDBMS .
By chucking the virtualized model and buying the cheapest Dell pizza box server with 16 GB of RAM ( about $ 500 worth at the time ) , the amount of time required to produce a page fell from 5 - 10 minutes to no more than a few seconds .
Hosting costs were reduced from $ 1100 per month to less than $ 100 .
However , our friend was not able to recover the months of customers who had been lost due to the poor performance of the service .
What would have saved this business ?
An external design review .
The Fundamental Problem : Business People Are n't Technical
Adding to the challenge is America 's corporate self - esteem culture .
The average programmer does terrible work , producing bug - ridden code with non-existent documentation .
However , it is outside the realm of acceptable discourse for a manager to say " this is terrible work . "
Best Practices from the Most Successful Software Companies
External Design Reviewers
Bring in an outsider .
Even if you can't attract excellent technical people to work all year ever year on your boring IT systems , you can probably find an excellent software developer to come in for a few half - day review sessions .
The outsider wo n't have any bias or preconceived notions about particular divisions of your company .
The outsider wo n't have to worry about hurting anyone 's feelings by saying " You need to do X , Y , and Z . "
The design review process outlined here is described in terms of the development of a multi-user application program , such as a Web - based service for a group of collaborating employees or for a public Web site .
These services are typically backed by a relational database management system such as Oracle or SQL Server .
However , the process should be useful for any other kind of computer application where there are decision - makers , programmers , and end -users .
The process outlined here is based on the experience of the authors with more than 300 database - backed Internet application programs and roughly 60 years of experience as computer programmers .
Review Stages
Scope and tool selection , to answer the questions " What problem is being solved ? " , " Could it be solved by tweaking some existing software rather than writing new software ? " , " Are the tools selected the best choice ? "
Page flow and data model ( for a standard Internet application ) or user interface and data structures ( for a traditional application )
Post - Prototype
Pre-Launch
Post - Launch / Maintenance
Let 's go through the stages to see what questions should be answered by documentation .
Scope and Tool Selection
The design document produced at this point should answer the following questions :
What is useful to end -users and the organization about the proposed software ?
If they did n't have this proposed software , how would they solve their problem ?
What are the classes of users ?
What kinds of devices can be used to access the application , e.g. , can it be used from a mobile phone ?
How are specifications to be communicated to the development team ?
How will the development team 's plans be reviewable by decision - makers ?
What existing software comes closest to doing the job and why is n't it adequate ?
How much data will need to be stored persistently , i.e. , on a hard drive , and what kinds of queries need to be run against those data ?
How much data will need to be processed rapidly , i.e. , stored in fast memory , and what kinds of queries need to be run against those data ?
Does any computationally - intensive processing need to be performed ?
What software development tools , computer languages , and database management systems are being selected and why ?
What is the schedule and method of updating the schedule ?
Software Engineering for Internet Applications
" How are specifications to be communicated to the development team ? " is an important question .
There is nothing more wasteful than a group of skilled programmers building the wrong thing .
The data size and computational intensity questions are important for figuring out what kinds of servers will be appropriate to host the application .
Within the " software development tools " section there should be at least one paragraph on version control .
Is a standard system such as subversion or git going to be used ?
How can a programmer restore code as it existed at a previous point in time ?
Is the repository stored on a separate computer or hard drive so that it may be able to function as a backup copy ?
Can a big change be isolated from the current production line through branching ?
Page flow and data model / User interface and data structures
Conversely , an expert SQL developer can often tell whether or not the data model stores insufficient information to fulfill the requirements .
As a simple example , suppose that an electronic medical record data model has first and last names are stored in one column .
A SQL developer can glance at the table definition and observe that it wo n't be possible to produce a list of patients sorted by last name .
Page flow more or less determines the complexity of the application for end -users .
If it requires 15 steps to accomplish a task , that will be slower and require more training than if it takes 5 steps .
For a consumer - facing Internet site , a sufficiently complex page flow will almost guarantee commercial failure .
If you can't make money unless every user has an IQ over 130 and is extremely motivated to learn a complex interface , well , you can't make money .
For a non-Web application , the equivalent items to review are the user interface and the data structures in memory and on disk .
In all cases , at this point a draft development standards document should be available to review .
This lays out simple questions such as file , URL , and variable naming conventions .
It also addresses planned documentation for modules and procedures .
The development standards include how configuration variables are named and added .
Finally user input data validation and security are addressed .
This is also the stage at which procedures for internal code review should be documented .
The external design review process described here is not a substitute for continuous internal reviews .
At Google , for example , every check - in to the version control system must be reviewed by at least one other programmer .
This sounds cumbersome .
What if the change is to fix a typo in a comment ?
It gets reviewed !
But somehow Google has managed to prosper and this blog entry explains how the process is supported .
We 're not suggesting that Google 's process is right for every project , but there should be some documented internal code review process .
Post - Prototype
What has been learned from user testing and what additional tests should be performed ?
Are the development standards working or should they be modified based on the coding experience ?
Is the quality assurance strategy adequate ?
What aspects of site usage and performance are going to be tracked ?
With what tools ?
Pre-Launch
A critical set of documentation to review at this point concerns the hosting of the application .
Where are the servers ?
If colocated , how does one get physical access to them ?
What is the network layout ?
Firewall configuration ?
What is each server named and what is its IP address ?
What software does each server run and in what directories is that software located ?
What hard drives are in each server and what does each drive do ?
What single disk drive failures will bring down the application ?
( The answer to this should be none ! )
What single machine failures will bring down the application ?
( Oftentimes the RDBMS server failing will bring down the application and this is more acceptable than the cost of redundant RDBMS servers . )
If using an RDBMS it becomes critical to document the RDBMS server configuration .
A small RDBMS server might have 10 - 20 hard disk drives .
Why so many ?
Consider a single update to a table with two indices .
This requires writes to the table , index1 , index2 , and the transaction log file , i.e. , to four separate files .
If those four separate files are on four separate hard drives the four writes can be processed in parallel and database updates can proceed approximately four times as fast compared to keeping everything on one hard drive .
The four drives will need to be mirrored so that the failure of a single drive does not result in data loss or application downtime .
Now we have 8 physical disk drives on the server .
You would n't want the operating system 's day - to - day demands interfering with those of the database nor would you want the OS crashing down in the event of a hard drive failure .
So we add two more disks in a mirrored pair to support the OS .
Our minimum size server now has 10 physical disks .
The design choices for the RDBMS server have huge implications for performance , reliability , recoverability , and maintainability .
They need to be documented partly so that they can be reviewed but mostly so that the system can be maintained .
A release plan should describe how minor changes and new full releases are pushed to production .
How are changes to procedural code and SQL data models to be coordinated ?
What are the names of the development and staging servers ?
What steps must be taken and who has to sign off before what is on staging can go to production ?
What is the procedure for backing out from a new release if things are n't going well ?
Quality assurance and performance testing procedures and results should be reviewed at this point .
Given that a lot of modifications are likely to be made shortly after launch , it is important that a testing plan is in place to make sure that new bugs are n't introduced when old bugs are fixed and when new features are added .
Conformance to the development standards should be evaluated at this point .
Are file and variable names consistent ?
Are modules , procedures , and data models documented sufficiently and according to the standards ?
Post - Launch / Maintenance
A sweep through all of the earlier documents should be made to ensure consistency with the final product .
Remember that a new person coming onto the team should be able to go back to the documents produced during the Scope and Tool Selection review and figure out why custom software was built instead of adapting an existing open - source tool .
Finally , the development team should put together a writeup document that , on one Web page , explains what the application does and why it is useful , complete with screen shots so that the reader need not actually be sitting in front of the running application .
See the Writeup chapter of Software Engineering for Internet Applications for examples .
Conclusion
The cost of this process should be minimal .
All of the documents that are required for the design review are documents that should be produced in any competently executed software development effort .
The cumulative number of hours required for an external expert to conduct all five reviews suggested in this document should be roughly 100 .
With software experts available at anywhere from $ 100 to $ 300 per hour , that 's $ 10,000 to $ 30,000 in costs to guard against the following horrifyingly expensive situations :
custom software developed to solve problem where open - source solution already exists
wrong tools selected
inappropriately small , large , or complex servers selected
extra costs incurred due to overly complex data model
lost customers or user training time due to needlessly complex interface
exposure to catastrophic loss in the event of a system failure , attack by crackers , or data center destruction
insufficient documentation available for long - term maintenance and therefore enterprise is at the mercy of original developers

Reader 's Comments
In my years as a software engineer , it has always been business people that resisted the formal software engineering process .
The engineers are the ones who see and fear the complexity of major projects but business people often do not .
Perhaps your thesis ought to be that software firms run by engineers succeed due to an appreciation of these risks and hence are willing to finance the risks of mitigating them ?
Secondly , note that I did not claim that business manager are ' lazy ' or incompetent .
If one has respect for the professiona software engineeringl regiment , one should at least feign respect for the professionals who also advocate it .

" Programmers will not keep themselves honest . "
I 've seen senior , principal , and senior principal programmers who can write beautiful algorithms , construct advanced object hierarchies , and implement what many would consider to be elegantly architected solutions .
Those senior programmers will give you a perfect solution ; yet still you 'll run into issues mentioned where pages will take five minutes to render .
Confront these senior programmers with the issue , and the response will be something along the order of " what 's the problem , the solution is perfect ? " .
And because these programmers are considered experienced , management will often back them up .
There is a certain class of programmers who will keep themselves honest .
This class of programmers has had to deal with customers directly .
They have experienced the mistakes of not documenting , not testing , and writing cool , clever , elegant code instead of code that may be ugly but robust .
They will provide some documentation , but not enough that it is easily outdated .
They will test the solution , but not to the point where the tests become academic .
They will write cheap hacks into their code because they realize the end goal of a happy customer is infinitely more valuable than another page in their portfolio of a textbook perfect solution .

Remembering my control systems classes in college , there are three primary faults here : bad control module , bad sensors , and poor feedback loops .
The control module takes in data from the sensors ( feedback ) and adjusts the system 's outputs to keep it on track .
If any one of the three ( control module , sensors , feedback loops ) are faulty , the outcomes will not be as expected .
If it is an electrical system and the electricity goes out , then the system stops .
Let 's use this as an analogy for the ecommerce project in your article and map control system components to the project :
The electricity is the business person ; if the money stops , the project ends .
The control module is the programmer .
If you thought it was the business person , remember that the business person does not have any direct input control in how the system operates because they do n't login and change or refactor any of the code etc .
The feedback loop is information about how the system is performing .
In this case it would be performance data such as page generation times , responsiveness of the application to the customer , etc .
If there is no goal or vision document , then there is no ' why ' to the project .
I have central heating and cooling for a reason : so I can be comfortable in my own home during hot and cold weather .
That 's the purpose of my HVAC system , and if I did n't have that goal or purpose , then there would be no reason for me to expend the money and effort to buy and operate the system .
For the ecommerce site , the purpose may be more complex -- at its root the purpose is to make more money than is spent on developing and operating the system , what I 'll call the ' generic ' purpose ; others might call it profit .
But for that outcome to occur , the system must provide something the customers who use it actually want and are willing to pay for , what I 'll call the ' specific ' purpose .
Some people call the explanation of this specific purpose a business plan .
It 's important for the programmer to understand the purpose or business plan so they can assess their own progress in developing the system .
The better the programmer understands that purpose , the less tight the communication feedback loop between the programmer and the business person has to be .
I 'm quite willing to admit that in many cases there is no initial vision or goal ; people often putter around and end up with things like twitter and so on kind of by accident .
They start somewhere simple , and evolve based on feedback or interest without having some grand scheme or goal in mind at the beginning .
That 's OK .
Serendipity is a fine business plan if it does n't make you broke , and these days it costs very little to create online applications .
If there is no design document , spec or whatever you want to call it , for the system you 're creating ( or in the simplest case , a clearly understood goal the system must meet ) then there is no basis of measurement by which to determine whether the system needs to adjust itself , and therefore no basis for knowing when your implementation is working properly or ' done ' .
Projects that have no defined goals can't be considered failures because they have nothing to shoot for , no basis for measuring success .
They 're simply wastes of money , or jobs programs .
The system you are creating has its own goal or purpose that is separate and distinct from your business plan : the purpose or goal of my HVAC system is to maintain the temperature inside my house as close to what I have it set to as is reasonably possible .
My HVAC system does not care whether I 'm comfortable or not ; its goal is only to maintain the temperature within specified bounds .
This is where you can more easily define the boundaries around the system you 're building -- you must decouple your business purpose , goals or reasons from the technical goals or reasons that the system will embody .
The system does n't know you want to make money , and it can't tell that you 're losing money and come up with ideas for how it can adjust itself to make you happy .
The control module ( i.e. thermostat ) analyses the data coming in from its feedback loop ( s ) ( the temperature sensor or sensors ) , compares that to the ' goal ' I have given it ( maintain the ambient air temperature inside my house at 75 degrees Fahrenheit ) , and turns on , shuts off or leaves in its current state the heater or A/C depending on whether the temperature is within the bounds I set for it or , if not , whether the measured temperature is too high or too low against what I 've set it for .
The control module in our mapping is the programmer : if the programmer does n't understand the system 's technical goals ( and ideally the business plan so perhaps he or she may catch where the system 's design spec may fail to provide your business outcomes ) , or ignores the data coming in ( which is the same thing -- not knowing the goal or not seeing whether what you 're doing is leading to the goal is really the same as not having a goal ) , then there is no way for the project to be successful from a business plan perspective .
And the business person , unless they themselves are technical , will have no chance of figuring out what needs to be done or why things are n't working the way they want .
So , to recap :
If the control module is faulty ( not appropriate for the task at hand , ignoring the feedback inputs , etc. ) , or the feedback loops are bad ( the data is being corrupted between the sensors and the control module ) , or the sensors are faulty or not appropriate to the data collection task ( they are collecting stock prices instead of temperature readings ) , then it's hard to understand how you can possibly have a successful business outcome .
Of course , having your system work as you specified does n't mean your business idea will actually make you money , but that 's not the system 's problem .
And if you cannot establish the parameters the technical system itself must meet , then it is an open - ended project that cannot succeed technically except by sheer luck or because you have a programmer smart enough and self - constrained enough who will figure out what the system 's technical goals need to be as they do the work .
Keep in mind that this is only a thought experiment , a way to model the dynamics of the project to provide insight into where the issues might be .
If you lose sight of the fact that the programmer , bill payer and possibly other ' parts ' of this system are human beings and not machines or parts of a machine then you will likely treat your programmers and other people as machines and the means to your ends instead of as human beings .

Great article , could n't agree more .
As a software architect with about 30 years ' experience in the field , I also have spent untold hours " nagging " developers and architects alike to document not only their design decisions , but their code !
Software development should be easy , but this article is another of many showing how cutting corners leads to disaster .
Cutting corners almost * always * lowers value and ROI for software projects .
In my own most recent experience , inside one of the largest and ( formerly ) most successful online advertising networks , I saw at close hand the truly epic failures of a company - wide initiative to refresh the entire adserving platform ( legacy UNIX to .NET ) .
This involved a technology division of at least some 150 folks .
Management made all the * classic * software development mistakes : hiring outside consultants to do the job , for instance ; having * way * too few architects , for another .
They soldiered on through YEARS of poor designs , missed dates , browbeaten teams , fired consultants , and literally tens of millions of dollars burned into thin air .
I personally expended most of my political capital trying to get them to do the right thing , in as many ways as I knew how .
Now this company , recently worth billions of dollars , is having its workforce slashed and is reduced to a mere shadow of its former self .
How did this happen ?
A total disregard for creating and fostering any type of software engineering culture .
REAMS of requirements were drawn up -- but no one really understood them .
Designs were presented -- but they were n't conceptually coherent and did n't work .
Project plans were constructed , time and time again -- but they almost never delivered on their commitments .
Software development was started and re-started -- but it was almost always late , and much of it had to be re-written .
And so on .
Classic .
And * why * did this happen ?
There was a management culture of arrogance , especially on the technical side .
One simply cannot labor on for so many years without asking the simple question : " why could we not deliver on our commitments ? "
These hard questions * are * asked , as Phil points out , in companies like the Microsofts , the Googles , the Amazons , where the leadership is steeped in technical knowledge and cannot have the wool pulled over their eyes .
Personally , I 'm proud of my record of success on projects : I have learned a lot of lessons from a lot of great folks .
I lead teams with relative ease to meet committed dates , with high - quality , well factored , scalable , maintainable , monitorable and deployable software solutions .
To add to the points made by this article , it 's a simple matter of discipline : knowing WHAT to pay attention to , namely all the elements of a software lifecycle and the value it creates for the business .
The entire team must be clear on requirements .
The design must be simple and justified against its alternatives .
An appropriate level of test suites must prove out that the requirements have been met .
The software must be easy to deploy , and when running it should be easy to monitor that it is , indeed , running correctly .
All these elements of software discipline are borne out of a single , simple , focused practice : the virtuous cycle of continuous improvement .
It 's OK to fail , once ; but then one must stop and ask a sincere " why , " decide how to prevent it in the future , and incorporate this literally into the DNA of the technology teams via an updated software process .
Likewise , we want to also ask why we succeed and incorporate that as well .
The result is that the team or organization always continues to get better and better with time .
So , an emphatic " yes ! " to this article : most software is horribly written , and , unlike hardware design ( circuit boards , bridges , etc ) , the creation of software machines is largely practiced as more of a black art than a science .
The one point I would take issue with is that " programmers will not keep themselves honest . "
While I agree with the result -- poor quality software -- most software developers really do want to do the right thing .
It 's just that they are not given the proper guidance on * how* to do it .
Most developers are happy if not eager to understand how to frame , design , develop , and deploy software solutions that deliver real value to the business .
In the end , if your software project is having trouble , it 's likely you may need more and better architects .
No one would attempt to build a house of any note without an architect - imagine telling master bricklayers , carpenters , and plumbers to " just do it " without first drawing up detailed plans .
It 's the same with software .
In the end , you have to measure yourself by your results .

South African athlete Caster Semenya ( shown here holding a gold medal she 's just won ) has been the subject of gender - related cheating allegations .
She was forced to take a gender test ( perhaps more accurately , a " sex test " ) , and the results have been released : Semenya is intersexed .
For context : we 're not just talking about deeply personal medical news becoming very public world news , we 're talking about that happening before the person involved was informed or counseled on the results .
And , she had no option to keep the very private information private .
Mainstream news coverage , within South Africa and worldwide , has reflected ignorance , and worse .
Here 's a snip from a news article that describes her with the derogatory term " hermaphrodite " :
The athletics governing body is also expected to advise her to have surgery to fix the potentially deadly condition , the paper reported .
The IAAF would not comment on the results that have yet to be released .
You stay classy , New York Daily News .
Blogger Pam of Pam's House Blend , where I 'm reading this news , says ,
Someone please tell me how the f*ck her natural condition — which is that of a superb physical athlete — is deadly ?
Thankfully Semenya wants no part of this .
Update : Some BB commenters have pointed out that the " potentially deadly condition " of which they they speak may be the belief that having male sexual organs " embedded " within the body means elevated cancer risk in intersexed people .
Another BB commenter who says they 're an intersexed person argues the purported risk is a ruse to pressure intersexed people towards altering themselves through surgery .
Semenya , who identifies as female , says ,
" God made me the way I am and I accept myself .
I am who I am and I 'm proud of myself , " she told [ South Africa's ]
You Magazine , which ran a photo spread .
" I do n't want to talk about the tests .
I 'm not even thinking about them . "

This is the final and most important phase of roasting .
The whole house will be smelling like glorious juicy turkey , family members that you have n't seen since last year will be chewing your ear off , there 'll be 15 other dishes being cooked at the same time , and so it 's easy to get distracted .
If you take the bird out too soon , you 'll be serving undercooked turkey .
Take it out too late , and everything will be dry and tough .
In order to hit it just right , get yourself a meat thermometer and check the temperature of the turkey every 15 minutes during the final phase of cooking .
The goal is to get the turkey to reach 165 degrees in the thickest section of the thigh .
Plunge the meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh and take a temperature reading .
Try not to have the tip of the thermometer touching the turkey bone , but just nestled deep inside the meet .
While you 're getting the temperature of the turkey to hit its mark , you 're also trying to brown and crisp the skin .
With the foil removed , this will happen rather quickly .
You 've got only a few variables to manipulate .
Basically , there 's the foil covering , the temperature of the oven and the time you cook the turkey for .
Thus , it becomes a balancing act between these three things in order to reach the final perfectly cooked turkey .
If the skin is browning too quickly , but the meat is still less than 165 degrees , cover the turkey in foil to slow the crisping process .
If the meat reaches 165 degrees before the skin crisps to your liking , remove the foil , crank the oven up to 400 degrees , and take the turkey out as soon as the skin crisps up , so as not to overcook the turkey .
If all has gone to plan , after 3 hours of cooking , the turkey should be fairly close to 165 degrees in the thigh already , and so that final 30 - 45 minutes of foil - less roasting should really just be to crisp the skin , baste the bird more often , and impart that final savory roasted flavor onto the flavor profile .
Supporters make the point that Gary McKinnon has Asperger 's syndrome Computer hacker Gary McKinnon faces being tried in the US after requests to block his extradition were refused , the Home Office has confirmed .
Home Secretary Alan Johnson told Mr McKinnon 's family he could not block the move on medical grounds .
Glasgow - born Mr McKinnon , 43 , who has Asperger 's syndrome , is accused of breaking into US military computers .
He says he was seeking UFO evidence .
Now of Wood Green , north London , he faces 60 years in prison if convicted .
Mr Johnson said he had carefully considered the representations but had concluded that sending Mr McKinnon to the US would not breach his human rights .
As such , he had no discretion to block the extradition .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Due to legitimate concerns over Mr McKinnon 's health , we have sought and received assurances from the United States authorities that his needs will be met , " he said .
Mr McKinnon admits hacking into 97 US government computers , including Nasa 's and Pentagon's , during 2001 and 2002 .
He has told the BBC he was on a " moral crusade " to prove US intelligence had found an alien craft run on clean fuel .
His mother Janis Sharp told the BBC she was " devastated " by the news and that her son had reacted " very badly " .
" It 's a disgusting decision .
Gary has been in a heightened state of terror for almost eight years .
" To force a peaceful , vulnerable , misguided UFO fanatic like Gary thousands of miles away from his much - needed support network is barbaric , " she said .
She said she was not comforted by the home secretary 's advice that her son would not be held in a " supermax " jail , which hold the highest - security prisoners .
Judicial review
Their solicitor Karen Todner said they had seven days to put a case for judicial review and that she hoped that would be heard before Christmas .
If that failed , they would take the case to the European Court of Human Rights , she added .
Mr Johnson had last month agreed to study new medical evidence before deciding on the extradition .
The High Court had previously refused permission to appeal to the Supreme Court .
Mr McKinnon has been the focus of a campaign to prevent his removal to the US .
Earlier this month , the Commons ' Home Affairs Committee said the move should be halted owing to his " precarious state of mental health " .
They concluded there was a " serious lack of equality " in the way the extradition treaty deals with UK citizens compared with US citizens .

Update 2 : Intel has given us an updated timeframe on a fixed version of its TRIM firmware .
Intel will release the new firmware by the end of November 2009 .
More info here .
Update : Some users have had issues with Intel 's TRIM firmware bricking their drives , Intel has since pulled the firmware while they figure out what 's going on .
If you 've downloaded it but have n't updated , do so at your own risk .
While we have n't had any issues on the three drives we 've updated here others have had problems .
We 'll keep you posted .
Intel 's official statement is below :
“ Yes , we have been contacted by users with issues with the firmware upgrade and are investigating .
We take all sightings and issues seriously and are working toward resolution .
We have temporarily taken down the firmware link while we investigate . ”
Welcome to the anti-climax .
After a year of talking about it , Windows 7 and TRIM are here .
How does it feel to be a TRIMionaire ?
Indilinx , as usual , was first .
After a couple of false starts , the two tier 1 Indilinx partners ( SuperTalent and OCZ ) enabled TRIM on their Barefoot SSDs ( OCZ Vertex , SuperTalent UltraDrive ) .
OCZ calls its TRIM firmware 1.40 while SuperTalent calls it 1819 .
Update : As many of you have correctly pointed out , Crucial also has an 1819 update available for its SSDs .
You can get the firmware for your drive from the links here :
Intel held off to align with the release of Windows 7 .
Last week Windows 7 officially went on sale , and today Intel is delivering on its promise : this bootable iso will enable TRIM on X25 - M G2 drives .
Only the X25 - M G2 gets TRIM , the G1 ( right ) is left in the dust .
The G1 is more resilient than the G2 when it comes to performance degradation over time since it does n't have TRIM .
Alongside TRIM there ’s one more surprise .
If you own a 160 GB X25 - M G2 , Intel boosted sequential write speeds from 80 MB / s to 100MB/s :
The 80GB drives remain unchanged unfortunately .
Intel still wo n’t tell us why write speeds are so low to begin with .
What TRIM Does
Before we get much further , and without diving into a complete rehash of how SSDs work ( which I ’ve done here , here and here again ) , I want to do a quick refresher on TRIM .
SSDs are made up of millions of NAND flash cells .
They can be written to in groups called pages ( generally 4 KB in size ) but can only be erased in larger groups called blocks ( generally 128 pages or 512KB ) .
These stipulations are partially the source of many SSD performance issues .
The whole ordeal gets more complicated when you realize that an SSD has no way of knowing when a file is deleted .
Until an address gets used again , the SSD has to keep track of every last bit of data that ’s written to it .
The ATA - TRIM instruction tilts the balance in favor of the SSD .
In a supported OS ( e.g. Windows 7 ) , whenever you permanently delete a file or format your drive , the addresses that are erased are sent along with the TRIM command to the SSD ’s controller .
The TRIM instruction tells the SSD that those locations do n’t contain valid data and that it no longer has to track them .
Simplified version of how a SSD controller works .
TRIM helps the SSD clean blocks and add them to the free block pool
Again , I wo n’t go into great detail here but TRIM addresses a major part of the performance degradation over time issue that plague all SSDs .
A TRIM enabled drive running an OS with TRIM support will stay closer to its peak performance over time .
Writes Casey Donahue : " Ran into these guys on the train .
They win Halloween . "
Sorry about the location mix - up guys .

Shiloh Pepin , a girl who was born with fused legs , a rare condition often called “ mermaid syndrome , ” and gained a wide following on the Internet and national television , has died .
She was 10 .
Doctors had predicted she would only survive only for days after her birth at the most , but the girl , described by her mother as “ a tough little thing , ” died at Maine Medical Center on Friday afternoon , hospital spokesman John Lamb said .
She had been hospitalized in critical condition for nearly a week .
Being born with “ mermaid syndrome , ” also known as sirenomelia , meant that the Kennebunkport girl had only one partially working kidney , no lower colon or genital organs and legs fused from the waist down .
Some children who have survived sirenomelia have had surgery to separate their legs , but Shiloh did not because blood vessels crossing from side to side in her circulatory system would have been severed .
She had received two kidney transplants , the last one in 2007 .
Her story was featured recently on “ The Oprah Winfrey Show ” and other national television programs .
Earlier this month , her mother , Leslie Pepin , said her daughter came down with a cold that quickly turned to pneumonia .
Shiloh rushed to Maine Medical Center on Oct. 10 and was placed on antibiotics and a ventilator .
For a while , Leslie Pepin said , things were looking up .
“ She ’s a tough little thing , ” she said of her daughter earlier this week .
Shiloh was a fifth - grader at Kennebunkport Consolidated School .
“ She was such a shining personality in that building , ” said Maureen King , chairwoman of the board of the regional school district .
Counselors will be available next week to talk to students .
Through the television shows , news articles , Facebook and other Web sites , Shiloh inspired many .
“ I live in Iowa .
I have cerebral palsy .
I love your video , ” 12 - year - old Lydia Dawley wrote to Shiloh on Facebook .
“ You have a great personality I wish you lived close so we could be friends and hang out .
You opened my eyes because you are so brave . ”

West Africa , a region that has barely begun to heal from a decade of civil wars , is once again under attack .
The new threat grows silently , like a cancer , and the international community appears powerless to respond .
An international network led by Latin American drug cartels and the Lebanese Islamist group Hezbollah has chosen West Africa , among the poorest and most corrupted corners of the world , as the nexus for illegal trade in cocaine , oil , counterfeit medicines , pirated music and human trafficking .
International law enforcement officials say the profits fuel terrorist activities worldwide .
The past three years have seen a staggering increase in drug trafficking in particular , making West Africa — and especially the countries of Guinea - Bissau , Nigeria , Ghana and Guinea — the premier narcotics region of Africa .
The consequences are most visible in Guinea - Bissau , which saw the double assassination of its president and army chief on the same day in early March and more recently the murder of two leading politicians in the struggle for succession .
The consequences stretch as well to the slums of Guinea - Bissau , where crack - fueled prostitution is driving a new AIDS epidemic in a region where even basic health care is beyond the reach of many — and where young people turning to the drug trade become the unwitting soldiers of organized crime .
What ’s happening in Guinea - Bissau , Africa ’s first narcostate , is a red flag of warning for the region — and for the world .
About the photographer :
Marco Vernaschi began his long - term project of documenting the illegal activities behind terrorism with his project on cocaine trafficking : " West Africa ’s New Achilles ' Heel . "
His overall goal is to show how unaware consumers in the West support international terrorism .
This work documents the effects of cocaine trafficking in West Africa , showing how criminal networks led by Hezbollah and Al Qaeda destroyed a whole country in just a few years .
During this coverage , Marco spent a considerable amount of time with an African organization of drug traffickers affiliated with Islamist terrorists , documenting their criminal activities , the assassination of the president of Guinea - Bissau and the devastating social effects , including crack addiction and prostitution .
Marco has worked on several other stories in Indonesia , Bolivia , Madagascar , Argentina , India , Nepal , Zimbabwe , Swaziland and Belize .
His work is published internationally by major magazines such as Newsweek , National Geographic , GEO and The Sunday Times Magazine .
He ’s currently working on his first book , " NARCO . "

500 Programming Languages : Python
Python is one of my favorite programming languages .
It ’s almost always the first one that I reach for when I have a programming task I ’d like to try out , and often enough , it ’s the final language of that task , too .
Introduction to Python
On the official Python website , Python is described as “ a dynamic object - oriented programming languages that can be used for many kinds of software development . ”
They also claim that “ Many Python programmers report substantial productivity gains and feel the language encourages the development of higher quality , more maintainable code . ”
I am inclined to agree .
Though Python is a true “ everything is an object ” OO language , you can do more than just Object - Oriented programming with it .
You can do plain - ol ’ procedural programming , functional programming , Object - Oriented programming , and probably some other types of programming if you wanted .
One of the nicest things about Python is the “ batteries included ” approach , which means that Python comes with a ton of modules that do a large amount of what you want to do , right out of the box ( or tarball , or installer … I do n’t know if you can actually get Python in a box ) .
Does your app need to write a cgi app ?
Or even better , a wsgi app ?
Web client ?
Web server ??
Yep , it has all those , and many , many more .
There are many , more thorough introductions to Python out there , so I wo n’t attempt to cover the language in too much more depth , but I will show you a couple of things that really capture the spirit of Python :
Python 2.6.2 ( release26 - maint , Apr 19 2009 , 01:58:18 ) [ GCC 4.3.3 ] on linux2 Type " help " , " copyright " , " credits " or " license " for more information . >>> from __future__ import braces File " < stdin > " , line 1 SyntaxError : not a chance >>> import this The Zen of Python , by Tim Peters Beautiful is better than ugly .
Explicit is better than implicit .
Simple is better than complex .
Complex is better than complicated .
Flat is better than nested .
Sparse is better than dense .
Readability counts .
Special cases are n't special enough to break the rules .
Although practicality beats purity .
Errors should never pass silently .
Unless explicitly silenced .
In the face of ambiguity , refuse the temptation to guess .
There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it .
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you 're Dutch .
Now is better than never .
Although never is often better than * right * now .
If the implementation is hard to explain , it 's a bad idea .
If the implementation is easy to explain , it may be a good idea .
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let 's do more of those ! >>> import __hello__

My First Python Program
This is far from my first program in Python .
I first discovered Python when I was in High School , so possibly as early as 1999 - 2000 .
I had discovered Blender , a free 3D editing application , and it had Python embedded within it , for use in creating extensions and scripting games for the built - in game engine .
Back then , I still thought I was going to be a video game developer , so I made some effort to learn Python so I could write games in Blender .
Anyway , enough history . :)
For this program , I implemented a Brainfuck - to - Python compiler .
I wo n’t go into Brainfuck right now because I will be doing a post on it next .
This program is nowhere near demonstrating all of , or even a large number of , Python ’s features , but it does demonstrate how easy it is to write a quick - and - easy program .
I threw this compiler together in less than 5 minutes , and it functioned properly on my first try ( the Brainfuck hello world from Wikipedia ) .
The only addition I had to make later was handling the case of end - of - file on the input .
def compile ( program ) : indent = 4 code = [ ' def compiled ( input=None , output =None ) : ' , ' import sys ' , ' if not input : input = sys.stdin ' , ' if not output : output = sys.stdout ' , ' i = 0 ' , ' a = [ 0 ] * 30000 ' ] commands = { '>' : ' i += 1 ' , '< ' : ' i -= 1 ' , '+ ' : ' a [ i ] += 1 ' , '- ' : ' a [ i ] -= 1 ' , '. ' : ' output.write ( chr ( a[ i ] ) ) ' , ' , ' : ' a [ i ] = ord ( input.read ( 1 ) or " \0 " ) ' , '[ ' : ' while a [ i ] :' , ' ] ' : '' } for command in program : line = commands.get ( command , None ) if line : code.append ((' ' * indent ) + line ) if command == ' [ ' : indent += 4 elif command == ' ] ' : indent -= 4 exec '
'.join ( code ) return compiled
This function takes a string containing BF code as its one argument and returns a function which will run that code when called .
The function returned will have two optional arguments , input and output , which are expected to be file - like objects ( at least implementing read and write , respectively ) , which allows for passing in specific input and / or handling the output from within a python program .
It ’s kind of a dirty way to do it , building Python source , an then running it with exec , but it gets the job done .
I could also save the function to a compiled .pyc file , so you could later import it directly , but that would require a bit more code and ruin the simplicity of it all .
I could also have generated input for my Python assembler , and used that to generate a compiled .pyc file , but like I said , I was going for simplicity here , and encouraging people to learn Python , not necessarily Python bytecodes .

Anatomy of a Python program
Modules
Python is organized in modules and ( optionally ) packages .
A module is simply a file which contains some amount of Python code .
A package is simply a directory which contains some number of modules .
You can import modules with the import statement , which runs the code in the module , and then imports any objects the module defines into the current context ( generally under some namespace , see the Python Modules documentation for more details on the import statement ) . )
The code in a module can be at the module - level , outside of any functions , or it can be contained in functions and classes .
Code at the module level is run immediately when the module is imported .
For short scripts , it ’s usually fine to write code at the module level .
For more complex modules , it ’s common practice to put all the code into functions , and then conditionally invoke that function if the module is run directly .
For example , to extend my BF compiler above to be invoked directly from the commandline , I added the following code to the end of the bf module :
def cmd_line ( ) : import sys if len( sys.argv ) < 2 : print ( ' usage : %s bf_file
' % sys.argv[ 0 ] ) else : try : with file ( sys.argv [ 1 ] ) as f : bf_fn = compile ( f.read ( ) ) except IOError , msg : print ( " could n't read file %s : %s
" % ( sys.argv [ 1 ] , msg ) ) bf_fn ( ) if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : cmd_line ( )
The cmd_line function is just a regular function .
The real magic happens on the last line there .
At the module level , name will be set to “ main ” if the current module is the one which was run directly .
If a module is imported from any other module , name is set to the name of the module .
Python Shell
You can also run Python code directly , one line at a time , from the python shell .
The shell comes up if you just run Python directly without specifying a module for it to run .
Python makes a great calculator , random - number picker , interactive prototyping tool , etc .
Often when I ’m playing around with an idea for how to do something , I ’ll just open up the Python shell and play around until I get it working how I ’d like , then I will commit the code to an actual file .
Installing and Running Python
There ’s a nice guide to installing and running Python on various systems at Python.org , so I wo n’t spend time repeating what they ’ve got there .
Learning more about Python
A good place to start is the Python tutorial , and there ’s a lot to learn from the links on the Python Documentation page .
Conclusion
Python is a great language , for both new programmers and experienced programmers who want to try a language that is probably way nicer than what they ’re used to programming in , especially if what you ’re used to programming in is PHP .
Heck , even Terry Chay recommends Python as a learning language , and he ’s known to be a strong supporter of PHP .
In conclusion , if you have n’t yet , give Python a try .
You wo n’t regret it !
If you were a newspaper subscriber last year , there ’s a 10 percent chance you are n’t this year .
That ’s because paid circulation of daily newspapers nationally fell more than 10 percent from a year ago .
Some papers suffered truly horrendous daily circulation losses : the San Francisco Chronicle ( down 25.8 percent ) , The Boston Globe ( down 18.5 percent ) and The ( Newark , N.J. ) Star - Ledger ( down 22.2 percent ) , reports Rick Edmonds on his Poynter Biz Blog .
USA Today , hit by a slump in travel , fell nearly 18 percent .
The circulation of 400 daily newspapers has fallen to only 30 million readers .
This hemorrhaging of circulation — the worst ever — will have serious consequences .
Expect newspaper staffs , already slashed below the minimum necessary to adequately cover their turf , to be cut further .
Expect more shallow , one - source stories .
Expect more stories laden with anonymous sources because the poorly paid , younger , inexperienced reporters left on staff wo n’t have the skill to persuade sources to speak on the record .
Expect more wire - service content because local stories wo n’t get done .
Expect corporate newspaper management to continue to stall on finding a business model that enhances the public - service mission of journalism .
Expect more style than substance .
Just expect less of what good newspapers used to be .
The nation ’s newspapers , the constitutionally anointed watchdogs and adversaries of government , can no longer be considered as successful in those roles as they used to be .
Mr. Edmonds lists several reasons for this continuing , massive loss of paid circulation .
From his Biz Blog :
Readers continue to migrate from print to the Internet — sometimes to newspapers ’ own sites , sometimes to aggregators .
Papers , metros especially , are voluntarily trimming circulation to remote areas because they are more expensive to serve and less valuable to advertisers .
So - called “ start pressure , ” the selling of new subscriptions to replace lost ones , has taken a hit from cost - cutting .
Decisions at many papers to aggressively increase subscription and single copy prices has resulted in fewer copies being sold , though circulation revenue has increased .
This period is the first to include the full impact of the recession , in which some consumers are dropping subscriptions and others buying the paper less frequently .
Smaller news staffs and news space make the product weaker and less appealing .
In 2008 , newspapers shed more than 9,000 jobs .
This year , so far , newspapers have cut more than 14,100 jobs .
How can such cuts in reporting and other capabilities not have serious social , cultural , and political consequences ?
Yes , various foundation - funded , non-profit , experimental approaches to independent newsgathering have emerged .
Consider the well - intended efforts of ProPublica and MinnPost .
( Read Alan Mutter ’s excellent two - part take on non-profit news startups . )
Too little , perhaps too late .
American journalism sprouted from local printers who became family owners of newspapers — local newspapers .
The Founders intended the First Amendment to protect those who owned presses and printed newspapers from interference by the government .
But the utility of the First Amendment has been eroded by overt corporate mismanagement and malpractice far more than covert government malfeasance .
At the local level , newspaper staffs have been reduced far below necessary levels for competent , comprehensive coverage of local government .
Government did n’t cause this — but it now benefits from the ability to operate with far less inspection by journalists .
No non-profit efforts on the horizon would make up for the quantitative loss of experienced reporters nationally .
Fewer reporters means fewer watchdogs .
How is that not costly to a democracy ?
AS the health - reform bills move through Congress , the prognosis for Medicare pa tients gets worse and worse .
The Senate Finance Committee bill ( generally called the Baucus bill , after Chairman Max Baucus ) robs the elderly to cover the uninsured — like snatching purses from little old ladies .
The House bills already cut future funding for Medicare by $ 500 billion over the next decade .
The Baucus bill would slash a similar amount , just when 30 percent more people enter the program as baby boomers turn 65 .
The Baucus bill also puts new limits on what doctors can do for patients in Medicare :
* A “ race to the bottom ” provision ( p. 102 of the revised chairman ’s mark ) would take effect each year for the next five years .
The provision penalizes doctors who end up in the 90th percentile or above on the cost of what they use to treat their patients , compared with national averages .
The intent is to force down the cost of care , year by year .
Yet this blunt instrument ca n’t determine which care is actually wasteful — it will punish doctors for treating high cost patients with complex conditions .
Inevitably , it will lower the quality of care .
* Even more devastating is the amendment Sen. Maria Cantwell ( D - Wash . ) got inserted into the bill ( revised chairman ’s mark , pp. 102-3 ) .
It gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the power to define quality , cost - effective care for each medical condition and penalize doctors who spend more on their patients .
The law establishing Medicare in 1965 barred the federal government from interfering in doctors ’ treatment decisions .
Slowly , Medicare regulations have begun unraveling that protection .
Now the Cantwell amendment finishes the job .
This is the most extreme change to Medicare ever .
Dr. David McKalip , a Florida neurosurgeon and a board member of the Florida Medical Association , predicts : “ The only doctors left in Medicare will be those willing to ration care and practice cookbook medicine . ”
It ’s reasonable for Medicare administrators to strive to get value for dollars spent .
In recent years , Medicare has taken a slow , tight - fisted ( and sometimes arbitrary ) approach to paying for new drugs or medical devices .
But Cantwell aims directly at doctors ’ decisions .
That ’s not surprising .
President Obama and his advisers vilify doctors for over - treating patients .
Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel , brother of White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and a key Obama health - care adviser , argues that the Hippocratic Oath is largely to blame for the “ overuse ” of medical care .
In his view , doctors focus too much on the needs of their own patients ; they should be taught to ask whether the money they ’re spending on a patient is worth it .
To curb doctors ’ spending , the stimulus legislation launched a process of sending doctors protocols via computer on what the government deems “ appropriate ” and “ cost - effective ” care .
Doctors who are not “ meaningful users ” will be punished financially .
When I warned that this meant the government would be interfering in doctors ’ treatment decisions , CNN and FactCheck.org said that was untrue .
But Dr. David Blumenthal , appointed in March to head the new system of computer - guided medicine , settled that debate .
In the New England Journal of Medicine ( April 9 ) , he confirmed that “ embedded clinical - decision support ” ( his term for computers telling doctors what to do ) would be used to reduce costs , and he predicted that some doctors might rebel against tight controls .
The Baucus bill completes the framework for tying doctors ’ hands when treating the elderly .
Driving all this is the misconception that doctors spend wastefully on patients who are about to die .
Newsweek ’s recent cover story , “ The Case for Killing Granny , ” argues that “ the need to spend less money on the elderly at the end of life is the elephant in the room in the health - reform debate . ”
Numerous studies prove that is false .
In 2006 , Emory University researchers examining the records of patients in the year before they died found that doctors spend far less on patients who are expected to die than on patients expected to survive .
The Emory researchers said it ’s untrue that “ lifesaving measures for patients visibly near death account for a disproportionate share of spending . ”
They also found that doctors often can’t predict when a patient is in the last year of life .
In any case , the health - reformers ’ plan to cut spending on patients 65 and older wo n’t simply reduce end - of - life care , it will also eliminate care for patients who are perfectly capable of surviving their illness and going on with life .

Mr Benn creator David McKee changed Festing to Festive Road in the stories
By Tim Masters
Entertainment correspondent , BBC News
Residents of the street that helped inspire the Mr Benn stories have clubbed together to pay tribute to the classic children 's character .
Festing Road , in Putney , south London , became famous when illustrator David McKee lived there in the late 1960s and made it Mr Benn 's home address .
On Saturday , an engraved paving slab will be laid outside the house where McKee invented his famous cartoon .
McKee has also revealed that he is in talks about a Mr Benn movie .
Magic portal Mr Benn 's adventures always began when he visited a magical fancy dress shop .
Everyone used to say that Mr Benn was probably stoned , and now he really is !
Mr Benn creator David McKee
The shop 's changing room was a portal to another world which reflected Mr Benn 's chosen costume .
The stories are best known through the 13 TV episodes that were first broadcast in the early 1970s , and have often been repeated .
McKee , who lives in France , will be attending Saturday 's celebration party .
" I 'm very fond of Mr Benn , " McKee told the BBC .
" When you create a character , it 's very much like your children - you have to give them a certain amount of attention and a certain amount of liberty as well . "
For his stories , McKee changed Festing Road to Festive Road , and had Mr Benn living at number 52 - next door to his own house at number 54 .
" I think it was because in the first book I drew myself looking out of the window , and I thought it would be quite nice to have him next door , " said McKee .
Diver , cook , caveman Neighbours in Festing Road clubbed together to pay for the stone
The engraved paving stone was the idea of the current resident of number 54 , Hugh Thompson .
Mr Thompson , 63 , said he had no idea about his home 's history when he moved in three years ago .
" It 's all been a bit of a surprise to find I live in a national monument , " he said .
The idea for the paving stone came during a visit to Australia last year when Mr Thompson noticed a Sydney suburb had the street names on the pavements .
He suggested it to the residents of Festing Road and they raised £ 500 to pay for the slab to be engraved .
The stone will be unveiled on Saturday with residents dressing up in many of the costumes worn by Mr Benn , including the diver , cook , caveman , hunter , clown , wizard and knight .
McKee , who is also the creator of King Rollo and Elmer the Elephant , is working on a new Mr Benn picture book and a Mr Benn novel for older children .
" I 've got quite a lot of that written , " he said .
' Zap bang wallop '
He also plans to create high - definition versions of the original cartoons .
" We are quite actively talking about that , I 've seen a test and it gives them a very different life , " he said .
" Television I see now is very zap bang wallop , and Mr Benn is n't like that , but I get letters from people who say how much their children are enjoying it . "
McKee also revealed that Mr Benn had been optioned for a movie " recently enough for the contract not to be dry " .
He added : " There are quite a few people interested in doing it and it is with someone at the moment - it's a project that is very much alive . "
McKee said he was looking forward to Saturday 's unveiling ceremony with members of his family who grew up in Festing Road .
" Everyone used to say that Mr Benn was probably stoned , and now he really is ! "

THE NATION’S business media have been getting a little gushy over JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon .
“ The Banker Who Saved Wall Street , ’’ proclaimed Newsweek .
“ In Full Stride as Others Fall , ’’ proclaimed the Washington Post .
Dimon does seem to be a rare success story .
But this is also a good time to remind the nation ’s business journalists of the dangers of emphasizing heroic - CEO narratives over tough scrutiny of the underlying economy .
The new financial regulations being drafted in semiobscurity by Barney Frank ’s House Financial Services Committee will do more to determine the vitality of the economy than Dimon ’s “ outspoken , profane , fearless ’’ personality , as Fortune described it .
But new regulations do n’t make for big drama , and therefore do n’t get big attention - until something blows up big .
Whatever Dimon ’s fate , it ’s worth noting that the business media often guess wrong on their heroes .
“ It is n’t clear whether the deal will enrich shareholders or how the market chaos will play out .
But it ’s certain that [ Bank of America CEO Ken ]
Lewis is realizing the epic vision that he has long dreamed of , ’’ Fortune wrote last fall .
Or not .
Lewis , under pressure , announced his retirement this week .
Even if Fortune , Forbes , CNBC , and their brethren guessed right all the time , their CEO - worship would still be misguided .
All those seemingly irresistible rise - and - fall narratives are tangential , at best , to the fate of the nation ’s economy .
And calling attention to flaws in the economy , while serving as a tough watchdog on Wall Street , is the higher calling for the business media .
The failure to prevent the catastrophic collapse of the credit market can’t be entirely , or even largely , laid at the feet of the media .
But the nation had a right to expect better warning from the thousands of reporters employed to follow the markets , just as people had a right to expect the same from those who covered the run-up to the Iraq war .
Now , as news media face their own challenges , they must serve the public at large and not , in the case of business news outlets , the natural hunger of MBA - subscribers for narratives that aggrandize their bosses .

Year - long maternity leave , flexi hours , four day weeks ... why would ANY boss hire a woman ?
By Alexandra Shulman for the Daily Mail
In this provocative and very personal article , Vogue editor ALEXANDRA SHULMAN argues that mothers ' rights are making women unemployable ...
Concerns : Alexandra Shulman asks whether government policies have lost sight of the real working place
Last week , I had a couple of days off .
I spent a half - term afternoon with my son and wandered through the neighbourhood in search of ingredients for a slow - cooked sausage sauce for supper .
Slow - cooked ?
Not a phrase in my usual domestic repertoire .
As I walked through the residential streets toward the shops , the world appeared surreally quiet .
There were women with pushchairs , the odd gang of teenagers , old men puffing cigarettes outside pubs - but to one used to the momentum of a bustling office at 3 pm , it seemed both strange and stifling in its implacable ordinariness .
It reminded me of how alone I felt during my maternity leave when I was one of those women pushing my baby home from the park as dusk began to draw in .
That stroll encapsulated the conflicted way so many women feel about their working life and their need to balance home and family .
I treasured what for me was stolen time to be a mother and homemaker , yet it also made me appreciate the liveliness and richness that my work brings .
It is also the very issue that drives a stream of women into my office to discuss their futures , their maternity leaves , four - day working weeks , possible job shares , all now encouraged by recent legislation .
Nobody can legislate a route through the conflict between work and motherhood .
Nobody can predict the visceral love you feel for your children , the fear you have when they are small that when you are not physically there , they might come to harm .
Neither can laws help the sickening exhaustion of endless , sleepless nights combined with working days and the seeming impossibility of achieving success as a worker , a mother , a wife , even at times as a human being .
But while a slew of government policies are aimed at helping working women achieve a more satisfactory existence , are they not losing sight of the real workplace picture ?
And are they ignoring the evidence , not documented but heard in the beat of the tom - toms if you listen hard enough , that some of this legislation might even be harming women 's chances of employment ?
I completely understand the decision of any woman to give up their job to stay at home with their children .
Who knew ?
Under EU plans , women will be entitled to full pay for the first 18 weeks of maternity leave .
The current UK entitlement is six weeks at 90 per cent of your salary
And it seems entirely reasonable that in many situations a woman who becomes a mother will want to trade in her role for something less demanding .
But what I do n't understand is the idea that you should be able to keep exactly the same job , with all the advantages that entails , and work less for it , regardless of how that affects the office or colleagues .
I do n't think I 'm a monster .
I currently employ a 90 per cent female staff on the editorial team at Vogue .
Of them , 98 per cent are of childbearing age .
Babies , children , the possibility of children , the difficulties in conception , the problems once they arrive - that is the stuff of the water cooler debate around here .
Juggling motherhood and a career :
Are women wise to try and do both ?
I was in the same job when I had my one and only child in 1995 .
I took 18 weeks off .
I remember when Sam was 12 weeks old , my boss called me to see ' how I was getting along ' .
He hoped I 'd be back soon .
It was meant to be an encouraging phone call , but I , like so many other women in that situation , felt a bolt of panic .
What if I did n't get back soon ?
Would they still want me ?
Would I still be able to do the job ?
Legally , I and the several of my staff who were also pregnant could have taken longer off , but we all took the same length of leave and were propelled back to work by financial necessity and the sense that that was what one did .
To abandon our job for more time just did n't seem the right thing to do .
My mother - a journalist , too - had three children in the late Fifties and early Sixties .
She took two weeks off and had to pretend to her male employers that pregnancy was a bit like flu - inconvenient and not worth discussing .
Yes , it would keep her away from work , but only for a few days .
She recalls sitting in her hospital bed , post - delivery , with her typewriter ' tapping away on my slack stomach ' and that the men she worked for were horrified that she was returning to work at all and had simply assumed she would stop .
But she needed the money and , equally importantly , enjoyed her job .
Thankfully , we 've come a long way from then .
But have we gone too far in the other direction ?
Nowadays , the majority of pregnant women I know take close to a year off , during which they are entitled to statutory maternity pay for up to 39 weeks .
They return with the expectation and right to have their old job back after 52 weeks .
Except that , when they do return , many of them do n't want exactly their old job back .
They want the same role but moulded into a time frame that suits family life better .
They want to investigate four - day weeks , flexitime , jobshares , and they often then have another baby and are entitled to take another year off .
But is this realistic ?
Can the diversity of circumstances and job requirements mean that one - size - fits - all legislation works ?
Criticism of the situation is very much the view that dares not speak its name .
It 's barely acceptable to write this piece at all - and probably impossible for a man .
I met a woman last week who heads up a small company .
' You 're not allowed to say it , but the reality is that the maternity situation is a nightmare .
' Of course what happens is that the younger ones in the office step up to fill the gap - and , ' she whispered , ' they 're cheaper .
' At the end of a year , how much do I really need that person back ? '
Successful fashion entrepreneur Anya Hindmarch , who has built her own business while bringing up five children , adds another dissident voice .
A full - time jobs means full - time work - not doing the school run as someone else solves the latest office crisis
' If we are not careful ( and I speak as a mother and an employer ) , maternity leave and benefits will become too biased towards the mother and not considerate enough for the employer .
' In which case , it can start to work against women as it becomes too complicated and expensive to employ them .
To me , it shouts of shooting ourselves in the foot . '
My own experience is , I realise , substantially different to most women 's but , as all personal experiences do , it informs my opinions .
I had to work full - time .
When I had my child I was the main breadwinner in the family , a family that broke down three years later , leaving me financing a London house and the three - year - old and a 14 - year - old stepdaughter living there .
Working mother : Alexandra Shulman and her son
You might argue that the marriage broke down because I was working full - time in a high - profile job and my husband was not , but you would be wrong .
I employed a live - in nanny , and have continued to do so , because employing live - in help is cheaper than live - out and simply makes life easier if you work as I do .
I have never worked a shorter week , partially because I want the full salary to pay for the private education of my son , the help and the house we live in .
But it is also because I do n't , at root , think it would be the correct way to do this job .
I realise that most people are not in the same situation .
They can't afford childcare for their babies and their jobs neither pay so well nor are so fulfilling .
Who knew ?
74 pc of women in the UK without children feel they deserve time off equivalent to maternity leave , according to a poll
But it 's not the workers on the factory line , the bank clerks , the farm hands or the Tube drivers who are successfully negotiating part - time deals or who are able to take a year 's maternity leave and then return .
It 's the young professionals , women who are the people I was 20 years ago .
' Flexible hours for full - time jobs ' trumpets the website working mums.co.uk .
But , hang on a minute , for many of us a full - time job means working full - time .

Are greater rights for mothers making women less employable ?

Now share your opinion
It does n't mean being on the school run at 4 pm on Friday when a work emergency breaks out , or making paper snowflakes with your four - year - old while a younger and undoubtedly worse paid and probably childless fellow employee is trying to solve a problem that needs to be dealt with now .
And how fair is it for a deputy to be promoted to cover a maternity leave only to be demoted back to their box on your return after a year ?
It 's a situation that is increasingly encouraging small businesses , individuals , or employers in small rural communities who simply can't work around an employee 's year off and who do n't have a pool of freelance cover , to look instead for women who wo n't have more children - or indeed men .
Of course , as employers we should all do our best to help women , and men , with their childcare .
I think it vital to be understanding about sick children and there are always going to be childcare cover crises where parents just can't get into work .
In my office , I can forget about getting anything much achieved during the nativity play season ( and that includes the two dads ) with sports days running a close second .
But while employers certainly should have a duty of care for their employees , should n't employees in turn have a certain duty of responsibility to their job ?
How cherished does one feel as a boss by someone who is only at work nine months out of three years , the rest being taken as maternity leave , or by someone who - when resources are already stretched - forces a flexi - time deal ?
Women have increasingly broken through that old glass ceiling with determination and , to be honest , helpful employment legislation .
As a result , many are now employers themselves .
Let 's not put that progress back by creating a world where the next generation of women workers becomes too inconvenient and awkward to employ and find themselves legislated back into the home .
By Federico Fuentes , Caracas
September 24 , 2009 -- Faced with the growing impact of the global economic crisis , Washington ’s intentions to establish seven military bases in Colombia and growing challenges in solving structural problems , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez reaffirmed the need to build a new state .
“ We have inherited a capitalist state that serves the interests of the bourgeoisie and is still penetrated by interests contrary to the revolution .
We need to carry out an internal shake up of the government structures ” , Chavez said on September 19 during the second expanded council of ministers meeting , which also involved governors and mayors aligned with the Bolivarian revolution .
The meeting was called to discuss a series of new measures the revolutionary government plans to announce in coming weeks to confront some of the challenges it faces on the economic , political and social fronts .
In all , 54 new measures have already been approved by his cabinet .
Global economic crisis
New figures released by the Central Bank of Venezuela ( BCV ) showed the national economy contracted by 1 % in the first half of the year , including a 2.4 % drop in the second quarter .
The pro-poor and pro-development economic measures taken during the past 10 years of the Chavez government have ensured that some of the impact of the global economic crisis has been lessened , particularly in comparison with other countries .
However , it is becoming clear that Venezuela is being negatively affected by the global downturn .
This has also been felt in the decline in manufacturing industry ( down 8.5 % ) , among others , and the slight rise in unemployment , from 7.3 % in March to 8 % in August .
While pro-capitalist economists are claiming the economic crisis is coming to an end , Chavez said : “ No one can say that we have already passed through the worst of the crisis of capitalism . ”
He said worst could still lie ahead .
Chavez said the insistence of the US government on imposing the same economic model “ that generated the crisis ” was making the situation worse .
Chavez pointed to the military coup in Honduras and the seven new US military bases planned in neighbouring Colombia .
He said these represent “ the great threat of the empire and its pretension to continue imposing on us a model which they insist on despite the misery it has caused ” .
In Venezuela , the Washington - backed right - wing opposition continues to ramp up its propaganda campaign , using its control of the private media , against the government and Venezuelan people .
In most cases , the propaganda is based on lies and distortions .
However , in some cases it takes advantage of weaknesses in the revolution resulting — a result oif bureaucracy , corruption , internal power struggles and attempts to stifle popular participation that pervade the old state structures .
Chavez said an “ emergency situation ” existed in the health sector .
He said 2000 local medical clinics that were part of Mission Barrio Adentro , the popular government - run program that provides free health care to the poor , were no longer functioning due to “ neglect on the part of everyone ” .
He warned that “ the [ US ] empire knows that elections will be held next year .
They are seeking a majority in the National Assembly .
“ They will try to weaken us .
They will exploit to the maximum our inefficiencies .
They are going into the barrios ( poor neighbourhoods ) .
They are trying to create movements to cohere support … we know they are capable of anything : buying votes , blackmail , trickery . ”
Popular support for Chavez remains extremely high .
However , there is growing evidence that , after 10 years of the revolution , tiredness and discontent with the lack of advances in critical areas could mean that support for Chavez does not translate into similar support for pro-Chavez candidates in parliamentary elections .
The opposition , which boycotted the 2005 National Assembly elections , will go into the poll with control of a number of key governorships and a vote that has risen in recent years , particularly in the larger cities .
There are concerns they could win enough seats to sabotage the work of the assembly .
New state
In a July 25 , 2009 , National Assembly speech , Chavez raised the alarm about the failure of his government to act on decisive issues , such as health and crime , and the impact it was having on support for the revolution .
Some of the social missions created by the government — with the active participation of the people — to tackle problems in the areas of health , education and housing have begun to falter due to neglect and flagging participation .
The social missions emerged on the back of two important events .
First , the April 2002 defeat of a US - backed military coup through a popular uprising that included important sections of the military .
Second , the powerful mobilisation of the workers , communities and the armed forces that defeated a two - month bosses ’ lockout ( including shutting down the state - owned oil industry by its corrupt management ) from December 2002 to January 2003 .
Defeating the lockout meant the government won control over the state oil company , allowing it to use oil revenue to set up the social missions .
By organising the masses to help run the missions , the government was able to bypass the decrepit and corrupt old state structures that had proven incapable of meeting the needs of the people .
However , several years down the track , these new emerging structures have begun to be “ infected ” by the “ old state structures ” , Chavez warned on August 25 .
“ We cannot allow the new to be infected … its failure will mean the end of the revolution . ”
That is why “ we have to finish off demolishing the old structures of the bourgeois state and create the new structures of the proletarian state ” .
At the September 19 meeting , Chavez called on the government to revitalise the social missions — this time within a single system with a single fund to ensure the resources reach the missions .
Chavez said right now , “ there are many entities responsible [ for different missions ] , something which is holding back the process ” .
“ The missions have to be instruments for the acceleration of the creation of the new state ” , and therefore must not fall into the hands of “ the old bureaucracy ” .
In order to reinforce Mission Barrio Adentro , more than 1000 Cuban doctors and 213 Venezuelan doctors trained in Cuba , as well as 257 specialists in intensive therapy , endoscopy and other areas , will arrive in Venezuela in October .
They will join the almost 30,000 - strong team of Cuban doctors , specialists and health technicians already working in Venezuela .
Chavez emphasised on September 17 that these plans had to go hand - in - hand with the strengthening of popular power organisations .
“ The communal councils have to reactivate and commit themselves to this revitalisation ... because the role of the communes and communal councils are vital for consoliding its success . ”
Communal councils and communes
At the cabinet meeting two days later , Chavez said that the communal councils , which group 200 - 400 families in urban areas and 20 - 50 in rural areas to solve the problems of local communities , “ have to be a cell of a bigger body that is called the commune ” .
Chavez has constantly referred to the communes as the fundamental building blocs of a new , revolutionary state .
Chavez announced the transfer of almost US $ 57 million for more than 330 projects decided on by local communal councils and communes .
As part of the government shake up , Chavez announced the creation of six new vice - presidencies .
These positions would each work to improve the coordination of government policy and ministerial action in the areas of social and political issues , the financial and productive economy , territorial development , and defence .
A new Council of Revolutionary Ministries has also been formed , involving the six vice - presidents and a permanent secretary .
It will involve an executive roundtable — the finance and planning ministers , the first vice president and Chavez — whose aim will be to speed government action by cutting through bureaucratic obstacles .
Chavez also requested a law be drafted and presented to the National Assembly to create a Federal Council of Government involving all ministers and governors .
“ The opposition governors will be able to come ” , he said .
“ As of now we invite the opposition .
Instead of recruiting paramilitaries and enacting plans to destabilise the government , come to the Bolivarian Federal Council , where the people govern . ”
Economic measures
Chavez indicated which direction the economic measures will be likely to head when he presented a number of them at the September 19 meeting .
These include the creation of a new ministry and the Venezuelan Public Banking Corporation ( BCV ) to restructure and regulate the banking sector .
With the completion of the government buy - out of the Bank of Venezuela , the state now directly controls around 16 % of loans and 24 % of deposits .
Eight public banks , which until now have functioned with autonomous boards of directors and no coordination between them , will come under new banking corporation .
Chavez demanded stricter regulation of the private banking sector , and noted this sector “ continues , almost in its entirely , to not comply fully with its role of financial intermediary ” .
He called on governors to present productive projects for the creation of “ mixed companies between the national state , the workers and the regional states in order to continue creating a new public sector based on social property ” .
In line with this proposal , Chavez said the cabinet had decided to create , together with the BCV , a fund to finance and support all initiatives of the new companies of social property .
A special plan for employment has also been entrusted to the minister of infrastructure , housing and public works , and the minister of science , technology and medium industry .
The National Assembly has announced plans to approve a reform of the labour law by the end of October .
Pro-worker changes to be discussed include the reducing the workday , job protection , workers ’ councils and banning labour - hire practices .
Four hundred years ago this year , two events marked what scientists and historians today regard as the birth of modern astronomy .
The first of them , the beginning of Galileo 's telescopic observations , has been immortalized by playwrights and authors and widely publicized as the cornerstone anniversary for the International Year of Astronomy .
Through his looking glass , the Italian astronomer saw the mountains and valleys of the moon , the satellites of Jupiter , and sunspots — observations that would play a huge role in discrediting the prevailing , church - endorsed view of an Earth - centered cosmos .
The second event is not as well known , but is arguably equally important .
It was the publication of Johannes Kepler 's Astronomia Nova ( The New Astronomy ) in 1609 , a treatise in which the German astronomer introduced the first two of his laws describing planetary motion .
The first law states that the planets travel in elliptical orbits around the sun and describes the sun 's position as the focal point in that ellipse .
The second law states that an imaginary line connecting a planet to the sun will sweep out a region of equal size in a given time period , wherever in the orbit that time period falls .
Kepler would later go on to introduce yet another law , this one relating the dimensions of an orbit to the time it takes to complete that orbit .
He also made fundamental contributions to optics , working out how images are formed by pinhole cameras , a telescope and the human eye as well as developed the principles for corrective lenses for near - and farsightedness .
He coined the terms " orbit " and " satellite " and explained how ocean tides are caused by the moon .
" He was an astronomer 's astronomer , " says Owen Gingerich , a professor emeritus of astronomy and science history at the Harvard –Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .
Kepler was born in the town of Weil der Stadt in modern - day Baden–Württemberg , Germany , in 1571 .
His parents were not very well off :
His father was a mercenary and his mother a housewife who would later be accused of witchery .
Kepler was introspective and sickly as a child but he excelled in mathematics .
He decided to join the clergy and won a scholarship to the University of Tübingen , where he was first acquainted with the work of Polish astronomer Nicholaus Copernicus .
In 1609 the accepted view was that Earth was stationary at the center of the universe and the moon , sun and planets moved around it .
The stars lay beyond , encircling Earth in a sphere .
This view of the heavens had originated with the Greeks , and it was formalized as an astronomical system by Claudius Ptolemy in the second century A.D. Ptolemaic astronomy was not simple — to model the motion of the planets , it made use of a complicated system of circles and epicycles — but it had been accepted as truth for almost a millennium and a half .
In the middle of the 16th century Copernicus had put forward an alternate , heliocentric system in which the sun was the center of the universe , with Earth and the other planets encircling it .
Copernicus 's treatise on heliocentrism , De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium ( On the Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres ) , was published in 1543 .
Kepler discovered it as a student in Tübingen and was much taken by Copernicus 's views .
But most people were not similarly enamored with the concept of a heliocentric universe .
First of all , Copernicus 's ideas were not widely disseminated , as they ran counter to the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church ( although 73 years would pass before De Revolutionibus was listed as a forbidden work by the Church ) .
It was only in universities and their surroundings that they found a following .
Secondly , even for those who heard of it , Copernicus 's heliocentric astronomy was by some measures hardly more accurate than Ptolemaic astronomy .
The Great Martian Catastrophe
As Gingerich explains , the Ptolemaic system predicted positions of Mars approximately every 32 years that were in error by about 5 degrees in longitude for a short time .
Copernicus 's system was n't much better : it was off by about 4 degrees longitudinally .
Gingerich calls this " the great Martian catastrophe " — a problem that observers such as Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe knew about , but that Kepler would solve .
After Tübingen Kepler worked as a mathematics teacher in Graz ( in modern - day Austria ) , where he continued his interest in astronomy .
It was in Graz that he wrote the Mysterium Cosmographicum ( The Cosmographic Mystery ) , published in 1596 , in support of Copernicus .
He sent copies of his book to leading astronomers , including Brahe — the greatest observational astronomer of the day .
Brahe and Kepler started a correspondence in which they talked about Copernicanism and other astronomical issues .
By then , Kepler had realized the need for raw data — observations that would help him understand the underlying laws of nature .
In 1600 , as a consequence of the religious and political unrest during the Protestant Reformation , Kepler lost his job at Graz .
He made his way to Prague , where Brahe was the court astronomer to Emperor Rudolph II .
Prague was where Kepler would spend some of his most productive years .
Brahe died suddenly in 1601 , and Kepler succeeded him as court astronomer .
In addition to his royal duties , Kepler tried to resolve the motion of Mars .
He found that his initial model , which assumed that Mars revolved around the sun in a circular orbit , failed to match his predecessor 's observations .
He reluctantly altered the orbit and made it more egg - shaped .
" There is a myth that Kepler , fitting a curve through Tycho Brahe 's records of Mars , discovered that planetary orbits are elliptical , " Gingerich says .
" The fact is that Tycho 's observations showed that the orbit was not a circle , but the choice of an ellipse was largely theoretical . "
It was one of those intellectual leaps that would change the course of science .
Kepler found that not only did an elliptical orbit with the sun at one focus explain the movement of Mars , but also of the other planets .
In fact , as Gingerich points out , Kepler realized the momentous nature of his discovery .
In the Astronomia Nova , the typeface suddenly becomes larger to account for the significance as Kepler explains the motion of Mars and puts forward his first two planetary laws .
( The third would come later . )
But the underlying physical reason for the planetary motion eluded Kepler , who thought a sort of magnetism was responsible .
That puzzle would have to wait for another revolutionary thinker , Isaac Newton , whose law of gravity appeared on the scientific stage and explained orbital behavior eight decades later .

The day
The innards of my 27 " iMac
One more thing
Some days , things just do n't work out .
Or do n't work .
I wanted to upgrade ( their term , not mine ) my iMac from Snow Leopard ( 10.6 ) to Lion ( 10.7 ) .
I even had the little USB stick version of the installer , to make it easy .
But after spending some time attempting the installation , the Lion installer " app " failed , complaining about SMART errors on the disk .
Disk Utility indeed reported there were SMART errors , and that the disk hardware needed to be replaced .
An ugly start .
The good news is that in some places , including where I live , Apple will do a house call for service , so I did n't have to haul the computer to an Apple store on public transit .
Thank you Apple .
I called them , scheduled the service for a few days later , and as instructed by Apple ( I hardly needed prompting ) prepped a backup using Time Machine .
The day before the repairman was to come to give me a new disk , I made sure the system was fully backed up , for security reasons started a complete erasure of the bad disk ( using Disk Utility in target mode from another machine , about which more later ) , and went to bed .
When I got up , I checked that the disk had been erased and headed off to work .
As I left the apartment , the ceiling lights in the entryway flickered and then went out : a new bulb was needed .
On the way out of the building , I asked the doorman for a replacement bulb .
He offered just to replace it for us .
We have a good doorman .
Once at work , things were normal until my cell phone rang about 2 pm .
It was the Apple repairman , Twinkletoes ( some names and details have been changed ) , calling to tell me he'd be at my place within the hour .
Actually , he was n't an Apple employee , but a contractor working for Unisys , a name I had n't heard in a long time .
( Twinkletoes was a name I had n't heard for a while either , but that 's another story . )
At least here , Apple uses Unisys contractors to do their house calls .
So I headed home , arriving before Twinkletoes .
At the front door , the doorman stopped me .
He reported that the problem with the lights was not the bulb , but the wiring .
He 'd called in an electrician , who had found a problem in the breaker box and fixed it .
Everything was good now .
When I got up to the apartment , I found chaos : the cleaners were mid-job , with carpets rolled up , vacuum cleaners running , and general craziness .
Not conducive to work .
So I went back down to the lobby with my laptop and sat on the couch , surfing on the free WiFi from the café next door , and waited for Twinkletoes .
Half an hour later , he arrived and we returned to the apartment .
The cleaners were still there but the chaos level had dropped and it was n't too hard to work around them .
I saw what the inside of an iMac looks like as Twinkletoes swapped out the drive .
By the time he was done , the cleaners had left and things had settled down .
I had assumed that the replacement drive would come with an installed operating system , but I assumed wrong .
( When you assume , you put plum paste on your ass . )
I had a Snow Leopard installation DVD , but I was worried : it had failed to work for me a few days earlier when I wanted to boot from it to run fsck on the broken drive .
Twinkletoes noticed it had a scratch .
I needed another way to boot the machine .
It had surprised me when Lion came out that the installation was done by an " app " , not as a bootable image .
This is an unnecessary complication for those of us that need to maintain machines .
Earlier , when updating a different machine , I had learned how painful this could be when the installation app destroyed the boot sector and I needed to reinstall Snow Leopard from DVD , and then upgradeto a version of the system recent enough to run the Lion installer app .
As will become apparent , had Lion come as a bootable image things might have gone more smoothly .
Thank you Apple .
[ Note added in post : Several people have told me there 's a bootable image inside the installer .
I forgot to mention that I knew that , and there was n't .
For some reason , the version on the USB stick I have looks different from the downloaded one I checked out a day or two later , and even Twinkletoes could n't figure out how to unpack it .
Weird . ]
Twinkletoes had an OS image he was willing to let me copy , but I needed to make a bootable drive from it .
I had no sufficiently large USB stick — you need a 4GB one you can wipe .
However I did have a free , big enough CompactFlash card and a USB reader , so that should do , right ?
Twinkletoes was unsure but believed it would .
Using my laptop , I used Disk Utility to create a bootable image on the CF card from Twinkletoes 's disk image .
We were ready .
Plug in the machine , push down the Option key , power on .
Nothing .
Turn on the light .
Nothing .
No power .
The cleaners must have tripped a breaker .
I went to the breaker box and found that all the breakers looked OK .
We now had a mystery , because the cleaners had had lights on and were using electric appliances — I saw a vacuum cleaner running — but now there was no power .
Was the power off to the building ?
No : the lights still worked in the kitchen and the oven clock was lit .
I called the doorman and asked him to get the electrician back as soon as possible and then , with a little portable lamp , went looking around the apartment for a working socket .
I found one , again in the kitchen .
The iMac was going to travel after all , if not as far as downtown .
The machine was moved , plugged in , option - key - downed , and powered on .
I selected the CF card to boot from , waited 15 minutes for the installation to come up , only to have the boot fail .
CF cards do n't work after all , although the diagnosis of failure is a bit tardy and uninformative .
Thank you Apple .
Next idea .
My old laptop has FireWire so we could bring the disk up using target mode and then run the installer on the laptop to install Lion on the iMac .
We did the target mode dance and connected to the newly installed drive , then ran Disk Utility on the laptop to format the drive .
Things were starting to look better .
Next , we put the Lion installer stick into the laptop , which was running a recent version of Snow Leopard .
Failure again .
This time the problem is that the laptop , all of about four years old , is too old to run Lion .
It 's got a Core Duo , not a Core 2 Duo , and Lion wo n't run on that hardware .
Even though Lion does n't need to run , only the Lion installer needs to run , the system refuses to help .
My other laptop is new enough to run the installer , but it does n't have FireWire so it can't do target mode .
Thank you Apple .
Your aggressive push to retire old technology hurts sometimes , you know ?
Actually , more than sometimes , but let 's stay on topic .
Twinkletoes has to leave — he's been on the job for several hours now — but graciously lends me a USB boot drive he has , asking me to return it by post when I 'm done .
I thank him profusely and send him away before he is drawn in any deeper .
Using his boot drive , I was able to bring up the iMac and use the Lion installer stick to get the system to a clean install state .
Finally , a computer , although of course all my personal data is over on the backup .
When a new OS X installation comes up , it presents the option of " migrating " data from an existing system , including from a Time Machine backup .
So I went for that option and connected the external drive with the Time Machine backup on it .
The Migration Assistant presented a list of disks to migrate from .
A list of one : the main drive in the machine .
It did n't give me the option of using the Time Machine backup .
Thank you Apple .
You told me to save my machine this way but then I can't use this backup to recover .
I called Apple on my cell phone ( there 's still no power in the room with the land line 's wireless base station ) and explained the situation .
The sympathetic but ultimately unhelpful person on the phone said it should work ( of course ! ) and that I should run Software Update and get everything up to the latest version .
He reported that there were problems with the Migration Assistant in early versions of the Lion OS , and my copy of the installer was pretty early .
I started the upgrade process , which would take a couple of hours , and took my laptop back down to the lobby for some free WiFi to kill time .
But it 's now evening , the café is closed , and there is no WiFi .
Naturally .
Back to the apartment , grab a book , return to the lobby to wait for the electrician .
An hour or so later , the electrician arrived and we returned to the apartment to see what was wrong .
It was easy to diagnose .
He had made a mistake in the fix , in fact a mistake related to what was causing the original problem .
The breaker box has a silly design that makes it too easy to break a connection when working in the box , and that 's what had happened .
So it was easy to fix and easy to verify that it was fixed , but also easy to understand why it had happened .
No excuses , but problem solved and power was now restored .
The computer was still upgrading but nearly done , so a few minutes later I got to try migrating again .
Same result , naturally , and another call to Apple and this time little more than an apology .
The unsatisfactory solution : do a clean installation and manually restore what 's important from the Time Machine backup .
Thank you Apple .
It was fairly straightforward , if slow , to restore my personal files from the home directory on the backup , but the situation for installed software was dire .
Restoring an installed program , either using the ludicrous Time Machine UI or copying the files by hand , is insufficient in most cases to bring back the program because you also need manifests and keys and receipts and whatnot .
As a result , things such as iWork ( Keynote etc. ) and Aperture would n't run .
I could copy every piece of data I could find but the apps refused to let me run them .
Despite many attempts digging far too deep into the system , I could not get the right pieces back from the Time Machine backup .
Worse , the failure modes were appalling : crashes , strange display states , inexplicable non-workiness .
A frustating mess , but structured perfectly to belong on this day .
For peculiar reasons I did n't have the installation disks for everything handy , so these ( expensive ! ) programs were just gone , even though I had backed up everything as instructed .
Thank you Apple .
I did have some installation disks , so for instance I was able to restore Lightroom and Photoshop , but then of course I needed to wait for huge updates to download even though the data needed was already sitting on the backup drive .
Back on the phone for the other stuff .
Because I could prove that I had paid for the software , Apple agreed to send me fresh installation disks for everything of theirs but Aperture , but that would take time .
In fact , it took almost a month for the iWork DVD to arrive , which is unacceptably long .
I even needed to call twice to remind them before the disks were shipped .
The Aperture story was more complicated .
After a marathon debugging session I managed to get it to start but then it needed the install key to let me do anything .
I did n't have the disk , so I did n't know the key .
Now , Aperture is from part of the company called Pro Tools or something like that , and they have a different way of working .
I needed to contact them separately to get Aperture back .
It 's important to understand I had n't lost my digital images .
They were backed up multiple times , including in the network , on the Time Machine backup , and also on an external drive using the separate " vault " mechanism that is one of the best features of Aperture .
I reached the Aperture people on the phone and after a condensed version of the story convinced them I needed an install key ( serial number ) to run the version of Aperture I 'd copied from the Time Machine backup .
I was berated by the person on the phone : Time Machine is not suitable for backing up Aperture databases .
( What ?
Your own company 's backup solution does n't know how to back up ?
Thank you Apple . )
After a couple more rounds of abuse , I convinced the person on the phone that a ) I was backing up my database as I should , using an Aperture vault and b ) it was n't the database that was the problem , but the program .
I was again told that was n't a suitable way to back up ( again , What ? ) , at which point I surrendered and just begged for an installation key , which was provided , and I could again run Aperture .
This was the only time in the story where the people I was interacting with were not at least sympathetic to my situation .
I guess Pro is a synonym for unfriendly .
Thank you Apple .
There 's much more to the story .
It took weeks to get everything working again properly .
The complete failure of Time Machine to back up my computer 's state properly was shocking to me .
After this fiasco , I learned about the Lion Recovery App , which everyone who uses Macs should know about , but was not introduced until well after Lion rolled out with its preposterous not - bootable installation setup .
The amount of data I already had on my backup disk but that needed to be copied from the net again was laughable .
And there were total mysteries , like GMail hanging forever for the first day or so , a problem that may be unrelated or may just be the way life was this day .
But , well after midnight , worn out , beat up , tired , but with electricity restored and a machine that had a little life in it again , I powered down , took the machine back to my office and started to get ready for bed .
Rest was needed and I had had enough of technology for one day .
Oh yes , one more thing .
There 's always one more thing in our technological world .
I walked into the bathroom for my evening ablutions only to have the toilet seat come off completely in my hand .
Just because you started it all , even for this , Thank you Apple .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Microsoft MSFT.O has had talks with News Corp NWSA .
O about a tie up , which would involve News Corp getting paid to take its news websites off Google GOOG.O , a source familiar with the matter said on Sunday .
News Corp , which owns such papers as the Wall Street Journal and the Sun , started the discussions , which were at an early stage , the source said .
News Corp Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch has said he wants to make people pay for access to his news websites .
Other publishers including The New York Times NYT.N are also searching for ways to charge for news online , convinced that they must not give news through search engines such as Google and Yahoo YHOO.O .
Microsoft has also talked with other online publishers about removing their sites from Google , according to the Financial Times , which first reported the development .
“ This is all about Microsoft hurting Google ’s margins , ” the FT quoted a website publisher , who had been approached by Microsoft .
Microsoft , which relaunched its search engine as Bing this year , has been looking for ways to challenge market leader Google .
Earlier this year , it signed a 10 - year global web search partnership with Yahoo , a deal that U.S. and European antitrust regulators are evaluating .
Microsoft could not reached for comment late on Sunday .
News Corp declined to comment .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Wednesday 18 November 2009
Referring to the headquarters of the Brawn motor racing team , the piece below sited this in Brackley , Oxfordshire , when Brackley is actually in Northamptonshire .
Jenson Button has agreed terms to join McLaren on a £ 6 m - a - year deal and could sign his formal three - year contract to partner Lewis Hamilton in an all - British line - up within the next few days .
The Guardian understands that the world champion has turned his back on Brawn following protracted negotiations and will almost double his salary with the Woking - based team .
The 29 - year - old was given a guided tour of McLaren 's factory last Friday and , although neither the team nor Button 's management would confirm the deal tonight , sources close to McLaren hinted : " I think Jenson liked what he saw and they liked him too . "
In switching to McLaren Button will be going against advice from Formula One grandees including Sir Stirling Moss , Sir Jackie Stewart , Niki Lauda and Martin Brundle , all of whom feel he might be biting off more than he can chew taking on Hamilton on his home turf in equal cars .
But for Button the prospect of going head - to - head with a close friend and the man regarded by many in the pit lane as possibly the fastest of all will just be part of the challenge of defending his title .
It is unlikely either Hamilton , who earns about £ 12 m a year at McLaren , or his father Anthony , who has managed the 2008 world champion since his days as a teenage kart racer , will have been consulted on this beyond the normal deployment of good manners .
McLaren have always had the resources and philosophy required to field two fully competitive cars and have always sought the strongest possible driver line - ups they could engage .
The decision by the newly crowned world champion to leave the team built from the ashes of Honda by Ross Brawn came on the day it was officially announced that Mercedes - Benz had switched allegiances from McLaren and purchased a controlling interest in Brawn GP .
They will field their cars under the Mercedes banner in 2010 .
It had been widely thought that Button would remain with the team alongside Nico Rosberg , the preferred Mercedes nominee , for 2010 following Rubens Barrichello 's move to Williams .
But there are suggestions that Button was never at the top of the Mercedes wish list .
In fact , on Sunday Norbert Haug , the Mercedes motor sport vice - president , hinted that the company was already in talks to sign Nick Heidfeld from BMW , raising the possibility of two Germans going head - to - head with two Englishmen for next year 's championship .
Nick Fry , Brawn 's chief executive , played down those rumours tonight , saying : " I can confidently say that [ speculation ] is totally incorrect – Mercedes is an international company .
Clearly a German driver would be nice for them but we do n't need two German drivers , that 's not the intent . "
He added : " I hope Jenson is still with us next season .
We 've been together for a good few years now and we have succeeded in winning the world championship together and we want Jenson to be with us .
But we have to recognise that Formula
One is not divorced from the rest of the world .
We have worked within a budget [ and ] if we spend in one area then we cannot spend in another area . "
The purchase of Brawn was funded by Mercedes ' parent company , Daimler AG , who will own 45.1 % of the team 's equity , while Ross Brawn and the other senior management will hold 24.9 % and the Abu Dhabi - based Aarbar investments will hold 30 % .
The team will continue to be run from its headquarters at Brackley in Oxfordshire .
Under the new arrangements finalised today McLaren will have the facility of using Mercedes engines through to 2015 if they wish to .
" This is a win - win situation , for both McLaren and Daimler , " said Ron Dennis , chairman of the McLaren group and the man who originally forged the team 's alliance with Mercedes back in 1995 .
" I 've often stated that it 's my belief that in order to survive and thrive in 21st - century Formula
One a team must become much more than merely a team .
In order to develop and sustain the revenue streams required to compete and win grands prix and world championships companies that run Formula
One teams must broaden the scope of their commercial activities .
" Nonetheless , all of our partners will of course continue to play a crucial role in our Formula One programme .
For that reason , and because the engines they produce are very competitive , we 're delighted that Mercedes - Benz has committed to continue not only as an engine supplier but also as a partner of ours until 2015 – and perhaps thereafter . "
McLaren will not be disadvantaged by no longer being perceived as Mercedes - Benz 's standard bearer in the Formula One front line .
They and Mercedes have gone their separate ways because of conflicting interests in the high - performance road car arena .
But out on the circuits McLaren remains potentially a consistently formidable winning machine .
Button knows this and that is why he will be driving one of their cars next season .
' Shoot Them in the Head ' World Cup Hosts Brazil and South Africa Crack Down on Crime
There are 50 murders a day in South Africa , the host country of the 2010 football World Cup .
And Brazil , host of both the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics , also suffers from extreme violence .
With a view to the high - profile events , the two countries are now attempting to crack down on rampant crime -- and are using ruthless tactics to do so .
Way back in January of 2007 , we reported on the Strange family , who were suing Sacramento radio station KDND -FM for the wrongful death of Jennifer Strange , who was found dead in her home after competing in a contest to try to win a Nintendo Wii .
The contest -- " Hold Your Wee for a Wii " -- involved seeing who could drink the most water without urinating , and Jennifer , who did not win , left the studio and later died .
Her autopsy later showed signs of water intoxication .
Yesterday , a California jury ruled a wrongful death in the case , and ordered Entercom Sacramento LLC , a subsidiary of Philadelphia - based Entercom Communications Corp. , to pay $ 16.5 million dollars to her family as a result of the actions of the radio station 's employees .
Factory Graschaft - Gelsdorf has only 15 employees .
However , together with the entire staff , the company gave birth to a new type of supercar .
Veritas RS III is officially in production !
The Veritas RDS III Roadster was presented for the first time as a prototype .
It won the “ Best Super Car 2009 ” at the London Motor Show and now goes into production .
Limited production , it is true , but even the 30 vehicles that will enter the market they are truly blessed to owners .
Each vehicle will pass , in part , and the manual process of production to Vermot AG Gelsdorf .
It seems incredible , but there isnâ€™t .
Before it was starting to work at it , five of the 30 luxury cars have already been sold – one will go to Monaco , one in Australia , one in Britain , one in Spain and the last in Switzerland .
Eight are reserved and have received over 100 applications for purchase .
Obviously , before the end of the whole “ Christmas package ” of Gelsdorf will be sold .
Veritas RS III
“ Right from the first Veritas RS III to persuade customers with a design that combines traditional and futuristic elements and thus produce an unmistakable impression overall , ” said chief designer Michael Vermot AG Sohngen .
He put great emphasis on scale , one case of a car being classified as “ more than sports .
“ Shut the shark ” , xenon headlights aggressive contoured sides , and behind the plate with two stainless steel evacuation point up contrasts with asymmetric roll bar integrated into your body ’s airbag .
Veritas RS III
Extended mirror in the center of vehicle body components and chrome taillights zigzag design emphasizes exceptional .
Dunlop Tires – 225/30 to 325/25 in the rear and the front – of 12.5 and 10.5 inches wide , wheels “ with 5 - pointed star , the total height of only 97 cm – all these provide a firm control on the road .
Chassis height is adjustable – “ supercar ” was tested for lovers of strong sensations even the Nurburgring .
Drivers are more cautious , however , to fit ABS and TCS .
Technical specifications are testimony to the high demand .
New Veritas , whose predecessors have participated in Formula I in the ’50s , now accelerates from 0 to 100 km / h in less than 3.2 seconds .
This is just one of the considerations for the car enthusiastsâ€™ hearts will beat faster !
Veritas RS III
4.68 meters long and 2.02 meters wide .
Both measures monster that has already made a sensation in Monte Carlo , in Spa .
It is powered by a BMW V10 engine with 5.0 liters or 7 speeds SGM – optional !
With a 6 - speed , manual gearbox .
7500 engine rpm’s RDS achieve top performance : 507 hp and a top speed of 347 km / h .
There is nothing conservative about the war in Afghanistan .
The Center for Defense Information said a few months ago that we had spent over $ 400 billion on the war and war - related costs there .
Now , the Pentagon says it will cost about $ 1 billion for each 1,000 additional troops we send to Afghanistan .
One Republican Member from California told me recently that we could buy off every warlord in Afghanistan for $ 1 billion .
Fiscal conservatives should be the ones most horrified by all this spending .
Conservatives who oppose big government and huge deficit spending at home should not support it in foreign countries just because it is being done by our biggest bureaucracy , the Defense Department .
We have now spent $ 1.5 trillion that we did not have -- that we had to borrow - - in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Eight years is long enough .
In fact , it is too long .
Let 's bring our troops home and start putting Americans first once again .

Faster booting with Upstart
by Mirko Dölle
A good portion of the boot time on current Linux systems is spent on system initialisation and starting dozens of daemons sequentially .
The Ubuntu 9.10 development team have started to parallelise and accelerate the boot process through the large scale use of Upstart .
This article originally appeared in c't magazine 9/09 , p. 176
Loading the Linux kernel takes up just a fraction of the time spent waiting for the login prompt during booting .
The system spends most of its time sitting waiting for init ( which has its origins in Unix System V ) to cycle through the various runlevels , during which it runs innumerable sequences of init scripts .
In Ubuntu and Fedora , Upstart has long replaced the traditional SysV init .
The current boot sequence , with services starting consecutively in a fixed sequence , remains unaltered simply because no - one has sat down and adapted the init scripts for these various services to the capabilities of Upstart .
Upstart simply emulates the SysV init runlevels ( which actually no longer exist on systems running Upstart ) and continues to call the old init scripts .
For Ubuntu 9.10 , the development team have finally started to convert some services to Upstart .
Both Upstart and SysV init are the first processes to be launched by the kernel ( with ID 1 ) as soon as the latter has booted and any boot scripts from the initial ramdisk ( initrd ) have been run .
For SysV init , the lynchpin of system initialisation is the /etc / inittab file .
This is where SysV init finds the default runlevel , the name of the first initialisation script and the commands for initialising each runlevel .
During runlevel initialisation , the linked init scripts in the relevant runlevel directory ( e.g. /etc/rc5.d ) are run sequentially .
For this to work , all services must run in the background as daemons and decouple themselves from the console , since the init script would otherwise hang until the service had terminated .
This decoupling means that for init to determine whether a service is still running , or has self - terminated , is time - consuming .
It generally achieves this by the daemon saving a file containing its process ID ( PID ) in / var / run , leaving it to the init script to determine whether a particular PID belongs to the daemon in question .
One of the final init scripts launches the GUI .
Once SysV init has run all of its scripts , services listed in the /etc / inittab file , such as login consoles , are then launched and monitored .
Upstart , by contrast , is event - oriented and works using ' jobs ' , with each job file in the /etc / init directory being responsible for launching a service or for a specific component of system initialisation .
There is no fixed sequence ; instead each job specifies the events to which it will react .
When an event occurs , Upstart starts all jobs that have been waiting for this event , in parallel .
Upstart generates the first event , startup , automatically when it is called .
Each job also generates a started Jobname and stopped Jobname event on starting and terminating respectively .
Various jobs take an interest in the startup event in Ubuntu 9.10 , including hostname , which sets up the computer name .
The associated job file is /etc/init/hostname.conf .
The following example shows a very simplified version of this job :
start on startup
task
exec hostname - b - F /etc/hostname
The keyword start on specifies the event which will trigger this job .
If the job is to be triggered by multiple events , these events must be logically linked .
start on ( runlevel [ 016 ]
and ( stopped gdm
or stopped kdm
or stopped xdm ) )
Unlike in Ubuntu 9.04 , there can no longer be multiple start on lines .
If the job subsequently needs to be terminated , stop on is used to define additional stop events which in turn cause the job to be stopped .
If a job needs to be started or stopped manually , this can be achieved using
initctl start Jobname
and
initctl stop Jobname .
The name of the program which the job should run follows the keyword exec .
One major difference between Upstart and SysV init is that services always run in the background in init scripts , since they would otherwise cause init to hang .
Upstart , by contrast , expects the process following the exec statement to run in the foreground , since Upstart only considers the job to be running for as long as this process is running .
If a process started using exec ends , Upstart considers the job to have ended and waits for another suitable event to occur ( waiting ) .
Upstart notes the status of each job listed in /etc / init .
This information can be viewed using the initctl list and initctl status Jobname commands .

The bookmaker has taken over the baggage hall in the arrivals area at Dublin Airport for the tongue - in - cheek campaign , which will run over the next two weeks on 42 illuminated posters .
Taking a playful shot at France striker Theirry Henry for his controversial handball last week in the World Cup qualifier against Ireland , Paddy Power 's posters read : " Paddy Power welcomes you to Ireland ... unless you 're called Theirry . "
Paddy Power said : " We 're a nation still reeling from last week 's controversial result in Paris so it 's refreshing to be able poke some fun back Thierry 's direction .
" It 's a safe bet that he wo n't be travelling through Dublin Airport anytime time but if he does , our adverts will be waiting . "
Following last Wednesday 's match , digital agency Love Manchester also took a cheeky shot at Henry , spoofing French brand Le Coq Sportif by creating Le Coq un -Sportif t- shirts .
A young Iraqi woman died tonight in Arizona because her father believed she had become too Westernized .
Noor Faleh Almaleki , the 20 - year old pictured here , moved to the Phoenix area in the mid-90s with her family .
Her father , Faleh Hassan Almaleki , feared that her American upbringing had led her to abandon traditional Iraqi values .
He opposed the way she dressed and the way she resisted his rules .
So on October 20th , he ran over her and another woman , Amal Khalaf , in his Jeep Grand Cherokee as they walked across a parking lot .
Khalaf — who is the daughter 's roommate and the mother of her boyfriend — survived , but the daughter died tonight in the hospital .
Her father is in police custody now after a failed attempt to escape to the UK via Mexico .
Iraqi woman , 20 , dies ; police in Arizona say father ran over her
We 've certainly seen plenty of hackintoshes in our time , but Will Urbina 's OS Xbox Pro is also one of the cleanest casemods we 've ever seen .
Built so that Will can run Final Cut Pro for his job as a video editor , the machine is based on an EFI - X hackintosh dongle , and inside it sports an 2.93 GHz Intel Core 2 Quad Q9550s paired with an NVIDIA GeForce 9800GT card , 8GB of RAM , an 16GB SSD , and four traditional hard drives : one each to boot Windows 7 and OS X , and two 500 GB 7,200rpm drives in a RAID0 array for video editing .
Will says his total parts cost was under $ 1,500 for a system that matches a $ 4,500 Mac Pro , but that obviously does n't include the value of his time -- which , judging by the totally captivating build video , should be plenty expensive .

Pursuant to new powers delegated to him by Congress , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has executed an order blocking the release of photos depicting the torture of detainees .
In doing so , it becomes highly unlikely that the Supreme Court will further consider making the photos public , as a lower court had ordered .
In a new supplemental brief [ PDF link ] filed with the high court , the administration ’s attorneys argue that the new law Congress passed to allow Gates this authority effectively exempts the photos from the Freedom of Information Act , therefore invalidating an earlier lawsuit .

“ It now seems likely that today ’s action will put an end to the issue , making it unnecessary for the court to hear the case , ” MSNBC reported .
The American Civil Liberties Union , which sought the photos ’ release , had urged Secretary Gates to release the photos .
In an open letter [ PDF link ] , the ACLU said the images must be seen because they show the “ pervasiveness ” of abuse across Iraq and Afghanistan and that it was “ aberrational . ”
“ The government has previously asserted that disclosing these photographs poses risks in part because it is a ‘ particularly critical time ’ in Iraq , Afghanistan , and Pakistan , ” ACLU attorneys Jameel Jaffer and Alexander A. Abdo noted at the letter ’s conclusion .
“ We accordingly ask that you review any decision to withhold any photographs every ninety days to account for changing circumstances . ”
“ In order to withhold the photos , Gates simply had to certify , as he did in the court filing , that ‘ public disclosure of these photographs would endanger citizens of the United States , members of the United States Armed Forces , or employees of the United States Government deployed outside the United States , ' ” Mother Jones reporter Nick Baumann noted .
“ In other words , their release had to endanger someone , somewhere .
And in the unlikely event that Gates had to stretch the truth to make that certification , it would n’t matter , since there ’s no provision in the law that allows any court to review Gates ’ determination or rule on whether it was truthful . ”
In a release condemning the president ’s signature of the law allowing Gates to block the photos , Jaffer continued : “ Secretary Gates should be guided by the importance of transparency to the democratic process , the extraordinary importance of these photos to the ongoing debate about the treatment of prisoners and the likelihood that the suppression of these photos would ultimately be far more damaging to national security than their disclosure .
The last administration ’s decision to endorse torture undermined the United States ’ moral authority and compromised its security .
A failure to fully confront the abuses of the last administration will only compound these harms . ”

The Supreme Court is expected to react by Monday .
We always knew that interest rate targeting could never work in theory , because it left the price level indeterminate .
But it seemed to work well in practice , and kept inflation close to target , so we eventually learned to overcome our theoretical squeamishness and embrace it as part of the reality of how modern central banks operate .
But now interest rate targeting has failed in practice , and failed badly .
It cannot keep inflation , and expected inflation , on target .
We want to loosen monetary policy .
And because monetary policy is interest rate targeting , we can't , because interest rates on safe liquid assets are already at zero .
OK , this is probably the weirdest post I have ever written .
I am going to argue that interest rate targeting is not what central banks really do ; it 's a social construction of what they really do .
Interest rate targeting is not reality , it 's a way of framing reality .
That was weird enough , but I 'm now going to get really weird .
The failure of monetary policy is not caused by anything central banks are actually doing ; it 's caused by central banks ' way of framing what they are doing , and by the rest of us accepting that same framing .
The current recession was caused by those ( and that includes especially central bankers themselves ) who think that central banks use an interest rate as the control instrument .
It 's the framing of what central banks do that caused the mess , not anything central banks are actually doing .
The social construction of reality is what dunnit !
Let me give an example of what I mean by " framing " .
It would be quite conventional to say that the Bank of Canada sets an overnight rate target as a function of various indicators , including inter alia the exchange rate .
Write that reaction function as i= F ( S , I ) , where i is the overnight rate , S the exchange rate , and I a vector of other indicators .
Now , just invert that reaction function and write it as S=G ( i , I ) .
Exactly the same thing mathematically , but see how the framing has changed .
Now the Bank of Canada is targeting the exchange rate as a function of various indicators , including inter alia the overnight rate .
The Bank of Canada is doing exactly the same thing , but the account it gives of what it is doing , the framing , has changed radically .
And the Americans would get mad at us if the Bank of Canada targeted too low an exchange rate !
Now here 's a real - life example of how the Bank of Canada has changed the way it frames monetary policy , and why framing matters .
The Bank of Canada used to construct and publish a " Monetary Conditions Index " which was a weighted average of the overnight rate and exchange rate .
And it would talk about what was happening to the MCI whenever it changed the overnight rate target .
This did not mean it kept the MCI constant over time .
It would adjust the overnight rate target and so adjust the MCI whenever it felt that the indicators warranted it .
But the Bank of Canada eventually stopped publishing the MCI , and stopped talking about the MCI , because it found the MCI interfered with the Bank 's " communications strategy " .
People were thinking of the stance of monetary policy in terms of the MCI , and the Bank wanted people to think about the stance of monetary policy in terms of the overnight rate target .
When it stopped publishing and talking about the MCI , the Bank wanted to change the framing of monetary policy .
And it succeeded , even though anyone with a calculator can construct the MCI from public data .
As any philosopher or sociologist can tell you , the way reality is socially constructed can have real effects .
" I may lawfully nourish myself from this tree ; but the fruit of another of the same species , ten paces off , it is criminal for me to touch .
Had I worn this apparel an hour ago , I had merited the severist punishment ; but a man , by pronouncing a few magical syllables , has now rendered it fit for my use and service ... " says David Hume .
( One fruit tree is on his land , the other is n't ; the guy said he could buy the clothes ) .
When one man body - slams another , is it a fight or a hockey game ?
A British visitor can't always tell the difference , and not because his eyesight is any worse than the Canadians who know how to frame what they are seeing .
One framing causes a cheer ; the other causes a call to the police .
How could a stranger , with good eyesight and a time series graph of all macro variables , really tell which one of those variables the Bank of Canada was targeting ?
OK , there is a way , if he has a very high - frequency data set .
The stranger would notice that the overnight rate tended either not to move , or else move in discrete jumps , about 8 times a year .
But if Fixed Announcement Dates were held monthly , or weekly , or daily , or hourly , the stranger would see nothing .
In the limit , with continuous FADs , the " fact " that the Bank of Canada targets the overnight rate would be only a socially constructed " fact " .
Since I do n't think hourly FAD 's would make much difference to policy , especially under current circumstances , when nobody expects the overnight rate to change anytime soon , I think I 'm safe in saying that interest rate targeting is at least 95 % a social construction of reality .
A socially constructed reality , like who owns what , is a game - theoretic equilibrium held in place by players ' shared expectations of how each would react to an out - of - equilibrium move , something they never of course observe in equilibrium .
They follow the rules because of what they think would happen if they did n't .
A given time path of overnight rates would be highly inflationary under one set of expectations about inflation and real output growth , and highly deflationary under another set of expectations about inflation and real output growth .
A time path of interest rates cannot measure the stance of monetary policy .
A time path of interest rates does not define a coherent monetary order .
An interest rate reaction function , with feedback from expectations to the time path of interest rates , might define a coherent monetary order .
( Equilibrium would be maintained by players ' shared expectations of what would happen out of equilibrium . )
We thought it did for a decade or two , but events have proved us wrong .
We have hit the zero limit where it can react no further , so all we have left is the time - path itself , rather than a reaction function .
If expectations of monetary policy coalesced around the time path of some nominal variable ( one with $ in the units ) , we could escape the liquidity trap .
Just let that time path for the nominal magnitude grow over time at a fast enough rate and the equilibrium overnight rate will rise above zero .
If monetary policy were framed as the central bank setting some nominal variable , expectations of monetary policy could then coalesce around that variable , monetary policy would be loosened , and the overnight rate , as some endogenous response to monetary policy , would rise above zero .
Under an alternative framing , a loosening of monetary policy would mean an increase in the overnight rate .
But we are stuck with framing monetary policy as setting an interest rate .
So there is no way the Bank of Canada can try to say that an increase in the overnight rate counts as a loosening of monetary policy .
Because given the way expectations are determined by the framing , it would be a tightening of monetary policy .
The Bank of Canada is fettered by its own social construction of what it is doing .
Oh hell , it 's late .
I 'm posting this anyway .
The high - end audio market has always been more about marketing than about music , but it's hard to say if we 've ever seen a product as phenomenally insane as the LessLoss BlackBody , a $ 959 block of metal that designer Louis Motek says " takes advantage of the quantum nature of particle interaction " to improve your stereo's sound quality by simply being in the same room .
How ?
" Your gear 's radiation is transformed into room - temperature blackbody radiation . "
Yeah -- and that 's just the tip of this crazy iceberg .
We can't say we believe it for a second , but LessLoss says that the BlackBody is so effective at altering " electromagnetic ambient conditions " that the quality improvement is obvious to " even non-audiophiles " listening to " a noisy home PC playing through your average SoundBlaster . "
That sounds like a challenge to us -- hit us up , LessLoss .
An up - and - coming folk singer has died after being attacked by coyotes in a national park in eastern Canada .
Taylor Mitchell , a 19 - year - old Toronto singer - songwriter , was hiking alone in the Cape Breton Highlands national park , Nova Scotia , on Tuesday when the attack occurred .
Brigdit Leger , a Royal Canadian Mounted police spokeswoman , said other hikers heard Mitchell 's screams and called for help .
" The coyotes were extremely aggressive , " Leger told the Toronto Star .
Officers reached the scene quickly and shot one of the animals , but Mitchell had suffered multiple bite wounds , the emergency health services said .
She was airlifted to a Halifax hospital in a critical condition and died yesterday .
Bob Bancroft , a retired biologist with the Nova Scotia department of natural resources , said coyote attacks were rare because the animals were usually shy .
" It 's very unusual and is not likely to be repeated , " he said .
Officials blocked the entrance to the trail where Mitchell was attacked and hung signs in English and French warning of coyotes .
Park rangers were looking out for the animals to determine what had prompted such an unusual attack .
The last known coyote attack in the park was in 2003 , when a teenager was bitten .
" There have been some reports of aggressive animals , so it 's not unknown , " said Helene Robichaud , the park 's superintendent .
" But we certainly never have had anything so dramatic and tragic . "
Mitchell had just earned her driving licence and embarked on a tour of the east coast to promote her new album .
On her MySpace page , Mitchell said her influences were " constantly evolving " but included Van Morrison , the Eagles and Neil Young .
Her manager , Lisa Weitz , described Mitchell , who was nominated for a 2009 Canadian folk music award in the young performer of the year category , as a " sweet , compassionate , vibrant , and phenomenally talented young woman " .
She added : " She was just exhilarated to be on the road and performing .
We are all devastated . "

Sequoia Voting Systems plans to publicly release the source code for its new optical scan voting system , the company announced Tuesday – a remarkable reversal for a voting machine maker long criticized for resisting public examination of its proprietary systems .
The company 's new public source optical - scan voting system , called Frontier Election System , will be submitted for federal certification and testing in the first quarter of next year .
The code will be released for public review in November , the company said , on its web site .
Sequoia ’s proprietary , closed systems are currently used in 16 states and the District of Columbia .
The announcement comes five days after a non-profit foundation announced the release of its open - source election software for public review .
Sequoia spokeswoman Michelle Shafer says the timing of its release is unrelated to the foundation 's announcement .
Open - source software allows the public to participate in the actual development of the software .
Whereas Sequoia 's public source , or disclosed - source , software only allows the public to see software that its developers have already created .
In the press release announcing the public - source system , a Sequoia vice president is quoted saying that " Security through obfuscation and secrecy is not security . "
" Fully disclosed source code is the path to true transparency and confidence in the voting process for all involved , " said Eric Coomer , vice president of research and product development for Sequoia , in the press release .
" Sequoia is proud to be the leader in providing the first publicly disclosed source code for a complete end - to - end election system from a leading supplier of voting systems and software . "
Sequoia in fact has been a champion of security through obscurity since it 's been selling voting systems .
The company has long had a reputation for vigorously fighting any efforts by academics , voting activists and others to examine the source code in its proprietary systems , and even threatened to sue Princeton University computer scientists if they disclosed anything learned from a court - ordered review of its software .
Princeton University computer scientist Ed Felten , one of the targets of Sequoia 's legal threats , said he was pleasantly surprised to see the company opening its new system to examination after vehemently resisting it in the past .
" I think Sequoia is recognizing that it wo n't do anymore to just urge people to trust them , " Felten said , " and that people want to know that the code that controls these machines is open and that experts have had a full chance to look at it . "
Given that Sequoia is now acknowledging the value of code disclosure as something that can lead to better security rather than worse security , as it has claimed in the past , Felten said " it seems that it should follow that they would now be willing to release code for all of their other products as well . "
Last year , a judge ordered New Jersey election officials to give source code for the state ’s Sequoia AVC Advantage touch - screen machines to Princeton University computer scientist Andrew Appel and others for a lawsuit that challenged the integrity of Sequoia ’s paperless machines .
Voting activists had sued the state to decommission the units out of security and reliability concerns .
Appel ’s team found several vulnerabilities with the system , but was n't able to discuss them publicly .
Appel , in a separate issue , also found a discrepancy between summary tapes printed from Sequoia touch - screen machines during New Jersey 's primary election and totals that were recorded on the machine ’s memory cards .
Summary tapes from machines in one district showed a phantom vote for then - presidential - candidate Barack Obama that did n’t appear in the memory card totals .
The Sequoia machines deployed to Union County , New Jersey , also showed that Republican presidential candidates received 61 votes when only 60 ballots had been cast in the Republican primary .
About 60 machines showed such discrepancies .
When Union County election officials announced that they planned to have Princeton academics examine the machines to determine what went wrong , Sequoia threatened a lawsuit .
Sequoia initially blamed the problem on election officials for pushing the wrong buttons , but later claimed it uncovered a problem in its software that was creating the vote errors and announced that it had fixed the issue .
Earlier this year , in a separate case , Sequoia agreed , after a concerted battle , to hand over its source code to election officials in Washington , DC , to investigate why , during the city ’s September 2008 primary election , Sequoia ’s optical - scan machines added about 1,500 " phantom " votes to races on ballots cast in one precinct .
Sequoia blamed the problem on “ static discharge ” or human error .
After the city demanded to look at the source code to determine the problem , Sequoia in turn demanded a $ 20 million bond from officials guaranteeing they would n’t disclose information about the system .
Sequoia finally relented to provide the code without a bond , though only after the city agreed to keep the company ’s trade secrets confidential .
The election integrity group Voters Unite has compiled a partial list of reported problems ( .pdf ) with Sequoia voting machines .
Spokeswoman Michelle Shafer said Sequoia 's public source system has been in the works for months , and that the announcement this week was timed for a National Institute of Standards and Technology workshop discussing a common data format for voting systems .
She said the firmware on the company 's new Frontier optical - scan machines is written in C# programming language and runs on Linux .
The election management software – which sits on a computer at the election office and is used to create ballots and tabulate votes – runs on Microsoft Windows XP and uses a Microsoft SQL database .
Pamela Smith , president of Verified Voting , a group that has long lobbied for fully auditable voting systems , applauded Sequoia 's efforts .
" It 's good to know the vendors are developing a new transparent optical - scan system , " she said .
" That is probably the biggest recognition of the direction that the voting public wants to see the market going . "
Asked if Sequoia 's history of hiding behind its proprietary code taints the sincerity of its public source effort , Smith said , " It 's never too late .
If you 're making a step toward a more transparent system , good for you .
That 's a good thing . "

Sandia researcher Rich Diver assembles a prototype device intended to chemically reenergize carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide , which ultimately could become the building block to synthesize a liquid combustible fuel .
Photo by Randy Montoya .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories have built a machine that uses the sun 's energy to convert carbon dioxide waste from power plants into transportation fuels such as gasoline , diesel , and jet fuel .
The system could provide an alternative to carbon sequestration ; instead of permanently storing CO2 underground , the CO2 could be recycled and put to use .
A prototype of the machine , which was invented by Sandia researcher Rich Diver , was tested recently for the first time .
Called the Counter - Rotating - Ring Receiver Reactor Recuperator ( CR5 ) , the cylindrical machine consists of two chambers on the sides and 14 rotating rings in the center .
The outer edges of the rings are made of iron oxide .
When the scientists heat the inside of one chamber to 1,500C with a solar concentrator , the iron oxide undergoes a thermo-chemical reaction where it gives up oxygen molecules .
As the rings rotate ( at one revolution per minute ) , the hot side approaches the opposite chamber and begins to cool down .
When carbon dioxide is pumped into this chamber , the iron oxide retrieves oxygen molecules from the carbon dioxide , transforming it into carbon monoxide .
The carbon monoxide could then serve as a building block to create a liquid combustible fuel .
Diver originally designed the machine to generate hydrogen without using electrolysis .
By substituting water for the carbon dioxide in the second chamber , the researchers can make the machine produce hydrogen .
Also , by mixing the resulting hydrogen with carbon monoxide , they can produce syngas .
It will probably take 15 - 20 years before the technology is ready for the market , with the biggest challenge being to increase the system 's efficiency .
The researchers ' goal is to achieve an efficiency of a few percent , which is about twice as efficient as photosynthesis ' real - world efficiency of 1 % .
One way to increase efficiency is to develop new ceramic composites that release oxygen molecules at lower temperatures .
" Ultimately , we believe we have to get in the range of 10 % sunlight - to - fuels , and we 're a long way from doing that , " said James Miller , a chemical engineer with Sandia 's advanced materials laboratory .

Former rookie NYC transit officer Christian Torres has pleaded guilty to twice robbing a Sovereign branch on the Lower East Side in 2007 .
The robberies netted $ 116,000 and were almost completely successful , thanks in part to his 20 - year - old girlfriend Christina Dasrath , who worked as a teller at the bank .
( She still claims Torres tricked her into helping him , and describes him as her first love . )
Torres , 23 , only got busted for those jobs when cops pulled him over after robbing $ 113,000 from a Sovereign branch in Pennsylvania last April .
Dasrath is currently serving a two and a half year sentence , and Torres is doing a ten year bid in the Keystone State .
While pleading guilty yesterday , Torres blamed the crime spree on the low salaries allotted rookie cops .
At the time of the robberies , rookie pay for NYPD officers was $ 25,100 ; it 's since been increased almost 10 percent .
Torres told the judge , " I knew it was wrong .
I knew it was illegal .
I agreed because my dream of entering the academy [ would n't have happened ] .
I could n't afford my rent .
I could n't pay my bills . "
According to the AP , Torres could get more than eight years in prison for the NYC holdups when he 's sentenced in November ; the Post reports that he could face up to 60 years behind bars .

As if the mists were unknown

A new theory suggests that dreams are a warm - up for the day ahead
Dreams are so rich and have such an authentic feeling that scientists have long assumed they must have a crucial psychological purpose .
To Freud , dreaming provided a playground for the unconscious mind ; to Jung , it was a stage where the psyche 's archetypes acted out primal themes .
Newer theories hold that dreams help the brain to consolidate emotional memories or to work though current problems , like divorce and work frustrations .
Yet what if the primary purpose of dreaming is n't psychological at all ?
In a paper published last month in the journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience , Dr J Allan Hobson , a psychiatrist and longtime sleep researcher at Harvard , argues that the main function of rapid - eye - movement sleep , or REM , when most dreaming occurs , is physiological .
The brain is warming its circuits , anticipating the sights and sounds and emotions of waking .
" It helps explain a lot of things , like why people forget so many dreams , " Dr Hobson said in an interview .
" It 's like jogging ; the body does n't remember every step , but it knows it has exercised .
It has been tuned up .
It 's the same idea here : dreams are tuning the mind for conscious awareness . "
Drawing on work of his own and others , Dr Hobson argues that dreaming is a parallel state of consciousness that is continually running but normally suppressed during waking .
The idea is a prominent example of how neuroscience is altering assumptions about everyday ( or every - night ) brain functions .
" Most people who have studied dreams start out with some predetermined psychological ideas and try to make dreaming fit those , " said Dr Mark Mahowald , a neurologist who is director of the sleep disorders program at Hennepin County Medical Center , in Minneapolis .
" What I like about this new paper is that he does n't make any assumptions about what dreaming is doing . "

US National Security Adviser James L. Jones on Afghanistan ' We Will Not Solve the Problem with Troops Alone '
US National Security Adviser James L. Jones talks to SPIEGEL about his skepticism regarding calls for more US troops to be sent to Afghanistan , the chances of Pakistan 's nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands and President Barack Obama 's leadership style .
The brochure suggests trying poses in front of a mirror , including the full - frontal contrapposto of Michelangelo ’s David .
Oh , and to get over embarrassment , “ it may help to do some sort of naturist / nudist recreation . ”
That , frankly , brought me up short .
Where are the naturist activities around State College ?
Professor Garoian told me that the fine arts program has a hard time finding enough models .
Embarrassment , in fact , is an occupational hazard .
After all , one of the most common recurring nightmares is the naked - in - public dream .
Even Sam , who has never been easily embarrassed , admitted that as he approached the initial experience it all felt a bit strange .
“ The first time you get naked in front of a lot of people it ’s pretty weird , ” he said .
“ There was a lot of buildup to that moment .
All of a sudden , I have to do something that ’s not socially acceptable in any other setting , and at the same time become the center of attention . ”
He tried to rationalize : he had spent plenty of time without a stitch on in the locker room for football , wrestling and lacrosse , and had wrestled in a skintight singlet that left little to the imagination .
“ All that is fine until you actually have to take your clothes off , ” he told me later .
“ All the alarms in your brain say : ‘ This is wrong !
You ’re not supposed to be naked in front of people ! ’ ”
As he was considering this , the teacher said , “ Whenever you ’re ready . ”
So he took off his clothes and struck a pose .
There were about 40 students there on that first day , mostly women .
Eventually , he relaxed .
“ After 30 minutes it was n’t weird anymore . ”
In those same 30 minutes , however , he learned that holding yourself immobile is more difficult than it might seem .
Muscles tense and tingle , and cramps begin to announce themselves .
Also , a room that is comfortable for a group of people wearing clothes is chilly for someone wearing no clothes at all .
Still , he got through two sets of poses that first class .
After he put his clothes on , he got to look at the results .
“ For the most part , I was pleased with the drawings , ” he said , though one artist - in - training “ drew me with a slightly bigger gut than the others .
That was kind of an issue for me , but I moved past that . ”
Borough Market : A place for love .
But not Vegetarians .
I feel like I need to start this off with some sort of caveat about my complex and often contradictory feelings towards vegetarians .
Some of my closest friends eschew flesh , which I personally find insane but acknowledge it as a legitimate lifestyle choice for others ( sort of like skinny jeans ) .
After all , it literally leaves more meat for me .
By pure definition of being my friends , the vegetarians in my life are understanding and non-judgmental ( I seek out in others the characteristics I lack ) and consequently would not dream of giving someone a hard time for being , say , an indiscriminate , blood - slurping carnivore .
It is the judgmental vegetarians with whom I have a problem .
The holier - than - thou , that - thing - you ’re - eating - was - once - alive , I ’m - cranky - because - I - do n ’t - get - enough - protein jerks who I have had the occassional misfortune of encountering .
Those vegetarians suck .
I would gladly take one of those vegetarians to Borough Market , because they would FREAK THE HELL OUT .
Oh , how they would freak out .
Because Borough Market is a carnivore ’s dream come true .
An endless stream of meats culled from all sorts of magically delicious animals , prepared in every way imaginable , and served up piping hot .
For a girl like me , raised on tripe and pig ’s feet , and all manner of offal that I assumed everyone else ate , it ’s like the lovechild of Disneyland and a slab of bacon .
In other words , if you are in London , go , go , GO .
Rand and I went on the recommendation of some friends of ours who were locals .
Upon first arriving , we were seriously disappointed …
We kept walking , and found that the market expanded far beyond the near - empty pavillion we found ourselves in .
I was on a mission for steak and kidney pie , and was determined not to settle for something else .
Rand , on the other hand , just wanted something really , really delicious .
We saw some guys who were on their lunch break eating fresh - cooked ravioli , and Rand asked them what they thought .
I will tell you now , asking an Englishman what he thinks of his food is an absolutely pointless exercise .
Putting issues of a dark culinary history aside , England is really coming into its own , gastronomically speaking .
There are some amazing places to eat in London .
The problem is that you wo n’t get a straight answer out of anyone as to which places are good , and which are rubbish .
Maybe they ca n’t tell .
Or maybe they ’re too polite to tell .
But I will say this :
We had some fantastic food , and some utter crap food , both of which was described as “ quite nice ” by the locals around us .
So when Rand asked the guys about the ravioli , and they said , “ It ’s quite nice , ” it meant absolutely nothing .
But it looked really good , and was ridiculously fresh , so Rand went ahead and ordered some .
Holy crap .
It was friggin fantastic .
We got a mix of spinach - ricotta ravioli and beef ravioli , both in a sage - brown - butter sauce .
It was dense and chewy without being too heavy , and perfectly seasoned .
I told Rand , “ I want to get that ravioli pregnant ” and the guys behind the counter just stared at me .
I ’m fairly sure the above photo was taken minutes before I tried to wrestle that ravioli out of Rand ’s hand .
There might have been some pushing and shoving involved .
There might have been cries of “ YOU LOVE THE RAVIOLI MORE THAN ME ! ” and responses of “ YOU’RE GODDAMN RIGHT I DO ! ”
All for what the English guys described at “ quite nice ” .
Seriously , England .
Get on the ball .
If you show passion about something , people will try to present you with the best articulation of that thing .
It ’s why Americans are crap at soccer – we just do n’t care about it .
That ’s why the Italians are good at making wine .
And it ’s why English food has historically sucked .
Because if I serve you crap , and I serve you something fantastic , and your reaction is the same , what the hell is my incentive ?
My point is , your love for something should be apparent .
And that goes well beyond just food .
Phew .
Okay , sorry .
Rant over .
Let ’s get back to the carnivore ’s dream that is Borough .
I call this photo “ Moderately Attractive and the Beast ” :
–
And , call me perverse , but I find the way this lamb ’s little legs are sticking up in the air kind of cute :
–
Too much ?
Okay , fine .
Here ’s a photo of vegetables :
–
There .
Can we go back to talking about meat now ?
Good .
I took this photo for a friend of mine .
Make up your own joke :
Since we ’re still deliriously happy from the results of Tuesday ’s election and the passing of Referendum 71 , I figure I can make a few off - color comments .
–
And then we found Jamon Iberico from Spain .
Oh , joy of joys .
It ’s acorn - fed , and very similar to prosciutto , though the meat feels … I do n’t know – darker ?
More rustic ?
I feel like the jamon is to prosciutto what country pate is to smooth terrine ( man , do I love analogies that compare food to food ! ) .
They had this fantastic contraption holding the leg in place while the kid behind the counter sliced off pieces and offered us a taste .
I have to admit , even for me , the site of the pig ’s hoof at the end was a bit shocking .
Awesome , but shocking :
Still , I ’m all for owning up to where your food comes from , for realizing and acknowledging that meat does n’t magically come in plastic packages .
It reminded me of the leg of cured ham my mom would buy from Path Super Foods when we lived in Indialantic , Florida .
With a huge pig ’s leg sitting in your fridge , you ca n’t really deny anything .
It kept us honest carnivores , I think .
And it was delicious .
–
But I might have gotten a bit off - track – both at the market and in this post .
As you ’ll remember , this whole time I was looking for a hot steak and kidney pie , and there did n’t seem to be any about .
Some places were sold out of hot ones , or out of steak - and - kidney pies in general .
There were cold meat pies of every variety , and I was nearly tempted by the wild game variety that we saw at one stand …
I managed to walk away , though .
I figured I could n’t come this far and then settle for something less than what I wanted .
And then , at an unassuming stand with a sign that read , simply , “ Handmade by me .
England ’s Best Pies , ” there was exactly one hot steak - and - kidney pie left .
And it was perfect .
–
It ’s funny , because I tried to think of the last time I looked at anything that way , and found this :
It ’s just one of those moments where you get exactly what you want .
For me , it happens when I ’m either marrying the love of my life , or have just found really , really good food .
There ’s a part in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory , where Wonka says , “ Do n’t forget what happened to the boy who suddenly got everything he ever wanted . ”
I remember feeling my heart pinch the first time I heard that .
Here , amidst all of Charlie ’s joy and candy , there was going to be a moral , and I wanted no part of it .
I felt fear in my heart when Charlie asked what happened to the boy .
And then Wonka replied , “ He lived happily ever after . ”
And so did we .

The report said parenting style was more influential than income Children brought up according to " tough love " principles are more successful in life , according to a study .
The think tank Demos says a balance of warmth and discipline improved social skills more than a laissez - faire , authoritarian or disengaged upbringing .
It says children aged five with " tough love " parents were twice as likely to show good character capabilities .
Report author Jen Lexmond said : " It is confidence , warmth and consistent discipline that matter most . "
Life chances
According to the report , qualities such as application , self - regulation and empathy were more likely to be developed in children whose parents employed a " tough love " approach .
It found that these qualities made " a vital contribution to life chances , mobility and opportunity " .
The report said these characteristics were profoundly shaped in pre-school years .
The most important influence is the quality of parenting
Building Character report The Building Character report analysed data from more than 9,000 households in the UK .
It found that children from the richest backgrounds were more than twice as likely to develop the key characteristics compared to those with the poorest origins .
Additionally , children whose parents were married were twice as likely to show such traits than children from lone parent or step - parented families , the report said .
But it added that when parental style and confidence were factored in , the difference in child character development between richer and poorer families disappeared .
The report concluded that this indicated that parenting was the most important influence - and the same result occurred when the family structure factor was analysed .
The report said that other positive influences included the main carer 's level of education , and breast - feeding .
Girls were more likely to develop character capabilities by age five , while no connection was found between paid employment of either parent and children 's characteristics .
The authors urged more support and information for families , and for children with disengaged or low - income parents to be given particular focus .
They recommended that the government 's Sure Start programme should be refocused as a tool for early intervention , with less emphasis on childcare and more on development ; improved pilots for the Family Nurse Partnership ; and for health visitors to be given an early years role to help with parenting .
' Ambitious agenda '
" There is some evidence that lower - income households face more difficulty in incubating these character capabilities , " the report said .
" But the most important influence is the quality of parenting .
" Confident , skilful parents adopting a ' tough love ' approach to parenting , balancing warmth with discipline , seem to be most effective in terms of generating these key character capabilities .
" An ambitious agenda for equality of opportunity will need to take the development of these capabilities seriously . "
Ms Lexmond added : " Far from a ' soft ' skill , character is integral to our future success and wellbeing . "
Parentline Plus chief executive Jeremy Todd said the charity also supported the call for increased help for families .
But he said different children reacted differently to parenting styles .
" If we are to reduce the strangle - hold of cycles of deprivation , the issue of how we support families to raise children must be grasped , " Mr Todd added .
" We welcome this report and hope that it stimulates debate among policy makers around how best to support families to transform our society into one where we top the league tables for outcomes for children and well - being . "

Harsh rhetoric from the leaders of both countries accompanied by an unusually high deployment of military hardware .
US politicians should take heed : fracturing a society is far easier than healing it .
The need for factual and fair reporting is more important than ever .
Anthony Borden IWPR Executive Director
6 April 2020
The Covid - 19 pandemic is a global crisis of health and the economy – and of information .
Rumour and misinformation , fake news and propaganda , spread even more quickly than the virus itself , undermining health strategies , sowing confusion , costing lives .
Amid the tragedy , the need for factual and fair reporting is more important than ever .
Citizens need to be informed , officials need to be questioned , human stories need to be told .
While the international focus for now may be on the United States and the European Union , the varying responses – and the enormous risk – in the rest of the world are no less urgent .
If ever the world faced one problem together , this – along with climate change – is it .
Local voices of independent media and civic groups around the world are therefore absolutely essential , but they face fresh and sharp challenges .
How will the virus impact conflict zones , and especially those at particular risk such as refugees – and how can these issues be safely reported ?
How can reporting and engagement continue under social distancing and lockdown ?
What are the specific information and approaches essential to urgent health and public policy reporting ?
Will repressive regimes exploit the pandemic to crack down further on freedom of expression ?
Rumour and misinformation , fake news and propaganda , spread even more quickly than the virus itself , undermining health strategies , sowing confusion , costing lives .
At IWPR , we have had to shutter our ten coordinating offices , and are working virtually .
Yet our team of 150 around the world , and our dozens of partner organisations , continue to support vital local partners , independent media and forthright civic activists as they continue their efforts and in many cases pivot to cover the pandemic .
Through a series of research initiatives , IWPR is coordinating an international network of institutes , universities and other partners to monitor disinformation around the world and analyse trends and impacts around messaging on Covid - 19 .
Across Asia , we are working with a range of groups and individuals to strengthen community responses to news manipulation around the virus , and are supporting journalists and other opinion formers to investigate and report to regional audiences on the crisis and governmental responses .
Spanning the broad Southeast Europe and Eurasia region , we are assessing and comparing public health strategies , highlighting human impacts and holding governments to account for their emergency responses .
( Armenia : Can Government Popularity Weather Covid - 19 ? )
We are tracking the impact of Russian disinformation in fuelling panic and seeding public distrust in national governments ( Georgia : Is Russia Exploiting Coronavirus Fears ? ) or how the virus is impacting complex regional economic and social ties ( Coronavirus Tests Central Asia ’s Strength ) .
In former conflict areas , we have even found good news , with former political foes in the ethnically riven state of Bosnia and Herzegovina finally uniting for the common good ( Bosnia : Coronavirus Forces Rare Moment of Unity ) .
In the Middle East and North Africa region , independent voices are also finding common purposes with official efforts .
( Coronavirus Cannot Kill Our Spirit ) .
In Iraq , IWPR ’s longstanding network of journalists and leading opinion formers have dedicated themselves to supporting public health efforts .
Indeed , in several countries in the region , civic activists are now cooperating with governments that only weeks ago were trying to supress their protests .
( Iraqi Champions Fight Coronavirus Crisis ) .
In some Latin American countries , heads of state have been using their propaganda machines to spread disinformation about how individuals should tackle the virus , as well as their government 's response .
IWPR is supporting a coalition of independent media outlets in Latin America to coordinate coverage of the Covid - 19 pandemic to ensure people get the most up - to - date and accurate information possible – including providing fact - checked information on infection levels and republishing key stories to ensure they reach as wide an audience as possible .
We ’ve also partnered with a group of 15 social media influencers with broad youth appeal in their respective countries to develop online campaigns to ensure young people are also informed about how to best face the pandemic .
The suspension , for now , of in - person meetings is a loss .
Only a few weeks ago , I participated in a remarkable seminar IWPR hosted in Cyprus for journalists and activists from across the Middle East , sharing experiences , providing training and information , extending support networks .
As I was reminded first - hand , such personal connections are so powerful .
Like educational institutions worldwide , however , IWPR is working via video conferencing , online platforms and other dedicated technologies , sharing vital resources , monitoring health and safety , supporting those ill or otherwise affected and continuing intensive training , mentoring and content production .
We have not , and will not , go away .
Part of the “ exit strategy ” from lockdowns and from the crisis as a whole must be free and fair information to empower and involve the global public – for now , and for the future , helping courageous local voices to drive change in their communities wherever they are .
The future will bring a new normal that cannot yet be confidently described .
But with nearly three decades ’ experience in dangerous environments , IWPR teams at the frontlines will stay the course , innovating creative and often courageous solutions to support independent local voices in challenging environments around the world .
It is truly one world now , and all our futures depend on it .
An African elephant .
Poachers " wiped out " the entire elephant herd in Sierra Leone 's only wildlife park , wildlife managers said Thursday after police said they had arrested a gang of 10 poachers .
Poachers " wiped out " the entire elephant herd in Sierra Leone 's only wildlife park , wildlife managers said Thursday after police said they had arrested a gang of 10 poachers .
" It is likely that the elephant population is wiped out , " Ibrahim Bangura , senior superintendent of the agriculture ministry 's Conservation and Wildlife Management Unit .
The six elephants were shot and " crudely butchered , their bodies slashed with sword marks and their tusks virtually wrenched from their skins , " said Bangura .
Police said 10 poachers were arrested after the discovery of the elephant carcasses and those of four buffaloes in Outamba Kilimni national park , near the border with Guinea .
The men , from Sierra Leone and Guinea , are being held in the northern town of Koinadugu .
" We believe the killing was done between September and October and this is a great blow to all of us , " said Bangura .
" We had treasured the elephant population in the park as they are very important to the development of ecotourism in the country . "
Tourism Ministry officials said a crack military unit has been stationed near the park after frequent incursions by poachers from Guinea and Mali hunting wild animals .

Notice the peculiar pattern on the following book covers ?
See the pattern ?
All of the women displayed are missing part of their face or head and all of them are missing eyes .
( Although I stopped after twenty - one , I could have selected dozens more . )
I started looking for examples after this phenomena was pointed out by A.G. Harmon at Image magazine :
Aber der Rest des Vertrages ist eine einzige Katastrophe .
Gerichtsvollzieher sollen privatisiert werden ( warum nicht auch gleich das US - Konzept der Bounty Hunter importieren ?
Das schafft Arbeitsplätze !1!! ) .
Unternehmensverbunde sollen wieder Verluste aus Sparte A mit den Gewinnen von Sparte B verrechnen dürfen ( oder auf Deutsch : kein Unternehmen wird jemals wieder Steuern zahlen , wenn sie es nicht absichtlich darauf anlegen ) .
Und falls das nicht reicht , soll die Zinsschranke auf 3 Millionen erhöht werden .
Die Zinsschranke ist dafür da , …
In der Vergangenheit hatten global agierende Unternehmen durch Kapitalzuführung aus dem Ausland erreicht , dass in Deutschland steuerlich abzugsfähiger Zinsaufwand entsteht , die Zinserträge dagegen im Ausland erfasst werden .
Die Zinsschranke dient in erster Linie der Vermeidung dieser grenzüberschreitenden Gestaltungen .
Die Formulierungen sind auch ansonsten ganz großes Kino .
So tun sie gar nicht mehr so , als habe " Biokraftstoff " was mit Umweltschutz zu tun ( das Gegenteil ist der Fall ) .
Humoristisch sehr hochwertig ist auch , wie sie die Erbschaftssteuerentkernung als Impuls verkaufen , der Deutschland aus der Krise führen soll .
Dabei sind die Erbschaften genau der dynastieerhaltende Baustein , der die Ober - von der Mittelklasse trennt und eine gerechtere Gesellschaft verhindert .
Außerdem will man den Normenkontrollrat stärken , der ja der Lange Arm von Bertelsmann ( und INSM ) in der Politik ist .
Tolle Wurst .
Großartig ist auch der Beitrag zur Bankenkrise , den ich mal zitieren muss , so toll ist der :
Das Insolvenzrecht muss den neuen Herausforderungen angepasst werden .
Wir werden ein Instrumentarium schaffen , dass es der Bankenaufsicht frühzeitig ermöglicht , systemrelevante Finanzinstitute im Rahmen eines geordneten Verfahrens zu restrukturieren .
Die Regulierung der Netze soll nicht nur niedrige Nutzungsentgelte im Blick behalten , sondern auch qualitative Elemente berücksichtigen , um so schnelle und längerfristige Investitionen auszulösen .
Wir stehen für eine solide Haushalts - und Finanzpolitik .
Um Arbeitssuchende noch erfolgreicher in sozialversicherungspflichtige Beschäftigung vermitteln zu können , [… ]
Die Energiepolitik ist wie erwartet : weiter Kohlekraftwerke bauen , Atomkraftwerke laufen lassen , Asse schließen ( harhar ) , Gorleben weiter erkunden .
Oh und damit die betroffenen Regionen sich nicht weiter wehren , sollen sie " einen gerechten Ausgleich " bekommen .
Also , mit anderen Worten , sie sollen bestochen werden .
Immerhin hat auch Schwarz - Geld eingesehen , dass man die Energiemafia so nicht weitermachen lassen kann , und will die Übertragungsnetze ausgliedern .
Sie halten auch am Emissionshandel fest ( * stöhn * ) , und nennen " Biokraftstoffe der zweiten Generation " explizit als Energieforschungsziel .
Sie bezeichnen die Bahnreform als " erfolgreich " und wollen die Transport - und Logistiksparten doch noch an die Börse bringen , das Schienennetz und die Bahnhöfe aber behalten ( immerhin ! ) .
Und noch ein Neusprech - Klassiker bei der Ernährungspolitik :
Eine politische Steuerung des Konsums und Bevormundung der Verbraucher durch Werbeverbote und Strafsteuern für vermeintlich ungesunde Lebensmittel lehnen wir ab .
Ein farblich unterlegtes Ampelsystem zur Nährwert - Kennzeichnung führt die Verbraucher in die Irre .
Und noch ein Highlight , das seines Gleichen sucht : sie begründen ernsthaft die Fortführung der Agrarsubvention für brachliegende Grünflächen damit , dass das ja CO2 aufnimmt .
* schenkelklopf * Ich brauche mehr Popcorn !
Für Neusprech - Forscher ist das eine Goldgrube .
Ausbildungshemmnisse im Gastgewerbe werden durch ein flexibleres Jugendarbeitsschutzgesetz abgebaut .
Für die Aktivisten , die sich gegen das BKA - Gesetz gewehrt haben , kommt die Passage dazu wie ein Schlag in die Magengegend :
Wir sind uns mit dem Bundesverfassungsgericht einig , dass ein letzter unantastbarer Bereich menschlicher Freiheit besteht , der der Einwirkung der öffentlichen Gewalt entzogen ist . [… ]
Daher werden wir auf Grundlage der verfassungsgerichtlichen Rechtsprechung das BKA - Gesetz daraufhin überprüfen , ob und inwieweit der Schutz des Kernbereichs privater Lebensgestaltung zu verbessern ist .
Wir sind uns darüber einig , dass es notwendig ist , derartige kriminelle Angebote schnellstmöglich zu löschen statt diese zu sperren .
Darüber hinaus stärken wir den Beschlagnahmeschutz für Journalisten .
Künftig wird eine Beschlagnahme nur noch bei einem dringenden Tatverdacht gegen den Journalisten möglich sein .
Und natürlich reagieren sie auch auf die Prügelpolizisten - Affäre , indem sie die Prügelpolizisten besser schützen wollen durch Stärkung des Paragraphen 113 StGB , dem üblichen Instrument der Polizei gegen die , die Kritik vorzubringen wagen .
Ich für meinen
Teil halte den Paragraphen für vollständig überflüssig , denn die Polizisten haben bereits das Gewaltmonopol und wenn jemand mit einer Waffe gegen sie vorgeht , verletzt das das Waffenrecht , und auch Körperverletzung und co sind bereits so strafbar .
Das ist ein reiner Willkürparagraph .
Kein Wunder also , dass die Schwarze Pest ihn stärken will .
Oh und das war es noch nicht mit Stärkung des Polizeistaates .
Hier ist noch eine krasse Fehlentwicklung :
Wir werden eine gesetzliche Verpflichtung schaffen , wonach Zeugen im Ermittlungsverfahren nicht nur vor dem Richter und dem Staatsanwalt , sondern auch vor der Polizei erscheinen und - unbeschadet gesetzlicher Zeugenrechte - zur Sache aussagen müssen .
Oh und auch nicht sonderlich überraschend sollen das Patent - und Markenrecht weiter verstärkt werden , als ob das nicht schon jetzt viel zu stark wäre .
Und falls sich jemand gegen diese ganzen Knebelvorschriften wehren will … auch daran haben sie gedacht und wollen die Prozesskostenhilfe zusammenstreichen .
Am Ende gibt es dann noch eine Packung transatlantisches Brownnosing , ein paar " EU stärken " und " freier Binnenmarkt " Lippenbekenntnisse ( kurz vorher schreiben sie , wie sie die Gesetze nicht harmonisieren wollen , weil das ein Standortvorteil Deutschland sei ) und eine Runde " Wir bekennen uns zur besonderen Verantwortung Deutschlands gegenüber Israel als jüdischem Staat " , gekrönt von diesem grandiosen Satz :
Die Bundeswehr ist ein wesentliches Instrument deutscher Friedenspolitik .
Update :
Hier kommt gerade von Juristen die Zusatzinfo rein , dass § 113 mit weniger Strafe bewährt ist als die sonst einschlägigen Paragraphen und es daher gut ist , dass es den gibt .
Ich ziehe daher meine Kritik oben zurück .
REPORTS of environmental protesters throwing rocks at cars to disrupt the World Rally Championships in NSW last week , which led to the cancellation to two stages of the race , now appear to be false .
Motorsport stars Sebastian Loeb and Mikko Hirvonen had to be escorted around sections of the track near Murwillumbah in northern NSW after claims that leading drivers were pelted with rocks by demonstrators last Friday .
Police issued a statement condemning protesters for the supposed attacks and mounted a search operation to find the culprits .
The issue was picked up by major media organisations around the world .
The alleged incident took place in a tense atmosphere coloured by bizarre rumours that dead , frozen koalas would be thrown onto the race track by people who objected to the race being held in a national park .
In 1985 , Canada and the United States signed the Pacific Salmon Treaty .
Â
This treaty was established “ for the conservation , rational management , and optimum production of Pacific Salmon ” .
Â
It provided for both countries to set limits , share information , and improve habitat .
Â
One key disagreement the treaty sought to resolve was the “ overharvest by one country of the other countryâ€™s fish . ”
Â
For the past three years , poor salmon runs have caused Alaska not to meet its treaty commitments .
Â
This year ’s salmon runs are also in jeopardy . Â

Article III of the Pacific Salmon Treaty outlines the principles of the agreement :
1 . With respect to stocks subject to this Treaty , each Party shall conduct its fisheries and its salmon enhancement programs so as to : ( a ) prevent overfishing and provide for optimum production ; and ( b ) provide for each Party to receive benefits equivalent to the production of salmon originating in its waters .
2 . In fulfilling their obligations pursuant to paragraph 1 , the Parties shall cooperate in management , research and enhancement .
3 . In fulfilling their obligations pursuant to paragraph 1 , the Parties shall take into account : ( a ) the desirability in most cases of reducing interceptions ; and ( b ) the desirability in most cases of avoiding undue disruption of existing fisheries ; and ( c ) annual variations in abundance of the stocks .
Alaska has reduced fishing in order to try and meet treaty obligations .
The Fairbanks News Miner reports :
Even with major cuts in subsistence fishing up and down the Yukon River , the number of king salmon that reach the Canadian border might not satisfy a treaty agreement between Alaska and Canada .
With an estimated 75 percent of the chinook run accounted for , biologists are projecting the size of this yearâ€™s run to be 120,000 to 130,000 .
Somewhere around 50,000 to 55,000 of those fish will have to make it to Canada to meet Canadian escapement and harvest objectives , biologist Steve Hayes said .
According Hayes , genetic testing has revealed more Canadian fish in this year ’s run , even though the numbers are about the same as last year for the total run .
Â
A sonar counter is in place to count the fish as they cross the Canadian border .
Â
Subsistence fisherman in Alaska are upset as their season has been restricted , and they blame the government for mismanaging the resource that allow multinational pollock boats to harvest salmon as a “ bycatch ” .
Â
Others accuse Alaska of not enforcing closures .
This is not the first time the US has violated the Pacific Salmon Treaty .
Â Â In 1997 , “ the Canadian government formally accused the United States of violating the 1985 Pacific Salmon Treaty and requested that the United States submit the issue to binding arbitration .
The next day , angry Canadian fishers began a three - day blockade of the U.S. ferry Malaspina when it entered port in Prince Rupert , British Columbia . ”
Â
Will this year ’s poor King Salmon runs spark another round of the Pacific Salmon War ?
This one should be taken with a gigantic pinch of salt until some official confirmation arrives , but a few rumored Daft Punk concert dates have been leaked online .
The source for these shows is an Australian website named Undercover , which says : “ A source close to the band has leaked Daft Punk ’s proposed tour dates for 2010 , including dates in Melbourne and Sydney . ”
Is Daft Punk really big enough to sell out Yankee Stadium ?
They did play at Keyspan Park in Coney Island on their last visit to the city in 2007 — a show they comfortably sold out .
But playing Yankee Stadium is a far larger proposition .
The other shows are all is arena - sized venues , including a date in Daft Punk ’s native Paris .
Currently , they are thought to be working on the soundtrack to Tron Legacy .
Rumored daft Punk 2010 shows :
07.30 Paris : Le Zénith ,
08.01 Amsterdam : Heineken Music Hall
08.03 Munich : Allianz Arena
08.05 Dublin : O2
08.07 Nice : Parc De Sports
08.15 New York : Yankee Stadium
08.22 Sydney : Football Stadium
08.28 Melbourne : Olympic Park Stadium
09.03 London : Wembley Arena
09.06 Manchester : MEN Arena

Australian Camels Attacking Town Ordered To Be Killed
The thousands of camels attacking a Northern Territory , Australia town were ordered to be rounded up and be killed out of town where they will be left dead .
An animal rights group is contesting the decision .
The 350 residents of Docker River are being besieged by about 6000 camels for some weeks now .
The animals were looking for water as an effect by an ongoing drought .
They have been trampling fences , destroying water tanks , even taking water from air conditioning units .
The plan is to herd the camels by helicopters nine miles out of town into the desert .
They will be shot from the air and they will leave the animals where they fell to decay .
The move , as a local official have said , is an urgent action since the situation is highly unusual and getting out of control .
An advocacy group , Animals Australia , criticized that the plan is barbaric and called for to instead focus the attention in building barriers to keep the camels out of the town .
A Philippine politician ordered soldiers , police and other gunmen to kill at least 57 defenceless people in a horrifying slaughter that saw women shot in the genitals , the government alleges .
In the most detailed account yet of Monday 's election - linked massacre , which has sent shockwaves through the South - East Asian nation , an emotional Justice Secretary Agnes Devanadera said female victims may have also been raped .
" It was horrible .
I cannot begin to describe it , " Ms Devanadera told the GMA television network , recounting what she had seen of the bodies as well as the testimony of many of those who had taken part in the killings .
Ms Devanadera said the witnesses told prosecutors that local mayor Andal Ampatuan Jnr ordered his private militia of more than 100 gunmen to open fire on the group of people on a remote farming area in the southern Philippines .
The gunmen had a short time earlier abducted a convoy of aides and relatives of a rival Muslim politician , Esmael Mangudadatu , plus a batch of local journalists .
The group had been travelling to an election office so Mr Mangudadatu 's wife could nominate him to run against Ampatuan Jnr for the post of Maguindanao province governor in next year 's elections .
Fifty - seven bodies have since been recovered from shallow graves in the killing fields close to a town bearing the Ampatuan name .
At least 22 of the victims were women , police said .
Twenty - seven victims were journalists and 15 were motorists who were driving past the area at the wrong time , all of whom were apparently killed to eliminate witnesses .
Ampatuan Jnr , who surrendered to authorities on Thursday and was taken to Manila where he was expected to be charged with mass murder , has denied any involvement and blamed Muslim rebels for the killings .
Authorities had already said that hundreds of policemen believed loyal to Ampatuan 's powerful clan in Maguindanao province had been detained and suspected of being directly involved or linked to the massacre .
Ampatuan Jnr is the son of Maguindanao 's governor , a Muslim clan chief of the same name who until this week was a close ally of President Gloria Arroyo 's ruling coalition .

Grayson : " I think that the Democrats have been fooled now for months , by this , this fantasy of bipartisanship .
Bipartisanship is a concept that 's become a Weapon of Mass Distraction to keep us from actually doing what we need to do , to give people in this country universal health care , to give them affordable health care , and to give them comprehensive health care , because a lot of people find they get all the health care they need as long as they do n't need any .
And that has to end , that 's not what America is entitled to , and that 's not the kind of America most people want to see , but instead we get bogged down in these nuscances .
I do n't remember hearing a lot about bipartisanship when we were talking about tax cuts to the rich . "
Maddow : " Do you think that Democrats are starting to rise to the occasion on health reform ?
Do you think they 're , they 're fighting more , appeasing less when it comes to real health reform ? "
Grayson : " I think so .
Since I pointed out that a Harvard study shows that 44,789 Americans die every single year because they do n't have health coverage , now people in Washington understand what 's at stake , and that is life and death .
The cost of delay now , people understand now , is death .
And death of many , many Americans , more Americans dying every month than died on 9/11 , but that was just once , and this is month after month after month , and that 's why I say it is so important that we move it along to save these people 's lives . "
Maddow : " And strategically , do you think the Democrats have made the pivot ?
That they 've stopped working for , toward Bipartisanship as an end rather than as a means and they 've started pushing for what they want ? "
Grayson : " I think we 're making the pivot because we are making the moral argument in favor of what we want .
For too long we were bogged down in this idea of , of just simply making it more affordable when , in fact , we are talking about is life or death .
And that is the case the Democrats have n't made until now , and now we 're seeing , we also exposed that the Republicans have nothing .
I mean , the point of my presentation was that they have no plan , and now they 've had two weeks to come up with something that would actually save these people 's lives and they 've got nothing , so now , for a change , they 're on the defensive . "
Republicans on the DEFENSIVE !?!?
Who knew that was even possible ?
If Grayson keeps this up maybe other people will start wondering why other Democrats do n't have guts ?
Maybe it will force other Democrats to FIGHT TOO !
Now that is something I can support
Donate to Alan Grayson ( Dem with GUTS - FL08 ) here with Act Blue , where we 've raised almost $ 10,000 for Alan Grayson at The Progressive Electorate.com
Or go to CongressmanwithGUTS.com and donate there to help Grayson build a Money Bomb so he can stay in office for years to come .
The Money Bomb goes OFF on Nov 2nd , and they 're asking people to pledge to give on the Nov. 2 Money Bomb .
( I am not affiliated with the Organization behind CongressmanwithGuts.com )
The GOP will be painting a BIG Bullseye on Grayson 's back in 2010 .
If you can , help out Grayson and show that you want MORE and BETTER Democrats with GUTS !
Bipartisanship is a ruse .
It always has been .
It is designed to create a consensus that IS NOT THERE .
The Republicans HATE YOU , Obama .
They HOPE YOU FAIL .
They hope AMERICA FAILS , and they are hoping we are all pissed off , unemployed and pissed off in 2010 , as if that will bbe good for them .
As soon as Obama and Democrats understand that the Republiican party is NOT loyal opposition but a pack of bratty , fit throwing 6 year olds who do not care about anyone than themselves , the better .
Until then , let 's keep fighting back with guys like Grayson , Weiner , Sen. Sherrod Brown and others .
Put the GOP on the Defensive for one .
Attack for once .
Who knows , we may just get good at this sort of thing .
The best defense is a good offense .

Project details Skill 3 out of 5 Moderate Cutting the groove and routing the dado take patience and finesse Cost About $ 100 Estimated Time 4 - 6 hours
Unfortunately , a door 's weather seals , if it has any at all , can rip , compress , bend , or wear out over time , leaving chilly winter air free to enter ( or expensive air - conditioned air to leave ) .
Fortunately , attaching new weather seals is a straightforward exercise , far cheaper and faster than installing a new door .
How Much Does It Cost to Seal a Door ?
It costs approximately $ 100 for materials and labor to seal a door .
And when you consider that even a tiny 1/8 - inch gap around a typical entryway door is the equivalent of drilling a 5 ½- inch - diameter hole through an outside wall , closing that gap is well worth the effort .
How Do You Seal a Gap in a Door ?
Any well - sealed door requires two components : weatherstripping , which covers the sides and top of the door , and a sweep , which fills the space between the threshold and the door bottom .
Hardware stores and home centers sell an array of metal , foam , felt , and plastic products for this purpose .
Tom prefers a weather seal system that includes a tubular silicone weatherstripping that fits against the doorstop and a twin - fin silicone sweep that fits beneath the door .
Silicone makes an ideal weatherstripping because it 's durable , soft , and has no " compression memory " ; it remains tight as the door swells and shrinks .
The following steps will teach you how to weatherstrip a door to keep cold drafts from entering your home .
Step 1
Measure the door gap
Before ordering weatherstripping , measure the gap between the door and jamb and the door and stop with the door closed .
Make sure to take measurements along both side jambs and the head jamb , then choose weatherstripping for each side that 's big enough to fill the largest gap along its run ( 3/8 - inch maximum ) .
Step 2
Cut a groove
Pull a paint scraper along the stop and jamb to make sure that both surfaces are smooth , flat , and free of protruding nails .
Fit the grooving tool 's V - shaped base into the corner formed by the jamb and the stop , with the bit pointing up .
Turn on the motor and push the tool up to the head jamb .
This creates a slot 1/8 inch wide and 3/16 inch deep .
At the top , turn off the motor and remove the bit from the slot .
Reinsert it at the starting point , but this time with the bit pointing down .
( Retracing your path in the slot can widen it too much to grip the weatherstripping . )
A steady push to the bottom of the jamb with the motor revving finishes the slot on that side .
Repeat the process on the opposite side jamb and the head jamb .
If the shop vacuum leaves any wood chips in the slot , Tom gently cleans them out with a small screwdriver before he continues to weatherstrip the door .
Step 3
Insert the weatherstripping
Tom takes one end of the weatherstripping and pushes its barbed tongue into one end of the slot .
As he works up the slot , he 's careful not to stretch the weatherstripping ; it will return to its original length and leave gaps .
A couple of inches from the slot 's opposite end , he gauges the proper length and cuts the strip with scissors .
( Another method eliminates the possibility of stretching :
Cut the product to length first , fit its ends into the ends of the slot , then push in the barb at the halfway point .
Continue to push at each of the quarter points , and so on until the entire strip is secure . )
It 's not necessary to miter the ends where they meet at the head jamb ; a butt joint seals best .
To finish , drive the weatherstripping into its slot with a spline roller .
Check the installation by shutting the door from the outside and looking for gaps .
Step 4
Rout the dado
To seal the door gap in the bottom , place the door on sawhorses and use a square to mark out a 5/8 - inch - wide dado centered on the door 's bottom edge .
Tom sets the router 's guide so a ½-inch bit will cut next to the top mark when the guide rests on the door 's top face .
On the first pass , move the router from left to right .
On the second pass , the guide rides on the door 's opposite side as the router moves from right to left .
Make multiple passes to reach full depth ( 1⅛ inch ) .
Step 5
Attach the channel
Coat the exposed wood in the dado with primer and paint .
Then cut the sweep 's two aluminum channels just 1/8 - inch shy of the width of the door ( to allow for end caps to be installed later ) .
To make sure the cut is clean , Tom clamps the channels in a miter box and uses a hacksaw with a waxed blade .
Insert one channel into the dado , center it end to end , and screw it in place , as shown .
Step 6
Install the door sweep
After he fits the black silicone sweep into the free channel , Tom slides the glides into the channel in the dado , then carefully rehangs the door .
( To avoid the possibility of damage to the sweep , hang the door first , then install the sweep . )
Adjust the glides until no light shows between the sweep and the threshold when the door is closed .
To seal the ends of the dado , snap plastic caps into the ends of the channel and stick squares of adhesive - backed pile against the bottom of the jambs .
Step 7
Adjust the glides
The secret behind this sweep 's adjustability is its glides , which lift or lower the sweep by as much as ¼ inch .
To adjust the fit , simply open the door , remove the end cap from the latch side , and slide out the sweep .
Turning the glides clockwise raises the sweep ; counter - clockwise lowers it .
Then slide the glides back into the attached channel .

We have covered what you can do if your laptop has been stolen , but with the proliferation of other portable gadgets — cameras , cell phones , e-book readers — theft recovery applies to more than just your computer .
An Ars reader recently told us a tale of woe involving the loss of his Kindle DX on a flight home and his subsequent efforts to get it back .
Unfortunately , he was unable to do so , although he was able to see that whoever found it had unregistered his Amazon account from the device .
This made us wonder : is there any way to use technology to recover a lost Kindle ?
After all , the Kindle has built - in wireless connectivity through Sprint , and Amazon has the apparent ability to reach into people 's devices to yank back content .
There must be some way to figure out where the device is , or at least shut it down remotely to deter thieves .
Right ?
Right ?
Our reader , Justin Smith , said that Amazon 's Kindle Support told him that there 's no way to send a kill signal down to the Kindle and have it shut off remotely .
This is " something which I feel would be beneficial in a situation like this , where recovery of the device is unlikely , " he told us via e-mail .
Unfortunately , Amazon did not feel the same way .
Kindle customer service told Smith that there 's no way to remotely brick the device .
" If someone contacts us after losing their Kindle or having it stolen , we will de-register the Kindle to prevent purchasing on the registered account , " Amazon 's Director of Communications Drew Herdener told Ars via e-mail .
He declined to directly answer questions about remote bricking .
Similarly , there appears to be no easy way to find out the location of the device — at least not from the user 's perspective .
Customer service told Smith that " there are some options available with Sprint , since the device communicates over their network , but he was unwilling to discuss them with me . "
Herdner would not directly acknowledge that there was a way to triangulate the device , but stated that the company will " respond to appropriate requests for information from law enforcement officials . "
This is assuming , of course , that the Kindle 's wireless is turned on at the time of attempted triangulation .
The truth is , there are n't many ways to recover a lost or stolen Kindle — unlike a laptop , it 's very limited in power and capabilities .
Developers can't create third - party products that report information back to the Internet and , given the explosive response to Amazon 's recent debacle over the deletion of certain e-books from people 's Kindles , many users would not welcome having Amazon track their Kindle 's location .
At the same time , companies have long been able to remotely wipe a lost BlackBerry , and iPhone owners can now do so directly through MobileMe whenever the mood strikes them .
Would it behoove Amazon and other e-book makers to enable customers to do this as well ?
Thanks in part to the Kindle , e-books are making their way into the mainstream and more people than ever are carrying the devices around .
Users might welcome a way to send a signal down to a specific Kindle ( authenticated by serial number perhaps ) that would make it unuseable and perhaps even display a message saying that it has been lost or stolen , a la Apple 's " Find My iPhone " feature .
Of course , the other downside to losing a Kindle ( besides unsuccessfully trying to frustrate the person who now has it ) is the fact that users can no longer access their purchased Kindle books unless they use the Kindle iPhone app or purchase another Kindle .
" Not only could I not read them if I had them due to their DRM , " Smith told us , " but my purchased content is not even available to me through the Amazon site so long as I do not have a Kindle registered — I confirmed this to be the case with one of the two first - level customer service people . "
Questions have been raised this month about whether the gas resources of Turkmenistan are in fact as spectacularly voluminous as verified last year by the British firm , Gaffney Cline & Associates .
Gaffney Cline certified that the new South Yoloton field held between 4 trillion and 14 trillion cubic meters ( tcm ) of gas , with the most probable scenario at 6 tcm , and that Yashlar held between 0.3 tcm and 1.5 tcm , with the most probably scenario at 0.7 tcm .
These volumes would confirm the country as a leading producer on the world scene and do not even take into account other fields that remain unexplored .
They would justify claims reported to have been privately made to Western leaders by the country 's former president , Saparmurad Niyazov , shortly before his death almost three years ago .
However , two - and - a - half weeks ago , and within a day of one another , there appeared an article by Arkadii Dubnov in the Russian newspaper Vremya Novostei and a separate report on the website of the German - based Eurasian Transition Group questioning such claims .
This was on the basis of confidential information supposedly gleaned secretly from officials in Moscow in the first instance and in Ashgabad in the second .
To help evaluate these allegations , one could recall the adage oft - employed by Marcus Tullius Cicero : " Cui bono ? "
Literally translated , this means , " To whom [ accrues ] the benefit ? "
A looser and more colloquial modern translation would be , " Follow the money " .
So let us follow the money .
Who benefits ?
As a top Gaffney Cline representative explained in an e-mail published by a EurasiaNet correspondent , his firm 's auditing process followed international standards ( which is why Ashgabad chose a Western firm in the first place ) and involved assessing " a very considerable volume of data … [ from ] a wide range of types and from a range of sources : in practical terms , impossible to falsify [ systematically in such a way as to ] appear to be coherent and [ so ] mislead an expert team . "
With its international reputation on the line , Gaffney Cline would have no motive at all to be complicit in such a putative falsification .
Yet there is no doubt that the publication of this information , whether it is true or false , is to Turkmenistan 's disadvantage .
In fact , it complements what Russian media and officials have now insisted for many months , to wit , that Moscow has already contracted all future gas from Turkmenistan .
There is a contract in principle signed under Niyazov to provide Russia with 50 billion cubic meters per year ( bcm /y ) , but that is subject to continual negotiations and re-negotiations over price .
Because of the pricing disagreement , there have been no gas exports from Turkmenistan to Russia since an April pipeline explosion for which the former blames the latter .
Following repairs , political agreements between the two sides to resume the flow have been stymied , precisely because Russia wants a price lower than it had been paying , and moreover a formula for its calculation that would permit it to vary over time .
Turkmenistan still wants a fixed price at top dollar .
The ill - will that this series of events has engendered in Ashgabad has led President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow to seek Western contractors for repair of a separate " East - West " pipeline in the south of the country ending on the Caspian Sea , raising the possibility that the gas it carries could flow further west , across and under the sea , eventually to Europe , rather than north to Russia .
Here it is pertinent to remark on the quality of news reports on energy matters in the Russian media .
By and large , these are factually correct .
However , on more than a few occasions over the past several years , official English translations of Russian news stories have carried implications differing from the original Russian , ostensibly due to poor translation or differential editing .
A survey of such instances reveals that the nuances thus introduced tend almost uniformly to invite interpretations that are advantageous to Russian state interests , whether through omission by suggesting greater Russian influence on events , or through commission by offering as facts things that are not so .
This is not to say that there is a centralized propaganda strategy emanating from the Kremlin .
That is a question of fact , and there is no direct evidence to confirm such a suggestion .
However , the evaluation of any new information offered by such sources must take into account existing evidence for an established pattern of consistent bias , whatever may be the reasons for such a pattern , even if it is merely " group think " by Russian journalists .
For example , ever since the signature of the contract for Azerbaijan to send 0.5 bcm of gas from Shah - Deniz Phase 2 to Russia in 2010 , Russian media and officials have stated at every opportunity that they will have what amounts to " first refusal " on subsequent Shah - Deniz Phase 2 production .
However , no legal documents binding the Azeri side to such a bargain exist .
Nevertheless , such a claim on the Russian side is in the same line as reports about allegedly falsified numbers concerning Turkmenistan 's gas reserves .
And continuing insistence from Moscow that Russia will effectively remain the sole ( or main ) buyer of Central Asian gas , whether from Azerbaijan or from Turkmenistan , is in the same line as suggestions that Europe should abandon any hope to import , in any significant quantity , Caspian Sea basin natural gas reserves .
In the same vein , Yashigeldy Kakaev , who directs Turkmenistan 's State Agency on Hydrocarbon Resource Management and reports directly to Berdimuhamedow , was vexed this month when Russian media quoted him correctly but only in part as saying that Turkmenistan looked forward to beginning its exports to China in the near future , while insisting that that Western partners build a pipeline to Turkmenistan 's border ( where the country sells its gas by state policy ) .
An editorial statement about the unlikelihood of the latter would give the appearance that Kakaev downplayed ideas about pipelines such as the Europe - backed Nabucco and advocated instead China 's access for Turkmenistan 's market .
Yet the attribution of such a China - oriented view to Kakaev would be surprising , since the public record shows numerous statements by him strongly advocating a European direction for Turkmenistan 's exports .
Indeed , to suggest that he favors a China - only ( besides Russia ) export strategy would be the very opposite of what he really said at the time , as extensively reported by other news agencies , two weeks ago at a high - level conference in Bucharest .
It is the case that a pipeline under construction from Turkmenistan through Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to western China , scheduled for completion early next year , will have a capacity of 40 bcm /y .
But in such a context , questions about Turkmenistan 's reserves pointedly invite the observer to conclude that there will be no gas for westward export to Europe after fulfillment of contractual obligations to Russia and China .
There seems to be a risk that some US companies may take the bait .
These companies have suggested to the Turkmenistan government that , if they should receive production - sharing agreements , then they would like to participate in exports to China .
This idea makes no commercial sense to officials in Ashgabad , however , for they do not need such help ; the Chinese are capable of providing it and are already doing so .
On the other hand , energy officials in Turkmenistan are very aware of bilateral Russian - Chinese energy cooperation now being launched at the highest level as a knock - on from Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin 's recent visit to Beijing .
Indeed , they recognize that Turkmenistan 's own interest is not to be locked between the two large countries , which could easily collude against it .
They thus know that they need export markets , not only other than Russia , but also other than China .
These Turkmenistani officials are , then , precisely those who would have reason to fear that Western players believe the new allegations about falsification of reserves , which Russian players have a motive to make to appear credible .
Yet they will not risk angering Russia with a small agreement for exports to Europe .
It follows that piecemeal offers from the West are unlikely to provide sufficient incentive for so radical a re-orientation of Turkmenistan 's export policy in practice .
Ashgabad is waiting ( and hoping ) for a consolidated and practical offer from European and / or American companies that , by its very magnitude , will motivate a seismic shift westward in the geo-economics of the Eurasian hydrocarbon energy complex , and natural gas in particular , finding Turkmenistan in the first rank of those happy to participate in such an initiative , which would create its own momentum .

But there was another answer :
With nearly 90 percent of the populace given relatively generous benefits , patients stay healthy and health providers have the money and motivation to innovate .

If true , it ’s a crucial lesson .
Health care overhaul efforts at the state and national levels have so far been largely confined to providing bare - bones insurance coverage to those in need .
But changing the way care is provided has been given short shrift , and medical experts warn that costs could soar if overhaul legislation passes .
After expanding coverage in 2006 , Massachusetts is only now tackling the cost problem as expenses continue their inexorable rise .
But the Hawaii experience suggests that overhauling health insurance before changing the way care is provided could work , eventually .
With more people given access to care , hospital and insurance executives in Hawaii say they have been able to innovate efficiencies .
For instance , the state ’s top three medical providers are adopting electronic medical records  years ahead of most mainland counterparts .
The Hawaii Medical Service Association , the state ’s largest insurer and a Blue Cross Blue Shield member , recently offered the nation ’s only statewide system whereby anyone for a nominal fee can talk by phone or e-mail , day or night , to doctors of their choosing .
Kaiser Permanente Hawaii , which covers about 20 percent of the state ’s population , screens 85 percent of its female members ages 42 to 69 for breast cancer , among the highest screening rates in the country .
One result of Hawaii ’s employer mandate and the relatively high number of people with health insurance is that hospital emergency rooms in the state are islands of relative calm .
In 2007 , the state had 264 outpatient visits to emergency rooms per 1,000 people  34 percent lower than the national average of 401 .
Dr. Ray Sebastian splits his time between the emergency room at Kapi’olani Medical Center at Pali Momi and a hospital in Los Angeles .
Nearly all of his poorest patients in Hawaii have routine access to family doctors who can provide follow - up care , while fewer than half of those in Los Angeles do , he estimated .
So , he said , the emergency room in Hawaii is not clogged with patients suffering minor problems like medication adjustments and cold symptoms , and patient waiting times are a small fraction of those in Los Angeles :
“ It ’s like greased lightning here , ” he said .
Other states tried employer - mandated care only to repeal the efforts after employers threatened to move across state lines .
Hawaii ’s isolation forestalled such threats , and its paternalistic plantation history made employer - provided care an easy fit .
Dobbs : Congress stiffs working Americans By Lou Dobbs
CNN
Editor 's note : Lou Dobbs ' commentary appears every Wednesday on CNN.com .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Without much fanfare , the House of Representatives last week voted to give members of Congress yet another pay raise , as it has done almost every year for nearly a decade .
For some reason , our elected officials decided against holding a news conference .
Maybe that 's because they did n't want to draw attention to the fact that they raise their own salaries almost every year while refusing to raise the pay of our lowest - paid workers .
Corporate America , the Bush administration and the national economic orthodoxy with which they 're in league have consistently argued against helping working men and women at the lowest end of the wage scale by raising the minimum wage .
Big business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce say it will harm the economy and eliminate jobs .
As is so frequent with the faith - based economics that grips both political parties in Washington , such concerns have absolutely nothing to do with reality .
For example , it 's impossible to deny the national minimum wage of $ 5.15 is not enough for a family to live above the poverty line .
The annual salary for workers earning the national minimum wage still leaves a family of three about $ 6,000 short of the poverty threshold .
Raising the minimum wage to $ 7.50 would positively affect the lives of more than 8 million workers , including an estimated 760,000 single mothers and 1.8 million parents with children under 18 .
But even this 46 percent increase would get them only to the poverty line .
Do n't you think these families just might need that cost - of - living increase a bit more than our elected officials who are paid nearly $ 170,000 a year ?
With no Congressional action on raising the minimum wage since 1997 , inflation has eroded wages .
The minimum wage in the 21st century is $ 2 lower in real dollars than it was four decades ago and now stands at its lowest level since 1955 , according to the Economic Policy Institute and Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
Also , since the last time Congress increased the minimum wage for our lowest - paid workers , buying power has fallen by 25 percent .
Yet over that time our elected representatives have given themselves eight pay raises totaling more than 23 percent .
Raising the minimum wage is n't simply about the price of labor .
It 's also about our respect for labor .
One of this country 's greatest business innovators , Henry Ford , made history almost a century ago by raising the salaries of his production - line workers far beyond the prevailing wage .
Ford not only paid his employees well enough to buy the products they built , but he kept his employees loyal and productive .
That 's also very good business .
The myth that raising the minimum wage will lead to job cuts is just that : a myth .
In fact , research suggests just the opposite .
According to the Fiscal Policy Institute , since 1998 , states with higher minimum wages experienced better job growth than states paying only the federal minimum wage .
Among small retail businesses in those higher minimum - wage states , job growth was double the rest of the country .
The House Appropriations Committee has passed a $ 2.10 increase as part of a spending bill , but the business lobby pressured the House leadership to hold up the measure .
" I think it 's disgraceful that we waited nine years to do this , " says Rep. David Obey , a Democrat from Wisconsin .
" We have seen gas prices go up by 140 percent since the minimum wage was increased .
We have seen home heating oil go up by 120 percent .
We have seen health care go up by almost 45 percent . "
This administration , our Republican - led Congress and the dominant corporate interests in this country want cheap labor .
And to achieve that goal they 're outsourcing middle - class jobs , importing illegal labor and cutting retirement and health - care benefits .
It 's time for the federal government to reverse the trend , to at least substantially raise the minimum wage in this country , and by doing so express how much we value all working Americans .
