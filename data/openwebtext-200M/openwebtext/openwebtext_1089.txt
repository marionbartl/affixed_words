-- the one - hundred - and - five - story Ryugyong Hotel is hideous , dominating the Pyongyang skyline like some twisted North Korean version of Cinderella 's castle .
Not that you would be able to tell from the official government photos of the North Korean capital -- the hotel is such an eyesore , the Communist regime routinely covers it up , airbrushing it to make it look like it 's open -- or Photoshopping or cropping it out of pictures completely .
Even by Communist standards , the 3,000 - room hotel is hideously ugly , a series of three gray 328 - foot long concrete wings shaped into a steep pyramid .
With 75 degree sides that rise to an apex of 1,083 feet , the Hotel of Doom ( also known as the Phantom Hotel and the Phantom Pyramid ) is n't the just the worst designed building in the world -- it 's the worst - built building , too .
In 1987 , Baikdoosan Architects and Engineers put its first shovel into the ground and more than twenty years later , after North Korea poured more than two percent of its gross domestic product to building this monster , the hotel remains unoccupied , unopened , and unfinished .

A bootleg video of the tower from YouTube .
How the brazen videographer escaped without being arrested remains a mystery .
Construction on the Hotel of Doom stopped in 1992 ( rumors maintain that North Korea ran out of money , or that the building was engineered improperly and can never be occupied ) and has never started back up , which should n't come as a shock .
After all , who the hell travels to beautiful downtown Pyongyang ?
It would make sense if the hotel were in South Korea , where Americans are allowed to travel and where projects like the Busan Lotte Tower and the Lotte Super Tower now rise thousands of feet above the formerly modest skyline .
With Pyongyang 's official population said to range between 2.5 million and 3.8 million ( official numbers are not made available by the North Korean government ) , the Ryugyong Hotel -- the 22nd largest skyscraper in the world -- is a failure on an enormous scale .
To put it in context , imagine if the John Hancock Center ( 1,127 feet tall ) in Chicago ( population 2.9 million ) was not only completely vacant , but unfinished with zero hope of ever being completed .
You may not be able to actually live there , but the building now has its own virtual real estate managers , Richard Dank and Andreas Gruber , a pair of German architects and self - described " custodians of the pyramid 's diverse manifestations . "
The duo run Ryugyong.org , which they describe as an " experimental collaborative online architecture site . "
Sad you can't visit the building in real life ?

The Demolition S How video .
The Demolition S How video by the Italian architects Extraneo might not be as conceptual as Ryugyong.org , but this piece of architectural porn sure is fun to watch .
The video ( which you can watch above ) was mounted as part of the exhibition Fiction Pyongyang , curated in part by Stefano Boeri , who also collected 120 speculative designs for the hotel in the June 2006 domus magazine .
The designs , he says , " have forced it to reveal its icy nature , its irresistible fascination as a fragile alien meteorite . "
The worst building in the world is also , we now know , " the only built piece of science fiction in the contemporary world . "
And it 's true .
Demolition S How is all Blade Runner - style flying ads and soaring concrete , and the video reminds us that the worst building in the world is the closest humans have come to building a Death Star .

NEW YORK --
It happened so fast , Eric Bruntlett needed a few moments before he realized he had just ended a game with an unassisted triple play .
Bruntlett became the second player in major league history to get the final three outs on his own , accomplishing the feat Sunday to preserve the Philadelphia Phillies ' 9 - 7 victory over the New York Mets .
" I did n't know how to react .
I did n't know what to do , " Bruntlett said .
" The ninth inning was wild .
The whole game it seemed was strange . "
Indeed , it was a stunning end to a crazy game that included an inside - the - park homer after the ball got stuck under the outfield wall .
Bruntlett turned the 15th unassisted triple play in big league history -- the second that ended a game .
Detroit Tigers first baseman Johnny Neun also turned the trick on May 31 , 1927 , completing a 1 - 0 victory over Cleveland , according to STATS LLC .
The amazing final sequence made a winner of Pedro Martinez in his return to New York and quashed a Mets rally against closer Brad Lidge .
" We picked a good time , " Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said .
With runners on first and second in the ninth inning and a run already in , Jeff Francoeur hit a line drive up the middle that appeared headed toward center field for a single .
But both runners were stealing on the 2 - 2 pitch , so Bruntlett was in perfect position as he moved over to cover second base .
He caught the liner easily , stepped on second to double up Luis Castillo and then turned to tag Daniel Murphy for the third out .
Murphy tried to backpedal away from Bruntlett , but had nowhere to go .
" Frenchy hit it on the screws , " Murphy said .
" It happened so fast there was nothing I could do . "
After bolting out of the box , a frustrated Francoeur stopped in his tracks and threw down his helmet with both hands .
" What a bizarre ending .
I do n't know what happened there .
The game 's over , so I 'm happy with that , " Lidge said .
" That was pretty exciting .
That 's definitely not the way you draw it up . "
The Phillies raced onto the field to congratulate Bruntlett after his rare play secured Lidge 's 25th save in 33 chances .
It was the first unassisted triple play since Cleveland second baseman Asdrubal Cabrera turned one in the fifth inning on May 12 , 2008 , against Toronto .
Bruntlett , who made one of two Phillies errors earlier in the inning , started at second because All - Star Chase Utley was rested .
Another Phillies second baseman , Mickey Morandini , turned an unassisted triple play in 1992 .
It was the first time the Mets were involved in such a play .
" Even with the runners going I did not expect him to be there .
The only place he could catch the ball was where he was , " Francoeur said .
" To end the way it did was a little disheartening . "
Angel Pagan hit the inside - the - park shot and added another homer for the Mets , handed yet another befuddling defeat .
New York has found improbable ways to lose all year : Murphy dropped a fly ball in left field , Ryan Church missed third base while rounding the bag , Castillo flubbed Alex Rodriguez 's ninth - inning popup at Yankee Stadium .
Of the 15 unassisted triple plays in big league history , all but one came during the regular season .
Cleveland second baseman Bill Wambsganss accomplished the feat in the 1920 World Series against Brooklyn .
Martinez batted before throwing a pitch .
The Phillies scored six times in the first inning off Oliver Perez on three - run homers by Jayson Werth and Carlos Ruiz .
The Citi Field crowd of 39,038 stood and cheered as Martinez walked to the plate in the Phillies ' road gray - and - red uniform , a jarring sight for sure after he spent the previous four years with the Mets .
" The ovation , that 's exactly the response I expected because of the mutual bond I have here , " Martinez said .
" I respect them and I love them . "
Martinez worked the count to 3 - 0 and Mets manager Jerry Manuel came out to remove Perez , bothered recently by a tender right knee that sidelined him earlier this season .
The move got a loud ovation , and Perez ( 3 - 4 ) was soundly booed as he walked off the field having thrown 47 pitches -- 20 strikes -- and getting just two outs .
Nelson Figueroa struck out Martinez to end the 26 - minute inning .
The 37 - year - old Martinez then gave up Pagan 's inside - the - park homer leading off the first .
Pagan 's drive to left - center briefly got stuck under the padding of the wall .
Center fielder Shane Victorino threw his hands up , looking for a ground - rule double , as Pagan slowed into third , but second base umpire Rob Drake allowed play to go on and Pagan raced home for his first career inside - the - park homer .
Charlie Manuel said the issue was n't covered when the umpires went over ground rules before the game .
" They never talked about that , " he said .
Martinez ( 2 - 0 ) never lived up to the $ 53 million contract he signed with the Mets after 2004 , winning just 32 games and missing the 2006 playoffs with one of many injuries , including major shoulder surgery that limited him to just five starts in '07 -- all during the September collapse .
The wiry three - time Cy Young Award winner was not offered a contract after going 5 - 6 with a 5.61 ERA in 20 starts for the Mets last year -- a trying season in which his father died .
He labored through six innings -- and hit an RBI single -- while giving up four runs and seven hits in his third start with the Phillies after signing with them as a free agent on July 15 .
Game notes
Pagan 's inside - the - park homer was the 25th in Mets history , and second leading off a game .
Charlie Neal hit the other one in 1963 at the Polo Grounds against Philadelphia .
... Charlie Manuel was ejected in the ninth after umpires reversed a call .

Francoeur bruised his left thumb while making a diving catch .
X - rays were negative .
WASHINGTON  The Justice Department ’s ethics office has recommended reversing the Bush administration and reopening nearly a dozen prisoner - abuse cases , potentially exposing Central Intelligence Agency employees and contractors to prosecution for brutal treatment of terrorism suspects , according to a person officially briefed on the matter .
The recommendation by the Office of Professional Responsibility , presented to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in recent weeks , comes as the Justice Department is about to disclose on Monday voluminous details on prisoner abuse that were gathered in 2004 by the C.I.A. ’s inspector general but have never been released .
When the C.I.A. first referred its inspector general ’s findings to prosecutors , they decided that none of the cases merited prosecution .
But Mr. Holder ’s associates say that when he took office and saw the allegations , which included the deaths of people in custody and other cases of physical or mental torment , he began to reconsider .
With the release of the details on Monday and the formal advice that at least some cases be reopened , it now seems all but certain that the appointment of a prosecutor or other concrete steps will follow , posing significant new problems for the C.I.A .
It is politically awkward , too , for Mr. Holder because President Obama has said that he would rather move forward than get bogged down in the issue at the expense of his own agenda .

The most striking aspect of the prolonged and deepening world recession / depression is the relative and absolute passivity of the working and middle class in the face of massive job losses , big cuts in wages , health care and pension payments and mounting housing foreclosures .
Never in the history of the 20 - 21st Century has an economic crisis caused so much loss to so many workers , employees , small businesses , farmers and professionals with so little large - scale public protest .
To explore some tentative hypotheses of why there is little organized protest , we need to examine the historical - structural antecedents to the world economic depression .
More specifically , we will focus on the social and political organizations and leadership of the working class , the transformation of the structure of labor and its relationship to the state and market .
These social changes have to be located in the context of the successful ruling class socio-political struggles from the 1980 ’s , the destruction of the Communist welfare state , and the subsequent uncontested penetration of imperial capital in the former Communist countries .
The conversion of Western Social Democratic parties to neo-liberalism , and the subordination of the trade unions to the neo-liberal state are seen as powerful contributing factors in diminishing working class representation and influence .
We will proceed by outlining the decline of labor organization , class struggle and class ideology in the context of the larger political - economic defeat and co-optation of anti-capitalist alternatives .
The period of capitalist boom and bust leading up to the current world depression sets the stage for identifying the strategic structural and subjective determinants of working class passivity and impotence .
The final section will bring into sharp focus the depth and scope of the problem of trade union and social movement weakness and their political consequences .
History of Economic Depression and Worker Revolts : US , Europe , Asia and Latin America
The social history of the 20th and early 21st Century ’s economic crises and breakdowns is written large with working class and popular revolts , from the left and right .
During the 1930 ’s the combined effects of the world depression and imperialist - colonial wars set in motion major uprisings in Spain ( the Civil War ) , France ( general strikes , Popular Front government ) , the US ( factory occupations , industrial unionization ) , El Salvador , Mexico and Chile ( insurrections , national - popular regimes ) and in China ( communist / nationalist , anti-colonial armed movements ) .
Numerous other mass and armed uprising took place in response to the Depression in a great number of countries , far beyond the scope of this paper to cover .
The post -World War II period witnessed major working class and anti-colonial movements in the aftermath of the breakdown of European empires and in response to the great human and national sacrifices caused by the imperial wars .
Throughout Europe , social upheavals , mass direct actions and resounding electoral advances of working class parties were the norm in the face of a ‘ broken ’ capitalist system .
In Asia , mass socialist revolutions in China , Indo -China and North Korea ousted colonial powers and defeated their collaborators in a period of hyper-inflation and mass unemployment .
The cycle of recessions from the 1960 ’s to the early 1980 ’s witnessed a large number of major successful working class and popular struggles for greater control over the work place and higher living standards and against employer - led counter - offensives .
Economic Crises and Social Revolts in Latin America
Latin America experienced similar patterns of crises and revolts as the rest of the world during the World Economic Depression and the Second World War .
During the 1930 - 40 ’s , aborted revolutionary upheavals and revolts took place in Cuba , El Salvador , Colombia , Brazil and Bolivia .
At the same time ‘ popular front ’ alliances of Communists , Socialists and Radicals governed in Chile and populist - nationalist regimes took power in Brazil ( Vargas ) , Argentina ( Peron ) and Mexico ( Cardenas ) .
As in Central and Eastern Europe , Latin America also witnessed the rise of mass right - wing movements in opposition to the center - left and populist regimes in Mexico , Argentina , Brazil , Bolivia and elsewhere – a recurrent phenomenon overlooked by most students of ‘ social movements ’ .
The phenomenon of ‘ crisis ’ in Latin America is chronic , punctuated by ‘ boom and bust ’ cycles typical of volatile agro-mineral export economies and by long periods of chronic stagnation .
Following the end of the Korean War and Washington ’s launch of its global empire building project ( mistakenly called ‘ The Cold War ’ ) , the US engaged in a series of ‘ hot wars ’ , ( Korea - 1950 - 1953 and Indo - China - 1955 - 1975 ) and overt and clandestine coups d’etat ( Iran and Guatemala – both in 1954 ) ; and military invasions ( Dominican Republic , Panama , Grenada and Cuba ) ; all the while backing a series of brutal military dictatorships in Cuba ( Batista ) , Dominican Republic ( Trujillo ) , Haiti ( Duvalier ) , Venezuela ( Perez - Jimenez ) , Peru ( Odria ) among others .
Under the combined impact of dictatorial rule , blatant US intervention , chronic stagnation , deepening inequalities , mass poverty and the pillage of the public treasury , a series of popular uprisings , guerrilla revolts and general strikes toppled several US - backed dictatorships culminating in the victory of the social revolution in Cuba .
In Brazil ( 1962 -64 ) , Bolivia ( 1952 ) , Peru ( 1968 - 74 ) , Nicaragua ( 1979 - 89 ) and elsewhere , nationalist presidents took power nationalizing strategic economic sectors , re-distributing land and challenging US dominance .
Parallel guerrilla , peasant and workers movements spread throughout the continent from the 1960 ’s to the early 1970’s .
The high point of this ‘ revolt against economic stagnation , imperialism , militarism and social exploitation / exclusion ’ was the victory of the socialist government in Chile ( 1970 - 73 ) .
The advance of the popular movements and the electoral gains however did not lead to a definitive victory ( the taking of state power ) except in Cuba , Grenada and Nicaragua nor did it resolve the crisis of capitalism ( the key problem of chronic economic stagnation and dependence ) .
Key economic levers remained in the hands of the domestic and foreign economic elites and the US retained decisive control over Latin America ’s military and intelligence agencies .
The US backed military coups ( 1964/1971-76 ) , US military invasions ( Dominican Republic 1965 , Grenada1983 , Panama 1990 , Haiti 1994,2005 ) , surrogate mercenaries Nicaragua 1980 - 89 and right - wing civilian regimes ( 1982-2000/2005 ) , reversed the advances of the social movements , overthrew nationalist / populist and socialist regimes and restored the predominance of the oligarchic troika : agro-mineral elite , the ‘ Generals ’ and the multinational corporations .
US corporate dominance , oligarchic political successes and pervasive private pillage of national wealth accelerated and deepened the boom and bust process .
However the savage repression , which accompanied the US - led counter - revolution and restoration of oligarch rule ensured that few large - scale popular revolts would occur , between the mid 1970 ’s to the beginning of the 1990 ’s – with the notable exception of Central America .
Civilian Rule , Neo-liberalism , Economic Stagnation and the New Social Movements
Prolonged stagnation , popular struggles and the willingness of conservative civilian politicians to conserve the reactionary structural changes implanted by the dictatorships , hastened the retreat of the military rulers .
The advent of civilian rulers in Uruguay , Brazil , Chile , Bolivia , Argentina in the late 1980 ’s was accompanied by the rapid intensification of neo-liberal policies .
This was spelled out in the ‘ Washington Consensus ’ and was integral to the President George H.W. Bush ’s New World Order .
While the new neo-liberal order failed to end stagnation it did facilitate the pillage of thousands of public enterprises , their privatization and de-nationalization .
At the same time the massive outflow of profits , interest payments and royalties and the growing exploitation and impoverishment of the working people led to the growth of ‘ new social movements ’ throughout the 1990’s .
During the ascendancy of the military dictatorships and continuing under the neo-liberal regimes , while social movements and trade unions were suppressed , non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) flourished .
Billions of dollars flowed into the accounts of the NGOs from ‘ private ’ foundations .
Later the World Bank and US and EU overseas agencies viewed the NGOs as integral to their counter - insurgency strategy .
The theorists embedded in the NGO - funded feminist , ecology , self - help groups and micro-industry organizations eschewed the question of structural changes , class and anti-imperialist struggles in favor of collaboration with existing state power structures .
The NGO operatives referred to their organizations as the ‘ new social movements ’ , which , in practice , worked hard to undermine the emerging class - based movements of anti-imperialists , Indians , peasants , landless workers and unemployed workers .
These class - based mass movements had emerged in response to the imperial pillage of their natural resources and naked land grabs by powerful elites in the agro-mineral - export sectors with the full support of voracious neo-liberal regimes .
Toward the end of the 1990 ’s , neo-liberal pillage throughout Latin American had reached its paroxysm :
Tens of billions of dollars were literally siphoned off and transferred , especially out of Ecuador , Mexico , Venezuela and Argentina , to overseas banks .
Over five thousand lucrative , successful state - owned enterprises were ‘ privatized ’ by the corrupt regimes at prices set far below their real value and into the hands of select private US and EU corporations and local regime cronies .
The predictable economic collapse and crisis following the blatant looting of the major economies in Latin America provoked a wave of popular uprisings , which overthrew incumbent elected neo-liberal officials and administrations in Ecuador ( three times ) , Argentina ( three successful times ) and Bolivia ( twice ) .
In addition , a mass popular uprising , in alliance with a constitutionalist sector of the military , restored President Chavez to power .
During this period mass movements flourished and numerous center - left politicians , who claimed allegiance to these movements and denounced ‘ neo - liberalism ’ , were elected president .
The deep economic crisis and repudiation of neo-liberalism marked the emergence of the social movements as major players in shaping the contours of Latin American politics .
The principal emerging movements included a series of new social actors and the declining influence of the trade unions as the leading protagonist of structural change .
The Crisis of 1999 - 2003 : Major Social Movements at the ‘ End of Neo-liberalism ’
Major social movements emerged in most of Latin America in response to the economic crisis of the 1990’s and early 2000 ’s and challenged neo-liberal ruling class control .
The most successful were found in Brazil , Ecuador , Venezuela , Argentina and Bolivia .
Brazil : The Rural Landless Workers Movement ( MST ) , with over 300,000 active members and over 350,000 peasant families settled in co-operatives throughout the country , represented the biggest and best organized social movement in Latin America .
The MST built a broad network of supporters and allies in other social movements , like the urban Homeless Movement , the Catholic Pastoral Rural ( Rural Pastoral Agency ) and sectors of the trade union movement ( CUT ) , as well as the left - wing of the Workers Party ( PT ) and progressive academic faculty and students .
The MST succeeded through ‘ direct action ’ tactics , such as organizing mass ‘ land occupations ’ , which settled hundreds of thousands of landless rural workers and their families on the fallow lands of giant latifundistas .
They successfully put agrarian reform on the national agenda and contributed to the electoral victory of the putative center - left Workers Party presidential candidate Ignacio ‘ Lula ’ Da Silva in the 2002 elections .
Ecuador : The National Confederation of Indian and Nationalities in Ecuador ( CONAIE ) played a central role in the overthrow of two neo-liberal Presidents , Abdala Bucaram in 1997 and Jamil Mahuad in January 2000 , implicated in massive fraud and responsible for Ecuador ’s economic crisis of the 1990’s .
In fact , during the January 2000 uprising , the leaders of CONAIE briefly occupied the Presidential Palace .
Beginning in the late 1990 ’s CONAIE had resolved to form an electoral party ‘ Pachacuti ’ , which would act as the ‘ political arm ’ of the movement .
Pachacuti , in alliance with the rightist populist former military officer Lucio Gutierrez in the 2002 elections , briefly held several cabinet posts , including Foreign Relations and Agriculture .
CONAIE ’s and Pachacuti ’s short - lived experience as a government movement and party was a political disaster .
By the end of the first year , the Gutierrez regime allied with multi-national oil companies , the US State Department and the big agro- business firms , promoted a virulent form of neo-liberalism and forced the resignation of most CONAIE - backed officials .
By the end of 2003 , widespread discontent and internal divisions were exacerbated by an army of US and EU - funded NGOs , which infiltrated the Indian communities .
Venezuela : Major popular revolts in 1989 and 1992 culminated in the election of Hugo Chavez in 1999 .
Chavez proceeded to encourage mass popular mobilizations in support of referendums for constitutional reform .
A US - backed alliance between the oligarchy and sectors of the military mounted a palace coup in April 2002 , which lasted only 48 hours before being reversed by a spontaneous outpouring of over a million Venezuelans supported by constitutionalist soldiers in the armed forces .
Subsequently , between December 2002 and February 2003 , a ‘ bosses ’ lockout ’ of the petroleum industry , designed to cripple the national economy , supported by the Venezuelan elite and led by senior officials in the PDVSA ( state oil company ) , was defeated by the combined efforts of the rank and file oil workers with support from the urban popular classes .
The failed US - backed assaults on Venezuelan democracy and President - elect Chavez radicalized the process of structural changes : Mass community - based organizations , new class - based trade union confederations and national peasant movements sprang up and the million - member Venezuelan Socialist Party was formed .
Social movement activity and membership flourished , as the government extended its social welfare programs to include free universal public health programs via thousands of clinics , state - sponsored food markets selling essential food at subsidized prices in poor neighborhoods and the development of universal free public education including higher education .
At the same time numerous enterprises in strategic economic sectors , such as steel , telecommunications , petroleum , food processing and landed estates , were nationalized .
While the ruling class continues to control certain key economic sectors and highly - paid officials in the state sector retain powerful levers over the economy , the Chavez government and the mass popular movements have maintained the initiative in advancing the struggle throughout the decade from the late 1990 ’s into the first decade of the new millennium .
The Venezuelan social movements retain their vigor in part because of the encouragement of Chavez ’ leadership , but the movements are also held back by powerful reformist currents in the regime , which seek to convert the movements into transmission belts of state policy .
The movement - state relationship is fluid and reflects the ebb and flow of the conflict and the threats emanating from the US - backed rightist organizations .
The regime - movement relationship deepened during the crisis period of 1999 - 2003 and was further strengthened by the rise in oil prices during the world commodity boom of 2003 - 2008 .
With the unfolding of the world economic crisis in late 2008 - 2009 , the positive relationship between the state and the movements will be tested .
Bolivia : Bolivia has the highest density of militant social movements of any country in Latin America , including high levels of mine and factory worker participation , community and informal market vender organizations , Indian and peasant movements and public employee unions .
The long years of military repression from the early 1970 ’s to the mid 1980 ’s weakened the trade unions and was followed by intense application of neo-liberal policies .
By the end of the 1990 ’s , new large - scale social movements emerged but the locus of activity shifted from the historically militant mining districts and factories to the ‘ sub - proletariat ’ or ‘ popular classes ’ engaged in informal , ‘ marginal ’ occupations , especially in cities like ‘ El Alto ’ .
‘ El Alto ’ , located on the outskirts of La Paz , is densely populated by recent migrants , displaced miners and impoverished Indians and peasants , and received few public services .
The new nexus for direct action challenging the neo-liberal regimes emerged from the coca farmers and Indian communities in response to the brutal implementation of US - mandated programs suppressing coca cultivation and the displacement of small farmers in favor of large - scale , agro - business plantations .
In the cities , public sector employees , led by teachers , students and factory health worker unions fought neo-liberal measures privatizing services , like water , and cutting the public budgets for education and health care .
The economic crises of the late 1990 - 2000 ’s led to major public confrontation in January 2003 , followed by a popular revolt in October and insurrection centered in ‘ El Alto ’ and spread to La Paz and throughout the country .
Before being driven from power , the Sanchez de Losada regime murdered nearly seventy community activists and leaders .
Hundreds of thousands of impoverished Bolivians stormed the capital , La Paz , threatening to take state power .
Only the intervention of the coca farmer leader and presidential hopeful , Evo Morales , prevented the mass seizure of the Presidential palace .
Morales brokered a ‘ compromise ’ in which the neo-liberal Vice President Carlos Mesa was allowed to succeed to the Presidency in exchange for a vaguely agreed promise to discontinue the hated neo-liberal policies of his predecessor , Sanchez de Losada .
The tenuous agreement between the social movements and the ‘ new ’ neo-liberal President survived for two years due to the moderating influence of Evo Morales .
In May - June 2005 , a new wave of mass demonstrations filled the streets of La Paz with workers , peasants , Indians and miners forcing Carlos Mesa to resign .
Once again , Evo Morales intervened and signed a pact with the Congress calling for national elections in December 2005 in exchange for calling off the protests and appointing a senior Supreme Court judge ( Rodriguez ) to act as interim President .
Morales diverted the mass social movements into his party ’s campaign machinery , undercutting the autonomous direct action strategies , which had been so effective in overthrowing the two previous neo-liberal regimes .
This resulted in his election as President in December 2005 .
While the economic crisis abated with the boom in commodity prices , President Evo Morales ’ social - liberal policies did little to reduce the gross income inequalities , the vast concentration of fertile land in a handful of plantation elite and the dispossession of a majority of Indian communities from their lands .
Morales ’ policies of forming joint ventures with foreign multinational gas , oil and mining companies did little to end the massive transfer of profits from Bolivia ’s natural resources back to the ‘ home offices ’ of the MNCs .
Nevertheless the Morales ’ tepid ‘ nationalist gestures led to a ‘ political - economic ’ confrontation with the US - backed Bolivian oligarchy , which was funded by their enormous private profits gained during the ‘ commodity boom ’ .
Argentina :
The strongest relationship between a severe economic crisis and a mass popular rebellion took place in Argentina in December 19 - 20 , 2001 and continued throughout 2002 .
The conditions for the economic collapse were building up in the 1990s during the two terms of President Carlos Menem .
His neo-liberal regime was marked by the corrupt ‘ bargain basement ’ sale of the most lucrative and strategic public enterprises in all sectors of the economy .
The entire financial sector of Argentina was de-regulated , de-nationalized , dollarized and opened up to the worst speculative abuses .
The national economic edifice , weakened by the massive privatization policies , was further undermined by rampant corruption and gross pillage of the public treasury .
Menem ’s policies continued under his successor , President De la Rua , who presided over the banking crisis and the subsequent collapse of the entire national economy , the loss of billions of dollars of private savings and pension funds , a thirty percent unemployment rate and the most rapid descent into profound poverty among the working and middle classes in Argentine history .
In December 2001 , the people of Buenos Aires staged a massive popular uprising in front of the Presidential palace with the demonstrators taking over the Congress .
They ousted President De la Rua and subsequently three of his would - be presidential successors in a matter of weeks .
Hundreds of thousands of organized , unemployed workers blocked the highways and formed community - based councils .
Impoverished , downwardly mobile middle class employees and bankrupt shopkeepers , professionals and pensioners formed a vast array of neighborhood assemblies and communal councils to debate proposals and tactics .
Banks throughout the country were stormed by millions of irate depositors demanding the restitution of their savings .
Over 200 factories , which had been shut down by their owners , were taken over by their workers and returned to production .
The entire political class was discredited and the popular slogan throughout the country was : ‘! Que se vayan todos !’
( ‘ Out with all politicians ! ’ ) .
While the popular classes controlled the street in semi-spontaneous movements , the fragmented radical - left organizations were unable to coalesce to formulate a coherent organization and strategy for state power .
After two years of mass mobilizations and confrontation , the movements , facing an impasse in resolving the crisis , turned toward electoral politics and elected center - left Peronist Kirchner in the 2003 Presidential campaign .
Low Intensity Social Movements : Peru , Paraguay , Colombia , Chile , Uruguay , Central America , Haiti and Mexico
The entire Latin American continent and the neighboring regions witnessed the significant growth of social movement activity of greater or lesser scope .
What differentiated these movements from their counterparts in Brazil , Argentina , Ecuador , Bolivia and Venezuela was the absence of political challenges and regime change and the limited scope of their social action .
Nevertheless significant outbreaks of mass popular movements raised fundamental challenges to the reigning neo-liberal hegemony .
In Haiti , a mass popular rebellion to reinstate the democratically elected President Jean Bertrand Aristide , who had been taken hostage and flown into exile by a joint US - EU - Canadian military operation , was brutally repressed by a multinational mercenary force led by a Brazilian general .
Subsequent massacres in crowded slums by the occupying troops aborted the resurgence of the popular ‘ Lavelas ’ movement protesting the foreign imposition of neo-liberal ‘ privatization ’ and austerity measures .
Mexico witnessed a series of localized rebellions and mass uprisings against the neo-liberal regimes dominating Mexico .
In 1994 , the Zapatista National Liberal Army ( EZLN ) , based in the Indian communities of rural Chiapas , rose and temporarily succeeded in gaining control of several towns and cities .
With the entry of many thousands of Mexican Federal troops , and in the absence of a wider network of support , the Zapatistas withdrew to their jungle and mountain bases .
An unstable truce was declared , frequently violated by the government , in which an isolated EZLN continued to exist confined to a remote area in the state of Chiapas .
In Oaxaca , an urban rebellion , backed by trade unions , teachers and popular classes in the capital city and surrounding countryside , organized a popular assembly ( comuna ) and briefly created a situation of ‘ dual power ’ before being suppressed by the reactionary neo-liberal governor of the state using ‘ death squads ’ and Mexican troops .
Faced with the repressive power of the state , the insurgent popular movements shifted toward the electoral process and succeeded in electing center - left Andres Manual Lopez Obrador in 2006 in the midst of the neo-liberal economic debacle .
Their victory was short - lived , with the election results , overturned through massive fraud in the final tally of the votes .
Subsequent peaceful protests involving millions of Mexicans eventually lost steam and the movement dissipated .
In Colombia , mass peasant , trade union and Indian protests challenged the neo-liberal Pastrana regime ( 1998 - 2002 ) while the major guerrilla movements ( FARC / ELN ) advanced toward the capital city .
Fruitless peace negotiations , broken off under US pressure and a $ 5 billion dollar US counter - insurgency program , dubbed ‘ Plan Colombia ’ , heightened political polarization and intensified paramilitary death - squad activity .
With the election of Alvaro Uribe , the Colombian regime decimated peasant , trade union and human rights movements as it advanced its neo-liberal policies .
The political effects of the economic crisis at the end of the 1990 ’s , which had precipitated social movement activity throughout the hemisphere , led to brutal repression in Haiti , Mexico and Colombia in order for the neo-liberal regimes to continue their policies .
In several other Latin American countries , namely Peru and Paraguay , as well as in Central America , powerful rural - based peasant and Indian movements engaged in rural road blockages and land occupations against their governments ’ neo-liberal ‘ free trade ’ agreements with the US .
Since these rural movements lacked nation - wide support , especially from the urban centers , their struggles failed to make a significant impact even as their economies crumbled under neo-liberal policies .
Social Movements in the Time of the Commodity Boom
The sharp rise of agricultural and mineral commodity prices between 2003 - 2008 , along with the election of center - left politicians , had a major impact on the most active and dynamic social movements .
In Brazil the election of Lula De Silva ( 2002 - 2006 ) from the putatively center - left Workers Party was backed by all the major social movements , including the MST ( Landless Rural Workers Movement ) under the mistaken assumption that he would accelerate progressive structural changes like land re-distribution .
Instead , Da Silva embraced the entire neo-liberal agenda of his predecessor , President Cardoso , including widespread privatization and tight fiscal policies , which , with the rise of agro-mineral prices , led to a narrowly focused agro-mineral export strategy centered exclusively on large agro-business and mineral extractive elites to the detriment of small businesses and rural producers .
The MST ’s efforts to influence Da Silva over the past decade ( 2003 - 2009 ) were futile – as state , local and federal governments criminalized the movement ’s direct action tactics of land occupation .
Lula ’s policy of granting subsistence federal food allowances to the extremely poor and his success at co-opting movement leaders , especially from the huge trade union federations , neutralized the landless peasants and organized workers ’ capacity to protest and strike .
Lula ’s policies isolated the MST from its ‘ natural ’ urban allies in the labor movement .
Lula ’s right - turn and the vast increase in export revenues from high commodity prices led to increased social expenditures and reduced the level of activity and support for the MST in its struggle for agrarian reform .
While retaining its mass base and continuing its land occupations , the MST no longer had a strategic political ally in its quest for social transformation .
Subsequently it pursued more moderate reforms to avoid confrontation with the Lula regime , to which it still offered ‘ critical support ’ .
In Argentina , the massive wave of direct action social movements subsided with the election of Kirchner ( 2003 - 2008 ) and the 7 % economic growth rate stimulated by the commodity boom and the recovery from the dramatic economic melt - down of 2001 - 2002 .
With the recovery of employment and the return of their savings , the middle class assemblies rapidly disappeared .
Kirchner offered subsidies to the unemployed and co-opted their leaders , which led to a sharp reduction of road blockages and membership in the militant unemployed workers organizations .
Kirchner won over part of the human rights movement with his policies , which included his public purge of some of the more notorious military and police officials and the granting of subsidies to certain sectors of the human rights movement , including the Madres de la Plaza de Mayo .
With the decline of the radicalized movements of 1999 - 2002 , the economic recovery of 2003 - 2008 led to a partial recovery of trade union activism , whose demands were mostly economic , focusing on the recovery of the workers ’ wages and benefits lost during the systemic crisis .
In Bolivia , the economic boom , which began under the neo-liberal regime of Carlos Mesa continued under ‘ leftist ’ populist Evo Morales .
He quickly moderated movement demands as he moved to the center - left .
As an alternative to the social movement platform calling for the nationalization of the principal resource sectors exploited by multi-national corporations , Morales promoted ‘ joint ventures ’ which he demagogically claimed were ‘ nationalization without expropriation ’ .
Likewise he answered peasant and Indian demands for agrarian reform by opening up mostly uncultivatable public lands in the Amazon to the landless peasants .
By the same token , he protected the most fertile land in the largest privately owned plantations from expropriation by exempting private land , which was classified as performing a ‘ social function ’ .
Avoiding structural change , Morales was able to use the windfall of state revenues from the high prices of Bolivian minerals and gas to co-opt movement leaders , provide incremental increases in the minimum wage , finance subsidies to Indian communities , encourage legal , political rights and recognize indigenous jurisdiction over their local communities .
Morales retained his leadership of the coca farmers union and , through his Movement to Socialist Party ( MAS ) , exercised hegemony over the major community - based movements .
His close ties with Presidents Castro in Cuba and Chavez in Venezuela set him in radical opposition to Washington ’s interventionist policies and its supporters among the five rightist - controlled provinces centered in Santa Cruz .
The extreme right gained ascendancy in the latter region and launched a violent racist frontal assault on the Morales government , polarizing the countryside while guaranteeing Morales the continued mass support among the popular classes and movements throughout the country .
In Ecuador , the powerful Indian movement ( CONAIE ) and its allies in the trade unions supported the neo-liberal regime of Lucio Gutierrez and suffered a severe decline in their power , support and organizational cohesion .
The recovery has been slow , hindered by interventions of numerous US / EU funded NGOs .
With the demise of the established social movements , a new urban - based ‘ citizens ’ movement ’ led by Rafael Correa overthrew the venal , corrupt , neo-liberal Gutierrez regime and led the electorate to vote Correa into power in both 2006 and 2009 .
Correa adapted center - left political positions , financing incremental wage and salary increases and state subsidized cheap credit to small and medium size businesses .
He adopted a nationalist position on foreign debt payments and the termination of US military basing rights in Manta .
The boom in mining and petroleum prices and ties with oil - rich Venezuela facilitated President Correa ’s capacity to fund programs to secure support among the Andean bourgeoisie and the popular classes .
In Venezuela , the economic boom , namely the tripling of world oil prices , facilitated Venezuela ’s economic recovery after the crisis caused by the opposition coup and the bosses ’ lockout ( 2002 -2003 ) .
As a result , from 2004 to 2008 Venezuela grew by nearly 9 % a year .
The Chavez government was able to generously fund a whole series of progressive socio-economic changes that enhanced the strength and attraction of pro-government social movements .
The social movements played an enormous role in defeating opposition referendums , which had called for the impeachment of the President .
Peasant organizations were prominent in pressuring recalcitrant bureaucrats in the Chavez government to implement the new agrarian laws calling for land distribution .
Trade union militants organized strikes and demonstrations and played a major role in the nationalization of the steel industry .
Given the vast increase in state resources , the Chavez government was able to both compensate the owners of the expropriated firms and meet workers ’ demands for social ownership .
Summary
The economic boom and the ascendancy of center - left governments led to incremental increases in living standards , a decline of unemployment and the co-optation of some movement leaders — resulting in the decline of radical movement activity and the revival of traditional ‘ pragmatic ’ trade union moderates .
During the economic boom and the rise of the center - left , the only major mass mobilization took the form of right wing movements determined to destabilize the center - left governments in Bolivia and Venezuela .
A comparison of the social movements in countries where they played a major role in political and social change ( Venezuela , Ecuador , Brazil and Bolivia ) and movements in countries where they were marginalized reveals several crucial differences .
First of all , the differences are not found in terms of the quantity of public protests , militant direct actions or number of participants .
For example , if one adds up the number of social movement protests in Mexico , Peru , Colombia and Central America , they might equal or even surpass the social actions in Brazil , Argentina and Bolivia .
What was different and most politically significant was the quality of the mass action .
Wherever they were of marginal significance , the organizations were fragmented , dispersed and without significant national leadership or structure and without any political leverage on the institutions of national power .
In contrast , influential social movements operated as national organizations , which coordinated social and political action , centralized and capable of reaching the nerve centers of political power – the capital cities ( La Paz , Buenos Aires , Quito and to a lesser degree Sao Paolo ) .
To one degree or another , the high impact social movements combined rural and urban movements , had political allies in the party system and bridged cultural barriers ( linking indigenous and mestizo popular classes ) .
World Economic Crisis and Social Movements – 2008 Onward
Beginning in late 2008 and continuing in 2009 the world economic crisis spread across Latin America .
The crisis came later to Latin America and with less initial severity than in the US or EU .
Because it is an ongoing process , the full socio-political implications and economic impact is still far from clear .
What we can observe is that , at least initially , the current crisis has not provoked anything like the mass upheavals and the surge of radical social movements that we witnessed during the crisis beginning in 2001 .

If anything , we have seen a surge of right - wing movements and electoral organizations in countries , like Argentina , and a US - backed right - wing military coup backed by the rightist business associations in Honduras , and the continued ‘ pragmatic ’ behavior of mass social movements in Brazil , Bolivia and Ecuador .
The only exception is in Peru where the organized Indian communities in the Amazonian region have engaged in armed mass confrontations with the US - backed , right - wing regime of Alan Garcia .
The Amazonian Indians responded to a series of Government decrees , which handed mineral and gas exploitation rights on Indian lands to foreign mining and energy corporations .
From a historical perspective , the struggle was ‘ conservative ’ , in so far as it pitted indigenous communities defending traditional use and ownership of lands and resources against the modern economic predators and the the neo-liberal state .
The Lumpen - Bourgeoisie : The Triple Alliance of the Neo-Liberal State , Narco - traffickers and the Unemployed Poor
The least studied , but most dynamic , and , possibly best organized social movement in Latin America today is the right - wing drug trafficking movement .
Headed by a powerful narco - bourgeoisie , with strong ties to the military and neo-liberal state apparatus and with armed lumpen - cadres drawn from the urban unemployed and landless peasantry , the ‘ Lumpen ’ Movement has created a powerful geographic and social presence in Mexico , Colombia , Peru , Bolivia , Guatemala , Honduras , El Salvador and elsewhere .
It was the agrarian neo-liberal policies that prepared the ground for the ‘ mass base ’ of the rightist narco - movement .
The promotion of mechanized agro-export agriculture in Colombia , Mexico , Peru and Central America uprooted millions .
State terror and paramilitary death squads drove millions of peasant families from the land and into urban slums .
The large - scale importation of cheap , subsidized agricultural produce from the US wiped out many thousands of small - scale family farms .
The stagnant of manufacturing sector was unable to absorb the migrants into labor - intensive work .
This created massive numbers of young rural unemployed landless and urban workers , who could be either recruits for progressive social movements or recruits for the narco - industry .
Cultivating coca and opium , refining and smuggling the drugs and soldiering for the drug lords provided a livelihood for these desperate young men and women .
The deep economic crisis and stagnation of the 1990’s and early 2000 ’s created a large mass of young unemployed and under - employed workers in the cities ripe for employment by the narco - gangs who paid a living wage for an often deadly occupation .
The links between right - wing political parties , banking , business and landowner associations has been demonstrated repeatedly throughout Latin America .
In Colombia , drug traffickers have become large landowners after their death squads devastated peasant communities suspected of supporting leftists or progressive organizations .
‘ Sicarios ’ or ‘ hit - men ’ are mostly young men from working or peasant class background who ‘ work ’ for business leaders and multi-national corporations as assassins .
They have killed hundreds of trade union and peasant and Indian leaders each year in Colombia alone .
Over a third of the members of the Colombian Congress , the principle backers of President Uribe , have been financed by the drug cartels .
Uribe has long - term ties with prominent narco - traffickers and death - squad militia leaders .
In Mexico , drug traffickers have recruited widely among the impoverished peasants .
In many Mexican states the narcos have purchased the services of thousands of government officials from top to bottom .
In the absence of employment and a social safety - net , many of the poor find work in the narco - trade .
Narco - traffickers have established alliances and business associations with upper class financial groups engaging in joint ‘ philanthropic ’ activities , such as handing out cash and delivering needed services to the poor .
Narco - traffickers eventually wash their illegal earnings through major banks in the US , Canada and Europe and then invest in real estate , tourist complexes and landed properties .
Narco - trafficker organizations and death squads have worked closely with rightwing movements in Sta. Cruz ( Bolivia ) , with rightist political parties in El Salvador , Guatemala and Honduras , as well as in Mexico and Colombia .
The ‘ lumpenization ’ process operates via two routes :
In some cases , young unemployed males are directly recruited via neighborhood organizations ; in other cases the dispossessed , bankrupt and downwardly mobile farmers and long - term unemployed workers are gradually forced into the ‘ illegal ’ labor market .
The long - term , large - scale process of stagnation , despite the periods of export growth , marginalize the rural poor and accelerate their impoverishment without generating compensatory stable , urban employment paying a living wages .
The ‘ lumpenization ’ of these displaced , marginalized peasants and workers , produced by the crisis and class polarization , is accompanied by the rise of a ‘ lumpen culture ’ with its own hierarchical structures , where the few at the ‘ top ’ develop ties to the economic and state elite and the masses at the ‘ bottom ’ aspire to a degenerate kind of middle - class consumerist life - style .
By the first decade of the new millennium , the rightist lumpen - narco movement far exceeded the progressive popular movements in terms of power and influence in Mexico , Colombia , Central America and some countries in the Caribbean , like Jamaica .
The relationship between the ‘ legal ’ rightist and the ‘ narco ’ rightist movements is one of collaboration and conflict :
They join forces to oppose powerful rural and trade union movements and progressive electoral regimes .
The lumpen - narcos provide the ‘ shock troops ’ to assassinate progressive leaders , including elected officials and to terrorize supporters among the peasantry and urban poor .
On the other hand , violent conflict between the rightists can break out at any time , especially when the lumpen - elite encroach on the state prerogatives , business interests , ties with imperial drug enforcement agencies and raise questions about the legitimacy of the bourgeois class .
Latin America ’s Social Movements and the Economic Recession / Depression
Economic crises have multiple and diverse impacts on the popular classes and social movements .
The profound economic crisis of the 1990’s and first years of 2000 radicalized the popular classes and led to widespread ‘ high impact ’ protests and national rebellions , which overthrew incumbent neo-liberal regimes and replaced them with ‘ center - left ’ regimes .
At the same time the social changes , implicit in the neo-liberal crisis , led to a downwardly mobile urban and rural sector .
This formed the basis for the growth of dynamic leftist social movement led by popular mass - based leaders and rightist movements led by lumpen - narco chiefs and supported by the economic elites .
The conservative , far - right confronted popular social movements from positions in the state and through the military and para - military death squads .
The commodity boom and the ascendancy of the ‘ center - left ’ regimes led to the ‘ moderation ’ of demands from below in the face of cooptation from above .
Large - scale job creation and poverty programs , cheap credit and incremental wage and salary increases all contributed to moderating mass politics .
The trade unions re-emerged as central actors and collective bargaining replaced mass direct action .
Rural movements engaged in militant struggle were relatively isolated .
The key political factor in this period was the demobilization of the popular classes , the decline of the direct action movements and the restoration of the power of the business , land - owning and mining elite based on their strengthened economic position .
The rejuvenated Right took the lead in directing their own ‘ direct action ’ movements in Bolivia , Argentina and Central America .
As the crisis of 2008 - 2009 unfolded , the progressive movements were slow to respond , having been ‘ under the tent ’ of the center - left electoral regimes .
Since these regimes were now being held responsible for the fallout of the commodity crash , the left social movements were in a weak position and unable to pose any radical alternatives .
It is important to remember that the world economic crisis had hit the ‘ North ’ ( US / EU ) earlier and harder than in Latin America .
In Latin American , the social impact was weaker – at first .
Unemployment grew mainly during the last months of 2008 .
The gradual unfolding of the crisis contrasted with the system - wide crash of the late 1990 ’s - 2002 , which precipitated mass rebellions .
In addition , as a consequence of the earlier crisis , capital and finance controls had been imposed that limited the spread of the toxic assets and financial crisis from the US to Latin America .
Moreover , Latin American countries are diversifying their trade , especially toward Asia including China , which continues to grow at 8 % a year .
Diversification and financial controls limited the impact of the US financial melt - down on the Latin American economies .
In addition , the early ‘ stimulus ’ measures , taken in response to the first signs of the crisis , had the effect of temporarily ameliorating the impact of the global recession / depression on Latin America .
Nevertheless as the depression deepens in the North , Latin America ’s trade has plunged , and the region has fallen into negative growth .
As a result , unemployment is growing in both the export sectors as well as in production for the domestic economy .
In response , the right - wing parties and leaders blame the center - left regimes .
Moves are underway in Argentina , Bolivia and Ecuador to oust these regimes through elections or through coups , backed by US President Obama ’s ‘ rollback ’ global strategy .
The July 2009 coup in Honduras , covertly backed from the strategic US military base in the country , is the first sign that Washington is moving its military client to overthrow the new independent ‘ center - left ’ regimes in the region .
This is particularly true among the Central American and Caribbean countries linked with Venezuela in the new integration programs , such as ALBA and PetroCaribe .
The first manifestations of progressive mass popular protests in the current economic recession are not directly related to the economic decline .
In Peru , the indigenous Amazonian communities organized militant road blockages and confrontations with the military resulting in over one hundred dead and wounded .
This mass movement developed in response to the Peruvian government ’s granting concessions of mining exploitation rights to foreign multi-nationals , an infringement of the rights of the indigenous people to their lands in the Amazonian region .
Demonstrations in solidarity with the Amazonian Indians occurred in most cities , including Lima .
The Congress , fearing a mass uprising , temporarily canceled the concessions .
This was a major victory for the indigenous communities .
Moreover , the success of the Amazonian Indian communities has detonated widespread sustained strikes and protests in most of the major cities of Peru , in response to economic decline resulting from falling commodity prices .
The sustained popular struggle in Honduras is in response to the military coup overthrowing President Zelaya , a moderate reformer pursuing an independent foreign policy .
Led by the urban public sector trade unions and peasant movements , the struggle has combined democratic , nationalist and populist demands .
Apart from these two mass popular movements , the economic crisis has yet to evoke mass radical rebellions , like those which took place during earlier crises between 2000 - 2003 .
We can posit several possible explanations or hypotheses for the contrasting responses of the mass movements to economic crises .
Hypotheses
1 . The full impact of the world crisis has yet to hit the popular classes – it began late in
2008 and only began to register increased unemployment in the first quarter of 2009 .
2 . The current crisis , at first , did not hit the lower middle classes , public employees and skilled workers .
It has been highly segmented , thus weakening cross class solidarity and alliances present in earlier crises .
3 . Unlike the previous period , the crisis takes place in many countries , which are ruled by ‘ center left ’ regimes with an organized social base backed by the social movements .
These regime - movement linkages neutralize mass protests , out of fear of a return to the hard right .
4 . The mass movements on the left have responded to the crisis with relative passivity – in part because the governments have intervened with economic stimulus measures and some social ameliorative policies .
The continuation and deepening of the crisis and the inadequate coverage of moderate public interventions could eventually lead to the resurgence of mass struggles .
5 . The increasing economic vulnerability of the incumbent center - left regimes and the relative passivity of the progressive social movements has opened political space and opportunities for rightwing mass mobilizations , combining electoral and street politics to build a base for a return to power .
6 . The crisis will likely accelerate the lumpenization process , as long - term unemployment sets in and if alternate movements fail to organize the chronically unemployed in consequential struggles .
7 . As the bourgeoisie and its political supporters find few legitimate sources for profiteering available , they will likely serve as intermediaries and ‘ protectors ’ of the narco - traffickers and other criminal syndicates and rely on them to eliminate left social movement leaders and activists .
8 . The rise of the ‘ lumpen - Right ’ may lead to a virtual ‘ dual power ’ situation in which legitimate and illegitimate power configurations cooperate in repressing social movements and compete for influence .
9 . The relative passivity of the social movements is likely a transitory phenomenon , influenced by the convergence of circumstances .
If the crisis deepens and extends over time and rightist regimes return to power , recent past historical experience strongly suggests that the massive increase in poverty and unemployment , combined with repressive rightist regimes , could lead to mass rebellions on the part of the previously ‘ passive ’ popular classes .
The nation 's wealth gap is widening amid an uproar about lofty pay packages in the financial world .
Executives and other highly compensated employees now receive more than one - third of all pay in the U.S. , according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Social Security Administration data -- without counting billions of dollars more in pay that remains off federal radar screens that measure wages and salaries .

Haskell used for data analysis - OLAP ?
Hi , I 've developed this commercial app in Haskell with all of the business logic coded in SQL with the help of haskelldb .
Some of the intermediate results ( of queries ) I had to manifest in extra tables because the initial query was expensive , the intermediate result would be the " source " data of other queries and queries can't themselves be indexed for further efficient querying .
Since the amount of data could become rather large , in - memory processing was n't an option and I thus chose SQL ( Sqlite ) .
The solution works , but still I 'm not quite happy about it , since I consider the tables that hold intermediate results fixes .
I understand that the financial industry employs Haskell to analyse large data set under complex schemes .
I wonder what techniques are employed for that , do they use Haskell to create some sort of OLAPish tools ?
Do they use Haskell to run complex queries against SQL data warehouses ?

( From Right - Wing Populism in America : Too Close for Comfort ) The Lyndon LaRouche network , an offshoot of the radical student movement that metamorphosed into a fascist organization in the early 1970s , developed an idiosyncratic doctrine and approach quite different from other far - right groups .
Though often dismissed as a bizarre political cult , the LaRouche organization and its various front groups are a fascist movement whose pronouncements echo elements of Nazi ideology .
Beginning in the 1970s , the LaRouchites combined populist antielitism with attacks on leftists , environmentalists , feminists , gay men and lesbians , and organized labor .
They advocated a dictatorship in which a “ humanist ” elite would rule on behalf of industrial capitalists .
They developed an idiosyncratic , coded variation on the Illuminati Freemason and Jewish banker conspiracy theories .
Their views , though exotic , were internally consistent and rooted in right - wing populist traditions ....

As someone who writes about entrepreneurship and teaches others how to sell physical products online , I make a habit of following as many successful people as I can .
It does n’t matter if you ’re famous or just starting out , I ’ll at least check out your website to see what you have to say .
But even though I love reading posts about entrepreneurship , I ’ve become increasingly jaded with the cliches that I ’ve been seeing .
“ Learn to fail ”
“ Learn from your mistakes ”
“ Understand your weaknesses ”
“ Hustle hard ”
“ Fail fast and often ”
Do n’t get me wrong .
These articles all offer great advice but it is difficult to truly comprehend and describe these actions in words unless you ’ve experienced them first hand with real people .
For example , what the hell does “ Fail fast and often ” mean ?
Does that mean that I should purposely screw up over and over again ?
How the heck is telling me to “ hustle hard ” possibly going to help me ?
“ DOH !
Thank god Steve told me to hustle because I ’ve been slacking here the entire time ! ”
Bottom line , trite sayings will never help you .
Instead , your success in business and life depends on your routine and your habits in life .
After interviewing over 150 successful entrepreneurs on my podcast , I ’ve noticed definite patterns of behavior that forces them to succeed .
Here are the habits of successful people that resonate with me the most .

Successful Entrepreneurs Do n’t Get Bogged Down With Little Details
Almost all of my friends who run successful companies have this uncanny knack for staying focused and not getting sidetracked by minute details .
Now there ’s a reason that this is the first trait on my list .
Not only is it the most important one , but it used to be ( and still is ) one of my greatest weaknesses .
Looking back , when I first started my wedding linens store , I kept getting stuck on stupid , meaningless details .
For example when I was working on the first iteration of my website , I remember spending 8 hours tweaking the look of the sidebar and header for my online store .
I would move our logo 10 pixels to the right , make the sidebar just a little bit wider and move things all around .
After all of that tweaking , everything still looked pretty much the same and I wasted many hours that I could have been using to grow the business , especially in the early stages .
If you ’ve taken my free 6 day mini course , you ’ve probably seen me talk about various shopping carts like Open Cart , Shopify and Big Commerce .
Well here ’s what I ’ve come to realize .
Even though I ’m still a huge proponent of owning your source code and having the flexibility of an open source platform like Open Cart , 90 % of you are probably better off using a fully hosted solution like Shopify or Big Commerce because the little details of site design can bog you down .
Is your time better spent tweaking your website or formulating your sales plan ?
Good entrepreneurs know their priorities and will rarely waste time in any activity that does n’t directly affect their end goal .
Speaking from experience , it ’s all too easy to become engrossed in something that appears to be significant on the surface but actually does n’t really matter at all .
Prioritize !
Successful Entrepreneurs Know When Someone Else Can Do The Job Better And Faster
One of the easiest traps to fall into is to try and do everything yourself especially if you are n’t the right person for the job .
Most entrepreneurs will often try to save money on a bootstrapped budget even if doing so is not inline with their goals .
They do n’t take into account the time aspect of their work and think strictly in terms of dollars .
But the best entrepreneurs I know optimize their time for maximum throughput .
They know what they are good at and when to outsource .
Ok confession time .
Those of you who know me well know that I always try to do everything myself even if I ’m not the right person for the job .
And I ’ve been known to code up entire plugins on my own in order to avoid getting nickle and dimed with a monthly fee for a simple feature .
For example , I recently coded up a custom review system for my store instead of paying for a popular review service that would have costed me hundreds of dollars per month .
But hear me out .
When I take on the task of doing something myself , I do so for the sake of learning .
And I rarely have a strict time table .
In addition because I teach a class on ecommerce , I feel as though I MUST have detailed knowledge of everything that I teach .
In fact , what differentiates me from a lot of other teachers out there is that I actually do everything myself and know all of the little details .
But if you are a brand new entrepreneur just starting out ?
You need to consider the trade offs of going cheap .
When I first started out , I designed my own website even though I knew nothing about web development or programming php .
And as a result of my lack of experience , I ended up spending a lot of time writing code that was already written by someone else before .
I devoted many hours learning and struggling through something that I could have easily hired someone else to do in a quarter of the time .
Now I do n’t regret my decision to learn about web programming as I ’m now self sufficient when it comes to web design .
But realistically , my wife and I could have launched our store several months earlier had we hired an expert to do the job .
Figure out your timetable and adjust accordingly .
Successful Entrepreneurs Know How To Do The Bare Minimum Just To Get By
If you read my last post on being a lazy entrepreneur , hopefully you ’ve realized that you do n’t need to be great at EVERYTHING .
In fact , you do n’t need to be an expert at anything unless it is one of the core competencies of your business .
Successful entrepreneurs are adept at learning and doing just the right amount of research and work to get by and not an ounce more .
Going back to the web design analogy , you do n’t need to reinvent the wheel in order to create a high converting website .
90 % of the features you need have already been written by someone else in some shape or form .
You just need to do your due diligence and find the required bits and pieces to put it all together .
For example , before you hire a developer to implement something custom , spend some time looking for a plugin that already does what you are looking for .
Personally before I start any coding project , I do a quick Google search to see what ’s already out there .
And 9 times out of 10 , I can simply piece together and adapt existing code for my own needs .
Great entrepreneurs do n’t create anything from scratch unless they absolutely have to !
Successful Entrepreneurs Are Excellent With People
Going out of your way to help others is my favorite trait of successful entrepreneurs .
I ’m not sure if it ’s just a coincidence , but my most successful friends have gigantic networks of people who are always willing to help .
And they ’ve established these mutually beneficial relationships by helping each other out without expecting anything in return .
In fact , I ’ve never met a successful entrepreneur who also was n’t an excellent people person as well .
It seems as though making friends and helping others comes with the territory .
This is the main reason why I started my podcast .
As an engineer who likes to hide behind a computer screen , podcasting forces me to reach out and meet new entrepreneurs .
And as a result , I get to talk to someone new and successful for a solid hour every week .
Fostering lasting relationships is what I love about networking with new people which is why I try to attend as many conferences as my wife will allow me to attend .
It ’s also why I started my own conference called The Sellers Summit .

Above all else , being a successful entrepreneur is about listening to other peoples ’ problems and finding solutions .
Great entrepreneurs simply have a knack for fixing things .
And the more people they can help , the more successful they become .
Successful Entrepreneurs Have An Open Mind
Finally , great entrepreneurs are constantly learning .
You ’ve probably heard the story that the wealthiest entrepreneurs in the world read an insane number of books .
For example , Warren Buffett has been known to read between 600 and 1000 pages per day and devotes about 80 % of each day to reading .
Bill Gates reads about 50 books per year .
Now I do n’t read nearly as much as Warren Buffett or even Bill Gates , but one thing that I have learned from the great entrepreneurs of the world is to keep an open mind .
After all , just because you are successful today does n’t mean that it will last forever .
And you have to be constantly evolving your business in order to stay relevant .
My favorite example of this is with Netflix .
Even though they obliterated Blockbuster and were killing it with their mail order DVD rental business , Reed Hastings made the tough decision to focus the business towards streaming video .
Now in hindsight , this seemed like an obvious decision but back in the day , DVD rentals were 99 % of their business .
One of my favorite quotes of all time is from Andy Grove of Intel who once said “ Only the paranoid survive ” .
If you are stuck in your ways and unwilling to change , then someone will eventually overtake you .
And the only way to change is to expose yourself to new and different ways of thinking .
Changing Your Habits
Even though I admire all of these habits and traits of successful entrepreneurs , there ’s no way to just flip the switch and adopt these habits immediately .
It ’s a gradual process and something that I myself am constantly working on in the background .
For example , every week I force myself to take a step back from my work and look at the big picture .
I analyze what ’s on my plate and figure out how to simplify and do the least amount of work possible to achieve the desired result .
I decide if it makes sense to outsource more .
I spend a good portion of the week keeping up with trends and new strategies for success .
And I attend as many conferences as I can .
What are you doing to change your habits ?

Have you read these ?
With new Browsers coming every fort - night , everyone wants to try their hands into Browser market .
Whether it ’s small or big player , they come and go .
But this one could be different .
Have you met RockMelt yet ?
Neither have most people , it seems — but the Web is definitely buzzing with word of the mysterious new browser .
It triggered with the story in The New York Times , then onwards , RockMelt rapidly became the talk of the tech community .
So what exactly is RockMelt , and who ’s behind it ?
Most of the available info is sketchy at best .
If you piece it all together , though , you can get a very rough picture of what the browser might be about .
Here ’s a roundup of what ’s been revealed so far .
1. RockMelt ’s founders are two former Opsware ( Netscape ) employees .
The guys reportedly creating RockMelt are Tim Howe and Eric Vishria , both of whom used to work at networking company Opsware .
Opsware was founded by Netscape creator Marc Andreessen and sold to HP in 2007 .
2. Andreessen himself may be involved with RockMelt .
Andreessen is investing in RockMelt , according to unnamed sources quoted by The New York Times .
Andreessen apparently alluded to the project in an interview earlier this summer as well , telling The Times he had “ backed a really good team . ”
Within minutes , The Times reports , Andreessen “ appeared to regret his comment ” and declined to elaborate any further .
3. RockMelt will be “ different ” from other browsers .
What ?
It ’s a vague statement , but Andreessen is quoted as telling “ RockMelt would stand out from the pack of browsers currently on the market , focusing somehow on the “ network of complex Web sites and applications ” into which the Internet has evolved . ”
4. RockMelt may feature some kind of Facebook integration .
One of the areas of focus may involve some kind of social network integration .
A Times reporter claims to have seen references to a RockMelt - Facebook relationship in a privacy policy once posted on the RockMelt home page .
( The policy is no longer accessible from the site . )
The reporter says the policy discussed the presence of features tied to a user ’s Facebook ID , including built - in access to Facebook updates and other content .
The idea of a Facebook relationship .
An Early build of RockMelt can be called “ semi- independent desktop client for Facebook . ”
Here is a screenshot as an illustration .
Despite those reports , Facebook is denying knowledge of any kind of formal relationship with the startup .
A Facebook spokesperson has gone on the record as saying the company is “ not aware of any details about RockMelt and its product . ”
5. RockMelt may have its own URL shortener .
RockMelt has registered the domain me.lt as a URL shortener , ReadWriteWeb ’s Kirkpatrick claims .
He says the domain was referenced on the RockMelt home page up until early this week .
According to DNS records , the me.lt domain was registered on April 16 of this year under the name “ Klute - Thiemann Informationstechnologie GmbH & Co. KG . ”
As of now , it points to a generic server landing page .
6. RockMelt team is staying quiet , purposely .
The guys involved with RockMelt definitely do n’t want to say much about it .
Eric Vishria tells he and his group are “ at very early stages of development , ” adding : “ Talking about it at this stage is not useful . ”
RockMelt ’s
Web site does have a form to register for updates as they become available .
I already did it , will keep you updated .

The Worcester Telegram & Gazette reports another Teabagger / Townhall incident up in the Worcester , Mass .
This time it was Reps. McGovern ( D ) and Neal ( D ) heckled and shouted down several times by unruly Bay State Teabaggers at a townhall event U Mass Medical School .
Indeed , at one point , one heckler started likening Rep. McGovern to Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele , notorious for performing macabre experiments on concentration camp inmates .
But was it just Teabaggers ?
It turns out a long - time TPM Reader ( I ’ll call him RZ to extra - super - double protect his anonymity ) was there and he just after leaving the event he wrote in to tell us that at this event the Teabaggers were joined by a squad of LaRouchies .
About the Mengele incident , he writes …
In response to a question about medical effectiveness research , the gentleman wearing a shirt with President Obama sporting a Hitler mustache called our dean “ Dr. Mengele ” for suggesting we compare treatments to find those that are effective , safe and better than other medical treatments treatments .
The conversation reached a low at that point .
Apparently the Mengele outburst came in response to a question about medical effectiveness research came from a non-Teabag , non-LaRouche sane woman in her 60s .
So I asked RZ , was the Mengele outburst from one of the Teabaggers or one of the LaRouchies ?
Definitely Larouche …
They are calling the Obama Plan a “ Nazi health plan . ” I could n’t bring myself to take their literature .
They made the Teabag crowd look civil .
Sounds like it was quite a special time .

The World Series Of Card Stacking ?
Total Pro Sports –
So I had to check this up and no , it is not yet an event at the annual World Series of Poker which is currently taking place in Las Vegas , Nevada , but if there was a bracelet awarded for card stacking , then it would not be very hard finding a winner .
During the 2009 WSOP , Bryan Berg , the world record holder for card stacking , was on hand to build the London skyline for Betfair Poker using several decks of cards .
How long did it actually take ?
We are not sure , but thankfully it was cut down to 1 minute 37 seconds for our viewing pleasure .
Luckily Brad Garrett ‘s girlfriend was not around to provide any distractions .
As for the actual competition , Phil Ivey currently looks to be in good shape to add to his 2009 WSOP win totals as he sits in third place with only 64 participants remaining .
Also in the mix is Antonio Esfandiari , sitting in 6th .
These tow pros are in good shape , headlining the top 10 , and intimidation may become a factor allowing for a familiar face to take home over $ 8.5 million first place prize and the main event bracelet .
Here is Bryan Berg ’s card stacking .

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke made a guarded declaration of success Tuesday before a skeptical and sometimes combative audience , saying Fed policies had helped to set the stage for a modest recovery this year .
In his semiannual testimony to Congress on the economic outlook , Mr. Bernanke laid out the case that growth is returning , saying businesses and consumers could be nearer to a resumption of spending after wrenching cutbacks .
He also turned up the heat on Congress and the White House to get budget deficits under ...

The Fraser Institute ’s motto is : “ If it matters , measure it . ” Mark Twain had a different take : “ Lies , damn lies , and statistics . ”
It ’s easy for statistics to become lies .
A recent Fraser Institute mini study demonstrates how this can happen .
This study was produced to contribute to the heated debate in the United States over Barack Obama ’s proposal to bring in a publicly funded health - insurance option .
One argument used to support a public option is that it would reduce the large number of bankruptcies experienced by Americans who have inadequate insurance to pay for expensive medical procedures .
A 2007 national study by legal , medical , and sociological researchers found that medical expenses contributed to nearly two - thirds of all personal bankruptcies in the U.S.
Most medical debtors were well educated , owned homes , and had middle - class occupations , the study noted .
Three quarters had medical insurance but had accumulated large medical debts , lost significant income due to illness , or mortgaged their homes to pay medical bills .
Some lost coverage when they changed jobs .
An earlier study by the same authors noted that Canada ’s universal health insurance resulted in lower bankruptcy rates .
Not so , claims Brett Skinner , the Fraser Institute ’s director of bio-pharma and health - policy research , and senior policy analyst Mark Rovere .
If the 2007 national study is correct , they argue , because of Canada ’s single - payer system , “ we should expect to observe a lower rate of bankruptcy in Canada compared to the United States , all else being equal .
Yet the most recent data shows that the non-business bankruptcy rate in Canada is statistically the same as it is in the United States . ”
But Skinner and Rovere do n’t use the most recent data , which would undermine their case .
They use data from 2006 and 2007 that shows bankruptcy rates being higher in Canada than in the U.S.
In both years , the Canadian bankruptcy rate was 3.0 per thousand population .
In the U.S. , the rate was 2.0 per thousand in 2006 and 2.7 in 2007 .
Skinner and Rovere conclude that a publicly funded health - care system does n’t lead to lower bankruptcy rates .
Why , though , did n’t the Fraser authors use 2008 data ?
It ’s not that it was n’t available .
The Fraser study is dated July 7 , 2009 , and the footnotes indicate they were checking Web sites up to June 17 .
The United States Bankruptcy Courts released its 2008 bankruptcy statistics on March 5 , 2009 , and the office of the superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada ’s annual insolvency - rates Web page was last modified on March 10 , 2009 .
Skinner and Rovere could easily have used the 2008 data .
But this new data shows that in contrast to 2006 and 2007 , the U.S. bankruptcy rate was higher than Canada’s .
Nor is 2008 the only year American bankruptcies surpassed those in Canada .
The Fraser study claims “ we should expect to observe a lower rate of bankruptcy in Canada compared to the United States , all else being equal . ”
But all else is not equal .
The U.S. revamped its bankruptcy law in 2005 — the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act — making it more difficult for consumers to declare bankruptcy .
In 2006 , the first year used in the Fraser study , American bankruptcy rates plummeted .
In the six years before the law came into effect , the Canadian rate averaged 3.8 per thousand population , while the average American rate was 6.7 bankruptcies per thousand — nearly 75 percent higher .
In fact , 2006 and 2007 are the only two years in the past decade in which Canadian bankruptcy rates exceeded the American ones .
And they are the only two used in the Fraser analysis .
Bob Lawless is a professor at the University of Illinois School of Law and a nationally acclaimed expert in bankruptcy and corporate law .
In a post on Creditslips.org , a blog for law professors and other experts in credit and bankruptcy , Lawless chastises the Fraser study for using bankruptcy rates for the total population rather than for the adult population ( over 18 ) .
Despite the housing and financial collapses , not many 11 - year - olds are declaring bankruptcy these days .
Lawless allowed that the results would likely not be much different if Skinner and Rovere had used the more relevant adult population .
Lawless accuses the Fraser authors of being “ extremely selective ” in their use of bankruptcy data .
“ By limiting the data to 2006 and 2007 , ” he concludes , “ the report is able to support the anti–health - care - reform agenda that the Fraser Institute seems to further . ”
It mattered , and the Fraser Institute measured it .
Researchers at the J. Craig Venter Institute ( JCVI ) , a not - for - profit genomic research organization , have just published results describing new methods in which the entire bacterial genome from Mycoplasma mycoides was cloned in a yeast cell by adding yeast centromeric plasmid sequence to the bacterial chromosome .
Researchers modified it in yeast using yeast genetic systems .
This modified bacterial chromosome was then isolated from yeast and transplanted into a related species of bacteria , Mycoplasma capricolum , to create a new type of M. mycoides cell .
This is the first time that genomes have been transferred between branches of life — from a prokaryote to eukaryote and back to a prokaryote .
The research was published by Carole Lartigue et al in the journal Science on August 21 .
Hamilton Smith , M.D. , one of the leaders of the JCVI team said , “ I believe this work has important implications in better understanding the fundamentals of biology to enable the final stages of our work in creating and booting up a synthetic genome .
This is possibly one of the most important new findings in the field of synthetic genomics . ”
The research published today was made possible by previous breakthroughs at JCVI .
In 2007 the team published results from the transplantation of the native M. mycoides genome into the M. capricolum cell which resulted in the M. capricolum cell being transformed into M. mycoides .
This work established the notion that DNA is the software of life and that it is the DNA that dictates the cell phenotype .
In 2008 the same team reported on the construction of the first synthetic bacterial genome by assembling DNA fragments made from the four chemicals of life — ACGT .
The final assembly of DNA fragments into the whole genome was performed in yeast by making use of the yeast genetic systems .
However , when the team attempted to transplant the synthetic bacterial genome out of yeast into a recipient bacterial cell , all the experiments failed .
The researchers had previously established that no proteins were required for chromosome transplantations , however they reasoned that DNA methylation ( a chemical modification of DNA that bacterial cells use to protect their genome from degradation by restriction enzymes , which are the proteins that cut DNA at specific sites ) might be required for transplantation .
When the chromosome was isolated direct from the bacterial cells it was likely already methylated and therefore transplantable due to it being protected from the cells restriction enzymes .
In this study , the team began by cloning the native M. mycoides genome into yeast by adding a yeast centromere to the bacterial genome .
This is the first time a native bacterial genome has been grown successfully in yeast .
Specific methylase enzymes were isolated from M. mycoides and used to methylate the M. mycoides genome isolated from yeast .
When the DNA was methylated the chromosome was able to be successfully transplanted into a wild type species of M. capricolum .
However , if the DNA was not first methylated the transplant experiments were not successful .
To prove that the restriction enzymes in the M. capricolum cell were responsible for the destruction of the transplanted genome the team removed the restriction enzyme genes from the M. capricolum genome .
When genome transplantations were performed using the restriction enzyme minus recipient cells , all the genome transplantations worked regardless of if the DNA was methylated or not .
“ The ability to modify bacterial genomes in yeast is an important advance that extends yeast genetic tools to bacteria .
If this is extendable to other bacteria we believe that these methods may be used in general laboratory practice to modify organisms , ” said Sanjay Vashee , Ph.D. , JCVI researcher and corresponding author on the paper .
The team now has a complete cycle of cloning a bacterial genome in yeast , modifying the bacterial genome as though it were a yeast chromosome and transplanting the genome back into a recipient bacterial cell to create a new bacterial strain .
These new methods and knowledge should allow the team to now transplant and boot up the synthetic bacterial genome successfully .
The research published August 21 by JCVI researchers was funded by the company Synthetic Genomics Inc. , a company co-founded by Drs. Smith and Venter .

S.A.W. - Viper carries a giant belt fed machine gun and has the distinction amongst Cobra troops as the soldier with the most Joe kills ever ( four ) , after executing the captive Doc , Thunder , Crankcase and Heavy Metal .
It should be noted that S.A.W. - Viper , despite being armed with a weapon that can fire 1,000 rounds per minute , somehow only managed to kill four people before he was overpowered ( presumably he asked those four if they would please stand very close together before he opened fire ) .
Most Telling Quote from File Card :
" You wo n't even know I 've shot at you until you hear the sonic boom from the bullet whipping past your ear ! "
Yep .
You wo n't know he 's shooting at you until he fucking misses .

Pathetic Weapon of Choice :
S.A.W. - Viper 's weapon makes sense in his role as the Cobra 's heavy machine gunner , and it carries some cool modifications like " cryogenic cooling , " a sound suppressor and a flash inhibitor .
This would allow him to pick off a flea at 800 yards with one shot , if it were n't for the fact that S.A.W. - Viper could n't hit a battleship with an elementary school .
Basically he has a light machine gun that stealthily misses every one of its targets .
Crowning Moment ( of Ignominy ) :
After killing the four Joes , S.A.W. - Viper was on the verge of capture when he convinced Duke that he could n't be arrested because he was " out of their jurisdiction . "
Somehow this ruse worked ( evidently Duke 's brain has a " cryogenic cooling " modification ) and S.A.W. - Viper returned to a warm reception at Cobra - occupied Benzheen .

What are you looking at right now ?
The Joes ' Ninja Force quite literally crashed the party to avenge their fallen comrades , critically injuring S.A.W. - Viper which led to his eventual rebirth as the cyborg , Overkill .
Shortly thereafter , Overkill was shot in the face alongside Cesspool ( see Cesspool , above ) by Tomax during a prison break .
At least he got to have a party first .

Death panels ???
Swiftboating as a way of political life
The risk factor I paid less attention to was the steady wearing down of resistance to the habit of lying .
In retrospect , the Swiftboating of John Kerry can be seen as a sort of trial run , whether that was the intention or not .
The immediate objective was strategic : to neutralize any potential advantage that a war hero might have in a national election against a draft doger - turned - deserter .
I wonder whether even Karl Rove imagined that you could befuddle the public to the extent of blackening the reputation of the war hero in the eyes of the people to whom that credential should have mattered most .
If you 're a political strategist , or at any rate a poliical strategist of a certain sort ( Karl Rove , for example ) , you notice things like that , and you surely begin to wonder just how far you could push it .
Here we are in 2009 , and we still do n't know the answer to that .
We still have n't found the limit .
The process whereby a provision to make end - of - life counseling available to people who might otherwise never give any serious thought to preparing for the one stark reality we all face is twisted into " death panels " that decide who will live and who will die truly boggles my mind , which is highly boggle - resistant .
( The fact that in the American health care system so beloved by people like Sen .
Max Baucus , we have insurance - company bureaucrats making such decisions every day , and not just with regard to the elderly , really ought to be mentioned but is n't strictly speaking relevant to our discussion of political . )
What 's intriguing is that the right to lie applies only to the Right .
Remember when Bill Clinton got caught lying about the blowjobs he got from Monica Lewinsky ?
For months we had to listen to those sanctimonious GOP hypocrites on the House Judiciary Committee whine , " But he l - i - e - d . "
( They went into kind of chant mode for " lied , " so that the word was stretched out to about 10 seconds . )
That was all they needed to justify the president 's impeachment -- and , they hoped , his conviction .
Now every Republican lies every time he / she opens his / her mouth , and there is never any price to pay .
They 're heroes !
Meanwhile your average " Christian values " conservative seems to be engaged in sexual escapades i doubt our Bill would have dared dream of .
Lying to them for their own damned good ?
Obviously it 's important here to tell the right kind of lies , and to tell them in the right kind of way .
So what are " the right kind of lies " ?
They 're the lies that many people not only do n't mind but prefer to the truth , indeed may even insist on .
That 's right , brothers and sisters , the American people stand by their God - given right to be lied to !
Someimes these are lies that make them feel good , but more often they 're lies that make people feel bad , but bad in a special kind of way .
People like to be outraged , especially if they get to play the victim of malevolent forces whose villainy relieves them of responsibility for all that sucks in their lives .
Back in the good old days , when " Tiny George " Bush and " Big Dick " Cheney were doing their best to scare the bejezus out of their fellow Americans , those fellow Americans gobbled up every lie they were fed , and the more it made their juices flow , the more alive they felt .
God , that War on Terror was great !
We did n't actually know who we were fighting , or how we were fighting them , but we spent money on it like it was going out of style , and nobody we knew was getting hurt , and it just felt great to be afraid -- it gave us a reason to live !
By gosh , it was more exhilarating than this week 's episode of Dancing With Big Brother .
And best of all , it was all the libruls ' fault , and the towelheads ' , and the homos ' -- let 's vote them all off of the island .
In a sane society , the first time somebody mentioned the nonexistent " death panels , " the response of any normal person with an undamaged brain would have been , " Huh ?
That really does n't sound likely . "
But the Right has worked hard for decades now to minimize the presence in the population of undamaged brains , and so the utterly insane response was , " The libruls wanna kill Gramma ! "
In reality , I suspect there are few families that do n't have at least one story of a relative or friend who went through the agony -- for all concerned -- of a grueling final leg of life 's journey made worse by failure to anticipate its grim realities .
I can thank my mother , now enduring a lengthy version of that final leg , for having the foresight to make her wishes known clearly in a living will :
She wanted no extraordinary measures taken .
She made this clear in conversation as well as the living will , and while I would never decline any medical procedure that offered her some genuine hope , I know -- and all the health care professionals involved in her treatment know -- that that 's all she wants .
Lacking a shred of human decency
Counseling of this sort is precisely what that obscure provision buried in the health leigslative drafts seeks to make sure is available to everyone .
You would think , who could possibly object ?

Unfortunately , in our present political situation we have an entire political movement -- not at this point a large movement , but one that by virtue of its very shrunken state has nothing to lose -- dedicated to telling Americans lies they will like , and pressuring its band of ( almost literally ) confederates to keep the faith .
Was there a sorrier spectacle than Georgia Sen.
Johnny Isakson , caught by the archdemon of the Shithead Right , President Obama , as having sponsored legislation to do just this , having to back off the only evidence I 've encountered that he actually has a shred of decency ?
I do n't know how a creature like Sarah Palin is able to look in the mirror without feeling an urge to blow her diseased brain out .
Even she is n't stupid enough not to know she 's lying her putrid guts out .
But she is part of a political movement that thrives on , almost exists only for , boiling hatred , and I guess she figures somebody 's gotta keep that blood boiling .
The people demand their lies .
The final crushing irony is how much of this is done in the name of Jesus .
Jesus , of course , would forgive them all , because that 's what he did .
But I 've got to think that even Jesus would have a moment there when he felt despair at the evil being wrought in his name .
Hmm , I 've been going on awhile now ( I do get worked up , as you may have noticed ) , and still have n't gotten to the specific lies that set this particular round of philosophizing in motion .
In our 6 pm PT post I promise to try to shut up so you can hear some answers to some of the health care lies .
#
Okay , I admit it .
Even I was taken aback by the scale of the lying the opponents of health care reform , or the warriors of the I Hate Obama movement generally , have engaged in .
In retrospect , though , I should n't have been surprised .
After all , I 'm the one who spent the entire presidential campaign jumping up and down screaming , " But every word out of the Republicans ' mouths is a lie !
" I even articulated on several occasions the worry that all those lies being dumped into the innocent minds of impressionable Americans could n't be good for the future health of the republic .
What I had in mind , though , was mostly the increase in the quantity of sludge lodging in those minds , which seemed inevitable given the breathtaking amount of what was being heaved out .
Say only a certain percentage of it stuck , you 've still got that much more gunk mucking up people 's brains , and in my darker moments I wondered whether we were n't being naive about just how high that certain " sticking " percentage might be .
How many Americans still believe that Saddam Hussein was behind 9/11 , or that there were links between Saddam and Al Qaeda ?

VANCOUVER - British Columbia 's minister of state for intergovernmental affairs wants to keep the border with Washington State " thin , " especially during the 2010 Winter Olympics .
" I 'm hoping that maybe there is some way that people with Olympic tickets can be pre-cleared somehow , so that they can get through quickly , " rookie Liberal MLA Naomi Yamamoto said Monday in Blaine , Wash .
Yamamoto , however , said she did not plan to discuss the idea with U.S. Department of Homeland Security Sec. Janet Napolitano .
Yamamoto joined Napolitano and Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire Monday for a tour of the Customs and Border Protection Olympic Coordination Centre at Bellingham International Airport and the Peace Arch crossing construction site .
A 2007 DHS report to Congress forecast U.S. - bound border traffic at Games - time would be 25 per cent more than in summer .
Congressman Rick Larsen said CBP is committed to opening 10 customs booths to traffic during the Games at Peace Arch , despite the ongoing construction .
" We feel pretty confident , " Larsen said .
The Olympic Coordination Centre is a communications and planning facility for 40 military , police and emergency agencies .
Vancouver 's World Police and Fire Games will serve as a dress rehearsal for the Olympics .
" We plan for the worst , we hope for the best , " Napolitano said .
" I 'm looking forward to a great and successful Games . "
Napolitano would not comment about the U.S. military presence in B.C. during the Olympics .

Kidnap victim key worker , suspect 's clients say JAYCEE LEE DUGARD CASE
( FILES ) :
This undated file photo obtained August 27 , 2009 from the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) shows Jaycee Lee Dugard , who had been missing since she was kidnapped 18 years ago at age 11 , and who walked into a California police station in good health and identified herself , police said August 27 , 2009 .
Jaycee Lee Dugard , now 29 , came into the Concord , California , police station on August 26 , 2009 and said she was the missing girl , police officials said .
" We are ninety - nine percent sure that it is her , based on conversations the mother had with the daughter this morning , " Lieutenant Les Lovell of the El Dorado County Sheriff 's office said .
He said a man and a woman had been arrested with the help of the FBI and taken into custody by the Concord Police Department , but would not identify them .

Jaycee Lee Dugard was not only a kidnapped captive of Phillip Craig Garrido , living for 18 years in his backyard in unincorporated Antioch , but also the creative force behind his specialty printing business , according to the firm 's customers .
They knew the 29 - year - old Dugard as " Allissa " and believed Garrido when he said she was his grown daughter .
Mostly , they knew her as the courteous , professional young woman who , in telephone calls and e-mails , helped them order business cards , flyers and posters .
" He told us up front he works with his daughter .
He said Allissa did all of the graphic design and he did all of the printing , " said J.P. Miller , who hired Garrido this month to advertise his Orinda - based company , A&J Hauling .
Miller said the woman never gave any indication that she had been snatched from a South Lake Tahoe street at age 11 and forced to bear two children with Garrido , as police say .
If Miller sent her a suggestion over e-mail , he said , " she 'd fire it right back to me with the changes . "
The interaction that Miller and others had with Dugard , while limited , sheds light on the living arrangement in a squalid compound on Walnut Avenue , where police say the kidnap victim resided with Garrido and their daughters , ages 11 and 15 , along with Garrido 's wife and elderly mother .
Dugard apparently developed emotional ties with her attacker , Dugard 's stepfather , Carl Probyn , said in a telephone interview Sunday .
Experts say Dugard probably suffered from Stockholm syndrome , a condition in which captives become sympathetic to their captors .
' Like a little family '
" We had Jaycee for 11 years , and they had her for 18 .
After that long , you bond , " Probyn said from New York , where he was doing a series of TV appearances .
" That 's probably what kept her alive - the fact that they all bonded .
It was almost like a little family . "
Probyn said Dugard is with her children , her mother , her sister and her aunt at an undisclosed location , where they are receiving help from counselors .
Probyn said he was told by Dugard 's mother that his stepdaughter looks similar to how she looked at age 11 , that she is an excellent mother , and that she and her daughters face a difficult adjustment .
" They 've never been to school , never been to a doctor , never been to a dentist , " Probyn said .
" They 're just hugging and holding each other .
This will take months , if not years . "
Meanwhile , in unincorporated Antioch , three police agencies continued searching Garrido 's property Sunday , in an effort to determine if he might be linked to any unsolved homicides in eastern Contra Costa County .
Police said some of the victims ' bodies had been found near Garrido 's printing clients .
The search included dogs trained to find dead bodies and extended onto a neighboring property where , according to police , Garrido lived in a shed for a time .
The adjacent home was vacant for a period in 2006 , police said .
Garrido , 58 , and his wife , Nancy Garrido , pleaded not guilty Friday in El Dorado County to a total of 29 charges of rape and kidnapping .
They were arrested Wednesday when Dugard told a state parole officer that she had been kidnapped 18 years ago .
The officer was interviewing the family after being told that Phillip Garrido , a registered sex offender , had behaved strangely with his two young daughters on a visit to UC Berkeley .
Photos shot in yard
Also Sunday , dozens of photographs of Garrido 's backyard compound appeared in British newspapers , two days after a freelance photographer from Hollywood shot them when he sneaked over a fence .
The pictures show tarps and large tents , under a thicket of tree branches , outfitted with beds and dressers , toys and knickknacks , and an odd collection of books - some about crime and many about cats .
A " Welcome " sign hangs from one tree .
The photographer , Nick Stern , told The Chronicle that he obtained the photos " through unconventional means " but said they were important journalistically .
Contra Costa County Sheriff 's Office spokesman Jimmy Lee said the photos were unfortunate but that there were no plans to prosecute Stern .
Ben Daughdrill of Oakley , who used to run the hauling business now owned by J.P. Miller , was another customer of Garrido's who had dealings with " Allissa , " speaking with her and even seeing her at Garrido 's house .
He , too , said she gave no indication she was a kidnap victim .
" She was very professional , very polite , just like any other secretary or anyone you 'd meet at a place of business , " said Daughdrill , 37 .
" If I was requesting something , he 'd say he'd have his daughter send it over .
He 'd say , ' I 'll get Allissa right on that . ' "
The growing national debt is concerning and a little difficult to understand .
So we created infographics to help explain how and why America owes so much money .
The United States is in some hot water financially .
This graphic is a comprehensive look at exactly the kind of mess we 're in .
National Debt Numbers More Than a Little Scary
Running a superpower costs a lot of money ; just ask America .
The United States is currently in debt — we all know that .
Many of us know that the national debt stood at a rather frightening $ 7.5 trillion at the end of the 2009 fiscal year .
Many U.S. residents even identify the size of the national debt as one of their top worries .
But it ’s not easy getting a handle on what $ 7.5 trillion really means .
It ’s also difficult to understand just how fast the country ’s debt can grow .
Fortunately , there are some ways to put the U.S. debt picture into better perspective .
For instance , the amount of money the United States spent on World War II , the Vietnam War , the Marshall Plan and the Korean War do n’t even come close to matching the size of the United States ’ national debt .
In fact , you ’d have to add the amount of money the country spent on the New Deal , NASA ’s entire historical budget , the Louisiana Purchase , Panama Canal , first Gulf War and Hoover Dam to get close .
And even then you ’d be a few billion dollars short .
The cost of all the wars and projects mentioned above ?
$ 6.9 trillion .
That , of course , is less than the national debt of $ 7.5 trillion .
Here ’s another , even more sobering way , to look at it :
If you were born on the same day that Jesus was born , you ’d have to lose a million dollars every day , a full 365 days a year , and it still would take you until October of 2737 to lose just $ 1 trillion .
What ’s scary , of course , is that the United States has managed to lose $ 1 trillion an amazing seven - and - a - half times .
And the country was n’t born until many , many years after Jesus ’ birth .
Stabilizing the national debt is no easy task , either .
The U.S. government would have to take some significant steps to do this .
For instance , the government would need to boost taxes or cut spending by 5 percent of the country ’s Gross Domestic Product every year to keep the national debt at $ 7.5 trillion .
Yes , that ’s to keep it there , not to reduce it in any way .
The country , in other words , would have to spend $ 10 billion less every year to keep the national debt where it is today .
That $ 10 billion figure is nearly equal to the country ’s entire military budget or the combination of both Medicare and Medicaid .
It ’s also equal to the country ’s entire Social Security budget .
These are sobering numbers , but there is some good news !
First , the country has worked its way out of worse debt situations in the past .
Secondly , the U.S. economy has grown faster than the national debt .
So there is hope that the country , if our politicians work together and stop bickering , can get its national debt under control .
National Debt vs GDP
The amount of debt of each of the worlds ' countries is mapped out here as a percentage of the total Gross Domestic Product that each country produces .
For those personal budgeters out there , think of it as how much you owe versus how much you 're making – on a macro scale

National Debt Projected at $ 19 Trillion for 2015
Welcome to the Weekly Credit Loan Report .
We ’ll have a new infographic with accompanying blog post for you every week , detailing changes in the stock market and up - to - date info on national and consumer finances .
The national annual percentage rate on credit cards remained steady last week at 14.96 % .
Americans currently save about 5 % of their earned income , and they ’ve been able to pay off household debt in amounts that have created an 8.6 % rate of decline in total debt since 2008 .
In comparison , the United States accrues an extra $ 4 billion in debt every single day – $ 2.63 million per minute .
This explains the current level of total national debt , at $ 14.8 trillion and growing .
At this pace , the country will be in an additional $ 4.2 trillion of debt , totaling $ 19 trillion by the year 2015 .
How did we get so far in the hole ?
The 111th Congress increased our national debt by more than the 1st through 100th Congresses all together , sinking the most money by far into Health & Human Services ( $ 850 billion ) and the Department of Defense ( $ 720 billion ) in 2010 .
While less than one - quarter of Americans feel they ’d need at least $ 1 million to retire securely , nearly a third say they ’d want between $ 100,000 and $ 500,000 .
If they had $ 1 million , what would they do with it ?
The most popular answers are investment and savings ( 31 % ) , giving to family ( 17 % ) and spending ( 14 % ) .
Stocks favored technology giant Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) , which grew to reach share prices of 404.36 last week .
Coming in at # 2 for growth was Barrick Gold Corp. ( ABX ) at nearly 1/10th of the price — 46.98 .
At barely more than half of Barrick in the # 3 spot was Adobe Systems Inc. ( ADBE ) at 24.81 .
Associated Estates Realty Corp. ( AEC ) had a price of 15.64 , and Alliance Holdings Group LP ( AHGP ) grew to 43.78 per share .
Australian Federal police have been humbled after boasting of taking over an underground cybercrime forum - only for hackers to break into a federal police computer system , the Sydney Morning Herald reports .
Police computer security experts claimed responsibility for taking over the r00t - you.org cybercrime forum as part of a sting operation on ABC's Four Corners TV programme on Monday night entitled Fear in the Fast Lane .
The Feds had reportedly configured their own systems as a honeypot designed to track and trace denizens logging into the forum .
Police gained access to the forum not through infiltration but after raiding the Melbourne home of the forum 's alleged administrator last Wednesday .
r00t - y0u.org numbers an estimated 5,000 members , a fair percentage of which were reckoned to have been involved in cybercrimes of one sort or another , so the honeypot plan promised rich pickings .
Unfortunately the wheels fell off the scheme , because the officers involved failed to set a password on the database behind the honeypot site , allowing hackers to seize control with the minimum of effort .
The scheme was further undermined by the fact some of the denizens on the forum were aware of the raid , and therefore suspicious when police logged into the site using the administrator 's login credentials .
Hackers who broke into the system reportedly got their hands on police evidence , or at least federal police servers .
Screenshots purportedly taken from these systems was posted on anonymous document - sharing site pastebin.com .
These shots contained what was said to be fake IDs and stolen credit card numbers , as well as information on the federal police 's server .
The hacker then defaced the r00t - y0u.org website with a message claiming that police had only succeeded in busting a couple of novice hackers ( script kiddies ) in the first place .
Chris Boyd ( aka Paperghost ) , a security researcher at IM security firm Facetime who has taken part in many forum takedowns , describes the Australian police handling of the takedown of r00t - y0u.org as cack - handed .
He 's particularly critical of a decision by police to post messages on the forum in the immediate aftermath of the raid and , still worse , to film these messages getting posted for national TV .
A federal police spokeswoman confirmed the hack but denied suggestions that any evidence might have been compromised , adding that the hacked system was not connected to the wider police network .
She went on to claim that Federal police were hot on the trail of the ne'er - do - wells involved .
" The AFP [ Australian Federal Police ] has identified a person who has attempted to access the stand - alone computer system and we are currently working with our law enforcement partners regarding this matter , " the spokeswoman said .
Australian federal police are yet to charge anyone over the r00t - y0u.org forum bust . ®
So where 's your birth certificate , congressman ?
From POLITICO 's Kathryn McGarr :
Last week , POLITICO asked the 11 House Republicans co-sponsoring the so - called birther bill — requiring presidential candidates to prove they were born in the U.S. — for copies of their own birth certificates .
It is not , of course , a requirement for members of Congress to either produce a birth certificate or be natural - born citizens of the United States .
But we decided to ask anyway :
The bill ’s original sponsor , Rep. Bill Posey of Florida , is out of the country but sent this e-mail : “ I do not have a copy of my certificate handy , because there is no constitutional requirement for it . ”
He says he 'd authorize us to get it from the Bureau of Vital Statistics , though , and will present a certified copy if he ever runs for president .
Some of the six Texans co-sponsoring the bill had an easier time of it , since the Houston Chronicle had already asked for their birth certificates .
But Texas Rep. Randy Neugebauer declined the chance to show his proof of birth .
His staff sent a one - line e-mail response : “ Congressman Neugebauer will not be submitting a copy of his birth certificate . "
Reps .
John Culberson of Texas and Bob Goodlatte of Virginia win the prize , for e-mailing digital versions of their certificates .
Here 's Goodlatte's , with an address redacted by us .
Reps . Kenny Marchant of Texas , Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Dan Burton of Indiana faxed over copies .
Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert was in the Middle East , but his spokesperson said he’d be glad to provide it when he returns .
Gohmert was “ surprised ” by the request , since there is no requirement for a member of Congress to have been born in the United States .
Rep . John Carter of Texas says he 'll provide a letter of authorization for us to look at his original birth certificate in Austin , and the staff of John Campbell of California says they ’re working on our request .
Texas Rep. Ted Poe 's office has n’t responded to the request .

So you ’re worried about plastic decomposing under heat and leaching strange chemicals into your food ?
All I can say is : that ’s perfectly reasonable .
No sane “ science ” will tell us yea or nay on this one for another fifty years , or indeed ever , since we cannot mathematically isolate this factor , unless we find someone who literally has eaten all food out of tupperware and had no other environmental influences .
So in the meantime , we ’re left with instinct and mine is : stick to what has been in use the longest if you want to minimize environmental toxicity .
Amazon , $ 20.99
Here ’s the first part of your solution : pyrex bowls .
You can find them at Bed , Bath and Beyond , which although all your hip friends tell you it ’s a giant tower of corporate and possibly ( gasp ) Republican doom , is the best place to buy these things .
The three bowls are reasonably sized : the hugest is a 4 quart bowl that ’s about the size of a salad bowl you ’d use to serve a party of eight , the middle is a 2.5 quart bowl that is about the size you ’d use to marinate a couple steaks for barbecue , and the “ smallest ” is a 1.5 quart bowl that will fit comfortably a meal for four people that got cooked and then not eaten because pizza arrived that your teenage daughter ordered .
True , the lids are plastic ; however , nothing seals better than a flexible substance , so plastic is your option if you want a tight seal .
Try not to pack them to the rim , and it wo n’t touch your food .
Seems a reasonable compromise to me .
Amazon , $ 14.99
Here ’s another , this time from what all your urban friends will agree is the world epicenter of Satanic industrial might , Wal - Mart .
Although they ’re showing the set and do n’t list it , you can get the 1 quart flat - bottomed piece for $ 6 , which is a good deal .
Flat - bottomed is important : if you have leftovers which need to sit flat , like lasagna or enchiladas , this ’ll do it .
Next time someone tells you about how plastics are killing us all , remember a balance between idealism and reality : buy sterile , non-leachy pyrex for your containers , and let the lids be plastic .
This is a realistic response and one more thing you can cross off your list of modern terrors .

Turkey will be a major player in the Nabucco project
European governments are due to sign an agreement on the Nabucco gas pipeline on 13 July , the European Commission has announced .
The Nabucco pipeline will bring Central Asian gas to western Europe via Turkey and the Balkans , bypassing Russia .
Turkey , Bulgaria , Romania , Hungary and Austria - the pipeline 's five transit countries - will sign the accord .
The pipeline - which will compete with new rival Russian pipelines - should be operational by 2014 .
Germany is also a member of the consortium , but the pipeline will not cross Germany .
" I can confirm that the Commission has received an invitation to the signing ceremony of the intergovernmental agreement on the Nabucco pipeline on July 13 in Ankara , " a European Commission spokesman told a news briefing .
Russian concerns
Plans for the Nabucco pipeline come as European Union states are keen to reduce their reliance upon Russian gas because of Russia 's numerous price disputes in recent years with Ukraine .
These rows have seen Gazprom temporarily cut supplies to Ukraine , which in turn has reduced Russian gas deliveries to western Europe that are piped through Russia 's neighbour .
Work is under way on Russian pipelines which will bypass Ukraine .
Like Nabucco , the Russian South Stream pipeline will transit the Balkans .
The major sources of gas for Nabucco are expected to be Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan .
Azerbaijan has already promised Gazprom , the Russian state gas company , priority when it comes to buying gas .

I have spent the last 6 years of my free time from my normal job researching the similarities between dreams and psychedelic hallucinations .
Many people from the psychedelic community would disagree , claiming that their experiences are unique .
Not surprisingly , the lucid dreaming community or even normal sleeper may claim either that their dreams are unique or that “ I do n’t do drugs ! ”
This might be true , but the research shows that everyone does psychedelics if they would want to or not .
Our brains produce them endogenously ( naturally ) and our lungs also produce them in even higher amounts .
The Structure of Psychedelic Experience
Humans have long been interested in the alteration of their consciousness .
They have done so through a variety of means , including external chemicals , physical stressors and mental disciplines .
Humans have also taken great care to pay attention to their dreams ’ actions which regularly provides an altered state in which the experience inadvertently interacts with their so - called subconscious .
No matter what path individuals take to reach these altered states , the states themselves bear striking similarities to one another .
By understanding the connections between the disassociation ( change in normal consciousness ) of individuals in both dreams and in the use of drugs , one may be able to understand waking consciousness better as well as conscious altered - type disorders .
Chemically , it ’s a strong possibility that hallucinogens are more like dreaming than dreaming is like hallucinating .
Sleep Modulation and Circadian Rhythms
You may understand the stages , what REM is , and that even we get paralyzed during the REM stage of sleep .
But the real magic of sleep lies within the circadian rhythm and histamines .
The circadian rhythm is a brainstem - controlled mechanism for keeping time , heartbeat , heat control , and many other automatic functions .
The one aspect of circadian rhythm that deals mainly with sleep is the temperature control .
Temperature control during the 24 hours cycle of the circadian rhythm allows our core temperature to change from cold to hot or hot to cold depending on the phase in the 24 hour cycle ( Barrett & McNamara , 2007 ) .
During sleep onset , our circadian rhythm automatically lowers the body ’s core temperature using the body as a radiator .
Melatonin ( the dream mechanism ) helps increase this temperature change , and it also helps to produce drowsiness .
The key point here is that though melatonin may help induce change in temperature , it also has another function while we are asleep .
In short , melatonin may be the raw material to our private psychedelic experience .
Dream Transitions in the Pineal Gland
Our brain is like an on off switch .
When we are awake our brain is perceived as on , or specific chemical process are taking place in specific areas of our brain that run off of neurotransmitters , specifically serotonin .
When we are sleep our brain is considered off , or once again specific chemical process are taking place with different areas of our brains activated again using neurotransmitters , specifically acetylcholine and histamines which continue to push our brains toward the REM phase of sleep until its ready to wake up .
During this night time process , our brains also use the hormone melatonin in producing compounds into serotonin which is further processed into tryptamine and pinoline ( a known MAOI ) .
When combining these nightly produced compounds , which is produced in the largest quantities during REM sleep , you have the possibility of creating one of the most potent psychedelics available in the world today , DMT .
In layman ’s terms , dreaming may naturally release the most powerful hallucinogen known to humankind .
Here is a quote from Callaway ( 1988 ) who explains the process in more technical terms :
The pineal gland is a chemical production factory , either producing melatonin or serotonin depending on the presence of absence of light .
In this process , light source information is relayed from the eyes via the optic nerves and results in the activation of synthesizers that either produces melatonin in the absence of light or serotonin in the presence of light , becoming the brains largest producer of serotonin .
Also in the absence of light , other process are continued as melatonin is then processed into tryptamine and pinoline .
Pinoline is a beta - carbolin called 6 - Methoxytetrahydro - beta - carboline and acts as a monoamine oxidase - A inhibitor ( MAOI ) which in turn allows for the increases concentrations of serotonin ( Callaway , 1988 ) .
In other words , the buildup of these two known types of hallucinogens in the form of pinoline and tryptamines could easily explain the visual mentations experienced during specific pineal gland stimulation .
Callaway also thinks this could explain schizophrenia .
The Link with DMT , LSD - 25 , and Other Psychedelics
With the abundance of serotonin , the methyltransferases which covert serotonin into psychedelics , and the amplification ability of beta - carbolines , the pineal gland is one of the most logical places for indigenous DMT synthesis ( Strassman , 2001 ) .
Also chemically similar to melatonin is LSD - 25 , which relates specifically to the activity on the raphe nucleus ( a control center for serotonin release ) ( Hobson , 2002 ) .
Few studies into the relationship of the formation of DMT or LSD - 25 in the pineal gland have been conducted ; however , indigenous DMT has been found in the lungs and brain of humans .
Though DMT , LSD - 25 , and other psychedelic drugs are similar in structure , the effects of these drugs are sometimes dramatically different .
These differences are based on the individual as well as the environment of the individual taking the drug .
A few instances have occurred where the same psychedelic trip has been described by different people taking the same drug .
The amount of drug administered is also another key factor in how the effects of the drugs will be experienced .
So are We Hallucinating our Dreams ?
Or are we dreaming our hallucinations ?
With the great possibilities that one of the most potent psychedelic compounds known to man is formed in the pineal gland that is most active at night , we can see why it ’s so common that individuals dream of radical unexplainable experiences and places .
It is all so possible that the secretion of this chemical compound into our brain could induce a lengthy “ trip ” or what we call dream .
The length of the dream would vary ( and does ) based on the amount of sleep a person obtained allowing for the formulation of this psychedelic compound and allow for a longer psychedelic experience .
Someone might say , “ Well , why do psychedelic hallucinations seem to vary from dreams ? ”
As described before , set and setting has a lot to do with the type of experience a person has while on a psychedelic .
The setting of most psychedelic trips is during the day time , with friends , while awake and aware .
The settings of most dreams are while at night , with another partner if anyone , and unaware or asleep .
The amount of the drug would also very as during a self induced external psychedelic experience someone may take a large quantity of the drug , whereas at night while the brain is super sensitive to internal stimuli , the brain could excrete a small amount of the same drug and produce a powerful alteration .
Over all , I think that this field of study is an important aspect in understanding why we sleep and most importantly why we dream .
There is still a lot of research to be conducted on this topic , but over the last few years it has grown in popularity and has been provided some scientific credibility that is well deserved .

Naked Lunch at 50 :
An Interview with William S. Burroughs ( excerpt ) :
An online exclusive
An online exclusive
In honor of the 50th anniversary of the publication of The Naked Lunch , we present this 1966 interview with William S. Burroughs , which originally appeared in Jaguar Magazine .
It was excerpted here from Burroughs Live : The Collected Interviews of William S. Burroughs ( Semiotext ( e ) , 2001 ) .
PROPHET OR PORNOGRAPHER
New York , 1966
Jaguar Magazine :
You have been accused of being generally against the establishment , and many of your critics read “ messages ” into much of what the average reader may think of as simply extremely sexy .
I refer specifically to the fairly violent scene which might easily be re-read as a kind of social protest — perhaps against capital punishment .
William Burroughs :
It ’s a tract against capital punishment in the genre of Swift ’s Modest Proposal .
I was simply following a formula to its logical conclusion .
Some people appear to have understood it .
The publication of Naked Lunch in England practically coincided with their abolition of capital punishment .
The book obviously had a certain effect .
JM : Stanley Edgar Hyman wrote an attack on Naked Lunch treating that section as straight hardcore pornography .
How do you explain such a distinguished literary critic reading that passage as pornography ?
WB : I am not familiar with Mr. — what ’s his name ?
JM : Stanley Edgar Hyman .
WB : [ Chuckling ] Hyman .
I am not familiar with Mr. Hyman , so I really do n’t know what his emotions were .
So many people in the Western World are just automatically made ill by any sort of frank writing about sexual matters .
JM : Do you advocate , as part of personality development , that people use drugs and experiment with various sexual experiences , many of which would be illegal in America ?
WB : I feel that opiates — I include opium and all its derivatives , such as morphine , heroin , pantopon , etc. — are quite useless for any sort of creative work , useful though they may be for routine work .
Much of the hard physical work in the Far East is done by opium addicts .
On the other hand , the consciousness - expanding drugs — the hallucinogens , such as cannabis , mescaline , LSD , Psylocybin — I think are useful to a writer up to a certain point .
That is , they open psychic areas that would not otherwise be available to the writer .
But I feel that once these areas have been opened and the writer has reached them , he is able to get back there in the future without the drug .
So , I certainly would n’t advocate anyone using them on a regular or habitual basis .
JM : In the Introduction , you say that Naked Lunch deals with the “ algebra of need ” and that junk is “ the mold of monopoly and possession , ” by which you seem to imply that the junkie is representative of everybody else in an economy where power is centralized and monopolized .
Is that correct ?
WB : Well , by the “ algebra of need ” I simply meant that , given certain known factors in an equation and the equation comprising a situation of absolute need — any form of need — you can predict the results .
Leave a sick junkie in the back room of a drugstore and only one result is possible .
The same is true of anyone in a state of absolute hunger , absolute fear , etc .
The more absolute the need , the more predictable the behavior becomes until it is mathematically certain .
JM : In Naked Lunch , by combining autobiography with satire and fantasy , you confused some readers who could n’t decide what was real and what was n’t .
Now , in your latest writings , instead of going back to something more normal , you ’re going on into techniques even more radical , such as the cut - up method , in which you cut the pages into pieces and rearrange them and create what looks like chaos at first glance .
Readers say that it is unintelligible and they simply cannot read it .
WB : I think if a writer is not endeavoring to expand and alter consciousness in himself and in his readers , he is not doing much of anything .
It is precisely words , word lines , lines of words and images , and associations connected with these word and image lines in the brain , that keep you in present time , right where you are sitting now .
JM : The places that your characters visit in your books are places that do n’t exist on the planet Earth , places like Interzone , Slotless City , Cut City , the Nova Ovens , Minraud , Upper Babboonsasshole .
I have felt , and many people I have spoken to have a peculiar conviction about them , unlike any other fantasy writing , as if they actually existed .
Have you actually visited these places while using consciousness expanding drugs ?
WB : Yes .
I got a number of them while using yagé , the South American telepathic drug .
Many of the more unpleasant ones I got with N - dimethyltriptamine dim - N. Minraud I got with mescaline .
But all of these places have real origins .
Interzone is very much modeled on Tangier in the old international days : it was an Interzone , it was no country .
The jungle scenes come from my South American explorations .
Upper Babboon ’s asshole is Upper Babanasa actually .
Film - maker Martin Hampton has created a revealing documentary on four people with different degrees of compulsive hoarding , where individuals incessantly collect household objects , even to the point of not being able to throw out rubbish .
Compulsive hoarding is often linked to obsessive - compulsive disorder , where affected people experience intrusive thoughts or urges to complete certain actions ( most commonly ‘ washing ’ or ‘ checking ’ ) even though they know how seriously these intrusions are affecting their lives .
Hampton ’s documentary is a remarkably well made account of people with similar urges , in this case to collect and retain , and just lets the individuals and the images speak for themselves ( it is also freely available online as wide screen HD , so looks wonderful ) .
Apparently the documentary was created as part of a Master ’s course in visual anthropology , a field I ’d not come across before , but which seems to be concerned with documenting the diversity of human experience through film .
Possessed does this admirably and seems to have garnered numerous awards since it ’s release .
UPDATE : Grabbed from the comments .
An update and a request from the director !
I am the director of this film and am now researching the next stage of the project .
I am trying to compile a collection of peoples experiences of OCD and other anxiety based disorders .
I have found from experience that although symptoms might be similar , the actual particularities of the obsessions and compulsions are often very varied .
For example , one might wash ones hands 30 times a day , but have a very unique self discovered reason for doing so .
I would be very grateful to hear of your or any friend / acquaintances experiences / difficulties .
Many thanks and I hope you find the film interesting .

The Fed is Not Your Friend
Mark your calendars … the Fed has promised to stop manipulating the bond market by October .
That ’s the meat of the news from yesterday ’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting .
They will “ gradually slow ” the pace of its official Treasury purchases , but the $ 300 billion program will now run through October instead of ending in September , as the Fed had previously scheduled .
( Of course , as our friend Chuck Butler often points out , that ’s just the official word .
The Fed has other ways to skin this cat .
For example , they ’re rumored to be striking deals with primary dealers for post-auction purchases .
Instead of making official bond purchases at the auction , the Fed will have a primary dealer buy the bonds and then sell them to the Fed … same debt monetization , but without that pesky “ transparency ” and media attention . )
Outside of the Treasury bond announcement , the FOMC statement was about what you ’d expect : Interest rates were left at 0 % and will remain “ exceptionally low ” for an “ extended period . ”
While “ economic activity is leveling out , ” it will “ likely remain weak for some time . ”
And , of course , “ inflation will remain subdued for some time . ”
“ The Fed does n’t exist to help you , ” says our currency man Bill Jenkins .
“ Central banks do not exist for the good of economies .
They do not exist for the good of citizens .
Their sole purpose is to keep the game going , and to profit from it as long as possible .
After that , they clear out , leaving the taxpayers to pay off their debts .
Their protection and enhancement of economies and citizens is just a means to an end .
As long as it helps the profits roll in , helping others is fine .
But in the end , they will foist responsibility to others .
“ For us , we will trade with all this in mind as each bank assesses its role in the global finance arena … knowing that they will begin raising rates as soon as possible , and sometimes even before .
When they do , it will give us huge opportunities to profit .
Rising rates almost always guarantee soaring currencies .
“ Particularly I would look for the U.S. dollar , Europe , Aussie and United Kingdom .
Australia will provide the real runaway as long as China can get some exports up and running .
If this recovery gets some legs ( which is still problematic in my mind ) , they already have the upper hand with an interest rate multiple times higher than the others . ”
Is there an abundance of figs in your backyard ?
Make this Unripe Fig Jam Recipe with some of them before they get ripe .
You will be amazed with the result .
Nothing like you ’ve tasted before .
A great sweet snack or a garnish for your crepes and pancakes .
Love that green color !
Most people think that unripe fruits are worthless .
Wrong for unripe figs !
This jam is unbelievable !
Try it and see it yourself !
What Is Unripe Fig Jam ?
When I saw unripe figs at the open market today , I decided to make this fig jam .
A village woman was selling it .
She told that she picked these unripe figs up from the tree in their village .
She had no scales , just 2 bags of figs in front of her .
She said each bag weighs 1 kilo ( 2,20 pound ) , and her word was enough for me , no need to weigh on a scale .
I bought one of the bags , but I had never made unripe fig jam before although I ate many times .
Luckily enough , that lady gave me the instructions providing that I would come back and tell her the result .
Proud to say that I ’ve succeeded .
A bowl of the jam would be a nice gift for her , right ?
You might find it weird to make jam of unripe figs , but I can tell that you do n’t feel any unripeness when you taste it .
We call it jam , but I think it can also be included in category of desserts as I love to eat it not just at breakfast but also during day with cream , ice cream or plain .
Btw did you know anything about the benefits of unripe fig sap , that sticky white liquid .
It is helpful in the treatment of skin warts .
Just drop it on the wart and see the result .
How To Prepare Unripe Figs
Wash the figs and clean their stems .
We ’ll boil the figs two times changing the water each time to lose its unripeness taste .
Fill a large pot with water and boil the figs for about 10 minutes .
Let it cool .
When it is cool enough to touch , squeeze the figs gently to remove the bad taste .
You can make tiny holes on figs with a needle if you like and then squeeze .
Then fill the pot with water again , boil again and squeeze again .
This squeezing part might take a long time , but if you are passionate enough , you ’ll see it is worth .
Then drain .
Making Unripe Fig Jam
Meanwhile you can start to boil 5 and ½ cup water and sugar together in a different pot .
After it boils , add the squeezed figs in it .
You will see that these figs turn back into their original shape in this boiling sherbet .
Put the cloves with the figs to give this jam an outstanding flavor .
Boil them for about 25 minutes .
Finally , add lemon juice and boil it 5 minutes more .
Let it cool and fill it in jars .
You can keep them at room temperature , at a dry and dark place .
We love it cold , so we keep it in refrigerator .
This makes a wonderful breakfast when paired with a slice of fresh fig nut bread or a great summer dessert when paired with Turkish salep ice cream !

Gluskin- Sheff economist David Rosenberg has some harsh words about the Cash For Clunkers program in his daily letter :
We could n't believe this when we saw this quote from the U.S. Transportation
Secretary ( Ray Lahood ) in yesterday 's NYT ( page B3 ) on the “ Cash for Clunkers ”
program : “ There obviously is a real pent - up demand in America ... people love to
buy cars , and we 've given them the incentive to do that .
I think the last thing that
any politician wants to do is cut off the opportunity for somebody who 's going to be
able to get a rebate from the government to buy a new vehicle . ”
Are you kidding me ?
If there is pent - up demand for autos why do we need a
rebate ?
If there are 20 % more vehicles than there are licensed drivers , why
the need to perpetuate this cycle of overspending ?
Why is it a politician 's job
to create incentives to spend ?
Should n't they be focusing their attention on
health , education , defense , infrastructure , public safety , job skills and
productivity growth ( and perhaps the youth unemployment rate of around
20 % ) ?
We 're not exactly espousing an Ayn Rand libertarian view but at a time
when the deficit is running at 13 % of GDP , at what point is enough ?
These
rebates are not manna from heaven — it ’s a future tax liability to hasten a
decision that the auto buyer would have made in any event .
This is fiscal
policy short - termism at its best ( we say this as we read the article on page B5
of the NYT — $ 2 Billion in Grants to Bolster U.S. Manufacturing of Parts for
Electric Cars ) .
As a sign of how distortions are created when the visible arm of government
intervenes and chooses to subsidize a form of spending , see Clunkers Plan
Deflates Mechanics on page A4 of the WSJ .

Typhoon Morakot has struck China 's south - east coast , destroying hundreds of houses and flooding farmland .
Almost one million people were evacuated ahead of the storm , which crashed ashore in Fujian province with winds of up to 119 km / h ( 74mph ) .
Flights were cancelled and fishing boats recalled to shore .
A small boy died when a building collapsed .
Morakot has already hit Taiwan , killing at least three people and causing some of the worst flooding for 50 years .
In one incident , an entire hotel - empty at the time - was swept away by the waters .
' Treetops visible '
Chinese state media said that the sky turned completely dark in Beibi , Fujian , when Typhoon Morakot made landfall at 1620 local time ( 0820 GMT ) .
Trees were uprooted as high winds and heavy rain lashed the coast .
Some 473,000 residents of Zhejiang province were evacuated before the typhoon struck , as well as 480,000 from Fujian , Xinhua news agency said .
In Zhejiang 's Wenzhou City a four year - old child was killed when a house collapsed .
Dozens of roads were said to be flooded and the city 's airport was closed .
Rescuers used dinghies to reach worst - hit areas ; in one area only the tops of trees were said to be showing above the floodwater .
The storm is expected to move north and weaken , but strong winds are expected to persist for three days , forecasters say .
Taiwan devastation
Morakot dumped 250 cm of rain on Taiwan as it crossed the island on Saturday , washing away bridges and roads .

At least three people were known to have died - a woman whose car went into a ditch and two men who drowned .
Thirty - one others were reported missing , Taiwan 's Disaster Relief Centre said .
Among them were a group reportedly washed away from a make - shift shelter in Kaohsiung in the south .
At least 10,000 people were trapped in three coastal towns , a local official in the southern county of Pingtung said .
In Chihpen , one of Taiwan 's most famous hot spring resorts , a hotel collapsed after flood waters undermined its foundations .
Morakot - which means emerald in Thai - has also contributed to heavy rains in the Philippines .
At least 10 people were killed in flooding and landslides in the north .
Typhoons are frequent in the region between July and September .
As per my last diary , I have been following the Program Trading reports at the NYSE for a bit , and today there was a whopper .
Now , first off , Goldman Sachs went from a near dominate position within the program to not even been registered .
Here is the data from two weeks ago :
http://www.nyse.com/...
As you can see , Goldman Sachs dominates the trading in this program .
This has been the case since SPL was created last October .
I think it has something to do with having the keys to the Treasury and market dominance .
But then something ODD has happened :
http://www.nyse.com/...
Gone , over night .
Someone , either at the NYSE or Goldman Sachs , needs to explain what exactly is going on , because this audit sheet is also in error .
Total for 15 Member Firms : 5,425.7
Total for All Firms Reporting : 4,096.4
Uh , no .
The total for All Firms must be higher than the 15 Member Firms .
This " anomaly " also happens in the All Other Strategies column :
Total for 15 Member Firms : 5,390.7
Total for All Firms Reporting : 4,050.9
To quote the great philosopher of our time , Ralph Wiggum , " That is unpossible . "
Keep this in your pocket , it 's a slip showing a slip :
Someone at the NYSE needs to either " update " this information or explain how the total market is reporting less than a select membership of the market .
This Program Trading Report is one of the few windows into the SLP program , a program used by banks to recover from the " credit " crisis .
All of this does not compute .
On top of all this , the NYSE extended trading last Friday ( for style points , I 'll use Fox Business ) :
NYSE Traders Forced Into Rare Extra Inning
http://www.foxbusiness.com/...
The New York Stock Exchange extended trading by 15 minutes Thursday , in an extraordinary move prompted by what the exchange said were " system irregularities . "
The NYSE had connectivity issues that prevented some orders from being completed at the traditional 4 p.m. Eastern time close .
As a result , traders were allowed to manually execute orders until 4:15 p.m .
Unlike other stock markets , the NYSE still uses specialists , or actual traders who hold mini-auctions that help set the price of a stock .
While electronic trading now makes up the bulk of trading at the Big Board , specialists still handle some of the order flow on the exchange floor .
Trading past the official close is rare , but in October 2008 , amid the heavy volatility brought on by the near - collapse of the U.S. financial system , trading in individual stocks was extended so specialists could fill orders .
Add to this :
Goldman Sachs disappearance from the Program Trading report
A rogue trading stealing their quant platform
Obvious basic math errors in the Program Trading Report
Someone needs to start answering questions .
There is a ghost in the machine .
The results of the government 's stress tests on banks , to be released in a few days , will not mark the beginning of the end of the financial crisis .
If we are to believe the leaks , the results will show that there might be a few problems at some of the regional banks and Citigroup and Bank of America may need some more capital if things get worse .
But the overall message is that the sector is in pretty good shape .
This would be good news if it were credible .
But the International Monetary Fund has just released a study of ...

Lawrence O'Donnell filled in for Chris Matthews on Hardball Wednesday , and somehow managed to avoid savaging clueless town hall protester , Katy Abram .
Abram went on a moronic tirade at Senator Arlen Specter 's town hall meeting on Tuesday , telling him she was afraid that America was turning into Russia and that he had awakened a sleeping giant .
This was n't like shooting fish in a barrel , it was like shooting the broad side of a barn with a bazooka -- at point blank range .
O'Donnell toys with Abram , and you can tell he just wants to cut loose .
Granted , Abram is n't a professional pundit , but when questioned it became clear that she is the poster child for the entire undereducated , under - informed mob that make up the right wing town hall protesters .
When asked about taxes , Katy admits that she has no idea how much money she and her husband make .
When asked about Socialist programs like medicare and social security , she had this to say :
... You know , yeah , I mean , there are programs in place that the founders did not want to have here .
I know there are people out there that can't afford health insurance , that can't afford a lot of different things , and , you know , with the founders , they thought and hoped that the goodness of the people would allow the people to take care of those who are doing without .
And I know that may seem naive in today's , you know , world ...
Okay...umm... so she 's against a public option that would allow the goodness of the people help those who are doing without ?
There are many more displays of stunning ignorance in this segment , feel free to document them in the comments .
The story of Joya is the story of another Afghanistan - the one behind the burka , and behind the propaganda
Enraged by Taliban oppression Malalai Joya became a women ’s rights activist , and after the US - led invasion , took on the new regime as an MP .
But speaking out has come at a cost .
She tells Johann Hari why death threats wo n’t stop her exposing ugly truths about Afghanistan .
I am not sure how many more days I will be alive , " Malalai Joya says quietly .
The warlords who make up the new " democratic " government in Afghanistan have been sending bullets and bombs to kill this tiny 30 - year - old from the refugee camps for years – and they seem to be getting closer with every attempt .
Her enemies call her a " dead woman walking " .
" But I do n't fear death , I fear remaining silent in the face of injustice , " she says plainly .
" I am young and I want to live .
But I say to those who would eliminate my voice : ' I am ready , wherever and whenever you might strike .
You can cut down the flower , but nothing can stop the coming of the spring . ' "
The story of Malalai Joya turns everything we have been told about Afghanistan inside out .
In the official rhetoric , she is what we have been fighting for .
Here is a young Afghan woman who set up a secret underground school for girls under the Taliban and – when they were toppled – cast off the burka , ran for parliament , and took on the religious fundamentalists .
But she says : " Dust has been thrown into the eyes of the world by your governments .
You have not been told the truth .
The situation now is as catastrophic as it was under the Taliban for women .
Your governments have replaced the fundamentalist rule of the Taliban with another fundamentalist regime of warlords .
[ That is ] what your soldiers are dying for . "
Instead of being liberated , she is on the brink of being killed .
The story of Joya is the story of another Afghanistan – the one behind the burka , and behind the propaganda .
I " We are our sisters ' keepers "
I meet Joya in a London apartment where she is staying with a supporter for a week , to talk about her memoir – but even here , her movements have to be kept secret , as she flits from one safe house to another .
I am told not to mention her location to anyone .
She is standing in the corridor , small and slim , with her hair flowing freely , and she greets me with a solid handshake .
But , when our photographer snaps her , she begins to giggle girlishly : the grief etched on to her sallow face melts away , and she laughs in joyous little squeaks .
" I can never get used to this ! " she says .
Then , as I sit her down to talk through her life - story , the pain soaks into her face once more .
Her body tightens into a tense coil , and her fists close .
Joya was four days old when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan .
On that day , her father dropped out of his studies to fight the invading Communist army , and vanished into the mountains .
She says : " Since then , all we have known is war . "
Her earliest memory is of clinging to her mother 's legs while policemen ransacked their house looking for evidence of where her father was hiding .
Her illiterate mother tried to keep her family of 10 children alive as best she could .
When the police became too aggressive , she took her kids to refugee camps across the border in Iran .
In these filthy tent - cities lying on the old Silk Road , Afghans huddled together and were treated as second - class citizens by the Iranian regime .
At night , wild animals could wander into the tents and attack children .
There , word reached the family that Joya 's father had been blown up by a landmine – but he was alive , after losing a leg .
There were no schools in the Iranian camps , and Joya 's mother was determined her daughters would receive the education she never had .
So they fled again , to camps in western Pakistan .
There , Joya began to read – and was transformed .
" Tell me what you read and I shall tell you what you are , " she says .
Starting in her early teens , she inhaled all the literature she could – from Persian poetry to the plays of Bertolt Brecht to the speeches of Martin Luther King .
She began to teach her new - found literacy to the older women in the camps , including her own mother .
She soon discovered that she loved to teach – and , when she turned 16 , a charity called the Organisation for Promoting Afghan Women 's Capabilities ( OPAWC ) made a bold suggestion : go to Afghanistan , and set up a secret school for girls , under the noses of the Taliban tyranny .
So she gathered her few clothes and books and was smuggled across the border – and " the best days of my life " began .
She loathed being forced to wear a burka , being harassed on the streets by the omnipresent " vice and virtue " police , and being under constant threat of being discovered and executed .
But she says it was worth it for the little girls .
" Every time a new girl joined the class , it was a triumph , " she says , beaming .
" There is no better feeling . "
She only just avoided being caught , again and again .
One time she was teaching a class of girls in a family 's basement when the mother of the house yelled down suddenly : " Taliban ! Taliban ! " Joya says : " I told my students to lie down on the floor and stay totally silent .
We heard footsteps above us and waited a long time . "
On many occasions , ordinary men and women – anonymous strangers – helped her out by sending the police charging off in the wrong direction .
She adds : " Every day in Afghanistan , even now , hundreds if not thousands of ordinary women act out these small gestures of solidarity with each other .
We are our sisters ' keepers . "
The charity was so impressed with her they appointed her their director .
Joya decided to set up a clinic for poor women just before the 9/11 attacks .
When the American invasion began , the Taliban fled her province , but the bombs kept falling .
" Many lives were needlessly lost , just like during the September 11 tragedy , " she says .
" The noise was terrifying , and children covered their ears and screamed and cried .
Smoke and dust rose and lingered in the air with every bomb dropped . "
As soon as the Taliban retreated , they were replaced – by the warlords who had ruled Afghanistan immediately before .
Joya says that , at this point , " I realised women 's rights had been sold out completely ...
Most people in the West have been led to believe that the intolerance and brutality towards women in Afghanistan began with the Taliban regime .
But this is a lie .
Many of the worst atrocities were committed by the fundamentalist mujahedin during the civil war between 1992 and 1996 .
They introduced the laws oppressing women followed by the Taliban – and now they were marching back to power , backed by the United States .
They immediately went back to their old habit of using rape to punish their enemies and reward their fighters . "
The warlords " have ruled Afghanistan ever since , " she adds .
While a " showcase parliament has been created for the benefit of the US in Kabul " , the real power " is with these fundamentalists who rule everywhere outside Kabul " .
As an example , she names the former governor of Herat , Ismail Khan .
He set up his own " vice and virtue " squads which terrorised women and smashed up video and music cassettes .
He had his own " private militias , private jails " .
The constitution of Afghanistan is irrelevant in these private fiefdoms .
Joya discovered just what this meant when she started to set up the clinic – and a local warlord announced that it would not be allowed , since she was a woman , and a critic of fundamentalism .
She did it anyway , and decided to fight this fundamentalist by running in the election for the Loya jirga ( " meeting of the elders " ) to draw up the new Afghan constitution .
There was a great swelling of support for this girl who wanted to build a clinic – and she was elected .
" It turned out my mission , " she says , " would be to expose the true nature of the jirga from within . "
II " I would never again be safe "
As she stepped past the world 's television cameras into the Loya jirga , the first thing Joya saw was " a long row with some of the worst abusers of human rights that our country had ever known – warlords and war criminals and fascists " .
She could see the men who invited Osama bin Laden into the country , the men who introduced the misogynist laws later followed by the Taliban , the men who had massacred Afghan civilians .
Some had got there by intimidating the electorate , others by vote - rigging , and yet more were simply appointed by Hamid Karzai , the former oilman installed by the US army to run the country .
She thought of an old Afghan saying : " It 's the same donkey , with a new saddle . "
For a moment , as these old killers started to give long speeches congratulating themselves on the transition to democracy , Joya felt nervous .
But then , she says , " I remembered the oppression we face as women in my country , and my nervousness evaporated , replaced by anger . "
When her turn came , she stood , looked around at the blood - soaked warlords on every side , and began to speak .
" Why are we allowing criminals to be present here ?
They are responsible for our situation now ...
It is they who turned our country into the centre of national and international wars .
They are the most anti-women elements in our society who have brought our country to this state and they intend to do the same again ...
They should instead be prosecuted in the national and international courts . "
These warlords – who brag about being hard men – could not cope with a slender young woman speaking the truth .
They began to shriek and howl , calling her a " prostitute " and " infidel " , and throwing bottles at her .
One man tried to punch her in the face .
Her microphone was cut off and the jirga descended into a riot .
" From that moment on , " Joya says , " I would never again be safe ...
For fundamentalists , a women is half a human , meant only to fulfil a man 's every wish and lust , and to produce children and toil in the home .
They could not believe that a young woman was tearing off their masks in front of the eyes of the Afghan people . "
A fundamentalist mob turned up a few hours later at her accommodation , announcing they had come to rape and lynch her .
She had to be placed under immediate armed guard – but she refused to be protected by American troops , insisting on Afghan officers .
Her speech was broadcast all over the world – and cheered in Afghanistan .
She was flooded with support from the people of her country , delighted that somebody had finally spoken out .
One dirt - poor village pooled its cash to send a delegate hundreds of miles across the country to explain how pleased they were .
An extremely old woman was brought to her in a rickety wheelbarrow , and she explained she had lost two sons – one to the Soviets , one to the fundamentalists .
She told Joya : " I am almost 100 years old , and I am dying .
When I heard about you and what you said , I knew that I had to meet you .
God must protect you , my dear . "
She handed over her gold ring , her only valuable possession , and said : " You must take it !
I have suffered so much in my life , and my last wish is that you accept this gift from me . "
But the US and Nato occupiers instructed Joya that she must show " politeness and respect " for the other delegates .
When Zalmay Khalilzad , the US Ambassador , said this , she replied : " If these criminals raped your mother or your daughter or your grandmother , or killed seven of your sons , let alone destroyed all the moral and material treasure of your country , what words would you use against such criminals that will be inside the framework of politeness and respect ? "
She leans forward and quotes Brecht : " He says , ' He who does not know the truth is only a fool .
He who knows the truth and calls it a lie is a criminal . ' "
The attempts to murder her began then with a sniper – and have not stopped since .
But she says plainly , with her fist clenched : " I wanted the warlords to know I was not afraid of them . "
So she ran for parliament – and won in a landslide .
" I would return again to face those who had ruined my country , " she explains , " and I was determined that I would stand straight and never bow again to their threats . "
III " In every corner is a killer "
Joya looked out across the new Afghan parliament on her first day and thought : " In every corner is a killer , a puppet , a criminal , a drug lord , a fascist .
This is not democracy .
I am one of the very few people here who has been genuinely elected . "
She started her maiden speech by saying : " My condolences to the people of Afghanistan ... "
Before she could continue , the warlords began to shout that they would rape and kill her .
One warlord , Abdul Sayyaf , yelled a threat at her .
Joya looked him straight in the eye and said : " We are not in [ the area he rules by force ] here , so control yourself . "
I ask if she was frightened , and she shakes her head .
" I am never frightened when I tell the truth . "
She is speaking fast now : " I am truly honoured to have been vilified and threatened by the savage men who condemned our country to such misery .
I feel proud that even though I have no private army , no money , and no world powers behind me , these brutal despots are afraid of me and scheme to eliminate me . "
She says there is no difference for ordinary Afghans between the Taliban and the equally fundamentalist warlords .
" Which groups are labelled ' terrorist ' or ' fundamentalist ' depends on how useful they are to the goals of the US , " she says .
" You have two sides who terrorise women , but the anti-American side are ' terrorists ' and the pro-American side are ' heroes ' . "
Karzai rules only with the permission of the warlords .
He is " a shameless puppet " who will win next month 's presidential elections because " he has n't yet stopped working for his masters , the US and the warlords ...
At this point in our history , the only people who get to serve as president are those selected by the US government and the mafia that holds power in our country . "
Whenever she would despair in parliament , she would meet yet more ordinary Afghan women – and get back in the fight .
She tells me about a 16 - year - old constituent of hers , Rahella , who ran away to an orphanage Joya had helped to set up in her constituency .
" Her uncle had decided to marry her off to his son , who was a drug addict .
She was terrified .
So of course we took her in , educated her , helped her . "
One day , her uncle turned up and apologised , saying he had learnt the error of his ways .
He asked if she could come home for a weekend to visit her family .
Joya agreed – and when she got back to her village , Rahella was forced into marriage and spirited away to another part of Afghanistan .
They heard six months later that she had doused herself in petrol and burned herself alive .
There has been an epidemic of self - immolation by women across the " new " Afghanistan in the past five years .
" The hundreds of Afghan women who set themselves ablaze are not only committing suicide to escape their misery , " she says , " they are crying out for justice . "
But she was not allowed to raise these issues in the supposedly democratic parliament .
The fundamentalist warlords who could n't beat Joya at the ballot box or kill her chanced upon a new way to silence her .
The more she spoke , the angrier they got .
She called for secularism in Afghanistan , saying : " Religion is a private issue , unrelated to political issues and the government ...
Real Muslims do not require political leaders to guide them to Islam . "
She condemned the new law that declared an amnesty for all war crimes committed in Afghanistan over the past 30 years , saying " You criminals are simply giving yourselves a get - out - of - jail free card . "
So the MPs simply voted to kick her out of parliament .
It was illegal and undemocratic – but the President , Hamid Karzai , supported the ban .
" Now the warlord criminals are unchallenged in parliament , " she says .
" Is that democracy ? "
We in the West have been fed " a pack of lies " about what Afghanistan looks like today .
" The media are ' free ' only if they do not try to criticise warlords and officials , " she says in her book , Raising My Voice .
As an example , she names a specific warlord : " If you write anything about him , the next day you will be tortured or killed by the Northern Alliance warlords . "
It is " a myth " to say girls can now go to school outside Kabul .
" Only five per cent of girls , according to the UN , can follow their education to the 12th grade . "
And it is " false " to say Afghan culture is inherently misogynistic .
" By the 1950s , there was a growing women 's movement in Afghanistan , demonstrating and fighting for their rights , " she says .
" I have a story here " – she rifles through her notes – " from The New York Times in 1959 .
Here !
The headline is ' Afghanistan 's women lift the veil ' .
We were developing an open culture for women – and then the foreign wars and invasions crushed it all .
If we can regain our independence , we can start this struggle again . "
Many of her friends urge her to leave the country , before one of her wannabe - assassins gets lucky .
But , she says , " I can never leave when all the poor people that I love are living in danger and poverty .
I am not going to search for a better and safer place , and leave them in a burning hell . "
Apologising for her English – which is , in fact , excellent – she quotes Brecht again : " Those who do struggle often fail , but those who do not struggle have already failed . "
Today , she fights for democracy outside parliament .
But , she says , any Afghan democrat today is " trapped between two enemies .
There are the occupation forces from the sky , dropping cluster bombs and depleted uranium , and on the ground there are the fundamentalist warlords and the Taliban , with their own guns . "
She wants to help the swelling movement of ordinary Afghans in between , who are opposed to both .
" With the withdrawal of one enemy , the occupation forces , it [ will be ] easier to fight against these internal fundamentalist enemies . "
If she were president of Afghanistan , she would begin by referring all the country 's war criminals to the International Court of Justice at the Hague .
" Anybody who has murdered my sisters and brothers should be punished , " she says , " from the Taliban , to the warlords , to George W Bush . "
Then she would ask all foreign troops to leave immediately .
She says that it is wrong to say Afghanistan will simply collapse into civil war if that happens .
" What about the civil war now ?
Today , people are being killed – many , many war crimes .
The longer the foreign troops stay in Afghanistan doing what they are doing , the worse the eventual civil war will be for the Afghan people . "
The Afghan public , she adds , are on her side , pointing to a recent opinion poll showing 60 per cent of Afghans want an immediate Nato withdrawal .
Many people in Afghanistan were hopeful , she says , about Barack Obama – " but he is actually intensifying the policy of George Bush ...
I know his election has great symbolic value in terms of the struggle of African - Americans for equal rights , and this struggle is one I admire and respect .
But what is important for the world is not whether the President is black or white , but his actions .
You ca n't eat symbolism . "
US policy is driven by geopolitics , she says , not personalities .
" Afghanistan is in the heart of Asia , so it 's a very important place to have military bases – so they can control trade very easily with other Asian powers such as China , Russia , Iran and so on .
" But it can be changed by Americans , " she adds .
She is passionate now , her voice rising .
" I say to Obama – in my area , 150 people were blown up by US troops in one incident this year .
If your family had been there , would you send even more troops and even more bombs ?
Your government is spending $ 18 m ( £ 11 m ) to make another Guantanamo jail in Bagram .
If your daughter might be detained there , would you be building it ?
I say to Obama – change course , or otherwise tomorrow people will call you another Bush . "
IV " It 's hard to be strong all the time "
" It 's not good to show my enemies any weakness , [ but ] it 's hard to be strong all the time , " Joya says with a sigh , as she runs her hands through her hair .
She has been speaking so insistently – with such preternatural courage– that it 's easy to forget she was just a girl when she was thrust into fighting fundamentalism .
She was never allowed an adolescence .
The fierce concentration on her face melts away , and she looks a little lost .
" Yes , my mother is proud of me , " she says , " but you know how mothers are – they worry .
Whenever I speak to her on the phone , the first sentence and the last sentence are always ' Take care ' . "
Two years ago , she got married in secret .
She can't name her husband publicly , because he would be killed .
Her wedding flowers had to be checked for bombs .
She will only say that they met at a press conference , " and he supports everything I do " .
She has not seen him " for two months " , she says .
" We meet in the safe houses of supporters .
I cannot sleep in the same house two nights running .
It is a different home every evening . "
Where does this courage come from ?
She acts as if the answer is obvious – anyone would do it , she claims .
But they do n't .
Perhaps it comes from her belief that the struggle is long and our individual lives are short , so we can only advance our chosen cause by inches , knowing others will pick up our baton .
" When I die , others will come .
I am sure of that , " she says .
She certainly has a strong sense of belonging to a long history of Afghans who fought for freedom .
" My parents chose my first name after Malalai of Maiwand .
She was a young woman who , in 1880 , went to the front line of the second Anglo - Afghan war to tend the wounded .
When the fighters were close to collapse , she picked up the Afghan flag and led the men into battle herself .
She was struck down – but the British suffered a landmark defeat , and , in the end , they were driven out . "
When she ran for office , she had to choose a surname for herself , to protect her family 's identity .
" I named myself after Sarwar Joya , the Afghan poet and constitutionalist .
He spent 24 years in jails , and was finally killed because he would n't compromise his democratic principles ...
In Afghanistan we have a saying : the truth is like the sun .
When it comes up , nobody can block it out or hide it . "
Malalai Joya knows she could be killed any day now , in our newly liberated Warlord - istan .
She hugs me goodbye and says , " We must keep in touch . "
But I find myself bleakly wondering if we will ever meet again .
Perhaps she senses this , because she suddenly urges me to look again at the last paragraph of her memoir , Raising My Voice .
" It really is how I feel , " she says .
It reads : " If I should die , and you should choose to carry on my work , you are welcome to visit my grave .
Pour some water on it and shout three times .
I want to hear your voice . "
I look up into her face , and she is giving me the bravest smile I have ever seen .
' Raising My Voice ' by Malalai Joya is published by Rider at £ 11.99 .
All profits will go to supporting the cause of women 's rights in Afghanistan .

Why is the NYT ’s crying over a photographer who gets paid millions ?
The lopsided affections of the media .
In the opening lines in this weekend ’s fashion and style section of the NYT ”s , the Times laments ( with no sense of sartorial wit but with vigorous earnestness ) that if Annie ca n’t make it in NY , who then possibly can ?
We read the story with degree of humor and mild intrigue that a woman afforded the wondrous favors of a magazine a/ willing to pay her in the millions and b/ attain fire jets and circus animals if her heart desires it ( viz Vanity Fair and her wondrous corporate clientele that pay through the nose to use Annie ’s genius ) is now possibly going broke .
With defenders ranging from her boss Graydon Carter and editor about town Tina Brown we do have to wonder how someone making so much money ( year after year ) is suppose to affect out piety and sense of wonder when there are people trying to make it on $ 7.50 an hour , a song you wont hear being played on the NYT’s .
Call it misappropriated expenses , the cost of buying multi million dollar town houses and then joining all three of them ( I know you ’re falling down to the ground in pity too ) the Times spends considerable words lamenting the ability of Annie coming up with 24 million dollars by September .
Easy -
Refinance , sell the town houses and raise your fees Annie .
In a society falling apart given the excessive misbehavior of those who hold captain ’s position ’s we are frankly bored and insensitive to your self inflicted wounds .
Okay , fine Ms. Leibovitz we are told also suffers some personal setbacks with the death of her parents and partner Susan Sontag but this is something we all go through .
We know we are n’t suppose to care about those less fortunate than us ( except when it ’s convenient ) but one does wonder at the degree of impropriety of a major newspaper crying over a very well paid person who has managed to screw up , personal setbacks aside .
If on the other hand you go back to the business of inspiring us and provoking us we might just show up to your tea party but in the meantime we say ‘ stop sobbing ’ and next time your lackeys at the Times come calling have the decency to offer ‘ no comment . ’
A Premier League footballer has been stabbed in both legs and is described in a " serious " condition after an attack on him and his mother at their home .
The West Ham central defender Calum Davenport required emergency surgery today on his injuries after the knife attack in the home in Bedford .
Doctors described the Bedford - born player 's injuries as severe , but it is too early to speculate whether they have curtailed or could damage the 26 - year - old 's career .
His mother was also described by police as being in a serious condition .
Two men have been taken in to custody in connection with the incident .
A 25 - year - old man was arrested in Derby on suspicion of attempted murder , while a 19 - year - old man arrested earlier remains in custody , said Bedfordshire police .
Detectives from Scotland Yard have also been notified of the incident .
In addition , West Ham 's medical team are liaising with hospital staff over the extent of the wounds .
A statement by West Ham read : " The club 's thoughts are with Calum Davenport and his family .
His mum is recovering while Calum underwent surgery this morning and his injuries were described as serious by doctors .
" The thoughts of everyone at West Ham are with Calum and his family and , due to the ongoing police investigation , no further information will be released at this time . "
Davenport is a former England Under - 21 international , who cost the Hammers £ 3 m when he joined them from Tottenham during the summer of 2007 .
However , he did not figure in West Ham 's first game of the season at Wolves last week and recent transfer speculation has linked the defender with a £ 1.5 m move to Nottingham Forest .
Davenport spent a spell on loan at Premier League rivals Sunderland last season and has also been loaned out to Watford .
The centre - back started his career at Coventry and has also played on loan at Southampton and Norwich .
Gianfranco Zola 's side are due to play Tottenham tomorrow .
Search engine optimization this and search engine optimization that .
You read and hear about it all day , but what about your site ?
While there are plenty of articles providing useful information , this article shows you how a real world example met with success .
The point of this article is to emphasize creativity when approaching tough optimization situations .
Problems for BusinessTaxRecovery.com
In November of 2004 , our firm took on the seo marketing for BusinessTaxRecovery.com .
The site was being promoted through offline activities and pay - per - click campaigns .
No effort had been made to achieve high rankings in Google , Yahoo or MSN .
Keyword analysis revealed that combinations of the root keywords , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ businessÃ¢â‚ ¬Â  and Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ taxÃ¢â‚
¬
Â were going to be difficult to attack .
The primary problem concerned government agencies with web sites .
The IRS site , for instance , had roughly 9,680 inbound links and an absolute ton of content .
State agencies were nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t far behind .
The California tax agency site had roughly 7,000 inbound links and , again , tons of content .
For a final nail in the coffin , the client informed us the business was cyclical with the busiest months being January through April when people focused on taxes .
The site absolutely had to rank highly during this period .
We had two months to achieve results .
Gulp !
The Solution for BusinessTaxRecovery.com Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ 140,000 Hits
After staring at a Salvador Dali painting for a few hours , we came up with a solution .
It involved a combination of internal site page focus , meta tag optimization , link exchange and massive article promotion .
The results produced 145,828 hits from January through April , with only 5,000 coming from the pay - per - click program .
The first step was to change the focus of the site from the home page to the article page .
Jumping the tax agency sites on keywords such as business tax and taxes was impossible in two months , so we did nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t even try .
Instead , we decided to focus on the keyword phrase Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ business tax articlesÃ¢â‚ ¬Â and bring people into the site through the article page .
Meta tags were optimized and a link exchange program undertaken .
The key to campaign , however , was a strong article promotion campaign .
Since taxes are confusing , it seemed obvious that an article campaign focusing on tax information would meet with success .
Boy , did it .
Approximately 35 articles were written , published and submitted to article directories .
Since the articles were timely , they were snapped up and published .
The articles produced direct traffic to the site as well as numerous inbound links because of the link created in the article byline .
As for the search engines , we focused on everything but Google .
We expected nothing from Google because the major content and meta tag changes would take six to eight months to show results per the usual practices of Google .
In reality , it did nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t matter .
The Yahoo and MSN search engines produced big time .
In mid-January , the site went to number 1 on MSN under Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ business tax articles .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â
By the end of January , Yahoo was also listing it as number 1 . MSN started listing it at number 1 for Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ tax articlesÃ¢â‚ ¬Â in February .
The combination of these listings produced a significant amount of traffic , conversions and a very happy client .
Can we go on cruise control now ?
No !
With the end of the tax season , the traffic to the articles page of the site has dropped by 75 % .
Nobody is looking for tax information after April 15th , so this is hardly surprising .
The promotion of the article page was simply a short - term solution to a difficult situation .
While it should produce traffic during the first quarter of each subsequent year , it is not a year - around solution .
Over the next six months , we will focus on the long - term goal of jumping over the tax agency sites for keywords such as Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ business taxesÃ¢â‚ ¬Â , etc .
It is going to take a lot of patience , but will eventually produce a significant amount of business for the client .
Creativity is often the key to conquering seo situations .
Blindly slapping up new meta tags and links is nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t always the best answer .
Sometimes , a little pre-emptive consideration can yield amazing results .
It did in this case .
One stimulus will lead to the next one , and then more money printing , and then the collapse .
The US government will go bust , then it will go to war .
Buy a farm and a gun .

Editor 's note : On CNN's " State of the Union , " host and Chief National Correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country .
Herbert
Hale lives on a check of a little less than $ 17 a week and whatever he can pick up from odd jobs .
CHERRY CREEK , South Dakota ( CNN ) --
The tiny one - room house rests on a hill ; no electricity and no running water .
A creaky metal cot and a rusting wood - burning stove is all the comfort Herbert Hale says he needs .
" All it is is logs , glue -- dirt and water put together -- then cement and the chicken string , " Hale says of his home .
" Long as the windows do n't break , it 's nice and warm in here . "
The roof leaks a bit , and the floorboards are rotted in one corner , but Hale is n't one to complain .
" It 's home , " he says , almost under his breath , as he invites a visitor to have a look .
Firewood is stacked in one corner inside , and more outside as Hale uses the summer months to stockpile for prairie winters , where 20 below zero is not all that uncommon .
He also pulls bunches of long weeds in the prairie grass , to dry for use as a firestarter .
" I have to be careful , " Hale says matter - of - factly as he pulls a few fistfuls .
" Sometimes there are some snakes .
Rattlesnakes .
Nothing to mess around with . "
He is 54 years old , a member of the Lakota tribe and part of two stunning statistics , even as communities across America deal with the pain and challenges of recession :
The unemployment rate on his reservation runs higher than 80 percent ;
Ziebach County , where he lives , is the nation 's poorest , with just shy of 56 percent of its residents below the poverty line .
Poverty among children in the county eclipses a staggering 70 percent .
Article Correction Herbert Hale was identified as a veteran who served two combat tours in Vietnam .
That description was based on information provided by Mr. Hale and several friends .
In subsequent reporting , however , three government sources told CNN that while Mr. Hale served overseas in the Vietnam era , he did not serve in Vietnam .
Hale worked 16 years as a firefighter .
But he began having some back problems in the early 1980s and then , " cancer caught up with me .
I have a brain tumor . "
He says he gets a check for just shy of $ 17 every week from a tribal welfare fund , and tries to find odd jobs to pay for his food and to help out a diabetic sister .
But there 's a catch : Tiny Cherry Creek has no such jobs .
There are one or two one - room homes like Hale 's , but it is mostly a collection of a couple dozen simple modular homes provided by a federal and tribal housing program .
It does n't even have a gas station or general store .
So Hale heads out most days toward Eagle Butte -- 17 miles up one road and then 21 miles more up the next .
A few more twists and , " It 's about 42 to 43 miles , someplace around there . "
Herbert
Hale can't afford a car .
" Well , I take off , go to my sister 's , then get some water and take off .
Somebody along the way will pick me up . "
Often , that somebody is Bryce In The Woods , a member of the tribal council whose district includes Cherry Creek .
" It is bad , " he says of the area 's economic plight , walking a visitor through the gravel streets where many residents , idle because of the lack of jobs , are sitting out front or shout out a greeting from inside their small homes .
To spend a day crossing the reservation is to see a place stunningly beautiful and seemingly forgotten all at once , small , poor communities tucked into the hollows of western South Dakota 's Cheyenne River Reservation .
The poverty is all the more striking because of the richness of the setting : green and golden rolling hills , roaming horses and cattle , and tall corn and golden sunflowers sprouting from the fertile soil .
" Ziebach County is the No. 1 county statistically with child poverty , " he said .
" Now that alone is generational , with the trauma of poverty and the broken family . "
Breaking that cycle is Bryce In The Woods ' obsession .
He highlights a bright spot :
A building in the community converted to a makeshift classroom and library where residents can get tutoring help and then take the GED --- the high school equivalency exam .
" It is so difficult , " he says of the challenge facing younger reservation residents .
" Some of our young people join the services , the armed services , some of them go to college or apply to college , " Bryce In The Woods told us .
" The majority , if they are staying here , end up moving to Rapid City or some of the bigger cities to try to find employment . "
In Eagle Butte , the largest community on the reservation , a bustling construction site is a new source of pride .
A medical center is under construction , thanks to funding from the Obama administration 's stimulus plan , and Bryce In The Woods says about 65 construction - related jobs so far have gone to tribal members .
" At this point I am very appreciative of what we have received , " Joseph Brings Plenty , the elected tribal chairman , says when we ask if the stimulus funding is enough .
" But as far as expectation , I can say no .
There would be a lot more need to be fulfilled by the U.S. government for our tribe before I can say yes . "
Outside , Brings Plenty 's office is a " First Americans for Obama " sign -- a reminder the tribe was an early backer of Barack Obama .
Brings Plenty says he hopes the president remembers .
" I can sympathize , empathize , with the demands , with the pressures that are on his shoulders , on his plate and put in front of him , " Brings Plenty said during a break from a Tribal Council meeting .
The biggest help Obama and Congress could give , the chairman and others told us , is greater water rights .
The tribe has money for more housing , but can't build because the water pressure is too low and its treatment systems too outdated to handle increased demand .
" I feel that we are forgotten because we do n't have that voice out there , " Chairman Brings Plenty said .
" It 's demoralizing in a way for some of our members that go out and receive an education and come back and are unable to get a job here . "
To be clear , Chairman Brings Plenty and Bryce
In the Woods say not all of the tribe 's problems rest with the federal government .
Both mentioned obstacles and disagreements born of factional tribal politics and rivalries , which were in full evidence during just a few minutes of the Tribal Council 's debate .
In The Woods is also a strong advocate for land reforms he says would get the tribe a better deal for grazing rights on its property .
Still , they would welcome more economic development help , from the state and from Washington , but say their voices do n't always get heard , even in the best of times .
" When it comes down to a vote , a lot of the urban representatives , I do n't think they really know the plight on the reservation , " Bryce In the Woods said .
" I think there is a stereotype out there that all tribes have casinos and that 's not true . "
Herbert
Hale shrugs when asked if Washington has a responsibility to help his struggling community .
" I can't really say , " he said quietly .
" I 'm not into politics to tell you the truth .
I was when I was younger , back in the ' 80s . "
Now , he lives the simplest of lives .
A few hours of work if he is lucky , and perhaps an hour or two collecting wood , even in the scorching August sun .
The temperature neared 100 degrees on the day of our visit , yet Hale 's wood stove was warm to the touch .
Prairie mornings can still be chilly .
More important , memories of winter 's past remind Hale of the value of his growing stockpile .
" Sometimes it 's a long walk , " he says .
" Especially in February .
Twenty below and I have to walk .
Often no cars ... A few times I felt like falling asleep on the road .
I told myself , ' Fall asleep , you 're froze and you 're gone . '
I pushed myself to keep walking . "
Once home , he has a battery - powered radio and uses a small kerosene lamp to pass time at night reading .
He 's extra careful because he recently broke its glass chimney , so the flame burns without protection from the winds that can pick up suddenly .
Herbert 's worries are more immediate than whether the president or any other politician understands his plight .
" They never stopped up here , " he says .
" If they did , I was n't home . "
On the odd jobs in town , $ 1 here and $ 5 there adds up -- not too much , but his goals are modest .
" You know , take the trash out .
I sweep the front .
A few dollars a day would n't hurt .
That 's as good as you need .
That 's all I care about .
One day at a time . "
All About National Economy • Barack Obama • Poverty
The American empire has not altered under Barack Obama .
It kills as brutally and indiscriminately in Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan as it did under George W. Bush .
It steals from the U.S. treasury to enrich the corporate elite as rapaciously .
It will not give us universal health care , abolish the Bush secrecy laws , end torture or “ extraordinary rendition , ” restore habeas corpus or halt the warrantless wiretapping and monitoring of citizens .
It will not push through significant environmental reform , regulate Wall Street or end our relationship with private contractors that provide mercenary armies to fight our imperial wars and produce useless and costly weapons systems .
The sad reality is that all the well - meaning groups and individuals who challenge our permanent war economy and the doctrine of pre-emptive war , who care about sustainable energy , fight for civil liberties and want corporate malfeasance to end , were once again suckered by the Democratic Party .
They were had .
It is not a new story .
The Democrats have been doing this to us since Bill Clinton .
It is the same old merry - go - round , only with Obama branding .
And if we have not learned by now that the system is broken , that as citizens we do not matter to our political elite , that we live in a corporate state where our welfare and our interests are irrelevant , we are in serious trouble .
Our last hope is to step outside of the two - party system and build movements that defy the Democrats and the Republicans .
If we fail to do this , we will continue to undergo a corporate coup d’etat in slow motion that will end in feudalism .
We owe Ralph Nader , Cynthia McKinney and the Green Party an apology .
They were right .
If a few million of us had had the temerity to stand behind our ideals rather than our illusions and the empty slogans peddled by the Obama campaign , we would have a platform .
We forgot that social reform never comes from accommodating the power structure but from frightening it .
The Liberty Party , which fought slavery , the suffragists who battled for women ’s rights , the labor movement , and the civil rights movement knew that the question was not how do we get good people to rule — those attracted to power tend to be venal mediocrities — but how do we limit the damage the powerful do to us .
These mass movements were the engines for social reform , the correctives to our democracy and the true protectors of the rights of citizens .
We have surrendered this power .
It is vital to reclaim it .
Where is the foreclosure movement ?
Where is the robust universal health care or anti-war movement ?
Where is the militant movement for sustainable energy ?
“ Something is broken , ” Nader said when I reached him at his family home in Connecticut .
“ We are not at the Bangladesh level in terms of passivity , but we are getting there .
No one sees anything changing .
There is no new political party to give people a choice .
The progressive forces have no hammer .
When they abandoned our campaign , they told the Democrats we have nowhere to go and will take whatever you give us .
The Democrats are under no heat in the electoral arena from the left .
“ There comes a point when the public imbibes the ultimatum of the plutocracy , ” Nader said when asked about public apathy .
“ They have bought into the belief that if it protests , it will be brutalized by the police .
If they have Muslim names , they will be subjected to Patriot Act treatment .
This has scared the hell out of the underclass .
They will be called terrorists .
“ This is the third television generation , ” Nader said .
“ They have grown up watching screens .
They have not gone to rallies .
Those are history now .
They hear their parents and grandparents talk about marches and rallies .
They have little toys and gizmos that they hold in their hands .
They have no idea of any public protest or activity .
It is a tapestry of passivity .
“ They have been broken , ” Nader said of the working class .
“ How many times have their employers threatened them with going abroad ?
How many times have they threatened the workers with outsourcing ?
The polls on job insecurity are record - high by those who have employment .
And the liberal intelligentsia have failed them .
They [ the intellectuals ] have bought into carping and making lecture fees as the senior fellow at the institute of so - and - so .
Look at the top 50 intelligentsia — not one of them supported our campaign , not one of them has urged for street action and marches . ”
Our task is to build movements that can act as a counterweight to the corporate rape of America .
We must opt out of the mainstream .
We must articulate and stand behind a viable and uncompromising socialism , one that is firmly and unequivocally on the side of working men and women .
We must give up the self - delusion that we can influence the power elite from the inside .
We must become as militant as those who are seeking our enslavement .
If we remain passive as we undergo the largest transference of wealth upward in American history , our open society will die .
The working class is being plunged into desperation that will soon rival the misery endured by the working class in China and India .
And the Democratic Party , including Obama , is a willing accomplice .
“ Obama is squandering his positive response around the world , ” Nader said .
“ In terms of foreign and military policy , it is a distinct continuity with Bush .
Iraq , Afghanistan , the militarization of foreign policy , the continued expansion of the Pentagon budget and pursuing more globalized trade agreements are the same . ”
This is an assessment that neoconservatives now gleefully share .
Eliot A. Cohen , writing in The Wall Street Journal , made the same pronouncement .
“ Mostly , though , the underlying structure of the policy remains the same , ” Cohen wrote in an Aug. 2 opinion piece titled “ What ’s Different About the Obama Foreign Policy . ”
“ Nor should this surprise us : The United States has interests dictated by its physical location , its economy , its alliances , and above all , its values .
Naive realists , a large tribe , fail to understand that ideals will inevitably guide American foreign policy , even if they do not always determine it .
Moreover , because the Obama foreign and defense policy senior team consists of centrist experts from the Democratic Party , it is unlikely to make radically different judgments about the world , and about American interests in it , than its predecessors . ”
Nader said that Obama should gradually steer the country away from imperial and corporate tyranny .
“ You do n’t just put out policy statements of congeniality , but statements of gradual redirection , ” Nader said .
“ You incorporate in that statement not just demilitarization , not just ascension of smart diplomacy , but the enlargement of the U.S. as a humanitarian superpower , and cut out these Soviet - era weapons systems and start rapid response for disaster like earthquakes and tsunamis .
You expand infectious disease programs , which the U.N. Developmental Commission says can be done for $ 50 billion a year in Third World countries on nutrition , minimal health care and minimal shelter . ”
Obama has expanded the assistance to our class of Wall Street extortionists through subsidies , loan guarantees and backup declarations to banks such as Citigroup .
His stimulus package does not address the crisis in our public works infrastructure ; instead it doles out funds to Medicaid and unemployment compensation .
There will be no huge public works program to remodel the country .
The president refuses to acknowledge the obvious — we can no longer afford our empire .
“ Obama could raise a call to come home , America , from the military budget abroad , ” Nader suggested .
“ He could create a new constituency that does not exist because everything is so fragmented , scattered , haphazard and slapdash with the stimulus .
He could get the local labor unions , the local Chambers of Commerce and the mayors to say the more we cut the military budget , the more you get in terms of public works . ”
“ They [ administration leaders ] do n’t see the distinction between public power and corporate power , ” Nader said .
“ This is their time in history to reassert public values represented by workers , consumers , taxpayers and communities .
They are creating a jobless recovery , the worst of the worst , with the clear specter of inflation on the horizon .
We are heading for deep water . ”
The massive borrowing acts as an anesthetic .
It prevents us from facing the new limitations we must learn to cope with domestically and abroad .
It allows us to live in the illusion that we are not in a state of irrevocable crisis , that our decline is not real and that catastrophe has been averted .
But running up the national debt can work only so long .
“ No one can predict the future , ” Nader added hopefully .
“ No one knows the variables .
No one predicted the move on tobacco .
No one predicted gay rights .
No one predicted the Berkeley student rebellion .
The students were supine .
You never know what will light the fire .
You have to keep the pressure on .
I know only one thing for sure :
The whole liberal - progressive constituency is going nowhere . ”

Tony Abbott has thrown his support behind an anti-drugs program for parents after he said his teenage daughter called him a ' ' lame , gay churchy loser ' ' .
The Opposition spokesman for families was trying to talk to the 18 - year - old about the perils of drug abuse at the launch of the How To Drug - Proof Your Kids program yesterday .
" I was talking to my 18 - year - old daughter just the other day with what I was thought was a worthy moral exhortation .
" She said : ' Well , what would you know dad ?
You 're just a lame , gay , churchy loser . ' "
Only a year ago , police were called to Mr Abbott 's home to disperse a crowd of revellers trying to gatecrash his daughter 's birthday party .

Three playful sea lion pups , all rescued separately from harbors in Southern California , have found their way to the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut .
The only male pup was originally found malnourished and suffering from pneumonia and was treated and released by the Marine Mammal Center .
Unfortunately the little California Sea Lion kept returning to the beach and finding his way to crowds of beach - goers ( or them to him ) .
Either way , after three restrandings , it was determined that life at Mystic would be a good fit for the little guy .
HELP MYSTIC AQUARIUM & INSTITUTE FOR EXPLORATION
NAME THE NEWLY - ARRIVED CALIFORNIA SEA LION PUPS !
Three pups , all just one year old , arrived from California in May ;
New names to be announced during first birthday celebration
MYSTIC , Conn. ( July 28 , 2009 ) — Mystic Aquarium & Institute for Exploration recently welcomed three California sea lion pups and wants the public ’s help in naming them !
Starting today , the aquarium is holding a contest to find the perfect names for the playful pups – one male and two females – that arrived on May 16 .
The chosen names will be announced during their first birthday party on August 27 at 11 a.m. at the aquarium .
The contest consists of several parts .
First , the public can submit name ideas through the aquarium ’s Web site , mysticaquarium.org , through August 12 .
From these suggestions , the aquarium ’s animal care staff and celebrity judges – WFSB - TV meteorologist and “ Better Connecticut ” co-host Scot Haney , Miss Connecticut 2009 Sharalynn Kuziak and UConn Men ’s Basketball Coach Jim Calhoun – will choose five finalist names for each pup .
From August 17 to 24 , the public can go back online to vote for their favorite names .
The winning names will be announced on August 27 at the pups ’ first birthday celebration , featuring cake for guests and a fish “ dessert ” for the pups .
“ We are thrilled to have the pups here , ” said Dr. Tracy Romano , senior vice president of research and zoological operations for Sea Research Foundation , Inc .
“ Our guests will be able to watch them develop physically and through their training , and learn more about these intelligent animals .
The naming contest also provides the perfect opportunity to tell these pups ’ stories and remind everyone of the important animal rescue and rehabilitation work that Mystic and other aquariums around the world do .
We encourage the public to submit name ideas that reflect these pups ’ stories . ”
The male pup was approximately six months old when he was rescued in Morro Bay Harbor in San Luis Obispo County and brought to The Marine Mammal Center in December 2008 .
He was treated for malnutrition and pneumonia and released back into the wild , but re-stranded several times , and was found surrounded by people .
Even after being relocated , the pup found his way back to Morro Bay , where he remained for several days and lost more weight .
The two female pups come from SeaWorld San Diego ’s Animal Rescue and Rehabilitation Program .
One was rescued in February at Ocean Beach in San Diego and the other from Oceanside Harbor in Oceanside in January .
Both pups were malnourished and dehydrated .
All three recovered well during rehabilitation and were brought to the aquarium for enhancement of the species .
The pups will remain permanent residents of the aquarium and are currently housed in the Aquatic Animal Study Center , which can be viewed from the Gurdon and Kathy Wattles Marine Mammal Observatory .
The male will eventually join the other California sea lions in the aquarium ’s daily Marine Theater shows , and the two females will join the Steller sea lions in the Pribilof Islands exhibit .
Former Mayor Tom Potter supports the recall of his successor Mayor Sam Adams , giving the grassroots effort its first high - profile supporter .
Potter made his support known in a comment he left Saturday morning on his wife 's Facebook page .
Potter 's wife , Karin Hansen , posted a status update on her page saying she has petitions for the recall and directing people to a site where they can join the effort .
" We deserve a truthful City Council , " she wrote .
A few minutes later , Potter wrote , " Please , please get your petition , sign a petition .
Good government is what we make it .
Thanks , Tom . "
Hansen 's Facebook profile picture is the logo from the Recall Sam Adams campaign .
News of Potter 's support for the recall was first reported on Saturday on The Mercury 's blog .
Reached at home this morning , Hansen said her husband is n't talking about the Adams recall .
When asked why , she said she could not talk about it .
In a follow - up phone call , Potter declined to comment .
Meanwhile , Jasun Wurster , the chief petitioner behind the recall effort , said he welcomed Hansen and Potter 's support .
" It speaks volumes to the credibility of our campaign , " he said .
He said he has not spoken with Potter but has traded emails with Hansen who signed up as a volunteer .
" This was a total surprise , " Wurster said .
" We do n't actively go after any former political people in Portland asking for their support .
It was on his own volition .
We are definitely elated that he supports the recall . "

Syracuse , NY -- Lt. Dan Choi vowed Tuesday evening to fight to stay in the military after an Army board in Syracuse recommended he be the first person discharged from the New York National Guard for violating the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy .
A four - officer panel meeting at Hancock Air Base notified Choi at about 5 p.m. that it would recommend he be discharged because he has publicly said he is gay .

» Post - Standard editorial : ' Do n't Ask , Don't Tell ' policy must be changed
The recommendation now goes to Lt. Gen. Thomas Miller of the First Army Division , and Gen. Craig McKinley , the chief of the National Guard Bureau , who will make the final decision .
" Today was a setback for me , " Choi said at a 6:10 p.m. news conference .
" I got in trouble for saying three words .
' I am gay . '" But he said he refuses to lie about being involved in a relationship with another man .
Choi said the relationship has made him a better person , a better Christian and a better officer .
Choi , an Arabic - speaking officer who served for 15 months in Iraq as a member of Fort Drum 's 10th Mountain Division before joining a New York National Guard unit based in Manhattan , said he would appeal to the higher - ranking officers to stay in the National Guard .
There is no deadline for a final decision in Choi 's case .
The fate of Choi and other gay and lesbian military personnel may ultimately lie with the White House and Congress , however .
While hosting a White House reception on Monday recognizing Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Pride Month , Obama repeated that he will work to repeal the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy approved in 1993 by President Bill Clinton and Congress .
The policy forbids military recruiters from asking someone about his or her sexual orientation , but also prohibits a service member from revealing if he or she is gay .
" As I said before -- I 'll say it again -- I believe ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' does n't contribute to our national security .
In fact , I believe preventing patriotic Americans from serving their country weakens our national security , " Obama said .
" ... I 've asked the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to develop a plan for how to thoroughly implement a repeal , " Obama said .
Ending the policy would require congressional approval .
Some members of Central New York 's congressional delegation are taking active roles this year in efforts to repeal the policy .
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , D - N.Y. , who recently met with Choi in her Washington D.C. office , is working with Sen. Edward Kennedy , D - Mass. , to draft legislation in the Senate that would do away with " do n't ask , do n't tell . "
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , will support any effort to repeal the policy , a spokesman said Tuesday .
In the House , Rep. Michael Arcuri , D - Utica , is among 150 co-sponsors of a bill that would repeal the policy .
A spokesman for Rep. Dan Maffei , D - DeWitt , said Maffei would support the legislation , although he is not currently a co-sponsor .
" The ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' policy should be re-evaluated .
It 's proven to be ineffective , " Maffei said Tuesday .
" The military , in following the policy , has had to discharge very good people who were willing to serve their country .
It just does n't make any sense . "
The only member of the Central New York delegation who has remained uncommitted on the issue is Rep. John McHugh , R - Pierrepont Manor , the former ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee .
McHugh has declined to discuss his position since Obama announced his intent to nominate McHugh to serve as Secretary of the Army .
In 2008 , McHugh said , " We need active military input on the effects a change in policy would have at a time of war . "
" As it was in 1993 , the question of whether the law is to be changed should ultimately rest on the matters of military readiness , morale , good order and discipline , " McHugh added .
More than 1,000 retired generals and admirals signed an open letter earlier this year supporting the ban on gay troops serving openly , and predicted a repeal could eventually break the all - volunteer force .
About 10,500 military personnel have been discharged for violating the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy in the 12 years from 1997 through 2008 , said Cynthia Smith , a Defense Department spokeswoman .
Another 250 individuals have been discharged this year , according to congressional members .
Advocates for change argue that the military would be stronger if it had not kicked out what amounts to a full battalion of troops just because they were gay .
At his news conference , Choi pressed Obama to issue an executive order suspending the discharges until Congress can vote on legislation .
Tuesday 's hearing was held in Syracuse because it is the headquarters of the 27th Brigade Combat Team , which oversees Choi's National Guard unit , the 1st Battalion , 69th Infantry .
It was closed to the public and the media .
Choi and his attorney provided the hearing panel with a disc that contained letters and petitions signed by 260,000 people supporting Choi 's efforts to stay in the National Guard .
" I served with him for six months on the sands of Iraq .
Dan was -- and is -- a fine officer , one of the best I 've ever met , " wrote Army Maj. Jessica McCoy .
" Soldiers do not care about sexual orientation .
They care about mission , a hot meal , and surviving until they get home . "
Choi and three other witnesses from the New York National Guard testified , said Maj .
Roy Diehl , Choi 's attorney .
Choi said that none of the witnesses said he was a poor officer or that they would object to serving with him .
The hearing board also watched a video clip of Choi outing himself on March 19 on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show .

China is quick to criticise nations that show support for the Dalai Lama China has criticised an invitation from Taiwan to the Dalai Lama , calling him a separatist who wants to sabotage improving cross -strait relations .
Taiwan 's president granted opposition requests for Tibet 's spiritual leader to comfort victims of Typhoon Morakot .
But a statement from Beijing 's Taiwan Affairs Bureau said the Dalai Lama was not a " pure religious figure " .
" Under the pretext of religion , he has all along been engaged in separatist activities , " the statement said .
" He raises the religious banner and continues to carry out attempting to split the country . "
The authorities in Beijing said Taiwan 's pro-independence opposition had ulterior motives in asking the more pro-Beijing President Ma Ying - jeou to approve the Dalai Lama 's visit .
" Some of the people in the Democratic Progressive Party use the disaster rescue excuse to invite Dalai to Taiwan to sabotage the hard - earned positive situation of cross- straits relations , " the statement said .
Comforting victims Under Taiwan 's previous pro-independence administration , the Dalai Lama visited the island several times - most recently in 2001 .
ANALYSIS Michael Bristow
BBC News , Beijing
It is not a surprise that China has expressed its " resolute opposition " - it objects to most of the Dalai Lama 's overseas visits .
Beijing believes his aim is to garner support for Tibetan independence .
What is perhaps surprising is that Taiwan 's President Ma Ying - jeou has approved the visit .
He has worked hard to improve Taiwan 's relationship with China since he took office last year .
This trip risks undermining those efforts .
But Mr Ma has faced criticism at home recently for what many see as a slow response to the devastation caused by Typhoon Morakot .
Many Taiwanese people also say he is just too close to Beijing .
Mr Ma probably gambled that , at this moment , it was better to risk annoying China than his own voters .
But President Ma , who came to power in 2008 , is much closer to China than his predecessor Chen Shui-bian .
Last year he refused to grant permission for a visit by the Dalai Lama , saying the timing was not right as his government was working to improve relations with Beijing .
But the typhoon and its aftermath have left Mr Ma in a difficult position .
The Chinese government considers Mr Ma 's administration far easier to deal with than the island 's previous pro-independence leadership .
However , an estimated 500 people were killed by severe flooding and mudslides caused by the typhoon - the worst Taiwan has suffered for 50 years - and Mr Ma 's administration has been criticised for its slow and inefficient response .
His popularity has plunged to a record low of 20 % over his handling of the disaster .
According to the BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei , the president needed to give the green light to the Dalai Lama 's visit because he could not afford to hurt his and his party 's image any further .
Many relatives of those killed in the south of Taiwan blame the government
So after a five - hour meeting with security officials , he chose to allow the trip .
Correspondents say that harsh Chinese criticism might play into the hands of Taiwan 's opposition by reducing Mr Ma 's popularity even further .
The Tibetan spiritual leader is due to arrive on 31 August and to stay for four days , with the focus of his trip being entirely to comfort those affected by the typhoon .
The Dalai Lama has long been eager to visit Taiwan , and is looking forward to the trip , his aide told Reuters news agency .
Taiwan is home to a large exiled Tibetan community , and millions of Taiwanese are Buddhists .
A spokesman for Taiwan 's Presidential Office insisted " cross - strait relations will not be negatively affected " by the decision .

One of the glorious parts about living in NYC is that we get some of the more intense ad campaigns , particularly in the form of viral posters .
District 9
The trailer is amazing , the reviews are excellent , and the ad campaign , is , well , beyond important :
I actually saw this next on a bus stop along 6th ave near 46th st :
A very cool campaign , to say the least .
Given the very clear references to our own troubled past regarding race - based rights restrictions and our current problems with gender / sexuality , it makes sense that District 9 would echo both campaigns .
I ’m kind of amazed they did n’t do it on subway cars too .
The other really amazing part about District 9 is that it forces the reader to consider rights as existing outside of the human condition .
If an alien race has rights , then rights are n’t “ God given ” nor are they inherent to “ being human . ”
In fact , the very concept of humanism is challenged by alien rights .
Oh , and the aliens also augment their bodies with robotic exoskeletons .
The other movie that ’s got me jazzed is :
Surrogates
The original comic was ok , a neat idea if only mediocre in execution , and the movie looks to be equally generic .
What I love , though , are the posters .
The concept of Surrogates is that everyone has a prosthetic body that they access from a terminal in their home , meaning physical society is made up of beautiful puppet - bots .
These first two posters are designed to be ads for the company that makes the bots :
These other posters have been all over NYC and use sexually provocative poses with the jarring exposure of mechanical parts in a way I really like :
There is something particularly strange about the middle poster , wherein it ’s not the model ’s midriff which is removed , but her chest .
The effect created by all of these posters is an increased sexualization and objectification of the models because the sexually irrelevant portion of the body is the one exposed as mechanical .
Furthermore , it creates a horrific , mechanized , exaggerated hourglass shape in all the models .
Perhaps that ’s what ’s so unsettling about the blonde , female model : the exposed robotic spine , particularly sans robot ribcage , undoes the hourglass shape and shifts her into the truly uncanny .
I think it ’s also telling that the campaign uses models , that is , abnormally attractive people .
The whole point of Surrogates is that people use their artificial bodies for sex and existing more beautifully in the world .
In that world , the normative standard of beauty is readily achievable through the purchase of a surrogate .
One of the big problems I had with the graphic novel , and I ’m sure the movie suffers the same fate , is that normative states , such as beauty standards , do not reflect the actual average person .
So when a normative standard becomes the average , what happens to ideas of beauty ?
I ’ve talked about this before , but I think you ’d see way more eccentric and exotic forms of beauty than a society full of runway models .
I ’d guess that a technology like this would make people more expressive , not less .
Consider how people will kit out their characters in something like World of Warcraft to intentionally look unique .
Instead of a boring society of beautiful people , I ’d actually expect something like the alt - reality world of Snow Crash , where people did impossible things to their surrogate ( digital bodies ) that would be inconceivable with flesh and blood .
Whether Surrogates itself is any good , it ’s asking all the right questions .
Ca n’t wait to see both of these movies .

One of the largest and most complete * Tyrannosaurus rex * skeletons ever discovered is set to go on the auction block in Las Vegas in October .
The 66 million - year - old fossil was found 22 years ago in South Dakota and has come to be known as Samson .
It is 40 feet long and 15 feet tall and consists of around 170 bones , more than half of a complete skeleton .
" In the last 110 years , there 's been a total of 46 specimens found of Tyrannosaurus rex of which this is the third most complete and has the finest skull , " said Tom Lindgren , who is co-director of natural history for the auction house Bonhams & Butterfields .
The last time a T. rex was auctioned , the most complete specimen ever found , known as Sue , went for more than $ 8 million dollars .
The winner was the Chicago Field Museum .
Sue was still in pieces and unprepared when she was put on the block , and was only expected to fetch around $ 1 or 2 million .
Lindgren hopes Samson will exceed his estimated worth .
One thing he has going for him is that he is fully prepared and mounted and ready to go on display .
" I 'm going to estimate it's in the neighborhood of $ 2 to 8 million , but it could easily go for upwards of $ 10 million , " Lindgren said .
" I want to hold the record for a natural history auction . "
Samson is clearly the star of the upcoming auction , which will be held October 3 at the Venetian casino , but there will be more than 50 other lots of rare specimens .
Highlights include a 25 - foot - long shark , the largest fossil shark ever found .
Lindgren has also secured a reconstructed shark jaw with a full set of real teeth that stands eight feet tall and 10 feet wide and belonged to a shark that was probably around 80 feet long .
He 's trying to finalize the largest bony fish skeleton ever found , which is 17 feet long .
Just 10 minutes before speaking with Wired.com , Lindgren learned he also has a woolly mammoth that stands around 12 feet tall .
" The items we have in this auction are definitely museum standard , or better , " he said .
" Most of the museums in the world do n't have anything near what we have in this auction . "
The auction items will be on display to the public during Labor Day weekend , as well as for the two weeks preceding the auction .
Samson 's skull was discovered intact , unlike most skulls , including Sue 's , which are in pieces .
There are bite marks from other dinosaurs and places where the bone has been eaten away by infection .
" This animal , when it died , was in a lot of pain , " Lindgren said .
" But we do n't know what killed it . "
After Samson was originally excavated from a ranch by fossil collectors , it was sold to a private buyer from the Isle of Man , who then sold it to its current American owners .
Lindgren is hoping Samson lands somewhere the public will be able to appreciate him for years to come and is pushing for museums to participate .
At least 20 institutions have shown interest , " but then there 's always the elite that have a lot of money and like unique and unusual items , especially the Hollywood types , " he said .
" There are a couple of major actors that are collectors of dinosauria . "
Because T. rex is only found in North America , Lindgren hopes it stays here .
" It would be a shame if the third most complete specimen , with possibly the finest skull , went to another country , " he said .
" A specimen like this , it needs to be seen by everyone .
It 's just spectacular . "

( CNN ) -- Reports of a lone child having survived Tuesday 's crash of a Yemenia Airways flight in the Indian Ocean have people wondering :
How does anyone survive a plane crash ?
Part of a United Airlines DC - 10 lies next to the runway in Sioux City , Iowa , after the plane crashed in July 1989 .
" I just do n't think there 's any pattern to survivability .
It 's just luck of the draw and depends on how the plane goes in , " said aviation expert John Eakin , head of Air Data Research in Helotes , Texas .
Not counting Tuesday 's disaster , there have been 12 airliner crashes since 1970 that yielded a sole survivor , according to data compiled by Dr. Todd Curtis , director of the Airsafe.com Foundation .
Five of those survivors were minors and four were crew members , accounting for 75 percent of the total .
" I can't figure out for the life of me why crew members and children tend to be disproportionate in these sole - survivor events , " Curtis said .
Watch what happened to the Yemenia flight »
One factor favoring flight crew members is their location in the sturdy cockpit and proximity to windows , he said .
Flight attendants often use shoulder harnesses when they are seated , aviation writer David Noland added .
Where one is seated is a factor only in that it helps to be far from the point of impact , Eakin said .
Sole - survivor crashes January 26 , 1972 , Czechoslovakia : JAT DC -9 ; 27 killed ; crew member fell to ground inside tail section January 29 , 1985 ; Reno , Nevada : Galaxy Airlines Lockheed Electra ; 70 killed ; boy , 17 , thrown from wreckage January 3 , 1987 , Ivory Coast : Varig 707-300 ; 50 killed ; one passenger survived August 16 , 1987 , Detroit , Michigan : Northwest MD - 82 ; 154 killed ; 4 - year - old girl found in wreckage November 14 , 1992 , Vietnam : Vietnam Airlines Yak 40 ; 30 killed ; surviving passenger found eight days later November 20 , 1993 , Macedonia : Avioimpex Yak 42D ; 223 killed ; one passenger survived March 1995 , Colombia : Intercontinental Colombia DC - 9 - 10 ; 51 killed ; 9 - year - old girl survived September 1997 , Cambodia : Vietnam Airlines Tu-134B ; 65 killed ; 1 - year - old boy survived December 16 , 1997 , United Arab Emirates : Tajikistan Airlines Tupolev 154B ; 85 killed ; crew member survived March 6 , 2003 , Algeria : Air Algerie 737-200 ; 102 killed ; crew member survived July 8 , 2003 , Sudan : Sudan Airways 737-200C ; 116 killed ; 3 - year - old boy survived August 27 , 2006 , Lexington , Kentucky : Comair CRJ - 100 ; 49 killed ; co-pilot survived

" I do n't think there 's any particular type of aircraft or position in an aircraft which is more survivable , because it pretty much depends on what type of accident -- it depends on how the aircraft impacts , " Eakin said .
" Sometimes , the survivors are all located in the tail , sometimes in the forward fuselage .
I do n't think there 's any rhyme or reason to it . "
A 2007 Popular Mechanics magazine article , researched and written by Noland , presented a different view .
Noland analyzed 20 U.S. airline crashes in which at least one person lived and one person died .
The statistics indicate that seats farther back in a plane are safer in crashes , the article said .
" Passengers near the tail of a plane are about 40 percent more likely to survive a crash than those in the first few rows up front , " Noland wrote .
Passengers in seats behind the wings had a 69 percent survival rate in crashes that included at least one fatality , Noland wrote .
Those with seats in coach areas over and forward of the wings survived 56 percent of the time , and passengers in first class and business class had a 49 percent survival rate , he found .
" To me , it 's fairly obvious :
You hit something going fast and obviously , the front is going to get crunched more than the back , " Noland told CNN .
" To quote one [ National Transportation Safety Board ] guy , ' Planes do n't back into mountains . ' "
Even in other types of crashes -- runway overruns , forced landings , etc. -- the plane is always going forward , so the front takes the impact , Noland said .
" That 's why they put the crash recorders in the tail , " he said .
Wide - bodied aircraft -- such as the Boeing 747 and 777 and the Airbus A310 and A330 -- tend to yield more survivors than smaller ones , Curtis said .
He chalked up that trend to what he called the SUV theory : Larger crush zones provide more and larger areas of survivability .
Both Curtis and Eakin pointed to the July 1989 crash of United Airlines Flight 232 in Sioux City , Iowa .
Spectacular video footage showed the McDonnell - Douglas DC - 10 cartwheeling down an airport runway as pilot Al Haynes and first officer William Records tried to land the airliner without hydraulic controls .
Of the 296 people aboard the plane , 111 were killed but 185 survived .
" Anyone looking at that crash at first , the video , would say , ' Well gee , how could anybody survive this ? ' "
Curtis said .
" That was kind of a classic .
A bunch of people survived that , " Eakin said .
" It looked terrible , and still so many people walked away from that .
And there was no real pattern to where the survivors were located . "
Availability of an escape route may be the biggest determining factor , Eakin said .
" If the impact is survivable , that 's the next challenge : getting the heck out of the thing , " he said .
" I think in Sioux City , a lot of the survivors exited through cracks in the fuselage .
That 's kind of the ultimate escape route , but you gotta do whatever you gotta do to get out . "
He noted the January 15 ditching of a US Airways Airbus A320 in New York 's Hudson River , in which no one was killed and injuries were minimal , although the craft quickly filled with cold water .
" That really demonstrated how important it is to get out quickly , " Eakin said .
Proximity of rescue equipment and personnel is key to survival too , Curtis said .
If fires can be extinguished and survivors taken to hospitals quickly , victims have a better chance of surviving , he said .
Despite his statistical evidence that the rear of the plane is safer , writer Noland does n't seek out a back seat when he flies .
" I try to get a window seat , " he said .
" Planes are so safe , it 's unbelievable how safe they are .
The odds of a crash are so minuscule that I do n't even worry about it . "

( Marketwire – August 19 , 2009 ) – Grail Advisors , a leader in the development and distribution of active Exchange Traded Funds ( ETFs ) , today issued a white paper on Exchange - Traded Funds and the state of the ETF marketplace
.
The paper — “ Exchange - Traded Funds : A Passive Past and an Active Future ” — provides a backdrop on the use of ETF securities as well as an analysis of the Funds ’ evolution .
Most importantly , the paper looks forward to future development possibilities of the ETF industry , including the expanding marketplace for actively - managed ETFs .
The paper notes that with assets climbing to more than $ 725 billion in just 15 years , ETFs are one of the industry ’s fastest - growing investment vehicles .
Why all the interest in ETFs ?
According the Grail Advisors study “ … because they ’re easy to buy , inexpensive to own , tax efficient , and totally transparent ( 1 ) in terms of portfolio allocation .
ETFs enable investors to trade a portfolio of stocks with a single investment as easily as if they were buying an individual stock . ”
The Grail Advisors paper outlines the competitive differences between ETFs and mutual funds , and cites other independent research , including a recent survey by Charles Schwab that found 79 % of registered investment advisors are looking to ETFs as the top investment vehicles for their clients .
“ For mutual fund managers and financial advisers , the report outlines why investors are increasingly moving out of traditional mutual funds and putting money into ETFs , ” said William M. Thomas , CEO of Grail Advisors LLC .
“ Market appreciation is uncertain , of course , and so are immediate flows into actively - managed funds , but we think it ’s reasonable to expect worldwide ETF assets to reach the $ 1 trillion milestone in the very near term . ”
To receive a copy of “ Exchange - Traded Funds : A Passive Past and an Active Future , ” call Grail Advisors at ( 415 ) 677-5870 , or email [ email protected ] .
In May , Grail Advisors launched the market ’s first true , actively - managed equity ETF , the Grail American Beacon Large Cap Value ETF ( GVT ) .
Traded on the New York Stock Exchange , GVT represents the first fund designed to incorporate traditional investment management approach and a multi-manager format into an active ETF structure .
The Grail American Beacon International Equity ETF — the first actively - managed international ETF of its kind — will be launched later this year .
The firm has also announced plans to introduce the industry ’s first actively - managed ETFs using a single - manager approach .
Four funds — RP Growth ETF , RP Focused Large Cap Growth ETF , RP Technology ETF , and RP Financials ETF — are slated for in September .
RiverPark Advisors , LLC , of New York will serve as the primary sub -adviser for each of the funds .

If you type ‘ street photography tips ’ into Google , you ’ll find lots of websites that provide lists on how to improve your street photography skills .
I thought we could try something a bit different and instead put up some photos and talk about the circumstances in which they were taken and lessons that were learnt from those experiences .
Purists may dispute the classification of some of the photos below as street photography , particularly the close - ups .
So if you ’re a purist , lighten up =)
Also , the lessons mentioned below are based on personal experiences , so they may well not generalize to all cases and all photographic genres – you can just take them for what they ’re worth .
1 . Off - guard shots are sometimes more natural
I spotted two kids wearing AC Milan shirts and digging into their cups of ice cream at the entrance to a theme park .
I asked their mother if it would be alright to take a few photos of them , and she said it was fine , so I proceeded to do so .
I then thanked them all and just before leaving took a couple more shots while the kids were off - guard .
Later at home , I noticed that those last couple of shots were the best of the lot since the facial expressions in them were much more natural .
So even when going for shots where the subject is posing for you , take a few off - guard ones as well ; they might end being your keepers .
2. Create a rapport with your subject
When taking pictures of people , it ’s very important never to forget that your subjects are human beings as well .
Creating a good rapport with them will ensure that the experience will be a positive one for both parties .
Walking away with a good shot is of no use if the subject ends up being offended or saddened .
For this photo , I was walking in an alley in Rome when I saw a lady sitting in a corner playing the accordion .
I really wanted to take a photo of her , but was n’t too comfortable with just taking some quick shots and walking away .
So instead , I figured I would stand and listen to her playing .
I ended up listening to her for close to 15 minutes , and was genuinely enjoying her tunes .
She then looked at me , I smiled and it was at that moment that I took the above shot of her .
This photo has an interesting story as well .
There was a kid sitting in a cardboard box eating some peanuts .
It was a great scene .
I took a couple of shots and the kid noticed me and immediately turned to his mother to tell her about the pesky photographer who was disturbing him .
At that moment , I walked up to both of them and showed them what I had taken and the kid simply could n’t be happier to see his face on the camera ’s little LCD screen .
So I then asked his mother if I could take a few more shots of her son and she tidied him up and told him to look at the camera .
Perhaps I would have gotten a different reaction from the mother had she not seen her son ’s jubilation prior to me asking whether or not it was ok to photograph him .
It ’s great when you can walk away with a nice photograph while also making sure that the other person feels good about the whole experience .
3 . When someone does n’t want to be photographed , do n’t give up on them
The man whose hands are visible in this photo was the owner of a frankincense shop and had some really great facial features so I was adamant on photographing him .
But he was n’t up for it .
Instead of just walking out , I asked if it would be ok to only frame his hands as they were sifting through his frankincense and he agreed .
The photo came out pretty nice and perhaps even looks better than if the store owner ’s entire upper body had been included in the frame .
The lesson here is to persist ( up to a point of course ) ; do n’t give up .
4 . Whenever possible , go in for a shot when all the other photographers leave
This is one of my favorite photos .
A group of girls were walking together as part of a larger parade and they had managed to grab the attention of all the photographers who were there on that day .
As a result , many of the girls got distracted with the tens of cameras that were clicking around them from every angle and so they ceased to be serene , which was the theme of the whole parade .
Instead of settling for the shots that I had taken , I decided to walk with the group for about 10 minutes until they were off the main road , which meant that there were fewer bystanders and photographers around ; it was that moment that I took the above shot and got the facial expression that I was hoping to get .
5 . Take lots of shots , especially if you shoot with digital
I wanted to photograph a demonstration that was going on , but unfortunately , the streets on which the demonstrators were walking through had been sealed off for security reasons .
Bystanders could only watch from a distance .
I was determined to get a few good shots of the event .
Standing on the pavement , at a distance , with a telephoto lens and wanting to get clear shots of the demonstrators proved a difficult feat : most of the captures were ruined by distractions , which were making the whole exercise very challenging .
The only option I had was to simply compose and fire the shutter like there was no tomorrow .
The above was one of the strategy ’s successful results .
The more shots you take , the greater the likelihood that you ’ll have keepers .
6 . Diptychs can turn otherwise normal shots into interesting ones
Each of the above photos looks very normal on its own , but when placed next to each other , the whole thing becomes a lot more interesting .
The photo was taken during the announcement in Trafalgar Square about whether or not London would win its bid to host the 2012 Olympics .
Having captured the same group of people right before and then right after the announcement resulted in a two - photo series that says a lot .
Notice the difference in facial expressions and also ( my favorite bit ) the man in the lower left corner who has his fingers crossed in the first photo and is ecstatic in the second photo .
7 . Shyness will always rob you of potentially great photos
Sometimes , I have to try extra hard to muster up the courage to ask someone if it ’s ok to take their photo .
I was walking in a vegetable market on one of my trips and was dying to take a photo of the mango seller shown above , but the general mood of the place did n’t seem to be one where I felt like I could easily ask him whether or not I could take his photo , let alone take one without asking him first .
So I carried on walking .
On our way back , I spotted him once again and this time thought to myself that if I do n’t give it a go , I would probably not get the chance to take this photo ever again .
So I gestured to him with the camera and , what do you know , he was more than happy to look at the lens and smile .
8 . Never delete a photo , even if you do n’t like it on first sight
I did n’t really think much of this one when I took it a few years ago nor when I was going through the photos after the trip .
It was n’t one of those times when you take a shot and go “ wow this one ’s great , it ’s going to make this whole trip worth it ” .
It was done very quickly on our way back to the hotel .
Then a few months ago I was looking through my old photos and thanks to a friend ’s advice who said that I should never delete anything , decided it could be brought back to life .
That ’s it for now .
Hopefully , these experiences have been useful .
Look out for another photography - related article soon .
Thanks .

It is time to declare war on the traditional course syllabus .
If there is one single artifact that pinpoints the degradation of liberal education , it is the rule - infested , punitive , controlling syllabus that is handed out to students on the first day of class .
I have seen long and highly detailed syllabi that carefully lay out rules for attendance , punctuality , extra credit , grades , and penalties for missing deadlines , as well as detailed writing assignment requirements that specify page and word length , spacing , margins , and even font style and size .
The syllabi use boldface , underlining , italics , and exclamation points for added emphasis ; the net effect is that of the teacher yelling at the student .
What such syllabi often omit is any mention of learning .
They list the assigned readings but not reasons why the subject is worth studying or important or interesting or deep , or the learning strategies that will be used in the course .
The typical syllabus gives little indication that the students and teacher are embarking on an exciting learning adventure together , and its tone is more akin to something that might be handed to a prisoner on the first day of incarceration .
The implicit message of the modern course syllabus is that the student will not do anything unless bribed by grades or forced by threats .
Students coming to class unprepared ?
Start each class with a quiz based on the readings .
Students missing classes or coming late ?
Take off points for absence and tardiness .
Students missing due dates for assignments ?
Take off points for lateness .
Students not participating in discussions ?
Assign points to whoever speaks and , if you want to get really fancy , adjust the number of points to reflect the quality of the contributions .
And so on .
Here ’s an idea : why not try to overcome those problems by making the topics and readings interesting , the discussions cordial yet lively , and the assignments challenging but meaningful ?
The controlling syllabus
I recently attended a conference of college teachers .
One of the sessions , which had an overflow crowd , promised to provide a stress - free method for “ managing ” students — an odd word choice that presumes students are like employees and we their bosses .
Soon into the session , it became clear that the presenter ’s idea of being “ stress - free ” was to create a set of rules so detailed that everything about assessing students could be quantified on a micro level .
The presenter advocated an intricate structure of points and penalties to ensure that every possible excuse a student might present for not meeting a requirement could be dealt with by invoking the appropriate rule , thus avoiding having to make judgments that might be challenged by a student .
The speaker justified her approach by asserting that the syllabus is a “ legally enforceable contract ” ( something one hears often these days ) and so the instructor is almost obliged to make sure that it includes everything expected of the student and not to deviate from it .
The speaker seemed unaware that a detailed legalistic syllabus is diametrically opposed to what makes students want to learn .
There is a vast research literature on the topic of motivation to learn , and one finding screams out loud and clear : controlling environments have been shown consistently to reduce people ’s interest in whatever they are doing , even when they are doing things that would be highly motivating in other contexts .
Making judgments is time - consuming .
A rigid , rule - infested , watertight syllabus might appeal to administrators whose preferred response to any situation is to invoke a rule .
But why should teachers want one ?
The teacher –student relationship is a mentoring one .
We should be modeling for them the exhilaration of the life of the mind .
What does it say about us if we lay out rules and force students to obey ?
And what makes us think that we can make general rules to deal with every contingency ?
I suspect that we have gotten into a vicious negative spiral , a kind of “ syllabus creep ” whereby faculty keep adding new rules to combat each student excuse for not meeting existing rules .
Although faculty sometimes justify this by saying that students want to know exactly what is required to be done in order to get a particular grade and that they are merely responding to that need , college faculty ( and administrators ) also seem to be driven by the fear that students will take legal action over a grade dispute .
But courts have traditionally shown great deference for the faculty ’s professional judgment , intervening only if they feel the teacher or institution has been arbitrary , capricious , acting in bad faith , or violating accepted academic norms .
It is sad that many teachers are willing to forego their autonomy and the privilege of making professional judgments about academic competence and , instead , transform themselves into rule - enforcing tyrants .
It is true that by the time students come to the college classroom , they have had over twelve years of education .
They have been treated , except by a few exceptional teachers , as if tests and grades and points are the most important things and that learning , like medicine , is good for you but not enjoyable .
Faculty may feel that students are so deeply conditioned to view learning negatively that resistance is futile , that we cannot hope to reverse it and must respond accordingly .
It is assumed that we have to teach in an authoritarian manner because of the way students are .
However , all the literature on student motivation has convinced me that the opposite is likely to be true : students act the way they do because we treat them the way we do .
An experiment
To test this , I abandoned the controlling syllabus .
I now go to the first class with only a tentative timeline of readings and writing assignments .
A few weeks into the semester , when students have a better sense of what kind of person I am and what the course is about , we discuss what might be the best way of assigning meaningful grades .
We collectively decide what goes into a good paper or talk , what good participation means , and together create rubrics to assess them .
While I make the judgments about performance , I give the students maximum flexibility and choice in what we do and how we do it — within the broad constraint that the course has to have integrity and coherence and that the grades have to be good measures of the level of student performance in the course .
I have done this for four years now , and it has been a wonderful experience .
It is what I thought teaching should be like when I entered the profession .
What is interesting is that the more I delegate decision making about course structure and rules to the students , the more discretion and leeway they give me to make judgments about their performance .
For example , they consistently reject creating detailed marking schemes for things like participation ( of the kind found on authoritarian syllabi ) , saying that they trust me to make a fair holistic judgment .
Faculty are often skeptical when I tell them about my experiment .
They are quick to claim that it would not work for them because their particular situation is special : their students are different , their subject is different , their institution is different , and so on .
No empirical justification is ever provided for these objections , and I suspect that they are grasped at because we have become deeply conditioned to think of the controlling syllabus as the only way to do things and are nervous about giving it up .
Completely abandoning a syllabus may not be possible for everyone .
What replaces the controlling syllabus will undoubtedly depend on the subject matter , size of the class , nature of the institution , and the like , and there can be no universally prescriptive solutions .
What should be universal , however , is the goal of moving away from an authoritarian classroom .
In doing so , we need to be mindful that students have become accustomed to the controlling syllabus .
Taking it away suddenly can disconcert them unless they are reassured that they can trust us , that our assessments measure important learning , that we have the competence to make judgments about their performance and meaningful criteria for doing so , and that we have the impartiality to be honest and fair .
Accordingly , I spend a great deal of time and effort building such trust and creating a sense of community in the classroom among the students and between them and me .
This is a harder but more pleasant task than creating a watertight syllabus , but it results in a much more rewarding experience for both the students and the teacher .
College faculty are fortunate in that we still have some level of autonomy in teaching .
We should use that freedom to show our students how wonderfully rewarding true learning can be .
Aristotle said that “ all men by nature desire to know , ” but we seem to assume that today ’s students do not want to learn and have to be bludgeoned into doing so .
The club we teachers use is the controlling syllabus .
It is time to throw it away .

But one had to imagine that Billy Mays , the booming TV infomercial pitchman , would have appreciated the YouTube comment that , despite its misspellings , merged a farewell with yet another testimonial for one of his many miracle products :
“ My Best Friend ’s house caught on fire the cloths were brown from the smoke , we soaked them overnight in [ OxiClean ] and they came out smelling fresh and clean , ” wrote the poster , jamiedeanb , one of dozens who offered their condolences on the site .
“ Rest In Peace MR. Mayes . ”
Mays , 50 , the emphatic and well - known hawker of the OxiClean stain remover , the Zorbeez super chamois , a sticky substance called Mighty Putty and many other items offered for an amazing low price , was found unresponsive in his Tampa , Fla. , home Sunday morning .
He was declared dead by a fire rescue crew at 7:45 a.m. , according to Sgt. Christopher Ugles , a spokesman for the Tampa Police Department .
The cause of his death was unknown , but Mays had told his wife , Deborah , that he did n’t feel well after a U.S. Airways flight he was on made a bumpy landing Saturday afternoon .
In an interview with a local TV station , Mays said he was struck on the head by a falling object during the landing .
“ All of a sudden as we hit , you know it was just the hardest hit , all the things from the ceiling started dropping , ” the Associated Press said Mays told MyFox Tampa Bay .
“ It hit me on the head , but I got a hard head . ”
The airline confirmed that Mays was on the flight .
The results of an autopsy are expected today or Tuesday , Ugles said .
Mays ’ surprising death came as he was enjoying an unlikely degree of fame and fortune as a practitioner of “ direct - response advertising , ” the infomercial - style spots that drive a $ 150 - billion industry .
He and his sometimes - collaborator , Anthony Sullivan , have racked up more than $ 1 billion in combined sales , according to Fortune magazine .
In April , the Discovery Channel began airing “ Pitchmen , ” a reality TV show based on their exploits .
“ I hate to say it , but the king is dead , ” Sullivan said in a statement Sunday . " . . .
I ’ll always remember his booming voice -- him saying , ‘ Hi , Billy Mays here ! ’
He was the best friend a man could wish for .
He was much more than people knew . ”
Mays was not known so much as an innovator ; TV infomercials have been around for decades , and other small - screen pitchmen , like Ron “ Ronco ” Popeil , have become quasi - household names .
But in a broader advertising culture that regularly deploys irony and subtlety to ward off the whiff of cheesiness , Mays proved the enduring power of the hard sell .
It was a universe where cleanup was always a breeze , where it was important to call right now , and where $ 20 values seemed to always be included free .
It was an old - fashioned style that prompted wags on the Internet to poke good - natured fun at Mays with countless video parodies that served to exponentially increase his stature .
They dubbed his ads with absurdist dialogue , created gangster - rap remixes of his voice and dressed themselves up to emulate his impossibly dark hair and beard -- a signature style that made him resemble a bear that had fallen into a vat of Just For Men .
Eventually , however , Mays cheekily exploited the phenomenon , starring in his own clever , self - parodying spots -- one for a snowboard made by the hip DC Shoes brand and another for ESPN360.com .
“ The secret is in the Internet connection ! ” Mays shouts in the ad for the ESPN website , with the same earnest delivery he ’d used to explain the technology of the Samurai Shark knife sharpener and the Bay City Slider Station burger machine .
The pitchman - as - entertainer role is one with deep roots in American history and culture .
In the 19th century , patent - medicine men often used Wild West shows , bands and pie-eating contests to draw attention to their nostrums .
Often , of course , their pitch was more effective than their product .
But Mays -- who marketed but never invented his products -- always insisted that they were good ones , and he credited that quality control for his enduring popularity .
“ You do n’t stay in this business as long as I have unless the products work , ” he told the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette in April .
“ When I say ‘ Billy Mays here for Mighty Putty , ’ all I have is my name and the trust of the audience .
I would never let the consumer down . ”
William D. “ Billy ” Mays was born in McKees Rocks , Pa. , near Pittsburgh , on July 20 , 1958 .
After graduating from high school , he played some semiprofessional football but found his calling just before his 24th birthday , when he followed a Ginsu knife salesman to the Atlantic City boardwalk .
There , he told the Post - Gazette , he learned from older pitchmen how to entrance a crowd and make a sale .
Later he met the owner of a cleaner called Orange Glo , who hired him to sell it on the Home Shopping Network in 1996 .
From then until his death , Mays talked up an ever - changing array of slicers , dicers , cleaners and cookers .
The only constant was his bearded visage , booming voice and trademark blue shirt .
With his Florida - based company , Mays Promotions Inc. , he entered into numerous marketing agreements with the makers of the world ’s next big gadgets .
He appeared on Jay Leno ’s and Conan O’Brien ’s talk shows and took to driving a Bentley .
In a sign of the times , Mays had also begun touting a discount health - insurance plan called iCan .
It was n’t always easy being king .
Recently , Mays ’ primacy as pitchman was challenged by Offer “ Vince ” Shlomi , a lupine , smart - alecky spokesman for the ShamWow , a rival chamois to Mays ’ Zorbeez product .
Shlomi ’s style was more knowing and sarcastic than Mays ’ , prompting Slate.com advertising reviewer Seth Stevenson to ponder whether he was a pitchman better suited to the times .
In February , Mays challenged Shlomi , perhaps half - jokingly , to a “ pitch - off ” over the two products .
A month later , Popular Mechanics magazine tested them and found the ShamWow to be more effective “ by a mile . ”
In addition to his wife , Mays is survived by a toddler daughter and a son , Billy Mays Jr. , who is in his 20s .
His mother lives in the Pittsburgh area , a Discovery Channel spokesperson said .
The taped season finale of “ Pitchmen ” is scheduled to run Wednesday night .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Cash for Clunkers Results Finally In : Taxpayers Paid $ 24,000 per Vehicle Sold , Reports Edmunds.com
SANTA MONICA , Calif . — October 28 , 2009 — Edmunds.com , the premier resource for online automotive information , has determined that Cash for Clunkers cost taxpayers $ 24,000 per vehicle sold .
Nearly 690,000 vehicles were sold during the Cash for Clunkers program , officially known as CARS , but Edmunds.com analysts calculated that only 125,000 of the sales were incremental .
The rest of the sales would have happened anyway , regardless of the existence of the program .
Ironically , the average transaction price for a new vehicle in August 2009 was only $ 26,915 minus an average cash rebate of $ 1,667 .
" This analysis is valuable for two reasons , " explained Edmunds.com CEO Jeremy Anwyl .
" First , it can form the basis for a complete assessment of the program 's impact and costs .
Second — and more important — it can help us to understand the true state of auto sales and the economy .
For example , October sales are up , but without Cash for Clunkers , sales would have been even better .
This suggests that the industry 's recovery is gaining momentum . "
The chart below sets forth actual SAAR ( Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate ) compared to Edmunds.com 's forecasted rate if the program had never been implemented .
Actual ( or Forecast ) If no Cash for Clunkers Difference Sales Volume Jan '09 9.59 9.59 n/a 654,922 Feb '09 9.14 9.14 n/a 687,182 Mar '09 9.69 9.69 n/a 855,146 April '09 9.20 9.20 n/a 817,096 May '09 9.85 9.85 n/a 923,141 Jun '09 9.67 9.80 - 0.13 857,447 Jul '09 11.22 10.11 1.11 995,216 Aug '09 14.06 10.45 3.61 1,258,747 Sep '09 9.19 10.63 - 1.44 744,367 Oct '09 10.40 10.89 - 0.49 n/a Nov '09 10.40 10.82 - 0.42 n/a Dec '09 10.61 10.85 - 0.24 n/

" Our research indicates that without the Cash for Clunkers program , many customers would not have traded in an old vehicle when making a new purchase , " Edmunds.com Senior Analyst David Tompkins , PhD told AutoObserver.com .
" That may give some credence to the environmental claims , but unfortunately the economic claims have been rendered quite weak . "
To conduct the analysis , the Edmunds.com team of PhDs and statisticians examined the sales trend for luxury vehicles and others not included in Cash for Clunkers , and applied the historic relationship of those vehicles to total SAAR to make informed estimates .
These estimates were independently verified through careful examination of sales patterns reflected by transaction data .
Once the numbers were determined , Edmunds.com 's analysts divided three billion dollars by 125,000 vehicles to arrive at the average $ 24,000 per vehicle .
Coincidentally , a parallel analysis of the first - time homebuyer credit was reported yesterday by MIT Sloan Professor Simon Johnson and Yale law student James Kwak , who both blog about economics at The BaseLine Scenario .

If a band wanted to make a song and accompanying video that makes Brokencyde look as banal as a Mark Ronson cover of Paulo Nutini , then Ohio's Attack Attack !
have certainly succeeded with their single , Stick Stickly .
Their boyband screamo - eurodance blend comes across like a cross between Enter Shikari and the Vengaboys .
Certainly , their amalgam of Auto - Tuned emo vocals , synchronised headbanging , puzzlingly bad miming , haircuts that would cause even Josh from the Horrors to raise an eyebrow and chart - trance interludes is one of the most baffling things I have seen in music in a long time .
Even the wistful blonde girl in the band 's Evanescence - go - rural - in - the - midwest video loses her cool near the end and has to cover her ears .
If you 've already stumbled across Attack Attack ! , you 've probably gone through several cycles .
You begin by hating everything about them .
Then you cackle in disbelief , and finally you grow to love them ( ironically ) .
I 've already gone through three - and - a - half cycles just while writing this .
To accompany their , er , unique sound and live aesthetic , Attack Attack !
have their very own genre name : crabcore .
But , unlike all the other genres covered in this column , crabcore is n't defined by sonics or BPMs or lyrical content , or tied to a geographic location .
Crabcore is defined by the body contortions of the band 's guitarists when they perform .
This is the lolloping crab - like stance adopted while a guitar player shreds , and it's not dissimilar to a sumo wrestler having extreme muscle spasms while readying themselves to engage with an opponent .
So is this whole thing just kids having fun or a carefully planned ploy to gain as much attention as possible by offending as many people as they can ?
If you listen to Attack Attack !'s earlier material , you 'll notice it is decidedly less ridiculous .
Their song Stick Stickly is well over a year old , and they have another accompanying video that is a lot less , er , intense .
But if you look at their video tour diaries , you 'll notice they are soundtracked by stuff like Basshunter , so maybe they just have very , very poor taste .
Regardless of what you think , there is already a Last . fm crabcore group , with fans planning to start their own bands .
Stick Stickly , it seems , is only the beginning .

James Bond Fan Hub
Check out our 007 - themed fan hub as we look back at all the James Bond films , from Connery to Craig , and more .
Für blinde und sehbehinderte Menschen ist das Internet eine wichtige Informationsquelle .
Mithilfe von Screenreader , Sprachausgabe und Braillezeile ist das Surfen möglich .
Aber auch die Webseiten müssen einige Voraussetzungen mitbringen .
Das Stichwort hierfür ist Barrierefreiheit .
Wie sieht es in Sachen Zugänglichkeit bei den Kampagnen - Seiten der Parteien aus ?
Auch blinde und sehbehinderte Menschen möchten sich vor der Bundestagswahl über Personen , Programme und Themen informieren .
Ist das möglich ?
Haben die Parteien an behinderte Bürger gedacht ?
Zusammen mit dem Accessibility - Experten Thomas Mayer habe ich die Startseiten der Parteien getestet .
CDU
CDU .de kommt sehr unübersichtlich daher .
Es gibt keine Überschriften , die der Screenreader erkennen und anspringen kann .
Ich muss mir die Seite komplett vorlesen lassen , weil ich auch keine Navigationsliste finde .
Mich interessiert ein Video : „ Eine Antwort auf die Angriffe der SPD “ .
Ich kann es nicht anklicken .
Bei dem Kampagnen - Portal der CDU wurde offensichtlich nicht an Barrierefreiheit gedacht .
Auffällig ist das Fehlen jeglicher HTML Strukturelemente .
Die Schriftgröße kann im Internet Explorer nicht individuell eingestellt werden – das wäre für sehbehinderte User aber eine große Hilfe .
Wichtige Inhalte , wie die Navigationsleiste in der rechten Spalte , sind als CSS - Hintergrundgrafiken angelegt .
Damit sind diese Links für Nutzer von Screenreadern unzugänglich .
Die Seite ist sehr Grafik - lastig , aber immerhin sind alle Bilder mit aussagekräftigen Alternativtexten versehen .
Fazit : Ungenügend .
SPD
Obwohl Parteien nicht gesetzlich zur Barrierefreiheit verpflichtet sind , erfüllt SPD .de viele Standards .
Es wird neben der Standard - Version eine barrierefreie Ansicht ohne Animationen und JavaScript - Spielereien angeboten .
Beide Versionen sind gut mit Überschriften und Listen strukturiert , alles lässt sich prima mit der Tastatur steuern und die Alternativtexte für Grafiken sind aussagekräftig .
Als einzige Partei bietet die SPD Sprunglinks an , die es Tastaturbenutzern ermöglichen , direkt zum I nhalt der Seite zu springen .
Fazit : Gut .
FDP
Auch FDP .de hat strukturierte Listen und Überschriften , die mein Screenreader erkennt .
Manche Grafiken und Überschriften bestehen für den blinden Leser aber nur aus Zahlen - Kolonnen .
Es gibt kleinere Probleme im Zusammenhang mit der Verwendung von Hintergrundgrafiken .
Als einzige Partei bietet die FDP einen Styleswitcher an , mit dem die Nutzer die Schriftgröße verändern können .
Fazit : Befriedigend .
Grüne
Gruene .de begrüßt mich mit einem Link „ Großbanken wie die Deutsche Bank müssen zu Transparenz gezwungen werden “ .
Ich erwarte aber als erstes eine übersichtliche Linkliste , so dass ich schnell die gewünschten Inhalte ansteuern kann .
Diese Liste erscheint auf meiner Braillezeile aber erst ganz unten .
Außerdem fehlen strukturierende Überschriften .
Es werden zahlreiche Banner und Animationen eingesetzt .
Bis auf einige Schaltflächen mit englischen Texten sind die Alternativtexte der Grafiken aussagekräftig .
Trotzdem sind grafische Banner problematisch : Sie funktionieren nur bei einem visuellen Zugang und lassen sich nicht an individuelle Anforderungen ( z.B. Schriftgröße oder Farbe ) anpassen – somit können sehbehinderte User die Seite kaum nutzen .
Weitere Probleme gibt es bei der Schriftvergrößerung .
Die Schrift lässt sich zwar vergrößern , aber schon bei geringer Vergrößerung werden Inhalte abgeschnitten und sind nicht mehr lesbar .
Auch bei den Grünen ist der Einsatz von Hintergrundgrafiken problematisch .
Einige Bereiche , wie „ Meine Kampagne “ oder der komplette Kopfbereich der Seite , sind dadurch unzugänglich .
Fazit : Mangelhaft .
Linke
Die -Linke.de erfüllt einige Standards der Barrierefreiheit : Überschriften und Listen sind so strukturiert , dass sie ein Navigieren vereinfachen .
Grafiken haben einen Alternativtext .
Die Linke verwendet für einige grafische Banner das HTML longdesc - Attribut .
Dadurch sagt mein Screenreader bei einer Grafik „ Drücken Sie Eingabe für lange Beschreibung “ .
Wenn ich das tue , kommt aber keine lange Beschreibung .
Das Attribut wird falsch eingesetzt .
Durch die Verwendung einer bestimmten JavaScript - Funktion in den Links der Navigation , ist das Angebot für Menschen , die keine Maus nutzen können und stattdessen mit der Tabulator - Taste durch eine Seite navigieren , im Internet Explorer praktisch nicht mehr nutzbar – somit schließt die Partei alle motorisch eingeschränkten User aus , die z .
B. durch eine Spastik keine Maus benutzen können .
Davon abgesehen gibt es noch Probleme mit der Schriftvergrößerung im Internet Explorer .
Einige Bereiche lassen sich nicht vergrößern .
Bis auf das Logo der Partei sind alle Grafiken mit Alternativtexten versehen .
Fazit : Mangelhaft .
Piraten
Piratenpartei.de kommt ohne Schnörkel daher .
Für blinde und sehbehinderte Nutzer ist das erfreulicher als die Grafik - und Animationslastigen Angebote anderer Parteien .
Anscheinend wird das Standard - Template des Content - Managment - Systems Drupal eingesetzt .
Das ist aber kein Nachteil .
Im Gegenteil , diese valide und gut strukturierte Vorlage ist eine gute Voraussetzung für eine barrierefreie Website .
Es gibt eine Navigation , Grafiken sind mit Alternativtext beschriftet .
Spezielle Optimierungen bezüglich der Barrierefreiheit sind aber nicht erkennbar .
Fazit : Befriedigend .
Zusammenfassung
Bis auf das Angebot der SPD hat jede Website größere und kleinere Probleme mit der Barrierefreiheit .
Nur bei der SPD ist erkennbar , dass das Thema Barrierefreiheit bei der Entwicklung berücksichtigt wurde .
Befriedigend sind die Auftritte der FDP und der Piratenpartei .
Diese Websites wurden nicht speziell auf Barrierefreiheit optimiert .
Sie profitieren aber von ihrer zeitgemäßen Umsetzung , die eine Grundversorgung in Sachen Barrierefreiheit sicherstellt .
Die Grünen haben vor allen Probleme mit der individuellen Anpassbarkeit ihrer Inhalte .
Die Linke disqualifiziert sich durch nur einen kleinen aber sehr schwerwiegenden Fehler .
Nicht akzeptabel ist das Angebot der CDU .

China is not the only emerging market that wants to lock up an energy supply .
India ’s Oil and Natural Gas Corporation is working on a bid for YPF , the Argentinian division of Spanish oil company Repsol that two of China 's oil companies are going after .
As we wrote earlier this week , China National Petroleum Corp. and Cnooc Ltd. are developing a $ 17 billion bid for YPF .
ONGC wants to mount a challenging bid , according to senior execs at the company who spoke with the FinancialTimes .
Repsol wants to unload its YPF business , but it 's playing coy , telling the FT , " Repsol wants to make it known that it has received various proposals from different companies , although none of them is firm . ”
India imports 70 % of its oil , and , presumably , would like to have some semblance of energy stability in the future .
This is n't an entirely VW post , but it seems related enough to toss up here .
Working with colleagues Nicole Martins of Indiana , Mia Consalvo of Ohio ( and TN ) and Jimmy Ivory of VaTech , we embarked a couple of years back on a content analysis of all game characters .
It was kind of ambitious , but we thought someone ought to take a census of who is in all the worlds and games we study .
We do a lot of research on effects and identity , but until you know what 's there , well , it 's hard to say a lot .
The results are in and in print , available from the journal New Media & Society , or in a pre-press version off my site .
The highlights are that whites , males and adults are over - represented compared to the actual US population via US Census data , while females , Hispanics , Native Americans , children and the elderly are under - represented .
These numbers parallel similar research for TV .
Breaking the findings down into primary ( playable ) and secondary ( NPC ) characters , the divides are stronger still .

ASM is an all purpose Java bytecode manipulation and analysis framework .
It can be used to modify existing classes or to dynamically generate classes , directly in binary form .
ASM provides some common bytecode transformations and analysis algorithms from which custom complex transformations and code analysis tools can be built .
ASM offers similar functionality as other Java bytecode frameworks , but is focused on performance .
Because it was designed and implemented to be as small and as fast as possible , it is well suited for use in dynamic systems ( but can of course be used in a static way too , e.g. in compilers ) .
ASM is used in many projects , including :

Different ways of seeing stats
Who would have thought cinema popcorn sales could tell us much about the economy ?
Yet sales of the snack could be just one unlikely indicator of economic fortune , says Michael Blastland .
How do you measure a green shoot ?
From the tub , if you are Norman Lamont , a former Chancellor of the Exchequer , who famously coined the phrase " green shoots " , while detecting recovery from the last recession ( accurately , as it turned out , despite media ridicule ) and also gave us " singing in the bath " as a measure of his own equanimity under pressure .
But first , you have to know what constitutes a green shoot .
What small , seemingly insignificant sign now reveals our destination in the near future ?
SUGGEST A NEW INDEX Popcorn sales , numbers of cranes and junk mail are just some of the things which might indicate economic activity Suggest something to measure below
This week we 'll feature some of the best , and keep tabs on them Send suggestions here No , not the horoscope .
If you want anything passably rigorous , it requires measurement .
So take up your ruler , go forth and measure .
" What exactly am I supposed to measure ? " you ask .
Good question .
Sometimes it seems as if half of economics is little more than a quest for a better index .
This continues despite decades of failure .
Part of the difficulty is that different green shoots indicate different kinds of improvement .
Some are suggestive of all the things we make and sell , some of trade , others of recovery in the housing market .
Any can occur without the others .
If I were to reveal , for example , that the height of Alistair Darling 's eyebrows changes in precise proportion to GDP growth six months later , it would be an economic breakthrough of cosmic proportions .
If there really were such a simple and reliable indicator of future economic conditions , predicting the recession would have been easy , betting on the economy via the stock market would wither and we 'd probably see an eyebrow derivatives market .
My Nobel prize would be in the bag .
It is n't .
But that 's not to discredit out of hand unconventional ways of spotting green shoots .
There 's fun to be had in identifying unlikely bell - wethers of recovery - which is why we want you to suggest your own - the best of which , we will measure .
Here to set you thinking are some less - than - standard measures of green shoots and turning points suggested in recent weeks , and a few that are more orthodox .
The crane index .
How many cranes are visible from a given point .
Really a measure of optimism about the prospects for commercial property .
The number of people signing up to dating agencies offering extra-marital affairs , on the basis that demand goes up either in times of excessive confidence - " I wo n't get caught " ; or depression - " I do n't care " .
( Sex had to figure somewhere . )
The Dry Baltic Index .
A measure of demand for shipping .
Since it takes two years to build a container ship , freight capacity is inflexible , so small changes in demand can cause marked changes in price .
The Popcorn Index .
Sales of popcorn at the cinema are , it was suggested in a newspaper recently , a sensitive barometer of consumer behaviour .
The baked bean index - my colleague Anthony Reuben noted in the spring how the value of sales of baked beans - a classic recession food - had risen 21.6 % in April compared with the same month last year .
Could a reverse signal the start of a recovery ?
And here are a few others , the result of our own in - depth - two minute - musing over a cup of tea .
The junk - mail index .
How many items per week hit the mat ?
The number - of - property - shows - on - telly index .
On the basis that there 's a link between confidence and risk - taking , a speeding index , also because people are in a greater hurry when there 's business to be done .
A niceness index .
When things are going well , are people friendlier ?
But how would you measure it ?
Over to you .
Send your suggestions for useful , and , crucially , measurable , indexes of recovery using the form at the bottom of this story .
Finally for the curious , some leading indicators - to use the techie term - do seem to perform reasonably well , though less usefully than might first appear .
This one , for example , from the OECD , shows how a composite of leading indicators - the red line - often move about six months before another measure of real economic activity .
Not perfect , but not bad .
Incidentally , the latest OECD CLI for the UK only has been going up for a few months now .
One problem is that there are sometimes false - start turning - points in the leading indicators which turn out to go nowhere .
We can see them afterwards , but at the time how do we know if the latest turning point is really a turning point or if it will , as sometimes happens , wobble a bit then go back the other way ?
We often need time to confirm that a trend is real , and time , of course , is what a leading indicator is supposed to beat .
The leading indicators the OECD uses for the UK include new car registrations , the Confederation of British Industry 's business climate survey , a measure of the stocks of finished goods and a measure of consumer confidence , all weighted , added together and compared to an estimation of the trend .
You can find out how it 's done , in all its bulky complexity , here This is your chance to become amateur economic forecaster .
Suggest something that is observable in every day life which might conceivably be an indication of green shoots .
The Magazine will discuss some of the best this week and keep tabs on them .
Number of packed lunches in the office fridge .
It 's certainly gone up in recent months , however it appears to probably drag behind rather than being an early indicator .

How about the ' chugger ' index ?
Measuring the amount of people who give money to those annoying people with vests in town centres asking for money for charity .
Surely there 's a link between economic growth , disposable income and donating to charity .

Try the " Peak Shoulder " index .
This is based on the number of people travelling on trains AFTER the peak hour ( arriving London 09:00 - 10:00 ) and BEFORE the cheap day returns are available ( arriving London usually after 10:30 , depending on origin ) .
These Peak Shoulder trains are used by people who do n't have to be at their desk by 09:00 every day , so they are coming into town to attend meetings etc 10:00 where ideas ( hopefully ) will be generated .
The more of these there are travelling , the more things are moving .
Simon Jeffs , Eastbourne Number of free items given away as part of marketing promotions outside London train stations in the mornings .
This has noticeably decreased over the last year ; it would be interesting to see if more free stuff is given away as confidence and consumer spending increases .
Neil Marshall , Sutton , UK
My wife and I have noticed something that certainly ( while not scientific ) indicates people 's view on their own financial situation - loose change on pavements .
Until last September you would always find coins on the pavement , typically 1 p and 5 p coins but sometimes as much £ 2 - no matter what the season .
Once the headlines were full of the credit crunch , we never saw any change on the pavement .
However , starting in late April , lost coins again starting to appear on London 's streets and in the last month it appears we are back to pre-credit crunch levels .
Either people were afraid of their financial situation and more careful with their change or they spent less and so had fewer opportunities to lose any coins .
Michael , London
How about reconditioned bricks ?
Not sure if that 's the right name but sales of bricks that have came from demolished buildings , this could be used to measure the supply ( showing how many buildings are being torn down to make way for new developments ) and the sale ( showing how many people are putting extensions on houses , possibly indicating the ability to gain credit , increased value of houses etc ... ) .
You would probably expect the ratio of supply : demand to be around 1:1 if this indicator does work .
Richard , London , England
The ratio of sun tan lotion to fake tan - sunshine getaway , staycation , or no holiday at all ?

New adverts on telly and not all the re-runs tend to indicate the money is available there to produce the ads and encourage more spending .
Andi , Stoke Maybe count people eating ice cream on a Saturday afternoon ?
Ice cream for a family can be expensive , and is one for the things that gets cut down upon in a recession .
By the by , no good just counting cranes , you need to count how many of them are actually moving and doing work .
Rosemarie Tomes , Mansfield Number of skips on any given road - more skips = more people spending their savings on housework .

My indicator is whether there are seats available on the bus in the morning .
Before the recession , the bus was always full , sometimes not even standing room .
But now there are seats available .
I 'll know there 's green shoots when all seats are taken by the time it gets to my stop .
Helen S , London Gym memberships taken and gym use .
In time of downturn people are more likely to cancel unwanted memberships .
Meanwhile those that actually have a membership probably use it less when they are busy , in a time of economic upturn for example .
Kate , London A " number of empty advertisement spaces in bus stops " index
Hugh , Aberdeen Car Wash Index -

The number of job ads in professional journals .
My made - redundant - in - February husband has been scanning the jobs in his weekly professional journal .
From a grand total of zero jobs for many weeks now , the past few weeks have seen at least one job a week for the whole country .
At this rate he may be re-employed by the next decade
Aqua Suliser , Aqua Sulis The White Goods Delivery Index based on the lead time in ordering and having delivered any large electrical item .
The theory is based on a twofold principle , That if the goods are in stock the demand for purchase is low and so it follows that if a store can deliver in 2 days then there delivery system is in surplus again indicating low demand .
When you have a 5 day wait for Delivery to the store and a further 5 days for physical delivery this will be the turning point in the recovery , as firms such as warehouses and delivery van companies will start to employ to cover increased business .
London Banker
The sick on the street index ?
More people going out the night before spending more money on drink , means more sick on the street the morning after .
Joe , Slough Carrier bags photographed in a given area within shopping mall .
Susie I reckon a useful way of judging the economy 's return is by charting the column inches of positive news stories versus the column inches of negative news stories .
That is , speculation causes negative stories which cause worsening public feeling , deepening the recession .
Positive news stories create happiness , stimulating public opinion and increasing economic growth .
Just keep talking about the nice things and people will feel better which will in turn make contribute to the economy without even knowing it .

How about ' length of hair ' ?
Getting your hair cut ( men 's and women 's ) can be expensive , could be considered a ' luxury ' and so may have been cut back on ( ahem ) , yielding , on average , longer hair .
Might need to be " seasonally adjusted " and might be influenced by people , like me in fact , swapping a trip to the barber for a set of clippers and trust in your wife to do it .

Has anyone actually done a statistical analysis of the popcorn-v-FTSE data or have they just been plotted on an axis and seen to look kind of the same ?
For example , if you look at the 21 weeks represented on the graph , you 'll see that there are only actually twelve where the popcorn index and the FTSE move in the same direction .
( I 'm including the first week of June , where the FTSE was flat but popcorn fell , but not the last week of June , which I think shows a very slight decrease in the FTSE but an obvious rise in popcorn ) .
In other words , if I tell you whether popcorn is up or down and ask you to tell me whether the FTSE is up of down for that week , you 'll only be right half the time -- exactly what you 'd get from tossing a coin !
Further , this does n't seem to offer a * prediction * .
The rise in popcorn in week 3 is a week behind the rise in the FTSE in week 2 ; popcorn continues to fall in week 11 , when the FTSE has already started to recover ; popcorn falls in week 20 , again lagging the FTSE by a week .
If anything , eyeballing the graph suggests that this week 's FTSE performance predicts next week 's popcorn sales .
But who , outside the catering industry , cares about predicting demand for popcorn ?
To use your eyebrow analogy , this seems to be saying that I can predict * last week 's * FTSE movements by measuring the height of the Chancellor 's eyebrows .
But I can get a much more reliable prediction ( perhaps one should say " postdiction " ) by just looking at the published market data .
David Richerby , Leeds , UK I live near a freight train line into London , I can tell you right now that shipping activity has increased recently .

Health Secretary Andy Burnham has accused a Tory MEP who attacked the NHS on American TV of being " unpatriotic " .
Labour has stepped up its criticism of Daniel Hannan , who waded into the debate over Barack Obama 's health bill .
They claim his view - that the NHS is outdated , unfair and should be scrapped - is shared by many Conservatives .
But David Cameron said Mr Hannan 's view was " eccentric " and accused Labour of making a meal of the row , stressing that the NHS was his top priority .
Mr Hannan has made a series of appearances on American television in recent weeks , describing the NHS as " 60 year mistake " and saying that he " would n't wish it on anyone " .
' Ring - fenced funding '
He has stressed that these are his own views and not those of the party - but they were backed by fellow Tory MEP Roger Helmer , who told BBC Radio 4's PM programme : " I think Dan has done us a service by raising these issues which need to be looked at .
The Conservative Party stands four square behind the NHS
Conservative leader David Cameron
Analysis : A healthy debate ?
" If 80 % of Americans are getting better health care than we are in the UK then we ought to ask why , and we ought to ask how are we going to deliver equally good results . "
Tory leader David Cameron , who has vowed to protect health from spending cuts if he comes to power , has been at pains to stress his commitment to the NHS and distance himself from Mr Hannan .
" The Conservative Party stands four square behind the NHS , " he told BBC News .
" We are the party of the NHS , we back it , we are going to expand it , we have ring - fenced it and said that it will get more money under a Conservative government , and it is our number one mission to improve it . "
And he rebuked Mr Hannan , saying : " He does have some quite eccentric views about some things , and political parties always include some people who do n't toe the party line on one issue or another issue . "
' Unpatriotic '
The Leader of the Conservative group in the European Parliament , Timothy Kirkhope told the BBC he believes Mr Hannan should be disciplined for his comments about the NHS and said he would be given a " stern talking to " by the party 's chief whip Brussels .
Healthcare around the world But Mr Hannan 's words have been seized on by Labour and the Liberal Democrats who have questioned the party 's commitment to the NHS .
Health Secretary Andy Burnham said : " What has happened within the last 48 hours is what Cameron has feared most because it lays bare the Tories ' deep ambivalence towards the NHS . "
And he hit back at criticism that the government had not done enough to defend the NHS from attacks in the US , saying : " We will stand up for the NHS and we will make sure that it is properly represented in the international media .
And that is why what Mr Hannan has done disappoints me so much .
" I would almost feel ... it is unpatriotic because he is talking in foreign media and not representing , in my view , the views of the vast majority of British people and actually , I think giving an unfair impression of the National Health Service himself , a British representative on foreign media . "
' Duped '
He said Mr Hannan 's words were an " insult " to the 1.4 m NHS workers and " he should not be voicing those views in the foreign media in my view " .
Former deputy prime minister John Prescott has recorded a video message to the American people accusing Mr Hannan of " misrepresentation of the NHS here in Britain " .

Earlier this week , Prime Minister Gordon Brown took the unusual step of adding his voices to the welovetheNHS Twitter campaign , set up defend the health service from US attacks .
In a message posted from Downing Street 's Twitter feed , the PM said " thanks for always being there " .
His wife Sarah , also sent a message of support to the campaign .
US critics of the NHS claim it is an example of an overly - bureaucratic system which rations care and denies treatment to the elderly .
But campaign groups and right wing pundits have also attacked it as " socialist " , with one TV debate even discussing whether it was a breeding ground for terrorism .
One British woman said she felt " duped " after becoming the unwitting star of an anti-Obama health campaign .

More from PM Kate Spall , who appeared in a US free market group 's TV commercial opposing Mr Obama 's health bill , said her views were misrepresented .
She told BBC Radio 4's The World at One : " " Absolutely I was deceived yes because when I then found out the link to the website and it was a huge political machine I was horrified because it was the polar opposite of what I believe in .
I absolutely believe in universal health care . "

I recently wrote an article for a community newspaper attempting to explain to scientifically naive readers why testimonial “ evidence ” is unreliable ; unfortunately , they decided not to print it .
I considered using it here , but I thought it was too elementary for this audience .
I have changed my mind and I am offering it below ( with apologies to the majority of our readers ) , because it seems a few of our readers still do n’t “ get ” why we have to use rigorous science to evaluate claims .
People can be fooled , folks .
All people .
That includes me and it includes you .

The first principle is that you must not fool yourself–and you are the easiest person to fool .
Science is the only way to correct for our errors of perception and of attribution .
It is the only way to make sure we are not fooling ourselves .
Either Science - Based Medicine has not done a good job of explaining these vital facts , or some of our readers are unable or unwilling to understand our explanations .
Our commenters still frequently offer testimonials about how some CAM method “ really worked for me . ”
They fail to understand that they have no basis for claiming that it “ worked . ”
All they can really claim is that they observed an improvement following the treatment .
That could indicate a real effect or it could indicate an inaccurate observation or it could indicate a post hoc ergo propter hoc error , a false assumption that temporal correlation meant causation .
Such observations are only a starting point : we need to do science to find out what the observations mean .
Last week one of our commenters wrote the worst testimonial yet :
I have witnessed first hand the life that begins to flow through the body upon the removal of a subluxation .
What does this even mean ?
Does he expect anyone to believe this just because he says it ?
Would he believe me if I said I had witnessed first hand the invisible dragon in Carl Sagan ’s garage ?
Another commenter wrote
Those pro SBM commenters here seem to think that even if they see something with their own eyes that they can’t believe it if there are no double blinded officially published studies to prove that what they saw actually happened .
Well , yes , that ’s pretty much what we do think ; and we are appalled that you do n’t understand it yet , since it ’s the whole reason we have to do science .
I would phrase it a bit differently : “ Seeing something with my own eyes does n’t prove it ’s true and it does n’t preclude the necessity for scientific testing . ”
We ca n’t believe our own eyes .
The very process of vision itself is an interpretive construct by the brain .
There are two blind spots in our field of vision and we are n’t even aware of them .
I saw a magician cut a woman in half on stage – that was an illusion , a false perception .
I saw a patient get better after a treatment – my interpretation that the treatment caused the improvement may have been a mistake , a false attribution .
So for those who still do n’t get it , here ’s my simplistic article :

Sometimes We Get It Wrong
How can you know whether a medical treatment really works ?
If everybody says it works , and it worked for your Aunt Sally , and you try it and your symptoms go away , you can pretty well assume it really works .
Right ?
No , you ca n’t make that assumption , because sometimes we get it wrong .
For many centuries doctors used leeches and lancets to relieve patients of their blood .
They KNEW bloodletting worked .
Everybody said it did .
When you had a fever and the doctor bled you , you got better .
Everyone knew of a friend or relative who had been at death ’s door until bloodletting cured him .
Doctors could recount thousands of successful cases .
All those people got it wrong .
When George Washington got a bad throat infection , his doctors removed so much of his blood that his weakened body could n’t recover , and he died .
We finally got around to testing bloodletting and found out it did much more harm than good .
Patients who got well had been getting well IN SPITE of bloodletting , not because of it .
And some patients had died unnecessarily , like George Washington .
Even modern doctors sometimes get it wrong .
Not long ago , doctors used to do an operation for heart disease where they opened the chest and tied off chest wall arteries to divert more blood flow to the heart .
They had an impressive 90 % success rate .
A smart doctor named Leonard Cobb wanted to make sure , so he did an experiment where he just made the incision in the chest and closed it back up without actually doing anything .
He discovered that just as many patients improved after the fake surgery !
Doctors stopped doing that operation .
How could so many people be so wrong ?
How could they believe something had helped them when it actually had done them more harm than good ?
There are a whole lot of reasons people can come to believe an ineffective treatment works .
The disease may have run its natural course .
A lot of diseases are self - limiting ; the body ’s natural healing processes restore people to health after a time .
A cold usually goes away in a week or so .
To find out if a cold remedy works , you have to keep records of successes and failures for a large enough number of patients to find out if they really get well faster with the remedy than without it .
Many diseases are cyclical .
The symptoms of any disease fluctuate over time .
We all know people with arthritis have bad days and good days .
The pain gets worse for a while , then it gets better for a while .
If you use a remedy when the pain is bad , it was probably about to start getting better anyway , so the remedy gets credit it does n’t deserve .
We are all suggestible .
If we ’re told something is going to hurt , it ’s more likely to hurt .
If we ’re told something is going to make it better , it probably will .
We all know this : that ’s why we kiss our children ’s scrapes and bruises .
Anything that distracts us from thinking about our symptoms is likely to help .
In scientific studies that compare a real treatment to a placebo sugar pill , an average of 35 % of people say they feel better after taking the sugar pill .
The real treatment has to do better than that if we ’re going to believe it ’s really effective .
There may have been two treatments and the wrong one got the credit .
If your doctor gave you a pill and you also took a home remedy , you may give the credit to the home remedy .
Or maybe something else changed in your life at the same time that helped treat the illness and that was the real reason you got better .
The original diagnosis or prognosis may have been incorrect .
Lots of people have supposedly been cured of cancer who never actually had cancer .
Doctors who tell a patient he only has 6 months to live are only guessing and can guess wrong .
The best they can do is say the average patient with that condition lives 6 months – but average means half of people live longer than that .
Temporary mood improvement can be confused with cure .
If a practitioner makes you feel optimistic and hopeful , you may think you feel better when the disease is really unchanged .
Psychological needs can affect our behavior and our perceptions .
When someone wants to believe badly enough , he can convince himself he has been helped .
People have been known to deny the facts – to refuse to see that the tumor is still getting bigger .
If they have invested time and money , they do n’t want to admit it was wasted .
We see what we want to see ; we remember things the way we wish they had happened .
When a doctor is sincerely trying to help a patient , the patient feels a sort of social obligation to please the doctor by improving .
We confuse correlation with causation .
Just because an effect follows an action , that does n’t necessarily mean the action caused the effect .
When the rooster crows and then the sun comes up , we realize it ’s not the crowing that made the sun come up .
But when we take a pill and then we feel better , we assume it was the pill that made us feel better .
We do n’t stop to think that we might have felt better for some other reason .
We jump to conclusions like the man who trained a flea to dance when it heard music , then cut the flea ’s legs off one by one until it could no longer dance and concluded that the flea ’s organ of hearing must be in its legs !
So there are lots of ways we can get it wrong .
Luckily , there ’s a way we can eventually get it right : by scientific testing .
There ’s nothing mysterious or complicated about science : it ’s just a toolkit of common sense ways to test things .
If you believe you ’ve lost weight and you step on the scale to test your belief , that ’s science .
If you think you have a better way to grow carrots and you test your idea by planting two rows side by side , one with the old method and one with the new method , and see which row produces better carrots , that ’s science .
To test medicines , we can sort a large number of patients into two equal groups and give one group the treatment we ’re testing and give the other group an inert placebo , like a sugar pill .
If the group that got the active treatment does significantly better , the treatment probably really works .
Jacqueline Jones was a 50 year old woman who had suffered from asthma since the age of 2 .
She read about a miraculous herbal treatment that cured a host of ailments including asthma .
She assumed the information was true , because it included lots of testimonials of people who had used it and were able to stop taking their asthma medications .
They KNEW it worked .
They had SEEN it work .
Sick of the side - effects of conventional drugs , Jacqueline stopped using her three inhalers , steroids and nebulizer , and took the herbal supplement instead .
Within two days she was in the hospital .
I had a massive asthma attack .
I was seriously ill in hospital for six weeks , during which I developed pleurisy .
I could n’t breathe and my lungs were so sensitive that even touching the area on the outside felt like someone was kicking me .
All those people who said that herbal remedy had cured their asthma got it wrong .
Asthma symptoms fluctuate .
Maybe their symptoms would have improved anyway .
Whatever the reason , the remedy had not been tested scientifically and it was not effective for treating asthma , and believing those testimonials almost cost Jacqueline her life .
The next time a friend enthusiastically recommends a new treatment , stop and remember that they could be wrong .
Remember Jacqueline Jones .
Remember George Washington .
Sometimes we get it wrong .
Herbert Rusche , the co-founder of the German Green Party and former member of the German Parliament , has joined the Pirate Party .
Rusche praises the party for its open structure and its efforts to protect people ’s privacy and fundamental rights .
Those issues , he says , are the ones established parties fail to address .
Just weeks after the Swedish Pirate Party entered the European Parliament , the German Pirate Party unexpectedly gained a seat in the German government when Jörg Tauss left the Social Democrats Party ( SPD ) to join the Pirate Party .
The ambitions of the Pirates do n’t stop there though , as they are currently preparing for a successful run in the upcoming elections .
With Herbert Rusche , the Pirates add another experienced politician to their team .
Nicole Hornung of the Pirate Party says he is pleased with gaining such a prominent new pirate : “ Herbert ’s long political experience is invaluable for us .
In addition , he has already helped to develop a group of dedicated young people in the direction of governing a party . ”
Indeed , Rusche has plenty of experience .
He is one of the co-founders of Germany ’s Green party for which he served as a Member of Parliament for several years .
This fall , the Pirate Party hopes to do well in the German federal election so they can do something about the increased censorship of the Internet and abuses of copyright .
The party is further committed to increase transparency and strengthen the fundamental rights and protection of privacy .
According to Rusche the Pirate Party can do a lot of good work for the German people by addressing these issues .
“ The established parties fail completely , for many people these issues are of paramount importance , ” Rusche concludes .
New York University Law School has hired a new Human Rights professor .
Dr. Li-ann
Thio , a professor at the National University of Singapore , will be teaching two courses during the Fall 2009 semester as a Global Visiting Professor of Law at NYU .
This professor has been outspoken against gay rights in Singapore .
She argued before the parliament to keep statute 377A which criminalizes homosexual sex .
She made outrageous claims such as " diversity is not a license for perversity " and " anal sex is like shoving a straw up your nose to drink " .
Dr. Li-Ann
Thio calls " homosexuality a gender identity disorder " and a " moral wrong that can not be compared to a human right . "
She supported a 15,000 dollar fine against a television station that portrayed a gay family and a child .
Students , LGBT and human rights activists are outraged at NYU 's decision to bring in this controversial and homophobic woman .
She is scheduled to teach two classes : Human Rights in Asia and Constitutionalism in Asia .
The classes are in jeopardy of being canceled since many students refuse to sign up .
Please sign the petition in opposition to Dr. Thio Li-Ann teaching at NYU .

If there were a prize for the most boneheaded thing that one hears very frequently , it would have to be the astonishment and revulsion that is commonly expressed at the existence of discrimination .
You are likely to have heard this horrified expression before : " It 's discrimination ! " Heavens above !
Alert the authorities !
Quite often , this tiny statement , without any elaboration or explanation , is enough to provoke looks of shock or revulsion from others , or at the very least , solemn looks of concurrence and disapproval .
In many cases , it will provoke fervent denials and apologetic defensive maneuvers from those accused of this heinous act , even if the accuser has made no attempt to deliver his case .
The mere charge is enough .
People do not often realize it , but when they disparage " discrimination " without any attempt to elaborate or justify what they are talking about , they are disparaging an abstraction .
Moreover , they are disparaging an abstraction on which they rely to think — an abstraction without which they would be docile vegetables unable to make sense of the world around them .
When someone shrieks " It 's discrimination ! " the irony is usually lost on them , but without their own discrimination they would not be able to establish that others are discriminating , and be offended by it .
If one does venture to ask questions about why discrimination is to be condemned , one may be treated to a slight elaboration as to what is upsetting people .
One may be informed that so - and - so is discriminating on the basis of race , sex , age , sexual orientation , political affiliation , attractiveness , or some other factor that should not be a part of his decision making , and that just settles the matter , consarn it !
But what is relevant to rational thinking , moral conduct , and justice is not whether discrimination has occurred , or even whether such discrimination is made on the basis of some particular set of purportedly prohibited criteria ; what should ultimately be at issue is the reasons why the factors used in a decision were used , and whether these factors do indeed form a rational basis for the inferences that underlie discriminatory decisions ( by which I mean , all decisions ) .
In assessing the rationality , irrationality , morality , or immorality of particular instances of discrimination , it behooves us to ask the reasons for discrimination and to assess these reasons in the light of the logic of inference .
This may sound trite , but it is a step rarely taken in the rush to disparage the ghastly abstraction of " discrimination . "
Discrimination and Statistical Inference
Discrimination is ubiquitous .
It is not some conceptual defect or manifestation of hatred or stupidity .
In its widest and most proper sense , discrimination is merely the drawing of distinctions between things , which is the basis for all concept formation and human knowledge .
Whenever we form concepts from observations of the things around us and attempt to integrate these concepts into a consistent whole to form a sensible view of the world , we do so by differentiating between different things on the basis of their observable characteristics .
In particular , when we form anthropic concepts — concepts pertaining to man — we do so by discriminating between different types of people on the basis of their observable characteristics .
Discrimination between people is the basis for all anthropic concepts and all knowledge about man .
It is the means by which we are able to condense all of our many experiences with other people down into some economized conceptual units that can be used to predict the unknown characteristics and behavior of others .
One of the reasons that discrimination is of such predictive value is that , like it or not , human beings have characteristics that are statistically dependent , meaning that , for whatever reason , these characteristics tend to occur with one another or tend not to occur with one another ( as opposed to occurring statistically independently of one another ) .
Sometimes these characteristics are causally related , and sometimes they are merely correlated , [ 1 ] meaning merely that they tend to appear together ( or in the case of negative correlation , tend not to appear together ) .
Discrimination on the basis of observable characteristics can be rationally justified in any situation in which there is a statistical dependence between these characteristics and some other characteristics of direct interest to us , given whatever information is available .
In such cases , the predictive characteristic gives us information on the characteristic of ultimate interest to us , even if there is no causal relationship between them .
I 'll give you an example : A study by the Washington Lawyers ' Committee for Civil Rights under the Law found that taxicab drivers in Washington DC are less likely to pick up young black males than other people , and are less likely to drive passengers of any race to areas of the city with larger proportions of the black population .
[ 2 ]
Does this mean that cab drivers — including many black cab drivers — are incorrigible racists who see blacks as being genetically predisposed to crime ?
Not at all !
To a cab driver in this situation , it does n't make a lick of difference whether a particular race of people are genetically predisposed to commit crimes or not .
All that matters in this context is that race and crime are correlated — they tend to occur together for some reason .
And because these things tend to occur together , in the absence of having some more detailed information about a prospective passenger , the driver is correct to use the passenger 's race , sex , and age as factors in his decision .
He is correct to conclude that picking up a young black man in his cab ( as opposed to picking up someone else ) will increase the probability that he will be a victim of assault or other criminal conduct .
The rational cab driver knows this , and acts accordingly , avoiding fares that he thinks are high risk , based on those characteristics he is able to observe about his prospective passengers .
Discrimination on the basis of predictive characteristics which are correlated with characteristic of direct interest is a form of rational discrimination .
While it is often slandered as an injustice , rational discrimination is both rational and morally proper .
In fact , since justice is the rational assessment and treatment of other people , rational discrimination is a necessary requirement for justice and the refusal to engage in such discrimination is itself an injustice . [ 3 ]
Even sex and race discrimination , the coup de grande of modern taboos , often involve little more than the recognition that these characteristics are correlated with qualities and behaviors that are of legitimate interest in many decisions .
When taxi drivers in Washington DC discriminate against young black men in their choice of passengers , they do so because they know that sex , age , and race are all correlated with violent crime , which they wish to avoid .
These people are not bigots or morons — they are intelligent people who are implicitly applying the lessons of the science of statistical inference , even if they are only aware of these ideas on an intuitive or " common - sense " level .
Is it a breach of a person 's civil rights to be denied taxi service on the basis of their race , sex , or age ?
According to civil rights groups , it is . [ 4 ]
But unless one has some inherent right to service from others , then it cannot be a breach of rights when this service is denied , no matter what the grounds for the denial .
Indeed , if rights are understood to be grounded in the nonaggression principle , then this must include the right to use one 's property in a discriminatory manner , a fortiori when that discrimination is rational . [ 5 ]
A cab driver who operates his cab without engaging in rational race discrimination , sex discrimination , or age discrimination does the world no favors .
While he will probably end up giving service to people who are not criminals , and who may have been avoided by other drivers , he is also more likely to give service to those who will rob and assault him .
If he ignores his own rational inferences then he will weigh the risks against the rewards incorrectly , playing into the hands of violent thugs . [ 6 ]
Unfortunately , the cab driver has another set of violent thugs to contend with , since he is the target of the coercion of government and its activist minions .
The government who punishes him for his rational inferences not only does the world no favors ; it violates his rights and entrenches a system of mandatory irrationality that compels him to ignore relevant information in the decision problem he is faced with .
Its antidiscrimination laws not only involve an unwarranted aggression , but they involve aggression in the pursuit of mandatory irrationality .
The absence of discrimination between people would make it impossible to gain a conceptual understanding of man and would force us to operate at a purely perceptual level , either treating people as interchangeable blobs without differentiation , or treating each person as a completely new and exceptional phenomenon .
It would put us in the position of starry - eyed infants who observe each new thing as a unique and unknown phenomenon to be stared at in vacant wonderment .
Trite allegations of discrimination , usually made without any elaboration , completely ignore the relevant issue .
What is crucial in evaluating other people is not whether we discriminate on the basis of this or that characteristic but whether the characteristics we use form a rational basis for our inferences .
Are the distinctions that we draw sensible inferences based on genuine causal or empirical relationships between observed characteristics , or are they arbitrary judgments based on spurious ideas with no basis in reality ?
In short , the relevant issue is whether the discrimination we engage in is rational or irrational , not whether it is discrimination on this ground or that .
Notwithstanding the shrieks of horror that one is likely to encounter from the equity - and - diversity intelligentsia , this applies as much to race and sex discrimination as to any other form of judgment and discrimination .
What matters is not whether characteristics like race , sex , and age are used as means of differentiation and judgment but whether they are used rationally to infer other characteristics of interest on the basis of some known correlation or causal relationship between them .
The Antidiscrimination Paradigm
When you hear someone express with indignation that " It 's discrimination ! " — without any attempt at elaboration — you may be sure that they have absorbed the basic ideas of the antidiscrimination paradigm which forms the basis for modern " civil - rights " legislation and the attendant drive for political correctness .
At its root , the antidiscrimination paradigm asserts the abhorrence of discrimination per se , not merely discrimination on particular grounds .
Article 26 of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights makes this clear when it directs that " the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race , color , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status . " [ 7 ]
This explains why no further elaboration is thought to be needed once discrimination has been established .
" It 's discrimination ! " is all that is needed to establish a breach of civil " rights " and the consequent moral outrage .
To see the complete implications of the antidiscrimination paradigm , observe that , although race and sex are often used as the thin end of the wedge in public discussion , antidiscrimination laws and the accompanying moral crusade for political correctness both continue to expand to outlaw discrimination on the basis of more and more of the characteristics of man .
From initially narrow and innocuous beginnings , antidiscrimination laws in most Western countries have now expanded to prohibit discrimination ( including rational discrimination ) on the grounds of race , sex , age , disability , sexuality , marital status , pregnancy , potential pregnancy , breastfeeding , and family and career responsibilities .
There is no end in sight to this expansion , with calls to prohibit discrimination on the grounds of attractiveness [ 8 ] and social status [ 9 ] receiving serious attention .
The sole impediment to this expansion has been the normal inertia of political change , with each new expansion meeting withering resistance until it becomes a normal and allegedly indispensable part of antidiscrimination law .
Throughout this process , the general philosophical principle that implicitly or explicitly forms the basis for change is that discrimination on any ground is abhorrent .
This is what is said , and this is precisely and literally what is meant .
Unfortunately , many libertarians who oppose antidiscrimination laws accept the false position that discrimination on the grounds of race , sex , age , and other demographic criteria is necessarily morally abhorrent . [ 10 ]
While one may commend the delineation of moral and political issues that this entails , this position understates the seriousness of the issue .
Antidiscrimination laws should not be seen as bad methods in the pursuit of good goals .
They are bad methods in the pursuit of a tyrannical goal .
In fact , the only possible logical goal of the antidiscrimination paradigm is the complete elimination of discrimination and the institution of an all - pervasive quota system in every field of human activity . [ 11 ]
In such a context , it is not enough to remain agnostic about moral issues involving discrimination .
One must fully analyze the inferential foundations of discrimination and defend the moral legitimacy of instances of rational discrimination from knee - jerk attacks .
One often hears the assertion that discrimination is based on ignorance and prejudice .
While this is certainly the case for some forms of irrational discrimination , it is not true for discrimination that is based on a rational assessment of the relationship between observable characteristics and unobservable characteristics of legitimate interest in judgment and decision making .
As I have explained elsewhere ,
The antidiscrimination paradigm , which holds all discrimination to be irrational , is contradictory to basic principles of rational inference and prediction .
Far from identifying irrational behavior based on ignorance and prejudice , the antidiscrimination paradigm is itself irrational and is itself based on ignorance and prejudice — ignorance of the principles of rational inference , and a baseless prejudice that there must be empirical equality among racial groups . [ 12 ]
One often hears of the great danger of irrational discrimination based on false ideas like racism .
But there is also a serious danger in the refusal to acknowledge the inferential and moral legitimacy of instances of rational discrimination .
If instances of rational discrimination are falsely understood to be manifestations of bigotry and hatred , then this can only create and sustain acrimony and hostility between groups of people , a trend which has manifested itself in a repressive system of coercive planning known as antidiscrimination law .

I fixed a bug in Perl 5 this morning .
I 'm not asking for praise ; lots of people fix bugs in Perl 5 .
In particular , Perl 5 pumpkings deserve tremendous praise for managing the bug queue -- and often fixing nasty bugs no one else wants to explore .
The bug was small and the problem seemed obvious .
The fix was simple .
Thus the process of fixing the bug may be valuable to document .
In particular , corehackers exists in part to recruit new developers .
Its articles about Perl 5 internals needs more information .
Here 's a start ; here 's how I fixed a small , obvious bug in Perl 5 .
The Bug
Dave Taylor reported a bug with the syswrite builtin .
Using syswrite on an empty string with an offset writes garbage to a filehandle :
$ /usr/local / refperl/5.10.0 / bin/perl
-e 'my $ foo = " " ; syswrite STDOUT , $ foo , 100 , 1 ' | less < DC>8 /null^@^@^@^Y^@^@^@ ^A^@^@^@ ^@^@^@^P^@^@^@X^V9 ^@^@^@^@<89>^@^@^@<80 >< A6 >^U^H^@^@^@^@^@<A6 >^U^H^@^@^@^@<80 >< A7 >^U^H^@^@^@^@^@ < A7 >^U^H^@^@^@^@<80 >< A8>^U^H^@^@^@^@^@<A9>^U^H^@^@^@^@^@<A5>^U^H^@^@^@^@<80 >< A4 > ^U^H^@ ( END )
His test case is simple and his diagnosis looks reasonable .
At this point , the bug is obvious to a C programmer .
Even though Perl 5 knows that $ foo is an empty string , the syswrite code attempts to read 100 characters from the string starting from the second character of the string ( at offset 1 ) .
The garbage shown in the bug report is whatever 's in memory one byte after the memory address of the null string in $ foo .
Whatever reads this data to write with syswrite checks the length of the string in $ foo incorrectly .
Finding the Culprit
That seemed like a reasonable hypothesis .
Where was this code ?
I already knew that it was likely in a C function called pp_syswrite in one of the pp_ *.c files in the Perl 5 core .
If I had n't known this , I could have used B:: Concise to figure out where to look :
$ perl - MO=Concise -e 'my $ foo = " " ; syswrite STDOUT , $ foo , 100 , 1 ' d < @ > leave [ 1 ref ] vKP / REFC ->( end ) 1 < 0 > enter ->2 2 <;> nextstate ( main 1 - e:1 ) v:{ ->3 5 < 2 > sassign vKS / 2 ->6 3 <$> const [ PV " " ] s ->4 4 < 0 > padsv [ $ foo : 1,2 ] sRM*/LVINTRO ->5 6 <;> nextstate ( main 2 - e:1 ) v:{ ->7 c < @ > syswrite [ t3 ]
vK /4 ->d 7 < 0 > pushmark s ->8 8 <#> gv[* STDOUT ] s ->9 9 < 0 > padsv [ $ foo : 1,2 ] s ->a a < $> const [ IV 100 ] s ->b b <$> const [ IV 1 ] s ->c -e syntax OK
B:: Concise compiles a snippet of code into an optree , then walks that optree and serializes it to textual output .
That output represents the operations Perl 5 performs when it runs the program .
I 've emboldened the important line .
That line shows a LISTOP ( a type of node in the optree which has multiple child nodes ) which performs an operation called syswrite .
The node type is n't important ; what 's important is the name of the operation .
Each operation implies the existence of a function in the Perl 5 core called pp_operation .
PP is , as I understand it , short for push / pop , which means that these functions operate on the Perl 5 stack ( more or less equivalent to @_ in Perl 5 code ) .
I used App :: Ack to search for pp_syswrite in the appropriate *.c files .
It led me to mathoms.c , which is sort of a limbo for functions that used to be in the core and exist now for compatibility reasons .
pp_syswrite is now :
PP ( pp_syswrite ) { return pp_send ( ) ; }
Thus the implementation of syswrite is in the function pp_send ( ) , which is in pp_sys.c .
That function is too long to reproduce here , but there 's an interesting branch around 80 lines in :
if ( op_type == OP_SYSWRITE ) { Size_t length = 0 ; /* This length is in characters .
*/ STRLEN blen_chars ; /* set blen_chars to the length of the string in C chars */ /* ... */ if ( MARK < SP ) { offset = SvIVx (*++ MARK ) ; if ( offset < 0 ) { if ( - offset > ( IV ) blen_chars ) { Safefree ( tmpbuf ) ; DIE ( aTHX_ " Offset outside string " ) ; } offset += blen_chars ; } else if ( offset >= ( IV ) blen_chars && blen_chars >
0 ) { Safefree ( tmpbuf ) ; DIE ( aTHX_ " Offset outside string " ) ; } } else offset = 0 ; /* ... */
This code goes through some gyrations , counting the length of the string in C chars ( this is more complex than you think when you have UTF - 8 in the string ) .
Eventually blen_chars contains the length of the string .
offset is the offset value in this branch .
I 've emboldened the offending code .
The intent of that line 's conditional is to check that the offset is n't outside of the string .
Unfortunately , when the string is zero chars long , the second part of that line 's conditional is false and the entire conditional fails .
Fixing the Bug
If blen_chars is 0 , then any offset of one or more chars will be outside the range of the string , so the exception is necessary .
( Deleting that conditional also means that using an offset of 0 with an empty string will also throw that exception .
I could argue that behavior both ways . )
Vincent
Pit checked in the patch for RT # 67912 , as well as a test case derived from Dave 's code :
eval { my $ buf = '' ; syswrite ( O , $ buf , 1 , 0 ) } ; like ( $@ , qr / ^Offset outside string /) ;
I used Dave 's command - line invocation as a quick test while creating the patch .
After running the entire core test suite to verify that there were no obvious regressions , I mailed the simple patch to p5 p :
--- a/pp_sys.c +++ b/pp_sys.c @@ - 1919,7 +1919,7 @@ PP ( pp_send ) DIE ( aTHX_ " Offset outside string " ) ; } offset += blen_chars ; - } else if ( offset >= ( IV ) blen_chars && blen_chars >
0 ) { + } else if ( offset >= ( IV ) blen_chars ) { Safefree ( tmpbuf ) ; DIE ( aTHX_ " Offset outside string " ) ; }
This is an interesting case where deleting code can make the project 's behavior more correct .
Five hours elapsed from the time of reporting to the time of the commit of the fix .
In addition , Vincent also refactored the sysio.t test for clarity and ease of maintenance .
This is how community - developed software should work !
It 's a simple bugfix .
Anyone reading this could have figured it out without too much work .
Not all bugs are this simple , but the process is reasonably easy and there are plenty of people willing to help you get started improving Perl .
( It 's also very satisfying to think of all of the people who wo n't run into this problem in the future because you fixed it for them . )

Ils mettent toutes les forces de leur lobby en branle pour réussir à maintenir la société dans un status - quo au nom d’une sacro - saint morale .
Vertu ou progrès : en voilà un choix difficile .
Il y a peu encore on lui rappelait qu’il lui était défendu de porter le pantalon sous peine de déguster 10 coups de fouet ( avec une promotion à 40 coups si elle faisait la fine bouche ) .
Il n’y a pas à dire la femme africaine fait l’objet de toutes les attentions d’un certain nombre de gars ayant droit au chapitre en ce début de siècle .
C’est un peu comme si un beau jour ils se sont levés et ont eu l’impression que « la machine » échappait à leur contrôle .
Ils ont donc naïvement fait tout ce qui est en leur moyen pour stopper tout progrès en cours et renversés tout avancée acquise par le passé .
Récemment une loi visant à dépénaliser l’avortement est arrivée sur la table de l’assemblé nationale du Rwanda .
Certains pensent que ce débat est moderne alors qu’il appartient au siècle passé .
Quoi qu’il en soit il s’est trouvé des représentants pour s’opposer au principe du texte et c’est leur droit .
Mais là où le bas blesse c’est au niveau des arguments qu’ils ont avancé , c’était tout simplement sidérants .
On a entendu par exemple que c’était là , la porte ouverte à tout les débordements dans le mœurs , car les gros boss du pays n’hésiteraient plus à courir les petites filles n’ayant plus à craindre de prendre en charge une progéniture qu’ils n’ont pas voulu .
Ce que ces détracteurs semblent oublier ou omettre , c’est que la loi sert avant tout à protéger les victimes .
Étant donné les moyens de contraceptions disponibles aujourd ’hui ( oui même au bled c’est disponible ) si une jeune fille tombe enceinte c’est qu’il y a un problème à la base .
C’est à ce problème là qu’il faut s’attaquer et pas à la jeune fille qui en est la victime .
L’avenir du bled …de jeunes filles africaines
Le Kenya , lui , tente de jouer la carte de la prévention .
Il vient de proposer un test de grossesse ( non obligatoire mais fortement conseillé ) aux jeunes filles 1 fois par trimestre pour détecter à l ’avance les cas de grossesses .
Ces grossesses , généralement non désirées ( souvent dues à des profs peux scrupuleux ) , sont la principale cause de l’échec scolaire des filles .
Et encore une fois , on trouveras des personnes , des hommes plus précisément , qui vont s’interroger sur la finalité de la mesure .
Si ce que l’on recherche c’est préserver l’éducation de la femme ils ne manqueront pas d’argument contre une telle pratique .
Soit parce qu’elle sous entendrait que tout les jeunes kenyannes mènent une vie dissolue , ce qui n’est pas le but de la mesure , soit parce qu’il refuseront que leur filles se soumettent à ce test .
Les plus extrêmes refuseront sans nulle doute d’envoyer leur filles à l’école pour préserver la dignité de leur famille .
Et oui , une loi peut être contre productive des fois 🙁 .
Comme on peut le voir , le développement ce n’est pas simplement avoir une connexion haut débit d’internet ou être capable d’assurer l’eau potable et l’électricité à tout un chacun .
Non , le développement cela passe aussi par l’éducation des hommes et des femmes pour que leur conditions de vie physique et psychologique s’améliorent avec le temps .
Cela étant dit , il ne nous reste plus qu’à espérer qu’avec la médiatisation de cas de viols d’hommes dans l’Est de la république démocratique du Congo , les hommes prendront enfin conscience que ce n’est pas qu’un combat de plus des femmes mais simplement un combat pour la dignité humaine .

It is a dream of many a Democratic strategist : A Hannity - Palin Ticket or Palin-Hannity Ticket in 2012 .
According to one news report , Sean Hannity added fuel to the speculation this week by saying that he would not rule out a run and would await direction from the Almighty .
( It is assumed that that is a reference to God as opposed to Roger Ailes ) .
When asked by radio sidekick Bill Cunningham , Hannity left open the possibility of a run , saying “ I ’ve never made a decision in my life without – whatever destiny God has you ’ve got to fulfill it . ”
Not a single decision in his life .
That must make lunch menu decisions rather difficult .
When the audience erupted in feverish excitement at the prospect after his statement , Hannity asked : “ Would any of you really want me to run ? ”
Faced with shrinking popularity polls , many at the DNC were saying “ oh yes , please . ”
For hard - right Republicans , a Palin - Hannity ticket might be the best of all worlds since Palin would resign halfway through her term and conservatives could enjoy both a President Palin and a President Hannity — if their hearts could take it .
The Palin- Hannity cabinet has some obvious choices :
Secretary of Defense : God
Treasury : God
Transportation : God
Interior : God
Commerce : God
Justice : God
HUD : God
Labor : God
Of course , if the Almighty is too busy with the other decision ’s in Sean ’s life , there is John Yoo for Justice , Oliver North for Defense , Gov. Sanford for Transportation , Sen. David Vitter for Labor , Bernie Ebbers for Commerce , Jeff Skilling for Treasury ( Ken Lay is no longer available ) , Joseph Hazelwood for Interior — and of course Glen Beck for White House Spokesman .
The only danger would be that the hearts of some Republicans would literally burst out of their chests in spontaneous explosions of joy .
Possible slogans based on past campaigns :
“ Palin - Hannity : In Your Heart , You Know They ’re [ Far ] Right . ”
“ Palin - Hannity : Its the Antebellum in America again . ”
“ Palin - Hannity : God-Chosen , Fox - Certified ”
“ Palin - Hannity : Because One Can Never Be Too Right . ”
“ Palin- Hannity : No You Can ’t ”
“ Palin - Hannity : An Endangered Bird in Every Pot , a Humvee in every garage ”
“ Palin - Hannity : Stop Thinking About Tomorrow and Start Thinking About Yesterday . ”
“ Palin - Hannity : Building a Bridge to the Eighteenth Century . ”

As many as half of workers in the United States may be trapped in jobs that they would like to leave , out of fear of losing their health insurance .
Experts say that this phenomenon , known as " job lock , " is not only making people unhappier , but also stifling the innovation that could emerge if more people were able to freelance or work for smaller companies .
" We can definitely say that it 's slowing down the rate of innovation , " said economist Tim Kane of the Kauffman Foundation .
The most common source of health insurance in the United States is private insurance purchased at least in part by an employer .
The costs of private insurance mean that many small companies , unable to qualify for the bulk discounts that the big companies command , simply cannot afford to offer their employees insurance .
The situation is even more dire for self - employed workers , who are responsible for the full cost of their insurance .
" I would rather be freelancing , no question , " said public relations professional Jessica Tolliver .
" I got my work done in less time , because once I finished what I had to do , the time was my own .
" When Tolliver was a freelancer , however , the insurance costs for her family ran an astonishing $ 1,200 per month .
As an employee , she pays only $ 200 per month .
An estimated 20 to 50 percent of all workers in the United States are trapped in job lock due to health insurance fears .
The significance of this number is brought home by the fact that only 60 percent of the U.S. population has work - based health insurance -- meaning that for between 33 and 83 percent of workers with job - based health coverage , this insurance is the only thing keeping them in their jobs .
While President Barack Obama has promised an overhaul of the U.S. health care system , the problem of job lock is likely to remain .
Private health insurance remains the foundation of Obama 's reforms .

WHEN I hear great American standards on the radio , I think of all the songwriters , artists and musicians whom my father , brother and I have worked with over the years .
It reminds me that every recording has two parts , the composition and the performance .
It also reminds me how many wonderful artists and musicians have not been paid fairly for their work .
Songwriters and publishers are paid when their tunes are played on the radio , but none of the artists or musicians who bring the music to life receive even a penny .
The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing today on legislation that will right this wrong , which dates back to the early days of sound recordings .
My father , Frank Sinatra , and singers like Tony Bennett , Bing Crosby and Perry Como fought for years for performance royalties from radio stations , arguing it was unfair that performers are not paid and citing cases like Helen Forrest that show the harsh side of this injustice .
Helen was one of the most gifted singers of the 1940s .
Known as the “ Voice of the Name Bands , ” she had hits like “ I Cried for You ” and “ I Had the Craziest Dream . ”
Sadly ,
Helen spent her last years practically destitute because she received nothing when her songs were played on the radio .
After the recent Typhoon Morakot devastated the island of Taiwan with over 100 people dead and many hundred people missing , mainland China donated 1000 prefabricated housing sets ( mobile homes ? ) along with other aid including tents , blankets , and money .
However , some Taiwanese people rejected this donation of temporary housing because they feared poisonous toxic chemicals in the materials .
Here is part of an English news report from Reuters :
TAIPEI , Aug 19 ( Reuters ) – A Taiwan town where 700 people were displaced after the island ’s worst typhoon in 50 years has declined mobile homes from political rival China , fearing the they might contain toxic chemicals , officials said on Wednesday .
Chiatung Township refused 100 quick - assembly homes after Taiwan ’s notoriously anti-China county of Pingtung said that based on news reports in China , they might contain formalin , a chemical that can be hazardous in high doses , deputy county magistrate Chung Chia - pin said .
“ Although the homes are a humanitarian donation , we need to consider safety first , ” Chung said .
“ Also , not just China , but other countries are also offering these donations . ”
The homes , which reached Taiwan on Tuesday , should be tested for any contamination , said township chief Lai Hsieh - ho .
China said the homes had already been checked .
“ These mobile homes are strictly produced according to Taiwan ’s design requirements and technical standards by the mainland ’s top producers , ” Fan Liqing , spokeswoman for China ’s Taiwan Affairs Office , told a news conference .
Upon seeing this news and many comments made by some Taiwanese people on Taiwanese BBS forums like PPT , many Chinese people were very offended and upset .
Comments from Tianya :
dior0823 :
You give and they make sarcastic remarks ;
You say “ wait until they have a need and then give ” and they say our donation was not proactive !
Only one thing to say : lowly people .
That ’s why we should have given them [ prefabricated housing ] that actually had excessive chemicals , because either way they are people who want to die but have not succeeded yet [ people who are “ asking for it ” ] , so it is the same whether they die sooner or later , and yet they want to spend mainland people ’s money .
How come the disaster was n’t just a little bigger ?
This is my biggest regret !
超 哥1986 :
… WW ‘s mentality ~ ~ the same as bang zi~ ~
Ms_静 :
If they do n’t want it , then they can go find America and Japan and beg them for it .
cayou米吐 :
Some people have nothing better to do ,
spending every day caring about foreigners ’ business .
Does the country of Taiwan have 5 mao money ’s relation with us ?
It would be better to pay more attention to the Fujian , Zhejiang disaster victims .
左佳穗 :
I really want to know what is inside these Wan - Wan ‘s brains ???
甜池 :
I have seen this so much I no longer feel anything .
Mainlanders going onto PTT are basically looking to make themselves angry , so I basically no longer go there .
Most WW people are :
If we give materials / supplies , they suspect us of giving black - hearted [ evil ] adulterated / contaminated goods ,
but if we do not give materials / supplies , they curse us for only talking big [ but not doing anything ] .
If we give money , they suspect us of maliciously trying to reunify ,
but if we do not give money , they again curse us for being a bunch of vulgar poor bastards without compassion .
Only one thing to say , no matter what you do it is wrong and harboring evil intentions .
The only feeling I have within my heart towards TW [ Taiwan ] compatriots now is that this bunch of lowly cunts have themselves destroyed my feelings towards them after we have given so much to them .
chunfofo :
Continue tightly clutching the thigh of the [ foreign ] devil ’s America …all are SB .
高语婕 :
No matter what they say , they are still our fellow compatriots , no matter how they look at us , we are born from the same roots .
Right now there is no need to bicker here , the disaster survivors are the most important , let ’s just ignore those people who have nothing to do but talk about others .
nanopanda :
I am not that magnanimous .
I will not donate money to them .
The mainland has also extremely seriously disaster - stricken .
熊猫数叶子 :
Let us do what we do [ and not care about what they say ] ~ those people criticizing us in Taiwan have nothing better to do , using their money to come yell at us ~ would it not be better for them to save some electricity costs , internet costs , and go help those disaster victims ?
舞着叉叉的恶魔 :
Let them talk .
We were donating to the disaster area , not to mental retards .
dior0823 :
1000 sets of prefabricated housing does not need to be too good , it just needs to be environmentally safe and habitable for the moment [ because the people will not live in them forever , it is just temporary housing ] !
This typhoon was too small , only that few people died in Taiwan .
Coming to the mainland to order body bags , it was difficult for us to deal with the factory producers .
Only a few hundred , there ’s no profit [ in that small amounts ] !
If possible , the mainland can donate 23 million body bags , guaranteed to be environmentally safe , guaranteed to be non-polluted !
Then throw it into the sea , feed the fish , and it would be considered a good deed for humanity !
Next , the mainland can emigrate 30 million people to Taiwan , and from then on everything will be OK !
Comments from KDS :
灵灵 :
Give them face but they do not want face .
If a few more Taiwanese die , then it will be peaceful .
pooruhc :
The south of Taiwan has always had a high concentration of Taiwanese independence supporters , so this incident we could say was our own fault .
Looks like there is not much hope for peaceful reunification , so let us give up our fantasies and prepare to fight .
奥特MAN :
Authentic “ cold butt pressed upon hot face ” [ being warm / friendly to someone but that person treats you coldly ] .
China has an old saying :
Once you eat / accept other people ’s things , it is harder to criticize them .
南希子 :
Taiwan , the motherland is calling for you to accept the mobile homes …
金牛座 :
They are much better at resisting hard disks than us SHR [ Shanghai ren , Shanghai people ] .
We only talk , but they take action .
格鲁古古 :
This is why it is said that Taiwanese are stupid / foolish .
They do n’t even know that the gcd [ gong can dang , Communist Party ] always likes to give outsiders high quality goods to use , and give their own people counterfeits + poisoned goods .
The past Sanlu melamine and Mengniu incidents are the best examples .
采菊东篱下 :
Great Chinese manufacturing .
夜乌子 :
Chengguan battalion 1 , prepare yourselves [ for battle ] .
tintim :
Bullshit donating .
They have plenty , so why give them money ?
Look , we give them and they do not even want it .
五作小郎君 :
The poisoned stuff we cannot bear to give you guys [ Taiwanese ] to use !
It is all for ourselves .
J.A&S.A :
It will be great the day Shanghainese can be this niubi .
无极限 :
Extremely stupid / foolish .
There are no problems with the aid .
Accept what is mainland China ’s humanitarianism .
Why refuse aid in order to criticize others ?
If the original destination did not need it , then rejecting it could still be understood .
But refusing urgently needed materials / supplies , how can the local head / leader do right by the people ?
Taking any problem and politicizing it , typical of Asians , typical of Chinese .
上海菜泡饭 :
The facts once again demonstrate
that military force is necessary to liberate Taiwan .
As for Taiwanese pigs , we can only treat them with the neutron bomb .
耶耶的熊 :
If they really have the gall , then they should also return all the money we donated ~ ~~motherfuckers !
They just know how to take money ~ ~ ~
没雨 :
We still do not know where [ their ] 5.12 donation is !
A lot of them were empty promises , and then making it so difficult to donate to the Taiwanese .
I really do not understand , Zhejiang and Fujian were also victims of Morakot , so why is the difference this big ?
Truly sad !!!
上海菜泡饭 :
President Barack Obama addressed the Veterans of Foreign Wars national convention this morning in Phoenix .
But the real story was on the streets outside the downtown convention center , where the corners were packed with vocal opponents and supporters of the his health - care reform plans .
Beginning before 7 o'clock this morning , people on both sides of the health - care divide arrived to make known their positions .
The epicenter of the debate was the corner of Third and Washington streets .
People on both sides were chanting and counter - chanting to make their points .
Signs were waved and fingers were pointed , but the overall mood in the city was more excitement than anger .
All morning long , Phoenix police reported no arrests or calls for medical assistance .
Throngs of people , some supporting the president 's plan to reform the system , and some opposed to his plan , milled about , expressing themselves with their voices , hand - made signs , and T - shirts .
Douglas Ducharme , 50 , a dispatcher from Tempe , was dressed like the grim reaper in a black hood and gray cape , standing on the corner of Second Street and Adams .
Holding a sign that said AARP NOW RIP , he was protesting any changes to the current health - care system .
" This is America .
We have the right to choose and the freedom to choose , " he yelled .
Army reservist Lt. Corey Harris , 33 , of Peoria , said he just returned from Iraq eight days ago .
He said he has experienced first - hand the ability of the government to help administer health care .
" As someone who has been involved in the VA system , I 've seen the great job government can do in getting involved in health care , " Harris said .
" Everyone deserves health care . "
Jane Kibler , 56 , of Florida , a member of the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars , was on her way over to the convention hall to hear President Obama speak .
She described herself as a Democrat who voted for Obama , but said she had never heard him speak in person .
She said veterans are really looking forward to what he has to say .
" I know they ( vets ) do have some concerns about veterans ' benefits . "
There were pockets of people on both sides of the health - care debate walking around the city .
Elaine Gangbluff , 73 , of Phoenix , held a sign that read : " If you think health care is expensive now , wait till it 's free . "
" I 'm strongly opposed to government running health care .
That should be between my doctor and myself , " she said .
She added that she is also opposed generally to the president 's administration .
" We 're printing money we do n't have , and borrowing money we can't pay , " Gangbluff said .
But those in favor of health - care reform are also out in large numbers .
A line of people in support of the new plan reached down Washington Street between Third and Fifth streets .
One sight was perhaps a little unnerving to those in charge of making sure everybody remains on their best behavior .
A man , who decided not to give his name , was walking around the pro-health care reform rally at Third and Washington streets , with a pistol on his hip and an AR - 15 ( a semi- automatic assault weapon ) on a strap over his shoulder .
" Because I can do it , " he said when asked why he was armed .
" In Arizona , I still have some freedoms . "
Two police officers were staying very close to the man .
" What he is doing is perfectly legal , " Det. J. Oliver , of the Phoenix Police Department said .
" We are here to keep the peace .
If we need to intervene , we will intervene at that time . "
Jim Mariman , a veteran from Idaho who served in the Korean War and the Vietnam War , was spending his time outside the convention center rather than in it .
" What we are seeing here is people speaking their minds and their hearts , " Mariman said .
Mariman is opposed to Obama 's health - care reform plan , but enjoys the fact that those who disagree with him , can disagree with him openly .
" These people can protest because I gave them the right . "
There have been some instances of the debate turning a little more contentious .
Leonard Clark , of Phoenix , called himself an Independent .
Standing on the corner near Third and Washington streets , he stopped and said those opposed to health - care reform were only doing so because the president " is Black . "
Immediately , a group of people opposed to the president 's plan surrounded him , yelling " race baiter , race baiter , race baiter " at the top of their lungs .
Doug Ducharme , of Tempe , was one of those yelling .
" This has nothing to do with the president being Black , " he said .
" My ex-wife is Black . "
Another protester , 12 - year - old Micah Vandenboom , was there with her parents .
She held a sign that made clear her opposition to the president 's health - care reform plans .
" Under Obama , everyone will get the same health care , that 's socialism , " she said .
" It has failed in other countries , you know , like Europe . "
Global Goals of the Clinton Administration President Bill Clinton appointed his Rhodes scholar roommate and fellow draft dodger , Strobe Talbott , as his personal foreign policy adviser and later to the number - two post in the State Department .
Talbott had spent 22 years as a writer for Time Magazine ( July 20 , 1992 ) , where he enthusiastically predicted that " nationhood as we know it will be obsolete ; all states will recognize a single , global authority . "
He wrote that " national sovereignty was n't such a great idea , " and he rejoiced in the coming " birth of the Global Nation . "
(1) The Talbott types in the Clinton Administration know that Americans will never willingly replace sovereignty with " a single global authority , " so they instead talk about global governance , a global village , a global neighborhood , a global commons , a global economy , a reinvigorated United Nations , and an expanded NATO .
Instead of advocating a " single " global authority , the globalists are moving us incrementally into a variety of global entities with interlacing tentacles of control .
They use two principal techniques to increase the power of global organizations at the expense of American freedom to run our own affairs : treaties and international conferences .
Three types of treaties endanger our individual rights and national sovereignty .
Treaties to Regulate Human Behavior
No human behavior is beyond the scope of these impudent treaties and the UN committees they would authorize to monitor our personal actions and our schools .
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child ( 2 ) would set up a broad array of children 's rights against their parents .
This treaty is a major goal of the Children 's Defense Fund , the chief lobby group for those who want the government " village " to take over the raising of children .
This U.N. Treaty prescribes that the education of the child shall include global education , multiculturalism , feminism , and radical environmentalism , and would probably require us to set up a national system of daycare .
Article 43 sets up a Committee on the Rights of the Child consisting of ten " experts " to monitor " the realization of the [ treaty 's ] obligations . "
In 1995 , the Committee released its report on the United Kingdom and gave us a preview of the international busybodyism in store for us if we ever make the mistake of ratifying the treaty .
This UN Committee expressed its concern that Britain is n't spending enough taxpayer funds for social programs , that British parents are allowed to withdraw their children from sex education in school , and that spanking is allowed .
(3) The United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women ( 4 ) would be a massive interference with U.S. laws and with our federal - state balance of powers , as well as have an unlimited capacity for legal mischief .
It purports to abolish discrimination against women " in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field , " which means that the UN would govern private relationships , " customs and practices . "
This treaty would require us " to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women " and to give assurances that we are following UN dictates about " family education . "
It would require us to ensure " the elimination of any stereotyped concept of the roles of men and women at all levels and in all forms of education . . . by the revision of textbooks . . . and teaching methods . "
Those are longtime feminist goals .
The treaty would obligate the federal government to take over all family law , including marriage , divorce , child custody , and property .
And , of course , a UN committee of 23 " experts " would be created to monitor our compliance with the treaty .
Both of these treaties were rejected by Presidents Reagan and Bush , but have become pet projects of Bill and Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright .
A third treaty to regulate human behavior is now being prepared at the Hague and will be presented next year .
It would set up a new world court with power to conduct criminal trials of individuals .
Treaties to Regulate Our Economic Life The World Trade Organization was rammed through Congress in 1994 as part of the lengthy treaty called GATT .
(5 ) The World Trade Organization functions in Geneva as a sort of United Nations of Trade , with a legislature ( where we have one out of 117 votes -- the same vote as Cuba or Haiti ) , a multinational bureaucracy accountable to no one , and a supreme court of trade that ruled against the United States in its first case .
Another treaty designed to control our economic life , the Law of the Sea Treaty , ( 6 ) was emphatically rejected by President Reagan in the 1980s .
However , old treaties do n't die , they do n't even fade away , and Clinton is trying to revive it .
It is a scheme to force American businesses to sink billions of investment dollars down on the ocean floor , and then turn the seabed 's riches over to a global commission .
This treaty would create an International Seabed Authority with sovereignty over three - fourths of the earth 's surface .
The one - nation - one - vote procedure would assure that decisions would always be dominated by the Third World which has contributed nothing to the tremendous technology and financial investment necessary to bring those riches to the surface .
Unfortunately , Clinton persuaded the Republican Senate to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention ( 7 ) in 1997 .
This treaty purports to ban chemical weapons , but the dangerous countries most likely to use chemical weapons ( Libya , Syria , Iraq , North Korea , China , Iran and Russia ) either wo n't sign the treaty or have indicated they will not be bound by it .
This unverifiable and unenforceable treaty will increase , not eliminate , the risk of chemical weapons use .
Of course , this treaty creates a new international bureaucracy .
Headquartered in the Hague , it is now planning its regulatory and reporting burden to impose on every U.S. company that produces , processes , or consumes a scheduled chemical .
Treaties to Regulate Energy and Property
These treaties usually masquerade under the pretense of protecting the environment .
The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity ( Biodiversity ) , an 18 - page treaty with 1,140 pages of explanation attached , planned to set aside buffer zones and corridors connecting habitat areas where human use by Americans would be severely restricted .
It would subject U.S. property owners to international review and regulation .
President Bush refused to sign the Biodiversity Treaty .
However , Al Gore ( see his book Earth in the Balance ( 8 ) ) persuaded Bill Clinton to sign it , and the Clinton Administration tried to ratify it in 1994 .
The good news is that , due to the action of alert patriots , the Senate rejected it .
The bad news is that the Clinton Administration is implementing it anyway through the President 's Council on Sustainable Development , claiming that we must " fulfill existing international obligations . "
Unknown to most Americans , the Clinton Administration has already put 47 large areas of land , called " Biosphere Reserves , " under control of the UN and prohibited development in these areas .
The area involved is larger than the state of Colorado .
In 1993 , our Senate ratified another treaty that came out of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio called the Framework Convention on Global Climate Change .
It called for the economically developed countries to take " voluntary actions " to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ( principally carbon dioxide ) to their 1990 levels .
The Climate Control Treaty that Clinton is planning on signing in Kyoto , Japan later this year would turn the voluntary goals into " legally binding commitments . "
(9 ) This treaty would bind the United States to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 10 to 20 percent below our 1990 levels , while Western Europe would be able to evade reductions by averaging among the EU countries and because most of their energy is produced by nuclear plants ( which do n't produce carbon dioxide ) .
The 130 developing nations , including China and Mexico , would have no limitations at all !
It does n't take a rocket scientist to see that U.S. fossil - fuel - burning plants would move out of the United States to countries where there are no such restrictions .
Whole industries and a million U.S. jobs would move overseas , making us a non-industrialized nation .
The World Heritage Convention of 1972 granted special powers to the corrupt UN agency called UNESCO to designate selected American treasures as World Heritage sites and develop regulations and policies concerning their use .
The United States does n't even belong to UNESCO because Ronald Reagan pulled us out of it .
Nevertheless , 20 World Heritage Sites have already been claimed and marked by UNESCO , including Yosemite National Park , Yellowstone National Park , the Grand Canyon , and even the Statue of Liberty in New York harbor and Independence Hall in Philadelphia .
( 10 ) All these treaties are dangerous attacks on American freedom , our national security , our land ownership , and our private property .
Every one of these treaties involves setting up a new global bureaucracy that would have some kind of obnoxious control over American citizens , or our families , or our schools , or our businesses , or our use of natural resources and energy , or our land .
UN Conferences Promote Feminist Agenda UN conferences are the other method used by the Clinton Administration to take us along the road to global governance .
UN conferences pretend to be democratic gatherings of diverse delegates from all over the world who hammer out their differences and agree on plans of action .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
The conference managers write the reports and recommendations ahead of time and then manipulate the so - called delegates to call it a " consensus . "
Although the result is not submitted to our Senate for ratification or our Congress for legislation , the Clinton Administration implements it anyway through the executive branch .
Bella Abzug , the former Congresswoman who is now head of the tax - funded Women 's Environment and Development Organization ( WEDO ) , has surfaced as the head of the very successful effort to use UN conferences to serve radical feminist goals .
First , she hijacked the UN Conference in Cairo , which was supposed to be about population , and used it for the feminist agenda .
Then , she was in her glory at the UN Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in September 1995 .
( 11 ) She boasted at Beijing : " You made a contract with the world 's women , and that has to be enforced .
And how does it get enforced ?
By politics , by political action . "
Of course , the American people made no such contract ; what she was talking about was the fabricated " consensus " in Beijing .
Soon after the feminists returned from China in 1995 , UN Ambassador Madeleine Albright , who was the U.S. Delegation chair in Beijing , spelled out the goals in a document called " Bring Beijing Home . "
These included " family responsibilities must be shared " ( obviously , the government should force husbands to do the dishes and the diapers ) and , of course , assuring abortion rights .
In May 1996 , the Clinton Administration set up the President 's Interagency Council on Women chaired by Hillary Rodham Clinton and HHS Secretary Donna Shalala .
Its mission is to " follow up on U.S. commitments made " in Beijing .
The Beijing commitments are now being implemented by the Clinton Administration through a federal entity composed of high - level representatives from 30 federal agencies .
It holds monthly meetings , engages in outreach activities , conducts local seminars , and uses a White House address .
Abzug has promulgated a 12 - point " Contract with American Women " that includes demands for affirmative action , abortion , and ratification of the UN Treaty on Women .
She boasts that work is under way to promote her platform in high schools , colleges and universities through courses and seminars on Beijing 's notion of " gender equity . "
UN Conferences on Energy and Property The principal UN conferences of this type were the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio ( which produced the Biodiversity Treaty and Climate Change Treaty ) , the Istanbul Habitat Conference in 1996 ( which was designed to make the United States feel that we should provide housing for people all over the world ) , and the Rome Conference on Food in 1996 ( which was designed to make the United States feel that we should feed the world ) .
The code words of these conferences are " human habitat " and " sustainable development . "
The people who use these words have an agenda that includes putting limits on American consumption , land use , transportation , and energy .
( 12 ) The people and groups promoting this and related treaties have a particular world view .
They think that our high standard of living is destroying the earth and , of course , Americans are the guiltiest .
They say we 've exceeded our sustainable development and should go back to being agrarian peasants .
They want to drastically restrict our use of automobiles , fuel , refrigeration , air conditioning , and meat .
They want to create bio regions and put 50 % of our land into wilderness .
Their mindset is to subordinate humans to the environment .
Other global conferences have produced " consensus " on even more exotic ways to coopt American wealth for global purposes .
The 1995 UN World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen , Denmark discussed imposing a global tax to give the UN its own flow of money independent of Congressional appropriations .
( 13 ) The Clinton - appointed head of the UN Development Program , James Gustave Speth , called for a global tax on international financial transactions .
Naturally , all the UN bureaucrats thought that was a smashing idea and they began to orchestrate demands for it .
U.S. Armed Services under Global Control
The Reagan vision of military strategy was firmly grounded in the principle of " peace through strength , " that is , having more weapons than any possible enemy so no bad guys would dare to attack us .
It worked -- Reagan ended the Cold War without firing a shot !
The Clinton policy is just the opposite .
The Clinton Administration wants to lock us into a perpetual interventionist policy under which American servicemen and women will be sent to faraway places to fight never - ending foreign wars disguised as " peacekeeping " operations .
In May 1994 , Clinton signed a Presidential Decision Directive , PDD 25 , asserting his authority " to place U.S. forces under the operational control of a foreign commander " and under the United Nations rules of engagement .
It is the most unconstitutional transfer of power in the history of America . ( 14 ) In 1995 , the Clinton Administration ordered American troops to go on a so - called " peacekeeping " expedition to Macedonia wearing the United Nations uniform .
When Army Specialist Michael
New protested that this order was illegal because it conflicted with his oath to the U.S. Constitution , he was court - martialed .
( 15 ) His conviction was a watershed event on the way to abandoning control over American armed services .
When American soldiers were killed over Iraq , Vice President Al Gore told their widows and orphans that " they died in the service of the United Nations . "
That was n't a slip of the tongue ; his words reveal the Clinton Administration 's plan to use our armed forces as UN mercenaries all over the world at the whim of UN bureaucrats .
And the worst part is that U.S. troops are sent to faraway places where we have no national security interest .
The Clinton Administration is well aware that the United Nations is no longer popular with any Americans except Ted Turner and Jane Fonda .
Americans resent the impudent demands that we pay alleged back " dues " when we are already paying big dues plus over $ 3 billion a year in " peacekeeping " operations .
The Somalia , Haiti , and Rwanda expeditions were very unpopular , especially when a U.S. solider was dragged through the streets in Somalia .
That 's why the globalists chose NATO , rather than the UN , to sponsor the Bosnian expedition , and Bosnia is a good example of the future the Clinton globalists have in store for us .
( 16 ) The Clinton Administration has just announced that our troops will not be pulled out on the promised deadline but must maintain a continuing presence in Bosnia .
Why is anybody surprised !
Everything that has happened was wholly predictable .
The fact that Bosnia is a terrible failure does not phase the globalists in the slightest because their game plan all along is to keep us forever on an interventionist path with our troops under foreign control .
The globalists have now come up with a new plan to lock America into never - ending foreign wars that are none of our business and keep American troops forever hostage in Europe -- it 's called NATO expansion .
( 17 ) All the propaganda mechanisms are moving into high gear to tell the American people that we must manifest " global leadership , " which means that our armed services will serve as global policemen and global social workers , while the U.S. taxpayers will play global sugar daddy .
Why should Americans commit to defend faraway European borders that have been the locus of ethnic , nationalist and religious disputes for hundreds of years ?
Make no mistake : NATO is a life - and - death U.S. promise to go to war to protect any of the other members .
The principal purpose of NATO expansion is to legitimize the President 's ability to continue to engage American troops in foreign quarrels without ever asking permission from Congress , as the Constitution requires .
It 's a sort of " back - door interventionism . "
Global government is not just a pipe dream of starry - eyed dreamers .
It is the world view and goal of the Clinton Administration .
Its advocates are all around us .
The attempt by the Clinton Administration to give away the rights of American inventors is another example of Clintonian globalism .
The number - one argument used to defend this giveaway is that we must harmonize our system with the rest of the world .
This particular sellout was n't even a treaty ; it was just a private deal made between Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown and the Japanese Ambassador to give away a great and unique American constitutional right .
( 18 ) The National Education Association passes a resolution every year calling for global education in the schools .
Public school textbooks are filled with concepts about world citizenship rather than American independence , protection of the earth and biodiversity rather than human rights , and definitions of family to conform to the feminist agenda enunciated in Beijing . ( 19 ) I received a letter from Walter Cronkite , the longtime icon of television news , asking me to contribute to the Campaign for Global Change .
He urged a " global call " for a reinvigorated United Nations , permanent UN peacekeeping forces , an international Court , and a strong Commission on Sustainable Development that would restrict our property rights .
( 20 ) As Walter used to say , " And that 's the way it is . "
When Bill Clinton delivered his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in New York City in 1992 , the only person he mentioned besides his mother and grandfather was his history professor at Georgetown University 's Foreign Service School , the late Carroll Quigley , whom Clinton credited with helping to form his own political outlook .
Quigley was a liberal professor known principally for his 1,300 - page book called Tragedy and Hope , published in 1966 , in which he approvingly described the small elite group which he said actually runs the United States .
( 21 ) Quigley labeled this group " the Network , " and he said it consists of men who are " cosmopolitan and international . . . close to governments . . . equally devoted to secrecy and the secret use of financial influence in political life . "
Professor Quigley taught his student from Hope , Arkansas how to tap into the power centers of the Network , the people who yearn to control the world through the mechanisms of global governance .
When Bill Clinton became President , he surrounded himself with people who share that vision .
Global treaties and conferences are a direct threat to every American citizen .
They are an assault on our right to raise and educate our children as we see fit .
They are an attack on our ownership of our private property and on American ownership of our national treasures .
They are an attack on our pocketbooks because , if the UN ever gets taxing power , there is no limit to how much of our money it can grab .
They are an attack on the American standard of living because their goal is to steal American wealth and give it to the rest of the world .
Global treaties and conferences are an assault on the soul and sovereignty of America because they mean that young American men and women will be sent around the world on phony " peacekeeping " expeditions .
The Senate should reject all UN treaties out of hand .
Every single one would be a diminution of our rights , freedom and sovereignty .
That goes for treaties on the child , women , the sea , trade , chemical weapons , biodiversity , and heritage sites .
Congress should stop financing UN conferences and put a stop to all Clinton attempts to implement them through the bureaucracy .
Americans are not willing to have our property stolen by envious dictators or our standard of living reduced by those who whine about sustainable development .
Americans are not willing to let Clinton turn our armed services into global social workers or global cops .
Americans are not willing to be ruled by Strobe Talbott 's " global nation , " or by Walter Cronkite 's " reinvigorated United Nations , " or by Bill Clinton 's treaties and conferences .
If the rest of the world wants to enjoy the blessings of liberty and prosperity , they can copy our system .
We are not going to compromise with theirs .

One of the two journalists held captive for months in North Korea conceded to relatives after her release on Wednesday that she had “ very briefly ” crossed into the Communist country , her sister said Thursday .
Lisa Ling , the television personality , revealed that her sister  Laura Ling , 32 , a reporter with Current TV  planned to write an editorial explaining the events that led North Korean authorities to detain her and a fellow American journalist , Euna Lee , 36 .
But Ms. Ling , speaking by telephone on CNN Thursday evening , revealed that the two women did apparently cross into North Korea from China as they were researching a story on human trafficking on March 17 .
The women were subsequently convicted and sentenced to 12 years hard labor .
“ She did say that they touched North Korean territory very , very briefly , ” Ms. Ling said of her sister , adding later , “ She said that it was maybe 30 seconds , and everything just got sort of chaotic .
It ’s a very powerful story and she does want to share it . ”
Ms. Ling , a former co-host of The View , said that she would leave it to her sister to divulge the remaining details for her captivity .

Please review our list of best credit cards , or use our CardMatch ™ tool to find cards matched to your needs .
Whether you ’re traveling to Pittsburgh for business or Prague for pleasure , you do n’t want to run into financial troubles – especially when you ’re on the road alone .
A little planning now – long before you head to the airport or hit the road – can keep you and your cards safe .
A few calls ahead of your trip can reduce the chance that your credit card will be declined , cut the risk that your cards and cash will be swiped while you ’re sleeping and keep you from paying hefty fees for foreign credit and debit card transactions .
It all starts with a check of the cards in your wallet .
Are they the best cards for where you are going ?
If not , make changes now .
This guide ( and a handy checklist you can print out ) will show you what to look for in your credit cards ( no foreign transaction fees , for example ) , how to keep your finances safe whether you ’re staying at hostels or high - end hotels and more .
Before you go
Notify your card issuers
If you ’re traveling and charging purchases from places you do n’t normally go , your credit card issuer may suspect fraud and block use of your card .
To prevent that , notify your credit card and debit card issuers before you hit the road or take to the skies .
Some financial institutions will let you notify them of your dates and locations of travel online or through their mobile app .
With others , you ’ll need to call to let them know .
“ If you ’re out of your pattern , the artificial intelligence that scans the transaction will red flag it , and it can lead to unnecessary delays , ” says Andy Abramson , founder of the communications agency Comunicano .
Abramson , of Del Mar , California , was named Business Traveller magazine ’s 2015 business traveler of the year because he has averaged about 200 days a year on the road for more than a decade .
Notify others of your travel plans
Let friends or family members know of your travel plans , and check in periodically so they know you ’re safe .
If you ’re traveling internationally , you can sign up for the free Smart Traveler Enrollment Program ( STEP ) , offered by the U.S. State Department .
You ’ll receive information from the closest U.S. embassy or consulate about the safety situation at your destination , and it will be easier for the embassy to get in touch with you if there ’s a natural disaster , civil unrest or a family emergency .
Make copies of your financial documents
Make copies of your debit and credit card numbers and the phone numbers to call in case your cards are lost or stolen .
Do the same for your bank account information and your passport if you ’re traveling internationally .
Leave one set of copies with a friend or family member , upload one set to a secure site , such as Dropbox , and carry one set with you , separate from your credit cards .
If your card is lost or stolen , you can use the information you ’ve copied to immediately notify your credit or debit card company .
“ Time is of the essence , ” says Johnny Jet , a travel expert who travels 150,000 miles a year .
Know your credit card benefits
Knowing the perks that come with your credit cards can save you cash ahead of your travels .
For example , compare two cards , the Chase Freedom versus the Chase Sapphire Preferred .
While the Sapphire Preferred is better for aspiring travelers , Freedom is better for everyday purchases .
Some card benefits of particular interest to solo travelers :
Travel insurance : Many credit cards , such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred and Chase Sapphire Reserve , will reimburse you for your prepaid expenses if your trip is canceled or delayed .
The amount you ’ll be reimbursed can vary greatly from card to card .
You also may have coverage if your luggage is lost or delayed .
Free checked bags :
Some airline credit cards , such as the Gold Delta SkyMiles from American Express and United Explorer cards , let you check your first bag for free .
With the United MileagePlus Club card , your first two checked bags are free .
Rental car insurance :
If your credit card includes rental car insurance , check to see if it ’s primary or secondary coverage .
Also , note whether there are any countries excluded from coverage .
All Citi cards , including the Citi ThankYou Preferred , have no country restrictions for rental car coverage .
Emergency assistance :
If you run into trouble on a business trip or epic adventure , you card may offer medical and legal referrals .
To determine your card benefits , you can check the terms and conditions online or you can sign up for Sift , which sifts through your credit card policies and shows you all your benefits for each card .
“ There ’s all that fine print .
People are n’t aware or do n’t know how to take advantage ” of their card benefits , says Sift co-founder Abhinav Dubey .
Know your card fees
Whether you ’re traveling domestically or internationally , keep credit and debit card fees in mind .
In the U.S. : If you use your debit card at an ATM that ’s not in your network , you might be charged both by your bank and the bank ATM that you use .
If you use a big bank , such as Chase or Citi , you can find branch locations around the country on their websites or mobile apps .
If you use a credit union that ’s part of the CO - OP Financial Services network , you ’ll have access to almost 30,000 ATMs around the country , and you wo n’t charged a fee .
Outside the U.S. :
You also may be able to avoid ATM fees abroad , says Jason Gaughan , credit card executive for Bank of America .
For example , Bank of America is part of the Global ATM Alliance , so if you ’ve got a Bank of America debit card , you can make a withdrawal or transfer funds fee - free .
Among the many banks in the alliance are Barclays in the United Kingdom and Deutsche Bank in Germany .
You also should look for credit cards that do n’t charge foreign transaction fees on your purchases , such as the Bank of America Travel Rewards card , Gaughan says .
A foreign transaction fee is a charge , usually 3 percent , that many credit card issuers and payment networks add for each transaction made abroad .
Know your card details
If you ’re staying at a hotel or renting a car , you might have a “ hold ” placed on your credit card to cover possible extra charges .
Make sure those holds do n’t eat up your entire credit limit .
Also , check your credit card expiration date .
You do n’t want to be far from home when your card expires and have no way to get your hands on your new card .
Using cards when traveling
Should you use credit or debit ?
It helps to bring both a credit card and a debit card on your travels .
Use your debit card to withdraw cash at ATMs , rather than your credit card .
If you use your credit card , it ’s considered a cash advance , so you ’ll be paying a high interest rate as soon as you get your cash .
That high interest rate is just for starters .
As our 2017 Cash Advance Survey found , cash advances begin accruing interest as soon as the transactions post to a cardholder ’s account .
Also , 99 out of the 100 cards surveyed immediately charge a fee for each cash advance transaction , typically 5 percent of the transaction or $ 10 , whichever is greater .
If you report your credit card as lost or stolen , your liability for fraudulent charges is capped at $ 50 – although many major card issuers have adopted zero liability policies .
With a debit card , your liability is limited to $ 50 if you report your card missing within two business days .
Beyond that time , your liability could be $ 500 .
And you also run the risk of the thieves draining your bank account and wiping out your savings .
Do you need a chip card ?
Most U.S. credit cards have chip - based EMV technology , which has long been the standard in Europe and other parts of the world .
However , while most U.S. cards now require a chip and signature for authorization , in Europe and other places , cardholders typically use a chip and PIN to authorize payments .
How this difference can cause problems :
While your chip - and - signature card will work many places abroad , there are exceptions .
Jet recounts wanting to take a train from the airport in Copenhagen , Denmark , into the city , but the ticket kiosk only accepted chip - and - PIN cards .
As a result , he had to wait in a long line to get a train ticket from the ticket counter .
A chip -and - PIN card “ saves time and aggravation , ” Jet says .
What does he travel with ?
When traveling abroad , Jet carries a Barclaycard Arrival Plus World Elite Mastercard , which has a PIN .
Other cards issued in the U.S. also offer chip- and - PIN .
Should you get a prepaid card ?
With a prepaid card , you load a certain amount of money onto the card – say $ 200 or $ 300 .
A big advantage of prepaid cards for travelers :
If your prepaid card is lost or stolen , no one can run up thousands of dollars in charges to your card or drain your bank account .
And some financial institutions will replace the money if your card disappears .
How many credit cards should you carry ?
While you might be able to streamline the record of your expenses by using one credit card , you might find certain hotels or restaurants do n’t accept your mainstay credit card – particularly if you ’re traveling abroad .
For example , Visa and Mastercard are accepted more often worldwide than American Express and Discover , but check which cards are more commonly used in the countries you will be visiting .
To increase the chances you will have a card that is accepted nearly everywhere , “ Have Cards , Will Travel ” CreditCards.com columnist Stephanie Zito recommends traveling with a variety of cards from different networks .
Another reason to pack more than one card ?
In case your primary card is lost or stolen , you will have a backup , Gaughan , of Bank of America , notes .
Where should you carry your money and cards ?
When traveling solo , it ’s particularly important you keep a close eye on your cash and cards , because you do n’t have another traveler to fall back on if you get into a bind .
If you have multiple cards , keep them in several places , Zito suggests .
If your wallet is lost or stolen , you do n’t want to have all your cards disappear .
Another tip : Jet wears a travel vest with hidden pockets .
When sleeping on a train or plane , safeguard your cash and cards .
Jet has heard reports from friends about thieves going into the overhead bin during international flights and stealing other people ’s possessions .
If your cards and cash are in a purse or backpack , carry that with you – even to the bathroom .
How should you monitor your balance and transactions ?
While traveling in the U.S. , you can check your financial transactions and account balance for free on your financial institution ’s website or mobile app .
If you ’re backpacking across the globe or on a business trip abroad , you may be charged data or roaming charges when checking your accounts .
Also , sign up for text or email alerts for all transactions , Jet says .
These alerts are a great way to spot fraudulent charges .
If you do n’t recognize a purchase , you can contact your card issuer , or go online or use your issuer ’s app to turn off your card if it has an on / off switch .
How can you safely use an ATM ?
Always look for card skimmers when you ’re using an ATM to prevent your credit or debit card information from being stolen .
And always cover your PIN .
“ You never know if someone has a camera or binoculars , ” Jet says .
Avoid ATMs in dark areas , obviously .
Abrahamson recommends opting to use ATMs with long lines so there will be plenty of people around when you withdraw your money .
If you ’re traveling abroad , check the State Department ’s Country Information , which will alert you to crime , such as skimming , pickpockets or armed robberies , in countries you will be visiting .
Do you need RFID - blocking devices ?
You may have seen ads warning you that thieves can steal your credit card data using radio frequency identification , or RFID .
That ’s led to an upsurge in RFID - blocking wallets and other accessories .
Since RFID - enabled contactless credit cards are just starting to arrive in the U.S. , chances are you do n’t need an RFID shield .
Contactless cards are much more common in the U.K. and Canada .
What if your card is stolen or lost when you ’re abroad ?
There ’s always the risk your credit or debit card may be lost or stolen when traveling the globe , so it ’s imperative you keep a copy of your card information , as well as the customer service number , in another location .
If your card vanishes , immediately notify your card issuer .
That will help prevent fraudulent charges from being billed to your account .
You also can request an emergency card replacement .
What if you lose your card while traveling solo ?
If you ’re traveling on your own and your credit card disappears , you should still be able to get your hands on some cash or a new card if you have a Visa , Mastercard or American Express card .
Capital One , for example , will issue a temporary virtual number until your replacement card arrives .
With Visa , a new card can be shipped globally in 24 to 72 hours and the card issuer also will work with your bank to have cash available within a few hours .
American Express can wire you a small amount of cash through Western Union or MoneyGram , and can help you check out of your hotel if you ca n’t find your card .
Hostel safety
How should you select a hostel ?
Hostels are a popular way to see a city and meet like - minded travelers trying to hold down costs .
Guidebook author and TV travel host Rick Steves calls European hostels the cure for expensive , lonely travel .
How do you pick a hostel , though ?
You want a place that is cheap , safe and has a strong local vibe .
And if free breakfast or beer is included in your hostel rate ( yes , some hostels offer those things ) , that ’s even better .
Steves notes there are “ official ” or “ independent ” hostels .
Official hostels are part of a network called Hostelling International , which manages a federation of nonprofit hostel associations .
In the United States , the association is called Hostelling International USA .
You can book hostels directly on their websites .
TripAdvisor.com has hostel reviews , such as this one for Vietnam ’s Central Backpackers Hostel , which has a free beer hour .
How do you keep your cards , money and valuables safe in a hostel ?
Many hostels have lockers you can use .
You should bring a padlock , although many have locks you can rent .
You also keep your cash and cards on you in a money belt or neck wallet while you sleep .
If you ’re not staying in hostels but rather in luxury hotels , there usually are in - room safes to keep your valuables and any extra cash and backup cards .
And with card rewards , luxury hotel stays ( with a view of the ocean or a whirlpool to soak in after walking all over the city ) may be free or within your budget , Zito notes .
Wi -Fi network safety
Protecting yourself on public Wi-Fi
Public Wi-Fi seems to be everywhere – at airports , hotel rooms and restaurants – but if you use it , your personal and financial information could be at risk .
Many public Wi -Fi systems currently lack strong security , so cyberthieves may be able to steal your passwords and other personal information .
Sometimes hackers will put themselves between you and the internet connection and intercept the information you send .
It ’s particularly important you do n’t shop online or make other financial transactions on public Wi-Fi .
The good news :
It soon may be safer to type passwords on public Wi-Fi .
WPA3 , a new security protocol , better encrypts hotel and coffeshop communication .
Protecting yourself on public computers
It ’s risky using a public computer , particularly if you need to enter personal information or make a financial transaction .
This goes for hostels , high - end hotels , campus computers and even libraries .
If the public computer does n’t have good security , keystroke logging malware can record your keystrokes .
You also put your information at risk if you walk away from the machine when it ’s in use .
Make sure the computer does n’t save your login information , and delete your browsing activity when you ’re finished .
Oh , and do n’t leave any invoices , receipts or other valuable information on the printer or in the trash can near the computer .
Do you need VPN ?
Because you should avoid public Wi - Fi , you should consider other ways to send your information .
One option is a virtual private network ( VPN ) , which creates a private network from a public internet connection , giving you a secure , encrypted connection .
Some VPN services are free , while others charge a fee .
What should you look for in a VPN , and how do you choose one ?
According to c / net , you should steer clear of the free VPN services .
Most VPN services for a new business will cost roughly $ 10 a month , c / net notes .
If you prepay for a year , you can usually shave a few dollars off your bill .
Or you can avoid VPN altogether and use your smartphone to create a personal mobile hotspot .
This way your information is sent via your provider ’s cellphone connection .
Information sent via 4G is encrypted .
Final thoughts :
Start planning your next trip
How are you , as a solo traveler , going to feel as if you ’re prepared to tackle the world ?
Plan your next big adventure now .
Check your wallet or purse .
Do you have the right cards for where you will be going ?
If not , sign up for one or more rewards cards .
A big sign - up bonus might enable you to take a break from hostel living and chill in a swanky hotel while backpacking across the continent .
That clothing and gear needed for your trip can help you meet the new card ’s minimum spend , ensuring you get that big sign - up bonus .
You ’ll find those tips and a lot more on our solo traveler ’s checklist .
Print it out and use it to help you get ready to hit the road , take to the air , sail the seas or hike across the country .
Safe travels !

A week or so ago I wrote a review of the book Money .
Purpose .
Joy. by Matt Bell .
I enjoyed the book thoroughly , and after discovering the author was on twitter I decided to see if he was available to do an interview and possibly a guest post on this blog .
Mr. Bell was extremely gracious , and agreed to do both .
You can find his guest post here , and my review of his book here .
So without further ado , let ’s jump right to my interview with personal finance author and speaker Matt Bell .
( Please read the interview , then read how to enter to win a free copy of his book ! )
Bible Money Matters :
How did you come up with the idea for Money .
Purpose .
Joy. , where did it have its beginnings ?
Matt Bell :
It ’s a message that God has been stirring in my heart for many years .
In fact , it got to the point where I was talking about the book so often that my friends finally gave me an ultimatum : write the book or stop talking about it .
So I decided to write the book
BMM : You write about how many in our culture do n’t know how to find true joy or purpose in their lives because they ’ve focused on all the wrong things .
Where do you feel their focus should be , and how do you think people can begin to change their outlook to find true purpose in their lives ?
MB : The messages of our culture tell us that life is about us – our comfort and pleasure .
They tell us happiness is found in money and what it can buy .
And they teach a competition mindset , encouraging us to compare what we have to what others have .
But researchers studying what constitutes a meaningful , joyful life say those approaches are all wrong .
Rather than living for ourselves , they say we’d be better off living for something bigger than ourselves .
Instead of loving money and stuff , they say we ’d be better off loving people .
And they say happiness is n’t found in competition ; it ’s found in contribution – using our gifts , talents , and passions to make a difference with our lives .
As I did research for the book , what I found fascinating – although I suppose it should n’t come as a surprise – is that the findings of today ’s leading social scientists only affirm what the Bible has been teaching for thousands of years .
Live for something bigger than ourselves ?
There ’s nothing – or no one – bigger than God , and loving God is the first and greatest commandment .
Love people ?
That ’s the second greatest commandment .
And make a contribution with our lives ?
The Bible says we were made for lives of good deeds prepared in advance for us to do .
So , those are three purposes that we all have in common – love God , love people , and make a difference .
The book teaches a process for using money in a way that enables us to fulfill those purposes .
BMM : You share in your book about how making a decision for Christ changed how you view your finances .
Can you explain how your Christian faith impacts your decisions about money ?
MB : The Parable of the Talents had a big impact on me .
As I came to see myself as a steward , as having been entrusted with everything I have by God , that began to change how I viewed and used money .
It ’s sort of like driving a great car that was loaned to you by a friend .
How do you treat that car ?
You ’re thankful for the use of it , right ?
You take care of it .
And you ’re more likely to share with others because someone shared with you .
BMM : In your book you examine how people can begin finding joy through the “ irrational act ” of giving .
Can you explain the concept for my readers ?
MB : Being generous is the most other - centered use of money .
And that ’s how we were designed to live .
But I also have to say that this is an area where I had to grow over time .
At first , giving money away was more of an act of obedience than anything else for me .
God ’s
Word teaches that generosity is to be our first financial priority , so I started to give some money away every month .
Over time , that act of obedience did something to my heart .
I experienced first hand the biblical teaching that our heart goes wherever we put our money .
The more that I gave to God -honoring causes , the more my heart was turned toward God and the things he cares about .
I remember one time when my wife wanted to help support a missionary friend who was working in Peru .
At the time I had approximately zero attention focused on Peru .
But once we started giving money to support her work I began to notice when Peru was in the news , and I always read her newsletters with a lot of interest .
My heart went there because some of our treasure went there .
BMM : If you could tell someone 1 or 2 things they could do to improve their financial life , what would they be ?
MB : First , develop and use a budget , or what I call a cash flow plan .
And second , get out and stay out of most forms of debt – at very least all debt except an affordable mortgage .
A lot of people think of a budget as a ball and chain , or they think of it as something you go on like a diet – “ Poor Joe and Sally , they ’re on a budget . ”
But I believe a budget is one of the most powerful , productive , and freeing tools anyone can use to manage money well .
When you know where your money is going you can start to be a lot more proactive and effective in choosing what to do with it .
As for debt , I once had $ 20,000 of credit card debt , so I know first hand what it means to be “ servant to the lender . ”
Having lived with debt and without debt , I can tell you that living without debt is way better !
If anyone reading these words is struggling under a load of debt , choose to stop going any further into debt today .
Take your credit cards out of your wallet or purse .
Make it as tough as possible to take on any more debt .
And tell a friend about your commitment to get out of debt .
Then one of the easiest steps you can take is to fix your payments on today ’s minimum required payment .
Next month , if your card company tells you your minimum is now a few dollars less , keep paying what you paid this month and you ’ll get out of debt way faster .
BMM : America has become a culture of consumers , where things are made to be used up and discarded .
Do you think there is any hope for our culture as a whole , and can we ever become a nation of builders – people who use money for a purpose ?
MB : I do think there ’s hope !
An important key is understanding the purpose of our life .
One of my favorite stories is that of a couple I know .
They bought a house that required both of their incomes .
They did n’t think they could have children , so they figured it was okay .
But sure enough , right after they moved in , she became pregnant .
After their daughter was born , the woman longed to stay home , but they could n’t afford to live on one income .
After five years , they finally decided to sell their home and move to a less expensive community .
It was a hard decision , and they wondered if they ’d even be able to sell their home since many houses in their town were sitting on the market for a year or more .
But their home sold within a month and for nearly their full asking price .
They saw it as an affirmation from God that they had made the right choice .
The move enabled her to quit her job and home - school their daughter .
A lot of people might look at their situation and conclude that they took a step backwards .
After all , they moved to a less expensive home in a less prestigious area .
But I think they took a bold step forward by arranging their use of money around a key purpose of their life .
BMM : Anything else you ’d like to share with my readers ?
MB : I encourage people to talk with their friends about money .
The recession has broken down a lot of barriers around talking about money .
We ’ve all been impacted by the tough economy ; it ’s been a shared experience .
By opening up conversations about money , people will discover that they ’re not the only ones who have financial questions or concerns .
We can learn from each other and encourage each other .
Developing a greater willingness to talk about money with our friends would be one really good outcome of the recession .

On the occasion of the death , at age ninety - five , of the novelist , producer , and screenwriter Budd Schulberg , David Hudson at The Auteurs Daily links to a post of his own , from 2005 , about Schulberg ’s novel “ What Makes Sammy Run ? ”
David cites a sharp reference found in Otto Friedrich ’s book , “ City of Nets ” :
Schulberg was intensely pleased when Dorothy Parker praised him by saying , “ I never thought anyone could put Hollywood — the true shittiness of it — between covers . ”
Here ’s Schulberg , cited from a 1972 interview in the magazine Cineaste :
I was raised in Hollywood , in the middle of the film capital , and had an early education in the vicissitudes of success and failure .
I became convinced , before I was out of high school , that the dynamics of success and failure were of earthquake proportions in America , and that Hollywood was only an exaggerated version of the American success drive .
The interesting word is “ only ” ; of course it was , and is , much , much more , as proven by the movies themselves .
It ’s fascinating that when “ On the Waterfront ” was a contender for the Oscar for Best Picture in 1954 , two of the movies not nominated that year were among the best inside - Hollywood movies ever — George Cukor ’s remake of “ A Star Is Born ” ( starring Judy Garland and James Mason ) and Joseph Mankiewicz ’s “ The Barefoot Contessa ” ( starring Humphrey Bogart as a director ) .
Bogart owes his last , and one of his greatest , roles to Schulberg : “ The Harder They Fall , ” based on a Schulberg novel ( which , in turn , was based on the life of the heavyweight boxer Primo Carnera ) .
It ’s one of the toughest boxing movies ever , and Bogart is superb as a down - at - heels journalist who gets mixed up with a shady promoter until his conscience can take no more .
Schulberg was also in local news last week , when Film Forum screened Nicholas Ray ’s “ Wind Across the Everglades , ” a bitter and bilious historical film noir in a dramatic natural setting ; Bernard Eisenschitz ’s superb biography of Ray ( “ Nicholas Ray : An American Journey ” ) depicts the director ’s conflicts with Schulberg , who produced the movie , in tandem with his brother Stuart .
At the very least , Schulberg knew where writers stood in the Hollywood power structure , and was determined to do something about it .
Staatliche Bekenntnisschulen Andersgläubige müssen draußen bleiben
In Nordrhein - Westfalen tobt ein grotesker Glaubensstreit .
Bei der Schulwahl zählt der Taufschein an einem Drittel der staatlichen Bildungseinrichtungen mehr als die Nähe zum Wohnort .
Die Folge : Katholische Kinder bleiben unter sich , vor allem Muslime werden ausgegrenzt .
Von Hermann Horstkotte
I did n't go to school to do anything creative .
I thought for a while I 'd go to medical school but ended up not really connecting with my bio classes .
So I switched to Journalism .
It was an easy choice since it seemed like the " grown up answer " to being " a writer " , which is what I really wanted to be .
Truthfully , I had some classes in the journalism school that I liked but I was always being yelled at for putting in my two cents on every story .
My elective classes were what really made my college experience amazing .
I took ballet .
Beginners ballet started at 8 AM to discourage girls from taking it " just for fun " .
They wanted serious dancers only and while I ended up there hungover more than once , I loved the classes so much that I never missed even one class .
I also befriended the dancers in the high level courses and though I never made it anywhere with dance , I always look back on that short time where I was remotely graceful as a great time in my life .
I also took creative writing classes .
In fact , I took every single creative writing class that the school offered and when I ran out , I designed my own classes under the watchful eye of my favorite writing teacher .
The point of all this ?
I had choices to take art and dance .
I 'm worried with colleges cutting arts , theater , and dance that students will have less choices to try out creative classes .
The New York Times reported again today that entire arts programs are disappearing from college campuses .
While students that intend to be artists ( and know it early enough to apply to art school ) will not be as affected , what about the people going to school for journalism that have creative leanings ?
What about the accounting major that might want to get a minor in fine art ?
As a result of my art classes ( elective ) , I developed an appreciation for images and words together that led me to the advertising world .
I would never have chosen that field on my own .
My creative electives were absolutely instrumental in my career development .
And what did ballet bring me ?
I am as ungraceful as ever but I met some really fun people , learned enough steps that I can watch ballets without being bored , and have a photo of myself in my dance outfit that I love .
Well worth the 3 college dance classes that I took .
If you have been using Windows Vista for a while then you probably know how annoying the security confirmations can be .
Any time you install a program , install drivers , run programs that need administrative rights , change certain configuration settings , etc. , you are forced to confirm your actions before continuing .
Fortunately , there are ways to disable these prompts .
First we need to understand what causes these prompts .
User Account Control or UAC is a new security feature in Windows Vista that gives applications only standard user privileges when they run .
This helps to prevent applications and malware from destroying critical operating system components that they would otherwise be able to do with administrative rights .
The annoying side effect of this , however , is that each time an application needs administrative rights , you are presented with a “ Windows needs your permission to continue ” prompt .
Windows Vista does have the option of disabling UAC completely .
Disabling UAC will suppress the prompts but also disables all of the other positive effects associated with UAC such as running applications with standard user rights , running Internet Explorer in protected mode , etc .
When you disable UAC , you are essentially running Windows Vista with the same type of security as Windows XP .
You can disable UAC in Vista by performing the following steps .
Step 1 : Click the Start menu and in the Start Search box , type msconfig and hit enter .
If you receive a security warning , click “ Continue . ”
Step 2 : Click the “ Tools ” tab .
Step 3 : Select “ Disable UAC ” and click “ Launch . ”
Step 4 : Close out of the command prompt window and the msconfig window .
Now reboot the computer for settings to take effect .
A better option is to switch UAC into “ Quiet Mode ” using TweakUAC or WinCleaner UAC Switch .
Quiet mode allows you to still experience the positive effects of UAC but disables the prompts when an application needs administrative rights .
In this mode you are giving control back to the computer , and in a sense , the computer is hitting the continue button for you when an application needs administrative rights .
Both of these options get rid of the annoying prompts but do not offer the full protection that UAC was designed to give .
You should only follow these steps if you are an experienced user and are not worried about malware .
We all know that < %= string %> emits a String in ERB .
And <% string %> runs Ruby code , but does not emit a String .
When starting working with Rails , you almost expect the syntax for block helpers to be :
< %= content_tag ( : div ) do %>
The content <% end %>
Why does n't it work that way ?
It has to do with how the ERB parser works , looking at each line individually .
When it sees <% %> , it evaluates the code as a line of Ruby .
When it sees < %= %> , it evaluates the inside of the ERB tag , and calls to_s on it .
This :
< % form_for( @object ) do %> Stuff <% end %>
gets effectively converted to :
form_for( @object ) do _buf << ( " Stuff " ) . to_s end
On the other hand , this :
< %= form_for( @object ) do %> Stuff <% end %>
gets converted to :
_buf << ( form_for ( @object ) do ) .to_s _buf << ( " Stuff " ) .to_s end
which is n't valid Ruby .
So we use the first approach , and then let the helper itself , rather than ERB , be responsible for concatenating to the buffer .
Sadly , it leads to significantly more complex helpers .
Let 's take a look at the implementation of content_tag .
def content_tag ( name , content_or_options_with_block = nil , options = nil , escape = true , & block ) if block_given ?
options = content_or_options_with_block if content_or_options_with_block.is_a ?( Hash ) content_tag = content_tag_string ( name , capture ( & block ) , options , escape ) if block_called_from_erb ?( block ) concat ( content_tag ) else content_tag end else content_tag_string ( name , content_or_options_with_block , options , escape ) end end
The important chunk here is the middle , inside of the if block_given ?
section .
The first few lines just get the actual contents , using the capture helper to pull out the contents of the block .
But then you get this :
if block_called_from_erb ?( block ) concat ( content_tag ) else content_tag end
This is actually a requirement for writing a block helper of any kind in Rails .
First , Rails checks to see if the block is being called from ERB .
If so , it takes care of concatenating to the buffer .
Otherwise , the caller simply wants a String back , so it returns it .
Worse , here 's the implementation of block_called_from_erb ? :
BLOCK_CALLED_FROM_ERB
= ' defined ? __in_erb_template ' #
Check whether we 're called from an erb template .
#
We 'd return a string in any other case , but erb < % = ... %>
# ca n't take an <% end %> later on , so we have to use <% ... %> # and implicitly concat . def block_called_from_erb?( block ) block && eval ( BLOCK_CALLED_FROM_ERB , block ) end
So every time you use a block helper in Rails , or use a helper which uses a block helper , Rails is forced to eval into the block to determine what the context is .
In Merb , we solved this problem by using this syntax :
< %= form_for( @object ) do %> Stuff <% end =%>
And while everyone agrees that the opening <%= is a reasonable change , the closing = %> is a bit grating .
However , it allows us to compile the above code into :
_buf << ( form_for ( @object ) do _buf << ( " Stuff " ) .to_s end ) .to_s
That 's because we tag the end with a special ERB tag that allows us to attach a ) .to_s to the end .
We use Erubis , which lets us control the compilation process more finely , to hook into this process .
Rails 3 will use Erubis regardless of this problem to implement on - by - default XSS protection , but I needed a solution that did n't require the closing =%> ( ideally ) .
Evan ( lead on Rubinius ) hit upon a rather ingenious idea : use Ruby operator precedence to get around the need to know where the end was .
Effectively , compile into the following :
_buf << capture_obj << form_for( @object ) do _buf << ( " Stuff " ) . to_s end
where capture_obj is :
class CaptureObject def < < ( obj ) @object = obj self end def to_str @object.to_s end def to_s @object.to_s end end
Unfortunately , with one hand Ruby operator precedence giveth , and with one hand it taketh away .
In order to test this , I tried using a helper that returned an object , rather than a String ( valid in ERB ) .
In ERB , this would call to_s on the object .
When I tried to run this code with the CaptureObject , I got :
template template : 1:in `< <' : ca n't convert Object into String ( TypeError ) from template template : 1:in `template ' from helper_spike.rb:48
Evan and I were both a bit baffled by this ( although it retrospect we probably should n't have been ) , and we hit on the idea to try running the code through Rubinius and look at its backtrace :
An exception occurred running helper_spike.rb Coercion error : #< Object:0x60a>.to_str =>
String failed : ( No method ' to_str ' on an instance of Object . ) ( TypeError ) Backtrace : Type.coerce_to at kernel / common/type.rb:22 Kernel( String ) #StringValue at kernel / common/kernel.rb:82 String #<< at kernel / common / string.rb:93 MyContext #template at template template : 1 main.__script__ at helper_spike.rb:48
By looking at Rubinius ' backtrace , we quickly realized that the order of operations was wrong , and to_str was getting called on the return value from the helper , rather than the CaptureObject .
As I tweeted immediately thereafter , the information available in Rubinius ' backtrace is just phenomenal , exposing enough information to really see what 's going on .
Because the internals of Rubinius are written in Ruby , the Ruby backtrace goes all the way through to the Type.coerce_to method .
After realizing that , we changed the implementation of CaptureObject to take the buffer in its initializer , and have it handle concatenating to the buffer .
The compiled code now looks like :
capture_obj << form_for( @object ) do _buf << ( " Stuff " ) . to_s end
and the CaptureObject looks like :
class CaptureObject def initialize ( buf ) @buf = buf end def < < ( obj ) @buf << obj.to_s end end
Now , Ruby 's operator precedence will bind the do to the form_for , and the return value of form_for will be to_s 'ed and concatenated to the buffer .
And the best thing is the implementation of content_tag once that 's done :
def content_tag ( name , content = nil , options = nil , escape = true , & block ) if block_given ?
options = content if content.is_a ?( Hash ) content = capture ( &block ) end content_tag_string ( name , content , options , escape ) end
We can simply return a String and ERB handles the concatenation work .
That 's the important part : helper writers should be able to think of block helpers the same way they think about traditional helpers .
Somewhat less importantly , we 'll be able to eliminate eval ing into untold numbers of blocks at runtime .
The masquerade is over !
The “ public option ” is … dead .
Health care reform is now a private option : WHICH FOR PROFIT INSURANCE COMPANY DO YOU WANT ?
You have to choose .
And you have to pay .
If you have a low income , under HR3200 government will subsidize the private insurance companies and you will still have to pay premiums , co-pays and deductibles .
The Administration plan requires that everyone must have health insurance , so it is delivering tens of millions of new “ customers ” to the insurance companies .
Health care ?
Not really .
Insurance care !
Absolutely .
Cost controls ?
No chance .
You will next hear talk about “ co-ops . ”
The truth is that insurance company campaign contributions have co-opted the public interest .
I need your help to spread the word and rally the nation around true health care reform which covers everyone and maintains fiscal integrity without breaking our nation ’s bank !
Your contribution will empower our efforts to continue to fight for the single - payer , not - for - profit health care bill , HR676 “ Medicare for All , ” which I co-authored with Rep. John Conyers .
The bill now has 85 sponsors in the House .
The hotly - debated HR3200 , the so - called “ health care reform ” bill , is nothing less than corporate welfare in the guise of social welfare and reform .
It is a convoluted mess .
The real debate which we should be having is not occurring .
Removing the “ public option ” from a public bill paid for by public money is not in the public interest .
What is left is a “ private option ” paid for with public money .
Why should public money be spent on a private option which does not guarantee 100 % coverage nor have any cost controls ?
A true public option would provide 30 % savings immediately which would then cover the 1/3rd of the population who presently have no health care .
Unfortunately , under HR3200 , the Government is choosing winners and losers in the private sector ; proposing to spend public funds on subsidizing insurance companies who make money not providing health care .
This process will insure only the expansion of profits .
Gone is the debate over cost .
As a result of current negotiations , the Medicare Part D rip - off will continue for another decade , further fleecing senior citizens .
Drug importation has been dropped , so no inexpensive drugs can be accessed from other nations .
Instead we are told the pharmaceutical companies will accept a 2 % cut in the growth rate of their profits – they call this cost control !
If the matter were not so serious , it would be farcical :
The executive branch pretends that the proposed health care reforms are something they are not .
The legislation is being attacked for something it is not .
Congressional leadership and the White House defend the legislation , pretending it actually is the very proposal that is being attacked .
But it is not .
A commonsense government health care reform policy would insure that every single American has full access to health care by expanding Medicare to cover everyone under a Single Payer System .
We are already paying for a universal standard of care , it is just we are not getting it .
I need your help to spread the word and rally the nation around true health care reform which covers everyone and maintains fiscal integrity without subsidizing insurance and pharmaceutical companies and breaking our nation ’s bank !
My voice in Congress will continue to challenge the special interests who do not want “ single - payer ” to succeed .
I need you to join me in combating the special and corporate interests who spend millions to try to win this Congressional seat .
With your help WE will win again .
With your help I will continue to represent your concerns , be YOUR VOICE in the United States Congress , and be the voice for health care for all Americans !
With your help , we can accomplish ANYTHING in America .
Persistence , dedication , truth and courage will lead the way and win out in the end .

[ The Che Guevara Myth and the Future of Liberty by Alvaro Vargas Llosa • Oakland , CA : The Independent Institute • 2006 . ]
Ironically , anticapitalist crusader and left - wing icon Che Guevara has turned into a brand name revered by people the world around , which brought me to Alvaro Vargas Llosa 's The Che Guevara Myth and the Future of Liberty .
Llosa , who is a senior fellow at the Center on Global Prosperity at the Independent Institute , has combined three previously published articles into a short ( 67 page ) book that evaluates the Guevara legacy and assesses the prospects for liberal reform in Latin America .
The essays stand alone .
While Llosa offers a critical dismantling of the mythology surrounding Che Guevara in his first essay , he does not connect the Guevara legacy directly to modern Latin American liberalism .
He offers a complete discussion of the reforms , both liberal and illiberal , that have taken place in Latin America over the last several decades , and a treatment of the history and legacy of individualism in Latin America .
Llosa introduces the book with an anecdote about how he first realized that something might have been amiss when he saw a poster of Che Guevara on a friend 's wall next to " a picture of ' Comrade Gonzalo , ' the genocidal leader of Shining Path , " a Maoist organization in Llosa 's native Peru ( p. 2 ) .
Gonzalo was a tyrant whose wrath had affected Llosa " firsthand . "
His goal is to right wrongs and correct falsehoods as he sees them , arguing " that intellectual and political deceit — the bondage of the mind — represent the first step toward oppression " ( p. 4 ) .
Thus he embarks on an exploration of the mythology of Che Guevara and the tradition of liberalism in Latin America .
Llosa argues that Guevara replaced Batista 's tyranny with his own .
After taking Havana , " Guevara murdered or oversaw the executions in summary trials of scores of people — proven enemies , suspected enemies , and those who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time " ( p. 11 ) .
Guevara slaughtered some of his enemies and tortured others by simulating executions ( p. 11 ) .
During his time in charge of La Cabana prison , Guevara oversaw numerous summary executions ( p. 12–13 ) .
" Counterrevolutionaries , " dissidents , and others were sent to a hard labor camp for " crimes against revolutionary morals , to a lesser or greater degree , " in Che 's words ( pp. 16–17 ) .
This laid the foundation for forced internment of unfavored groups .
Hardly a peace lover , Guevara also made noise about nuclear war " to defend a principle " and war more generally between countries ( p. 18 ) .
Fine work and words for someone whose likeness " adorn (s ) Mike Tyson 's abdomen " ( p. 22 ) .
The essays on Latin American liberalism complement the research program exemplified in the work of Hernando de Soto .
Llosa takes a critical look at the cultural and political institutions that have stood in the way of liberal reforms or distorted reforms for private gain .
Many of the liberalizations that occurred after the failures of collectivism in Latin America were very poorly done : many assets were transferred into the hands of politically connected elites , and these favored firms were often granted monopoly privileges .
This has created popular resistance to further liberalization ( p. 37–38 ) .
As Llosa writes , " [ i] nstead of distributing property ownership widely , as happened in England and in certain central European countries , privatization in Latin America served to close the tight circle of wealth " ( p. 37 ) .
Even the celebrated Chilean education reforms are limited because " the state still controls the curriculum " ( p. 47 ) .
Many libertarians correctly points out that the botched " privatizations " that have occurred in Latin America , Eastern Europe , and elsewhere have been transfers of resources to favored constituencies .
People view these episodes as products of free - market capitalism ; therefore , the ensuing morass has contributed to a global antiliberal backlash which , I fear , will convince many that the political mayhem following some forms of liberalization is part of the logic of capitalism .
Llosa reinforces a lesson for everyone , whether they be students , seniors , intellectuals , or policy makers : humility in advocacy and respect for local customs is of paramount importance .
I , for one , have spent precious little time in Latin America and am therefore ill equipped to design a program that will lead to peace and prosperity unto time immemorial .
Attempts by well - intentioned technocrats of all persuasions have had disastrous results .
Beyond general principles like private - property rights , we should leave the details to people who know what they 're doing .
Local knowledge matters , and the people who live their day - to - day lives in the shantytowns of South America are in a much better position than any well - intentioned outsider to make decisions about their welfare .
While browsing for some stuff about Che Guevara for a project about human - rights violations and economic freedom last summer , I came across www.che-lives.com.
Three things about the site immediately jumped out at me .
First , the hammer - and - sickle icons on the left sidebar , the second of which is next to " advertising " ( by Google — the link will take you to cheguevaraproducts.com ) .
The second is the fact that the right sidebar is all links to the Che - Lives Store .
Then , right below the middle of the page are " Links " ( actually " Ads by Google " again ) with one offering " Che Guevara Shirts " and the other linking to " 10 Rules of Flat Stomach " ( ca n't I just cover unsightly flab with a Che shirt ? ) .
From the main site , it would be easier to navigate to " 10 Rules of Flat Stomach " than it would be to actually find anything Che said or wrote .
Beautiful irony , thy name is Che Guevara .
Outrage at ' Noah 's Ark ' creationist zoo which denies Darwin 's theory of evolution
The British Humanist Association says Noah 's Ark Zoo in Wraxall , Bristol undermines the teaching of science due to its religious stance
A secular group is demanding that tourism groups stop promoting a ' creationist ' zoo which questions the traditional view of evolution .
The Noah's Ark Zoo is accused by the British Humanist Association of misleading tens of thousands of visitors annually and ' threatening public understanding ' .
The BHA says the zoo farm , run by husband and wife Anthony and Christina Bush in Wraxall , near Bristol , promotes creationism - the belief that all life was created by God - and seeks to discredit scientific facts such as carbon dating , the fossil record and the speed of light .
BHA director of education and public affairs , Andrew Copson , said : ' As they are public bodies , we believe it is inappropriate that tourist boards should support establishments that seek to urge religious or ideological beliefs upon people . '
Noah 's
Ark research assistant Jon Woodward said : ' We are offering our visitors the chance to look at the evolution / creation debate .
As it is a free country , that is within our right .
' We are slightly different from popular creationism .
We hold a view that the natural world around us is the product of both God and evolution .
' We do not hold the stereotypical creationist views that the world was created in 6,000 years . '
In a long section entitled ' creation research ' , the zoo 's website says Darwinism is ' flawed ' and wants to encourage a ' creation / evolution debate ' .
Secular uproar : Tourist boards were urged to stop promoting the zoo because it advocates creationist ideas
Elsewhere it reads : ' God was watching over his people on the earth he had made .
' But he was not pleased with what he saw ; violence and corruption plagued the earth , all the people had hearts full of evil .
' The sight of what his creation had become made God very upset .
' God decided he would wipe away mankind and the animals on the earth by sending a great flood . '
Signs at the zoo in Wraxall near Bristol also describe how the ' three great people groups ' could be descended from the three sons from Noah .
' Life created by both God and evolution ' : Husband and wife Anthony and Christina Bush , who run the zoo , believe that all life was created by God in six days
BHA director of education and public affairs Andrew Copson said : ' We believe Noah 's Ark Farm Zoo misleads the public by not being open about its Creationist agenda in its promotional activities and by advancing misunderstandings of the natural world .
' We have therefore asked the South West England and Visit Britain tourist boards to stop promoting the zoo .
' As they are public bodies , we believe it is inappropriate that they should support establishments that seek to urge religious or ideological beliefs upon people in these ways . '
The government has not allowed the teaching of Creationism to be part of the National Curriculum , but guidelines on teaching it have been issued by ministers .
Science teachers have been told they can answer questions on the subject but must make clear that Creationism has ' no underpinning scientific principles ' .
Controversial : Noah 's Ark Zoo , where Sultana the Siamang gibbon was born last month
The BHA was behind the ' atheist bus campaign ' , which saw thousands of buses across Britain carrying a poster saying : ' There is probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life ' .
The Advertising Standards Authority received more than 150 complaints , but it was not deemed to have breached guidelines .
Noah 's
Ark research assistant Jon Woodward dismissed the BHA 's claims and said the Creationism debate was limited to posters in the indoor section of the zoo and the play area .
Mr Woodward said : ' We look at the evidence that is there and it is not 100 % certain that God did n't have an involvement in the creation of the Earth .
' If it were false science we were claiming , that the Earth was created six thousand years ago and God created everything , then I could see their point .
' We 're not saying that .
You need to look at what we are saying : we are making claims to say that the facts suggest there is creation involved . '
He added that during lectures at the zoo no mention was made of Creationism and staff kept to the National Curriculum .
' It 's not hokum , it 's not rubbish science and it's not brainwashing - we 're doing a fair job and some of the criticisms have been unfair .
' Out of 120,000 , visitors each year , of which a vast amount are made up of parents and school trips , we get approximately 10 complaints a year regarding this topic which is very low .
Clearly the public do not share the British Humanist view point . '
Last year the Scout Association faced a human rights watchdog investigation over a complaint that it discriminates against non-religious members .
The association 's refusal to admit those who will did not make a promise to God forces youngsters to lie as there is no alternative for atheists , the National Secular Society claimed .
North Somerset Council spokesman Steve Makin said it awarded the licence for the zoo based on whether or not it promotes an understanding of animals and the natural world .
The religious beliefs of those in charge is not a factor .
BRUSSELS — Restrictions on the sale of incandescent bulbs begin going into effect across most of Europe on Tuesday in the continent ’s latest effort to get people to save energy and combat global warming .
But even advocates concede the change is proving problematic .
Under the European Union rules , shops will no longer be allowed to buy or import most incandescent frosted glass bulbs starting Tuesday .
Retailers can continue selling off their stock until they run out .
While some Europeans are eagerly jumping on the bandwagon , others are panicking and have been stockpiling the old - style bulbs for aesthetic or practical reasons .
Others are resigned to the switch , if grudgingly .
“ Why are we switching ?
Because we have to , ” said Ralph Wennig , a 40 - year - old photographer shopping on Monday at BHV , a Paris department store .
Is there anything more symbolic of the American summer than the ice cream man ?
No !
But some people hate the ice cream man .
Who ?
Dang food - Nazi parents , that 's who !
Especially one whose Brooklyn restaurant serves deep - fried candy bars to children !
On Wednesday the New York Times ran a piece in their Dining section about the growing resentment some insufferable parents of bratty kids have for the ice cream man .
One of the parents quoted extensively in the piece was a woman from Park Slope , Brooklyn ( Of course ! ) named Vicki Sell , and she is pissed that the damn ice cream man once made her daughter have an " inconsolable meltdown " after she was denied a tasty frozen treat , so she 's now doing everything she can to shit all over everyone else 's fun by having them all shut down just so she does n't have to listen to her kid whine anymore .
" I fall into the camp of parents who are irate , " Ms. Sell said .
She has equal disdain for Mister Softee and the ice cream pop vendor outside the park , but since they are licensed , there is not much she can do about them .
" I feel kind of bad about having developed this attitude , " she said .
" I want Katherine to have the full childhood experience and all .
But it 's really predatory for them - two of them - to be right inside the playground like this . "
Ms. Sell says she is not obsessed with health and nutrition .
She - and others - feel they have been pushed to the brink by that little bell .
Across message boards and playgrounds , soccer fields and day camp exits , parents have been raging .
In a greener , more health - conscious , unsafe world , the ice cream man has lost some of his mojo .
Toward the end of the piece , Sell is quoted again and this time her occupation is noted :
And Ms. Sell owns and runs a restaurant in Brooklyn with her husband , a chef .
" I 'm not a health freak by any means , " Ms. Sell said .
" But I notice what happens to my daughter when she eats these sugar - filled things with all these additives . "
Now , tonight a reader wrote in to point out the restaurant owned by Vicki Sell and her husband is The Chip Shop , a fish and chip joint on Fifth Avenue in Park Slope .
What sorts of foods does The Chip Shop serve ?
Fried foods , and lots of them !
In fact , they 'll fry just about anything that can be battered and placed on a wooden stick !
They even have something on their menu called the " Twice Fried Cherry Pie , " but the brownshirts at the NYC Health Department banned it !
But hey , do n't fret , as there 's all sorts of other " sugar - filled things with all these additives " that Vicki Sell is more than happy to batter and deep - fry for only $ 3.50 !
Here 's the menu :
Now , in case you 're unfamiliar with Park Slope and its geography , The Chip Shop is located in a densely populated area filled with families .
There are at least a million and one jokes about Park Slope parents and their strollers in circulation right now !
So is n't it sort of " predatory " to open a restaurant that sells crap like fried Twinkies , Snickers bars , Mars bars , Reeses Peanut Butter Cups and Twix in the middle of the New York City 's neighborhood most synonymous with urban family life ?
Well , yes , perhaps it is , so leave the freakin ' ice cream man alone lady !
Some people just have their heads stuffed so far up their own asses it 's ridiculous .
Update : Vickie Sell wrote into comments and claims that she was misquoted by the Times and does n't have anything against Mister Softee peddlers .
Since this is sort of buried in all of your commenty rage , we 're moving it up to the post :
I am the person quoted in the Times story and I my point of view was not accurately reflected by a long shot .
I 'm very upset to have been quoted as hating Mister Softee and all these vendors and I have absolutely not started a campaign against them .
My complaint was about the ice vendors within the playground and that they are unlicensed and illegally sell to children in a place they are not allowed .
I called 311 once ( not multiple times by any stretch of the imagination ) to inquire about their legal standing .
They do not have sanction from any health authority to handle food and there 's no telling where their product comes from .
I had hoped that would be played up in the article .
And yes , I do feel that bringing these carts into the playground is predatory .
I was perhaps " irate " about this but not about ice cream vendors in general .
They are run out over and over by the police or parks people but come back time and time again .
I do n't have any problem with legal vendors outside the playground in areas they are licensed for — despite what the article says .
I 'm all for people making a living and for people to choose the time and the place to buy treats for their children .
I did discuss these points for the article but I do n't see them there and I believe other people 's points of view were attributed to me .
In fact while I was being interviewed we bought ice pops for our children from a licensed vendor outside the park .

I2P version 0.7.6 contains additional fixes for network stability issues related to tunnel building and connection limits .
While the 0.7.5 release greatly improved the congestion that appeared UTC evenings and weekends , it was not eliminated ; this release should improve the situation further .
This version also has new console themes by dr|z3d , which may be selected on the new UI configuration page .
Sorry , the new themes are not available for IE browsers .
The default tunnel length variance is changed from 1 to 0 .
This mainly affects exploratory tunnels and iMule .
As explained on zzz .i2 p , a non-zero variance adds very little protection , at great cost in resources .
Should you wish to reconfigure your exploratory settings back to the old variance of 1 , or change to length 3 variance 0 , you may do so on the config tunnels page .
iMule settings are best changed within that application .
I2P now stores temporary data in the system temp directory ( generally / var / tmp on Linux and % TEMP % on Windows ) .
For new installs only , user data is in $ HOME / .i2 p on Linux / Mac and %APPDATA % \I2P on Windows .
The release contains several changes to reduce resource usage ( memory , CPU , and connections ) and the usual assortment of bug fixes .
Upgrading is recommended .
This is the first release built and signed by zzz .
Thanks again to Complication for his many contributions to the project over the past five years .
I2P is undergoing the most rapid development in years .
Please give the developers feedback on IRC #i2 p or forum .
i2p2.de and get involved !
Release details :
Connection Limits and related congestion
Split the limiting actions into three thresholds ( 75 % , 81 % , and 87 % ) instead of all happening at 80 % , for better control , and to save the drastic actions for the higher thresholds .
Other minor changes , perhaps temporary , to improve tunnel build success .
Change default tunnel length variance to zero , to help iMule and exploratory build success .
As explained elsewhere on this site , this will have a negligible affect on anonymity .
Should you wish to keep a variance of 1 for a particular tunnel pool , change it back on configtunnels . jsp or in i2 ptunnel , or the iMule config .
Make shared clients tunnels reduce - on - idle for new installs .
Expire peer profiles quicker and display less , to reduce memory use .
Use StringBuilder throughout , faster than StringBuffer
Reduce stats coalesce frequency , this is a big CPU user
Allocate much less memory on first startup
Remove more unused classes
More fixes related to UPnP , recognition of firewalls and changing firewall conditions , and address changes .
Wait until the console is up before launching browser .
New console , i2 psnark , susimail , susidns , and proxy error page themes by dr|zed
Console themes are selectable on configui.jsp .
Console themes not available for IE users .
Fixes for Opera
Serve css and image files at the reserved proxy .i2 p address , to better display the error pages when the user is on a different machine .
For new installs , code and data will be split into different directories .
Data ( router files , config files , i2 psnark files , eepsite files , etc. ) will be in ~/.i2 p on linux and %APPDATA % \I2P on Windows .
The code directory can be read - only to the user ( although the user will not be able to update in that case ) .
On linux , the shell scripts i2 prouter , runplain.sh , and eepget can be moved to a directory such as /usr / bin .
All assumptions that files are in the current working directory are removed .
Do n't launch the router anymore in the install scripts on linux .
For existing installs , about the only visible change will be a few temporary files now in the Java temporary directory ( e.g. / var / tmp on linux ) instead of $ I2P .
Move the reseeder from the routerconsole to the router , for easier embedding of the router in other code ( e.g. android , iMule )

Over 10,000 workers including Batay Ouvriye members at the industrial parks ( i.e. mass sweatshop district ) of Port au Prince occupied their factories Tuesday in support of the demand for the enactment of the minimum wage legislation passed by parliament , but stalled by the President .
August 6th 2009
Over 10,000 workers including Batay Ouvriye members at the industrial parks ( i.e. mass sweatshop district ) of Port au Prince occupied their factories Tuesday in support of the demand for the enactment of the
minimum wage legislation passed by Parliament , but stalled by the President .
The workers are demanding the full 200 gourdes minimum wage , while the President and capitalists are trying to negotiate a lower wage .
The bosses fled the factory in a panic through the back door as workers took over .
Workers then marched to Parliament where a meeting was being held on the objections to implementing the minimum wage law .
Flags from occupying nations were torn down and burnt by the workers ( Alterpresse 08/04/09 ) .
The first event occurred on August 3rd , and then subsequently by other groups of workers .
Batay Ouvriye , a combative workers ’ organization , has called for the full 200 gourde minimum wage to be implemented , and has mobilized to fight in communities and factories to see it through .
Miami Autonomy and Solidarity supports the struggles of Haitian workers and students , and will be picketing the Haitian Consulate in Miami on August 19th in coordination with other Haitian solidarity groups .
MAS asks progressives and revolutionaries to organize similar pickets and struggle alongside Haitian workers this August 19th .
In the days following August 4th similar occupations and activities have been reported in the industrial parks of Port - au - Prince .

Once rumored for extinction , Apple 's entry - level polycarbonate MacBooks are on the verge of a refresh that will solidify them at the base of the Mac maker 's notebook offerings for the foreseeable future , AppleInsider has learned .
People familiar with Cupertino - based company 's plans say the 13 - inch portables are presently undergoing an industrial design overhaul that will see them reemerge in the coming months with a slimmer , lighter enclosure and restructured internal architecture to boot .
It 'll be the first time in more than three years that the plastic Mac notebooks will receive a visual tune - up .
Introduced in May of 2006 , the white and black systems replaced the PowerPC - based iBook and 12 - inch PowerBook as part of Apple 's transition to Intel processors and quickly became the best selling Mac of all time , according to statistics from NPD Group .
The MacBooks were also among the first Macs to adopt Apple 's MagSafe power connector while pioneering several other features that would become staples of future Mac notebook designs , such as shrunken soft - touch keyboards , glossy displays , and a non-mechanical magnetic latches ( see : Magnet madness to hit Intel iBook line - Feb 2006 ) .
Earlier this spring , Apple restructured its notebook offerings by repositioning its aluminum unibody MacBooks as premium offerings under the MacBook Pro moniker , adding long - requested features such as FireWire and higher - quality displays .
This left the company with just a single MacBook offering , a white polycarbonate model that retails for $ 999 but sticks out like a sore thumb when positioned alongside its peers .
Still , sales of the sub - $ 1000 system have remained surprisingly brisk amid the economic crunch , leaving management little choice but to allocate R&D expenses in its favor .
As of press time , Apple 's online store indicates that the white MacBook is outselling all other Macs with the exception of the iMac , while similar rankings from high - volume resellers like MacMall also consistently place it in the top 10 best selling Apple - related products overall , ahead of all desktop - based Macs .
While it 's unclear how many models or configurations Apple will introduce as part the redesign , Ben Reitzes — an analyst with Barclays Capital who 's been following the Mac maker for years — sees the company offering several , at various price points .
" We [ ...] believe the MacBook line needs to be revamped ( there is only one MacBook available now , an old white model ) and that we could see a lower priced line soon , positioned below the new MacBook Pro models , " he said .
Reitzes ' comments on price points echo expectations laid out by AppleInsider this past April in its report on more affordable Macs .
More specifically , it 's believed that Apple is well - positioned to begin offering a model at considerable discount to the $ 999 entry - level model that exists today , further narrowing the gap with its Windows - based competitors .
Introduced in May of 2006 , the current MacBook design has about run its course .
Though details are few and far between , Apple is expected to achieve these markdowns through largely existing tactics , such as using lower - end components and previous - generation Core 2 Duo chips and architectures from Intel Corp .
Battery life should receive a boost from cutting - edge technology that recently found its way into the company 's other notebook offerings , while high - end legacy features like FireWire connectivity are likely to be sacrificed in the tradeoff .
This strategy more closely conforms to Apple 's DNA than alternatives that were under consideration late last year .
For instance , AppleInsider has heard from multiple sources that the company toyed with the prospect of throwing an Intel Atom processor into the existing white MacBook enclosure as interim solution aimed at delivering a low - cost Mac portable for those consumers eying a Mac but hit hard by the recession .
However , at least one person familiar with the matter claims the initiative was abandoned indefinitely earlier this year , around the time that management solidified the forthcoming Newton web tablet for a first quarter 2010 roll - out and instituted a significant restructuring of the Apple TV development team .
Regardless of how the pieces fell into place , AppleInsider believes the bigger story is how Apple , once discounted for its role as a niche player in the market for premium computing products , is rapidly adjusting to having been broadsided by the sudden economic downturn .
In a matter of mere months , it 's successfully applied the same fundamentals and expertise that made it king of the luxury computing market to the space reserved for those strapped for cash .
And it 's doing so with class .
An assessment of Apple 's portable computing lineup for Q2CY10 based on information presently available to AppleInsider .
Come the second quarter of next year , the company — whose repertoire three years ago lacked a compelling offering for under a grand — will off a staggering array of portable solutions ranging from $ 99 to $ 999 .
This includes the $ 99 iPhone 3G , $ 199 - $ 499 iPhone 3GS , a sub -$ 999 MacBook family , and a multi - touch tablet device wedged between the latter two when fully subsidized .
Apple 's new line of low - end MacBooks could be viewed as the last piece to the puzzle in Apple 's top - to - bottom line of product offerings , transitioning the company from a premium PC and phone manufacturer to one that offers truly competitive prices on products in both categories .
Scientists investigating the effects of cannabis on bone health have found that its impact varies dramatically with age .
The study has found that although cannabis could reduce bone strength in young people , it may protect against osteoporosis , a weakening of the bones , in later life .
The team at the University of Edinburgh has shown that a molecule found naturally in the body , which can be activated by cannabis – called the type 1 cannabinoid receptor ( CB1 ) – is key to the development of osteoporosis .
It is known that when CB1 comes into contact with cannabis it has an impact on bone regeneration , but until now it was not clear whether the drug had a positive or negative effect .
Researchers , funded by the Arthritis Research Campaign , investigated this by studying mice that lacked the CB1 receptor .
The scientists then used compounds – similar to those in cannabis – that activated the CB1 receptor .
They found that compounds increased the rate at which bone tissue was destroyed in the young .
The study also showed , however , that the same compounds decreased bone loss in older mice and prevented the accumulation of fat in the bones , which is known to occur in humans with osteoporosis .
The results are published in Cell Metabolism .
Osteoporosis affects up to 30 per cent of women and 12 per cent of men at some point in life .
Stuart Ralston , the Arthritis Research Campaign Professor of Rheumatology at the University of Edinburgh , who led the study , said : " This is an exciting step forward , but we must recognise that these are early results and more tests are needed on the effects of cannabis in humans to determine how the effects differ with age in people .
" We plan to conduct further trials soon and hope the results will help to deliver new treatments that will be of value in the fight against osteoporosis . "

Editor 's note : R&B singer Chris Brown spoke exclusively with CNN about his arrest and sentence for assaulting Rihanna .
You can watch the full interview on Larry King Live , Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET .
Chris Brown opens up to CNN's Larry King in his first television interview since his arrest .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
Pop star Chris Brown has admitted guilt and apologized for assaulting his then - girlfriend Rihanna in February , but he does not remember hitting the singer , he told CNN 's Larry King .
Looking at police reports about the incident makes him feel like he 's reading about a stranger , Brown said in his first television interview since the arrest .
" I'm in shock , because , first of all , that 's not who I am as a person , and that 's not who I promise I want to be , " he said in an exclusive interview that airs Wednesday night .
" I just do n't know what to think .
I 'm just like , wow , " Brown said .
" It 's crazy to me . "
Brown , 20 , said he still loves singer Rihanna , whose full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty .
But , he added , it is tough for him to look at the photo showing Rihanna 's battered face , the one image that might haunt and define him forever .
Chris Brown Exclusive on " Larry King Live " R&B singer Chris Brown breaks his silence .
The interview you wo n't see anywhere else .
Wednesday , 9 p.m. ET see full schedule »
" When I look at it now , it 's just like , wow , like , I can't believe that that actually happened , " Brown said .
He now has to keep his distance from Rihanna , because of a judge 's restraining order .
" We have to be like 10 yards away from each other , " Brown said .
Watch Chris Brown and his mother discuss Rihanna 's assault »
The February argument began over an incident at a Beverly Hills party , according to Brown 's probation report .
An earlier , sworn statement by Los Angeles Police detective DeShon Andrews said the incident began when Rihanna found a text message on Brown 's cell phone from " a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with . "
The pair argued while in a sports car driven by Brown , the police statement said .
It went on to describe the assault in great detail , saying Brown punched Rihanna -- identified in the statement as Robyn F. -- numerous times and put her in a head lock , restricting her breathing and causing her to start to lose consciousness .
He threatened to beat her and kill her , according to the statement , and he bit her ear and her fingers .
The detective said Brown sent a text message nine days later , apologizing .
Rihanna 's injuries included cuts and bruises inflicted by a large ring on Brown 's right hand , which he used to punch her , the probation report said .
Brown pleaded guilty to felony assault on June 22 .
A plea deal kept him out of jail .
A second felony charge , making criminal threats , was dropped .
He was sentenced to five years probation and six months of community labor .
" It means he walks the straight and narrow for five years , " said Mark Geragos , Brown 's attorney .
" I 've grown to love this kid like a son or a nephew .
I have a high degree of confidence -- I 'll say it now so that you can play it back if he ever does anything -- but a high degree of confidence that he 's not going to do anything like this in the future . "
Brown called the sentence fair and agreed that everything comes with consequences .
" They want me to pick up trash , remove graffiti , " he said .
" I 'm a hard worker , it 's something I 'm willing to do . "
Why did it happen ?
How did it happen ?
Those are questions Brown and his mother , Joyce Hawkins , have been asking .
" Chris has never , ever been a violent person , ever , " Hawkins said .
However , CNN obtained a probation report for Brown last week that said he and Rihanna were involved in at least two other domestic violence incidents before the February attack for which Brown was sentenced .
" The first incident occurred in Europe about three months before the present offense , " the report said .
" The victim [ Rihanna ] and the defendant [ Brown ] were involved in a verbal dispute and the victim [ Rihanna ] slapped the defendant [ Brown ] .
He responded by shoving her into a wall . "
Another incident happened in January , three weeks before the Hollywood incident , when Brown and Rihanna were visiting her home country of Barbados , the report said .
" The defendant [ Brown ] and the victim [ Rihanna ] were visiting Barbados and were driving a Range Rover loaned to them by a local dealership , " the investigator wrote .
" They had an argument inside the car .
The defendant [ Brown ] exited and broke the front driver and passenger side windows of the car . "
Brown 's mother remembers being shocked and upset when he came to her after the attack in February and told her about it .
She said her husband was abusive -- and Brown knew it .
" I used to be scared to go to bed , " the pop star said .
Brown said he is not blaming that history for the attack on Rihanna .
But , he added , nobody taught him how to control his emotions and anger .
Rihanna calls Brown 's mother " Mom . "
The two have spoken and seen each other periodically since the incident .
The court order that prevents her son from seeing Rihanna does not extend to Hawkins .
" I let her know that I was very , very baffled , what had happened and apologized for my son , along with I 'm so sorry what happened to you , " Hawkins said .
" And I did n't know what -- I did n't know what else to say , and I gave her a hug and she hugged me as well . "
Hawkins started sobbing at this point in the interview .
The singer has not seen Rihanna for a couple of months , and said the separation has been difficult , especially when it comes to her dating others .
" I definitely would be affected by it , but at the end of the day , I mean , we 're not together , so if she 's happy , I 'm cool . "
But they will always be friends , Brown said .

A scare tactic by the Government of Pakistan
Pakistans ’ Minister of Interior Rehman Malik recently announced a 14 - year prison sentence for anyone found propagating SMS and emails ridiculing or making fun of the present Pakistani leadership and its elected government officials .
The statement issued by the Ministry of Interior , referenced the Cyber Crime Act of 2009 which apparently would subject the violators to a prison sentence of at least 14 - years .
It has been a long time , the Government of Pakistan has been trying to enforce a cyber crime law which since 2007 , when it was first initially tabled in the form of a draft by the Ministry of Information and Technology .
The then Cyber Crime Ordinance of 2007 was critically evaluated by the IT community and was found to be unfair , practically giving all encompassing powers to the Federal Investigative Agency ( FIA ) , the local intellegence agency , to be the judge jury and executor with very minimal protection to any innocent bystanders who may become prey to any unwarranted political intentions .
The civil society in 2007 was in outcry over the cyber crime draft , holding many awareness seminars and discussion panel and were successful in pushing the Ministry to accept some serious revisions of the controversial document with the hope of bringing it under proper international standards as agreed upon during the Cyber Crimes Convention in Budapest 2001 .
In an extensive meeting with the stakeholders the Ministry of IT were then presented with a long list of problems and it was primarily suggest to rewrite the entire document rather then accede to a patch up of a grossly irregular document which differed significantly from internationally accepted norms
Suddenly on 31st December 2007 , the then President of Pakistan , General Prevaiz Musharraf quietly signed the un-revised ‘ first draft ’ as an ordinance titling the new document as the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Ordinance of 2007 .
An Ordinance according to the Constitutional of Pakistan [ Article 89 ] is a presidential injunction to force a law into effect for a period of four months [ 120 days ] and before its expiry the bill has to be presented on the floor of the Parliament for vetting and debate before potentially voting it into a full fledged law only after a 2/3rd majority vote , historically Presidents of Pakistan have used ordinances for political intentions and for the mere continuation of the law the President merely re-signs the ordinance every four months extending its life for another 120 days without taking the time or making an effort to put it before the legislative body
Since the start of this newly elected government , the local leadership , namely the President of Pakistan Mr. Asif Zardari and Minister of Interior Rehman Malik have been at the receiving end of some very hard hitting gutt wrenching jokes , which in turn have resulted in a massive propagation of SMS's and emails , not only in Pakistan but also across the world .
The local leadership have also not helped stop this flame war as they themselves provided fuel - to - the - fire with one funny blunder after another , from the God - Gaad misspelling controversy in September 2008 [ while signing a guest book President Asif Ali Zardari accidentally misspelled God as ‘ Gaad ’ and that turned out to be a serious cause of embarrassment for the President ] or even the Sarah Palin gorgeous - n- hug comment in Washington [ in an exclusive one - on - one meeting with Sarah Palin during her Vice - Presidential bid , Asif Zardari commented on Live TV to called her “ gorgeous ” and then goes on to flirt with Sarah Palin to say ‘ if he ’s insisting , I might hug ’ ] such opportunities generally become the bane of all comical SMS's , emails and blog posts among Pakistanis
Seeing their local leadership at the base of many hard hitting jokes , the government decided to take such critical offenders to task .
Here lies a very important problem , it is surprising to note that the Cyber Crime
Act does even not exist , it is a fact that the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Ordinance of 2007 ironically had no mention of any crime related to SMS's , let alone punish a person for sending funny SMS's which may tarnish the image of the an ‘ unspecified ’ local leadership , the maximum prison sentence in that 2007 bill for any cyber crime offense was set at a maximum of 7 - years [ 10 - years if it involved a minor ] .
Initially when the Minister of Interior announced the 14 year sentence people were shocked and taken aback , as it was assumed that the Pakistan Pakistan Electronic Crimes Ordinance of 2007 had lapsed , after 120 days , and there was no news about re-signing of a new Ordinance – soon APP provided us with the text of the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Ordinance of 2009 signed into effect on July 3rd 2009 which was identical word - for - word with the 2007 and there was no mention of an SMS crime let alone a 14 year sentence
The statements made by Ministry of Interior were challenged , and the only official response that has been received till now that the ‘ correct draft has not yet been released to the public ‘ .
It only seems that the politically motivated statement was more or less geared towards scaring the general public into submission and hopefully stopping political rivals from ridiculing them .
In a recent development the Supreme Court of Pakistan has nullified all actions taken by General Perzaiz Musharraf during the illegal Emergency that was imposed on November 3rd 2007 , the court has in the order requested the parliament to regularize all ordinances enacted by General Pervaiz Musharraf which may actually mean that the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Ordinance of 2007 may stand to be jeopardized , the faith of its subsequent enactment by Mr. Asif Ali Zardari on July 3rd 2009 is still unknown , and hence we can assume that extensive lobbying is needed to undo this irresponsible law and help push the Ministry of IT to develop a document that adheres to the International standards across the world
As per the legal experts in Pakistan there is still no law that prevents the prorogation of funny SMS's and emails , ironically on the other hand the Government of Pakistan still chooses to say otherwise .
A majority of the public believes that the war in Afghanistan is unwinnable and British troops should be pulled out immediately , a poll for The Independent has found .
The growing opposition to the military offensive emerged as another two UK soldiers were killed , bringing the number of deaths so far this month to 22 .
Gordon Brown declared yesterday that Operation Panther 's Claw – the five - week onslaught on Taliban positions in Helmand province – had been a success .
But today 's ComRes survey suggests that the public mood is switching rapidly against the war – and that people do not believe it is worth sending reinforcements to Afghanistan .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
More than half of voters ( 52 per cent ) want troops to be withdrawn from Afghanistan straight away , with 43 per cent disagreeing .
Opposition to the military action is even stronger among women .
By a margin of nearly two - to - one , the public believes that the Taliban cannot be defeated militarily .
Fifty - eight per cent view the war as " unwinnable " , with 31 per cent disagreeing .
There is overwhelming agreement – by 75 per cent to 16 per cent – that British troops in Afghanistan lack the equipment they require to perform their role safely .
Despite that , 60 per cent of people do not think more troops and resources should be dispatched to the war zone .
Just over one third ( 35 per cent ) are in favour of reinforcements being sent in .
The collapse in confidence in Britain 's involvement in Afghanistan comes after the numbers killed in the action exceeded those who died in Iraq .
Mr Brown yesterday announced the first phase of Panther 's Claw had been a success , clearing out Taliban insurgents from a wide area of Helmand ahead of next month 's Afghanistan elections .
He acknowledged the " tragic human cost " among UK troops who were killed or injured , but insisted it had not been in vain .
" What we have actually done is make land secure for about 100,000 people , " the Prime Minister claimed .

" What we 've done is push back the Taliban – and what we 've done also is to start to break that chain of terror that links the mountains of Afghanistan and Pakistan to the streets of Britain . "
The two latest deaths brought the total number of UK fatalities in Afghanistan to 191 since the invasion of 2001 .
One soldier , from the Light Dragoons , died while on a vehicle patrol in Lashkar Gah , the capital of Helmand .
It was the first death in Operation Panther 's Claw 's second stage , which will focus on holding ground won from the Taliban in recent weeks .
The second , from 5th Regiment Royal Artillery , died on foot patrol in Sangin district .
The American commander of Nato forces in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal , is due to present his strategic plan for the campaign this week , emphasising that territory taken from the Taliban must be held .
In the past , Western troops have been forced to abandon positions due to lack of numbers , allowing the insurgents to return .
For British troops the immediate effect of this is that they must now be present on the ground in large numbers in the areas they have captured .
However , senior officers point out it also means that UK forces will not be able to mount such an operation on their own in the future without reinforcements , because troops will be tied up guarding the newly secured areas .
Lt - Gen Simon Mayall , deputy chief of the Defence Staff ( Operations ) , declared : " We cannot afford another Musa Qala . "
He was referring to the capture of the Helmand town by British troops , who then withdrew after arriving at a deal with local elders .
The area turned into an insurgent stronghold from which attacks were planned throughout southern Afghanistan .
Brigadier Tim Radford , who commanded the British troops in Panther 's Claw , said : " I am absolutely certain the operation has been a success .
We 've had a significant impact on the Taliban in this area – both in terms of their capability and their morale .
It has been a very , very hard fight .
" When I have been on the ground , you look into the eyes of some of the soldiers and they have certainly grown up during this period . "
He refused to confirm how many insurgents were killed in the operation .
But he said : " There will be many Taliban who will not be fighting any more . "
Ministers are now backing moves by the Afghan government to draw moderate Taliban fighters into the political process by dividing them from hardcore militants .
David Miliband , the Foreign Secretary , speaking at Nato 's headquarters in Brussels , said : " The Afghan government needs effective grassroots initiatives to offer an alternative to fight or flight for the foot soldiers of the insurgency .
Essentially this means a clear route for former insurgents to return to their villages and go back to farming the land or a role for some of them within the legitimate Afghan security forces . "
William Hague , the shadow Foreign Secretary , called for a " comprehensive strategy " for stabilising Afghanistan .
He said : " It must include clear , tightly drawn , realistic objectives that are regularly reviewed , more rapid development of Afghan security forces and ensuring battlefield gains are swiftly followed by reconstruction . "

On Friday , in the weekly march in Bil ’in organized by the Popular Committee Against the Wall with the participation of Sa’di Tameezi , the Palestinian ambassador to Vietnam , two young men were injured , and dozens of people suffered from the effects of tear gas fired by Israeli soldiers .
Dozens of Palestinians were joined by international and Israeli activists , commemorating the 14 people who were killed in the demonstrations held on the anniversary of the Nakba last Suday .
The march began in the center of the village after Friday prayers .
In the area above the wall , demonstrators raised the Palestinian flag , as well as banners inscribed with the names of villages destroyed in 1948 and pictures of the imprisoned Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti .
Participants chanted nationalist slogans in favor of the right of return ( the return of refugees to the land from which they were expelled ) .
At the eastern gate of the wall , Israeli soldiers fired a shower of tear gas ; ; they also sprayed ‘ stink ’ water , water treated with a chemical that gives it a foul smell that ca n’t be removed from people ’s clothes .
Among those injured were Ibrahim Burnat , 28 , who was hit by a tear gas canister in the abdomen , and 22 - year - old Mohammed Suleiman Burnat , who , after severe choking and vomiting caused by tear gas , had to be treated by ambulance crews .
The soldiers also fired tear gas into the olive groves , with the purpose of setting fire to them .
The people of Bil ’in were able to put out the fire .
This demonstration took place the day after Obama ’s speech on the Middle East .
In a statement from the Popular Committee Against the Wall , organizers stated , “ Our response to that speech is : Obama is not the God who will decide our fate , and we are not depending on him .
Through the popular struggle we will achieve our goals : freedom , return and the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital . ”
A notice on underground cybercrime forum r00t - y0u.org on Thursday suggested the site had become part of a law enforcement sting operation .
However hacker hijinks and mischief making seem equally likely explanations for the incident , at the time of writing .
r00t - y0u.org 's home page has been replaced by an jpg image notice stating that the previous cybercrime activity on the site has been logged and will be passed on to appropriate law enforcement agencies .
It 's unclear who posted the advisory , which was spotted by security researcher Mikko Hypponen of F - Secure , or even whether it is genuine .
No law enforcement agency is identified on the notice .
Roots you , sir .
Chris Boyd , a security researcher at Facetime , and long time nemesis of s'kiddies , cautions that several underground hacking forums were defaced recently and the r00t - y0u incident might be related .
Bearing this important caveat in mind , the notice on r00t - y0u.org states .
This underground form has been monitored by law enforcement - every post , private message and all registration information has been captured .
All member IP addressed and have been logged and identification processes are now underway .
The creation and distribution of malware , denial of service attacks and accessing stolen information are serious crimes .
The notice goes on to suggest arrests will follow .
Every movement on this forum has been tracked and where there is information to suggest a person has committed a criminal act , referrals will be forwarded to the relevant authority in each jurisdiction .
There have already been a number of arrests as a result of current investigations .
This message should serve as a warning not to engage in criminal activity .
Law enforcement infiltration of underground forums is rare but not unprecedented .
The DarkMarket carder forum was famously taken over in a months - long FBI sting last year .
Around 56 people worldwide were arrested over their involvement their activities on DarkMarket , which posed as a forum for identity thieves , carders , and other cybercrooks .
Defacement of underground forums is a far more common incident .
Motives might include a desire to discredit a rival forum , among other reasons . ®

questo non è mai stato un foglio di partito e il Pdl si illude se pensa lo possa diventare .
La famiglia Berlusconi e gli altri azionisti da me si aspettano molto tranne una cosa : che trasformi Il Giornale in un megafono di Berlusconi .
Non sarei in grado .

Segnalazioni
L’assessore Walter Ganapini , ex Greenpeace , ex Legambiente di Susanna Ambivero
Nonostante il fatto che un assessore regionale abbia dichiarato di aver subito pressioni da parte di presunti servizi segreti neppure la magistratura , anche se lo aveva promesso in un primo tempo , ha aperto delle indagini ...
Scrivenell ’ editoriale d’esordio sul Giornale che è tornato a dirigere dopo averlo lasciato nel dicembre del 1997 : “ ” .
Uahahahahahah .
Feltri se ne andò 12 anni fa dopo che il Cavaliere aveva definito “ incidente gravissimo ” il suo articolo di prima pagina in cuiper averlo calunniato per due anni con le fandonie su inesistenti tangenti di D’Adamo e Pacini Battaglia : “ Caro Di Pietro , ti stimavo e non ho cambiato idea ” .
Seguivano due paginoni in cui il Giornale di Feltri si rimangiava quei due anni di campagne antidipietriste : “ Dissolto il grande mistero : non c’è il tesoro di Di Pietro ” , “ Di Pietro è immacolato ” , “ dei famigerati miliardi di Pacini ” non ha visto una lira , dunque la campagna del Giornale era tutta una “ bufala ” , una “ ciofeca ” , una “ smarronata ” perché la famosa “ provvista ” da 5 miliardi non è mai esistita .
Insomma Feltriai suoi lettori .
E lo faceva proprio alla vigilia delle elezioni suppletive nel collegio del Mugello , dove Di Pietro era candidato al Senato per il centrosinistra contro Giuliano Ferrara e Sandro Curzi .
In cambio di quella ritrattazione e di un risarcimento di 700 milioni di lire , l ’ex pm ritirò le querele sporte contro il Giornale , tutte vinte in partenza .
Furente Ferrara , furente Berlusconi .
Così Feltri , , se ne andò .
Non a nascondersi , come gli sarebbe capitato in qualunque altro paese del mondo .
Ma a dirigere altri giornali : il Borghese , il Quotidiano nazionale di Andrea Riffeser ( sei mesi prima aveva dichiarato all ’
Ansa : “ Per carità !
Conosco Riffeser da una vita e ogni volta che ci vediamo mi dice ' Sarebbe bello se tu venissi con noi ' , ma tutto finisce lì .
Non sto trattando con nessuno .
Ma tanto so già che nessuno ci crederà , comunque è così ” ) .
Mentre usciva dal Giornale , Littorio sparò a palle incatenate : “ Provo un certo fastidio : per la causa comune mi sono esposto ( alla transazione con Di Pietro , ndr ) , poi gli altri si sono ritirati e io sono rimasto con la mia faccina e tutti ci hanno sputato sopra .
La cosa non ha fatto per niente piacere .
Così si rompe un rapporto di fiducia …
Mi sono trovato da solo e ho le ferite addosso e il morale a terra ” ( Ansa , 10 novembre 1997 ) .
E il Cavaliere gli diede del bugiardo : “ Feltri ha detto ultimamente qualche piccola bugia , però è ampiamente scusato ” ( Ansa , 7 dicembre 1997 ) .
Feltri ora ricorda la sua prima esperienza ( dal 1994 al ’ 97 ) di direttore del Giornale , “ ” e si appella ai “ ” .
Uahahahahahah .
In realtànon cedette ad alcun corteggiamento progressista : rimase l’uomo libero che era sempre stato .
E Feltri non ereditò un bel niente : semplicemente prese il suo posto ( dopo averlo a lungo negato ) quando Berlusconi mise in condizione Montanelli di andarsene perché “ non volevo trasformarmi in una ” né Il Giornale che aveva fondato “ nell’organo di Forza Italia ” , come il Cavaliere pretendeva e come Feltri voluttuosamente accettò di fare .
Montanelli , lungi dal ritenere Feltri il suo erede , lo disprezzava profondamente .
Infatti il 12 aprile 1995 dichiarò al Corriere della sera : “ Il Giornale di Feltri confesso che non lo guardo nemmeno , per non avere dispiaceri .
Mi sento come un padre che ha un figlio drogato e preferisce non vedere .
Comunque , non è la formula ad avere successo , è la posizione : Feltri asseconda il peggio della borghesia italiana .
Sfido che trova i clienti ! ” .
Ma il meglio Littorio lo dà quando racconta che ora “ ” , perché lui sarebbe “ ” , e poi “ ”.. Prima di lasciare
Il Giornale nel 1997 , Feltri chiese provocatoriamente a Berlusconi di venderglielo : “ Ho fatto una proposta organica per l'acquisto del Giornale perchè non sono disposto a fare un quotidiano di partito .
Se la famiglia Berlusconi la accetterà , bene , altrimenti potrei pensare di lasciare .
Rimarrei solo a condizione di poter fare un giornale indipendente e non , come qualcuno evidentemente sperava , l'organo di Forza Italia o del Polo , di cui non mi frega niente .
Se un deputato di Forza Italia come Roberto Tortoli chiede le mie dimissioni e nessuno lo smentisce , vuol dire che non è il solo a pensare che Il Giornale debba essere il quotidiano di Forza Italia .
Sono stato costretto a questo passo dopo le ultime vicende che hanno umiliato la redazione e rischiano di far sentire al lettore l'esistenza di un cordone ombelicale che lega Il Giornale a Forza Italia .
Io invece voglio fare un quotidiano indipendente e lo dimostrerò , quando ne avrò occasione , anche in modo clamoroso ” ( Ansa , 14 novembre 1997 ) .
Oggi , nella fretta , Feltri dimentica di spiegare come mai a richiamarlo al Giornale sia stato un signore che non possiede nemmeno un’azione del Giornale , cioè il presidente del Consiglio , scavalcando l’editore , il fratello Paolo , informato come al solito a cose fatte .
Se l’è lasciato sfuggire , come se fosse un dettaglio insignificante , lo stesso Littorio l’altra sera nella rassegna di regime di Cortina Incontra : “ Il 30 giugno scorso ho incontrato Silvio Berlusconi .
Ogni volta che lo vedevo mi chiedeva : ‘ Ma quand'è che torna al Giornale ? ’.
E io : ‘ Sto bene dove sono ’ .
Ma quel giorno entrò subito nei dettagli , fece proposte concrete e alla fine mi ha convinto ” .
che dovrebbero vigilare sui conflitto d’interessi , se non fossimo in Italia .
L’ultima parte dell ’editoriale feltriano è una grandinata di(possibile “ ” , “ ” ) per le ultime rivelazioni sui .
Una prova di coraggio da vero cuor di leone , visto che l’Avvocato è morto da tempo .
Per la verità , che la Fiat e la famiglia Agnelli avessero montagne di soldi all ’estero era già emerso nel processo intentato dai giudici di Torino ai vertici
Fiat a metà degli anni 90 , concluso con la condanna definitiva dell ’allora presidenteper .
Ma all ’epoca Agnelli era vivo e potente , dunque Feltri e il Giornale difendevano a spada tratta casa Agnelli e attaccavano i giudici che osavano processarla .
Visto che Il Giornale non è l’organo di Forza Italia né , men che meno , il megafono di Berlusconi , Littorio Feltri sul Giornaledalle inchieste del gruppo Repubblica - Espresso .
Che strano .
Nel ’ 97 , lasciando
Il Giornale , lo stesso Feltri si profondeva in salamelecchi verso ile il suo editore Carlo De Benedetti : “ Non ho mai litigato con nessuno , tantomeno con De Benedetti , che ho sempre stimato e di cui credo di potermi definire da sempre amico .
Quando si sposò , fummo l'unico giornale italiano a pubblicare la sua foto con signora .
Ho ottimi rapporti anche… con Carlo Caracciolo e Eugenio Scalfari ” ( Ansa , 13 novembre 1997 ) .
Come passa il tempo .
La chiusa dell ’editoriale di oggi è un capolavoro : “ ” a proposito dei presunti fondi neri di Agnelli in barba al fisco .
Invece - aggiunge - “ ” , anche perché “ ” .
Uahahahahahah .
Il fatto è che un simile sospetto , rinviato a giudizio dinanzi al Tribunale di Milano perper svariate centinaia di milioni di euro nascosti nei paradisi fiscali ..
Perché Littorio Feltri , questo campione della libertà di stampa “ ” , questo pezzo d’uomo a cui “ ” non se ne occupa con una bella inchiesta sul suo Giornale libero e bello ?

Two security researchers have demonstrated a new technique to stealthily intercept internet traffic on a scale previously presumed to be unavailable to anyone outside of intelligence agencies like the National Security Agency .
The tactic exploits the internet routing protocol BGP ( Border Gateway Protocol ) to let an attacker surreptitiously monitor unencrypted internet traffic anywhere in the world , and even modify it before it reaches its destination .
The demonstration is only the latest attack to highlight fundamental security weaknesses in some of the internet 's core protocols .
Those protocols were largely developed in the 1970s with the assumption that every node on the then - nascent network would be trustworthy .
The world was reminded of the quaintness of that assumption in July , when researcher Dan Kaminsky disclosed a serious vulnerability in the DNS system .
Experts say the new demonstration targets a potentially larger weakness .
" It 's a huge issue .
It 's at least as big an issue as the DNS issue , if not bigger , " said Peiter " Mudge " Zatko , noted computer security expert and former member of the L0 pht hacking group , who testified to Congress in 1998 that he could bring down the internet in 30 minutes using a similar BGP attack , and disclosed privately to government agents how BGP could also be exploited to eavesdrop .
" I went around screaming my head about this about ten or twelve years ago ....
We described this to intelligence agencies and to the National Security Council , in detail . "
The man - in - the - middle attack exploits BGP to fool routers into re-directing data to an eavesdropper 's network .
Anyone with a BGP router ( ISPs , large corporations or anyone with space at a carrier hotel ) could intercept data headed to a target IP address or group of addresses .
The attack intercepts only traffic headed to target addresses , not from them , and it can't always vacuum in traffic within a network – say , from one AT&T customer to another .
The method conceivably could be used for corporate espionage , nation - state spying or even by intelligence agencies looking to mine internet data without needing the cooperation of ISPs .
BGP eavesdropping has long been a theoretical weakness , but no one is known to have publicly demonstrated it until Anton " Tony " Kapela , data center and network director at 5 Nines Data , and Alex Pilosov , CEO of Pilosoft , showed their technique at the recent DefCon hacker conference .
The pair successfully intercepted traffic bound for the conference network and redirected it to a system they controlled in New York before routing it back to DefCon in Las Vegas .
The technique , devised by Pilosov , does n't exploit a bug or flaw in BGP .
It simply exploits the natural way BGP works .
" We 're not doing anything out of the ordinary , " Kapela told Wired.com .
" There 's no vulnerabilities , no protocol errors , there are no software problems .
The problem arises ( from ) the level of interconnectivity that 's needed to maintain this mess , to keep it all working . "
The issue exists because BGP 's architecture is based on trust .
To make it easy , say , for e-mail from Sprint customers in California to reach Telefonica customers in Spain , networks for these companies and others communicate through BGP routers to indicate when they 're the quickest , most efficient route for the data to reach its destination .
But BGP assumes that when a router says it 's the best path , it 's telling the truth .
That gullibility makes it easy for eavesdroppers to fool routers into sending them traffic .
Here 's how it works .
When a user types a website name into his browser or clicks " send " to launch an e-mail , a Domain Name System server produces an IP address for the destination .
A router belonging to the user 's ISP then consults a BGP table for the best route .
That table is built from announcements , or " advertisements , " issued by ISPs and other networks – also known as Autonomous Systems , or ASes – declaring the range of IP addresses , or IP prefixes , to which they 'll deliver traffic .
The routing table searches for the destination IP address among those prefixes .
If two ASes deliver to the address , the one with the more specific prefix " wins " the traffic .
For example , one AS may advertise that it delivers to a group of 90,000 IP addresses , while another delivers to a subset of 24,000 of those addresses .
If the destination IP address falls within both announcements , BGP will send data to the narrower , more specific one .
To intercept data , an eavesdropper would advertise a range of IP addresses he wished to target that was narrower than the chunk advertised by other networks .
The advertisement would take just minutes to propagate worldwide , before data headed to those addresses would begin arriving to his network .
The attack is called an IP hijack and , on its face , is n't new .
But in the past , known IP hijacks have created outages , which , because they were so obvious , were quickly noticed and fixed .
That 's what occurred earlier this year when Pakistan Telecom inadvertently hijacked YouTube traffic from around the world .
The traffic hit a dead - end in Pakistan , so it was apparent to everyone trying to visit YouTube that something was amiss .
Pilosov 's innovation is to forward the intercepted data silently to the actual destination , so that no outage occurs .
Ordinarily , this should n't work – the data would boomerang back to the eavesdropper .
But Pilosov and Kapela use a method called AS path prepending that causes a select number of BGP routers to reject their deceptive advertisement .
They then use these ASes to forward the stolen data to its rightful recipients .
" Everyone ... has assumed until now that you have to break something for a hijack to be useful , " Kapela said .
" But what we showed here is that you do n't have to break anything .
And if nothing breaks , who notices ? "
Stephen Kent , chief scientist for information security at BBN Technologies , who has been working on solutions to fix the issue , said he demonstrated a similar BGP interception privately for the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security a few years ago .
Kapela said network engineers might notice an interception if they knew how to read BGP routing tables , but it would take expertise to interpret the data .
A handful of academic groups collect BGP routing information from cooperating ASes to monitor BGP updates that change traffic 's path .
But without context , it can be difficult to distinguish a legitimate change from a malicious hijacking .
There are reasons traffic that ordinarily travels one path could suddenly switch to another – say , if companies with separate ASes merged , or if a natural disaster put one network out of commission and another AS adopted its traffic .
On good days , routing paths can remain fairly static .
But " when the internet has a bad hair day , " Kent said , " the rate of ( BGP path ) updates goes up by a factor of 200 to 400 . "
Kapela said eavesdropping could be thwarted if ISPs aggressively filtered to allow only authorized peers to draw traffic from their routers , and only for specific IP prefixes .
But filtering is labor intensive , and if just one ISP declines to participate , it " breaks it for the rest of us , " he said .
" Providers can prevent our attack absolutely 100 percent , " Kapela said .
" They simply do n't because it takes work , and to do sufficient filtering to prevent these kinds of attacks on a global scale is cost prohibitive . "
Filtering also requires ISPs to disclose the address space for all their customers , which is not information they want to hand competitors .
Filtering is n't the only solution , though .
Kent and others are devising processes to authenticate ownership of IP blocks , and validate the advertisements that ASes send to routers so they do n't just send traffic to whoever requests it .
Under the scheme , the five regional internet address registries would issue signed certificates to ISPs attesting to their address space and AS numbers .
The ASes would then sign an authorization to initiate routes for their address space , which would be stored with the certificates in a repository accessible to all ISPs .
If an AS advertised a new route for an IP prefix , it would be easy to verify if it had the right to do so .
The solution would authenticate only the first hop in a route to prevent unintentional hijacks , like Pakistan Telecom's , but would n't stop an eavesdropper from hijacking the second or third hop .
For this , Kent and BBN colleagues developed Secure BGP ( SBGP ) , which would require BGP routers to digitally sign with a private key any prefix advertisement they propagated .
An ISP would give peer routers certificates authorizing them to route its traffic ; each peer on a route would sign a route advertisement and forward it to the next authorized hop .
" That means that nobody could put themselves into the chain , into the path , unless they had been authorized to do so by the preceding AS router in the path , " Kent said .
The drawback to this solution is that current routers lack the memory and processing power to generate and validate signatures .
And router vendors have resisted upgrading them because their clients , ISPs , have n't demanded it , due to the cost and man hours involved in swapping out routers .
Douglas Maughan , cybersecurity research program manager for the DHS's Science and Technology Directorate , has helped fund research at BBN and elsewhere to resolve the BGP issue .
But he 's had little luck convincing ISPs and router vendors to take steps to secure BGP .
" We have n't seen the attacks , and so a lot of times people do n't start working on things and trying to fix them until they get attacked , " Maughan said .
" ( But ) the YouTube ( case ) is the perfect example of an attack where somebody could have done much worse than what they did . "
ISPs , he said , have been holding their breath , " hoping that people do n’t discover ( this ) and exploit it . "
" The only thing that can force them ( to fix BGP ) is if their customers ... start to demand security solutions , " Maughan said .

BBC News , Calcutta
Mr Dutta has been an environmental activist for three decades
One of India 's leading environmental crusaders is planning to launch the country 's first Green party .
After his success in forcing old and polluting vehicles off the streets of the eastern city of Calcutta , Subhas Dutta says the time has come to set up a political party to protect the country 's environment .
" Many like me who fight for environment protection have realised we need a full fledged party in India .
Our movements are localised and it is not enough to operate as pressure groups or just fight legal battles , " Mr Dutta says .
He is due to visit the United Kingdom next month to meet the leaders of the Green Party there .
" We are also in touch with the Green Party of Germany , we want to understand how the Green parties operate in Europe before we launch a Green Party of India .
" But we will launch it soon , should we say , in a few months , " he says .
Mr Dutta says he was also in touch with leading environmentalists in India .
" This networking takes some time so that we have a truly national party , but we are more or less through with this , " he said .
Asked about how his party would be funded , Mr Dutta said he was hopeful that millions of Indians would donate for the Green Party " because they have become more and more environment conscious " .
He is , however , not very keen on donations from the corporate sector .
" We would prefer the corporates in private and public sector to take up some causes like Calcutta 's river front cleanup and development rather than give our party direct donations . "
' Opportunism ' Mr Dutta says Indian political parties do not pay attention to environment issues - and their manifestos ignore such concerns .
" When it comes to taking stands on environment protection causes , most political parties display rank opportunism . "
Mr Dutta 's campaign has resulted in a cleaner Calcutta Mr Dutta points out that West Bengal state 's opposition Trinamul Congress party opposes a chemical industry in Nayachar coastal area for fears of possible coastal pollution , but it takes to the streets in support of old vehicles which pollute Calcutta 's air .
Similarly , he says , the state 's governing Marxists were loathe to phase out old , polluting vehicles for fear of upsetting transport owners until they were forced by the court to act .
A chartered accountant by profession , Subhas Dutta has filed more court cases on environment and heritage protection issues than anybody else in India in the last three decades .
The issues he chose were diverse - from trying to ban vehicular traffic around the colonial Victoria Memorial monument , to fighting for those rendered deaf living around air force bases , to preventing sewage and waste disposal into Ganges river .
The latest was his petition to ban old and polluting vehicles in Calcutta to clean up its dangerously polluted air .
His crusade led to the Calcutta high court ban on vehicles which were 15 years old .
The Supreme Court of India upheld the ban .
After seeking several extensions , the city authorities finally enforced the ban from 1 August this year and that has dramatically reduced Calcutta 's air pollution levels .
" But this is clearly not enough .
For every success , I have several failures .
This is because our struggles are localised , we do n't have an all - India platform and we are mere pressure groups .
Until we operate at the decision - making level , we cannot protect India 's environment , " Mr Dutta says .

I have described the basic workings behind the business cycle more or less accurately .
However , I have noticed that some things in my description and conclusions remain inconsistent .
The lines between too much production spending and too much consumption spending are blurry and confusing .
It is necessary to distinguish between two different types of business cycles to clear this up :
The production business cycle and the consumption business cycle .
Both can occur separately or at the same time .
Rothbard and Mises hold that a credit expansion that aims at expanding consumer credit will not cause a business cycle :
Mises did not deal with the relatively new post - World War II phenomenon of large - scale bank loans to consumers , but these too cannot be said to generate a business cycle .
Inflationary bank loans to consumers will artificially deflect social resources to consumption rather than investment , as compared to the unhampered desires and preferences of the consumers .
But they will not generate a boom - bust cycle , because they will not result in “ over ” investment , which must be liquidated in a recession .
Not enough investments will be made , but at least there will be no flood of investments which will later have to be liquidated .
Hence , the effects of diverting consumption investment proportions away from consumer time preferences will be asymmetrical , with the overinvestment - business cycle effects only resulting from inflationary bank loans to business .
Indeed , the reason why bank financing of government deficits may be called simple rather than cyclical inflation is because government demands are “ consumption ” uses as decided by the preferences of the ruling government officials .
I am of a different opinion .
We have recently been able to witness the bust of one of the most severe consumer credit expansions , with significant effects on the alignment of productive factors .
But even when we approach it with Rothbard ’s explanation : if over - investment causes distortions then why would under - investment cause any less severe distortions ?
If anything , it will be even harder to ramp up new productive factors whose production has been neglected vs. having to abandon the use of excess capacity and move resources back into consumer based businesses .
Both cycles start with the same precondition .
A market unhampered by significant government and central bank intervention .
As described in the History of Money , gold and silver have emerged and are used as medium of exchange , money .
Individuals , in their function as consumers demand consumer goods , entrepreneurs employ individuals as workers , combine factors of production and produce consumer goods , seeking an entrepreneurial profit .
Individuals also decide to save a portion of their pay and make it available as capitalists in credit transactions against interest .
Thus it becomes feasible for some entrepreneurs to borrow this money and employ some individuals in projects that do n’t turn out consumer goods but more factors of production .
Those factors wo n’t turn out consumer goods immediately , but will turn out more and / or better consumer goods per unit of worker time in the future which enables the repayment of the loan with interest .
Whenever changes occur in any individual ’s behavior , or in the behavior of groups of individuals as a whole , market data will adjust accordingly .
We shall observe the effects of some fundamental changes in behavior .
If a significant number of consumers , for whatever reason , decide to consume more goods immediately and hence save less , several things may happen as a response :
– Entrepreneurs may abandon some projects that turn out factors of production and produce more consumer goods instead .
No change in interest rates or prices occurs .
Balance is restored by sacrificing more productive capacity in the future in exchange for more immediate consumption .
– Prices for demanded consumer goods may go up , thus crowding out previous consumers who will save more instead and make it available as credit to entrepreneurs .
Balance is restored by sacrificing one group ’s consumption for another one ’s .
No change in the supply of consumer goods or factors of production occurs .
– Due to less available savings , interest rates for credit may go up .
Some entrepreneurs will borrow less money for the production of new factors of production and rather produce more consumer goods .
Balance is restored by sacrificing future consumption for immediate consumption .
– A combination of all of the above may occur , only that none of the events would go all the way but rather all of them go a fraction of the way .
Also , a sequential progression of the events may occur , e.g .
Prices go up as an intermediary step , but entrepreneurs immediately respond with more production of consumer goods vs. factors of production .
Similar adjustments would occur if , say , some consumers decide to consume less in the present and save more for the future .
Entrepreneurs may produce fewer consumer goods and more productive factors ; or prices for consumer goods may fall , attracting previously abstaining consumers ; or interest rates may fall , making previously abstaining entrepreneurs borrow more money in order to produce more factors of production in lieu of consumer goods .
The main point in all of this is that any of these events ensures that market data is restored and aligned to the individuals ’ demands and expectations .
None of the adjustment procedures come without temporary pains , such as layoffs by one entrepreneur in order to adjust for the changed demands , and the necessity for the laid off workers to find new work or learn new things .
Also , overall production will initially decline , as current operations are abandoned and new ones need to be ramped up .
A temporary recession might be necessary .
But the quicker the adjustment , the more bearable and temporary will the pain be .
It is now necessary to observe the events caused by credit expansion and their effect on the behavior of market participants .
The government turns the paper tickets issued in return for gold into fiat money .
It outlaws the use of gold money .
It grants to the central bank and fractional reserve banks the exclusive right and protection to issue fiat money .
The Consumption Business Cycle
The central bank and fractional reserve banks create new fiat money and make it available in credit transactions to individuals who intend to use the money for the purposes of consumption .
Examples would be car loans and home loans which made the US economy align its productive factors accordingly over the past decades .
It is likely , but not necessary that interest rates for such credit instruments will drop initially .
Some individuals may now enter into these new credit transactions and use the new money to consume goods that they would n’t have consumed before .
But they did n’t do so by reducing their savings , nor did anybody else sacrifice consumption to make this money available .
It was created out of nothing .
No additional consumer goods have been produced .
The prices for the goods demanded will begin to increase .
Entrepreneurs will respond by abandoning the production of some additional factors of production and turn out more consumer goods instead .
So long as more credit is channeled into the system , prices will continue to increase while entrepreneurs try to catch up .
Fractional reserve banks will begin to earn more interest revenue and expand their operations and resource usage .
Businesses that produce consumer goods will report higher profits , while profits for businesses producing factors of production and basic materials will lag behind .
A myriad of consumer goods based businesses will spring up over time .
The alignment for immediate consumption vs. more / better future consumption continues so long as individuals continue to be able to pay interest on the credit transactions performed and expect to be able to do so in future .
But as explained above , making interest payments and paying off debt is only possible in the long run if the workforce , as a whole over time , becomes more productive per unit of labor .
But the opposite occurs .
Productivity per labor unit will be lower than the additional consumer loans appeared to indicate , since in an unhampered system credit can only come out of savings ( which means someone somewhere forgoes immediate consumption , making room for more factors of production ) .
After a certain period , the amount of debt and interest payments will become higher than consumers can afford .
In addition , due to lower interest rates , a lot of rather risky loans were made to individuals that would not have occurred in the unhampered state .
Individuals will begin to default on their interest payments .
They start realizing that they need to consume less and save more in order to not have this happen again .
Their demand for additional credit drops sharply .
Their demand for money to pay off the debt and / or generate savings rises .
The fractional reserve banks will begin to slow down the creation of additional credit .
They begin reporting losses on existing consumer debt .
As excess consumption comes to a halt consumer prices begin to fall , businesses aligned for the production of consumer goods will see declining profits , some will start reporting losses .
They realize that they will have to abandon some projects since the demand for consumer goods starts to fall back to sustainable levels that match everyone ’s time preference and expectations .
The desire to consolidate one ’s finances takes priority over everything else .
The further the excessive consumption went , the more severe this necessary correction will be .
Adjusting the existing productive factors and workers to turn out more factors of production instead of consumer goods will take some ramp up time during which overall less will be produced and consumed .
A recession occurs which aligns resources back toward the initial state .
The longer individuals take to adjust their consumption behavior , the longer the recession will take .
This applies particularly in the case where the government tries to step in and slow down the overall decline in demand .
The Production Business Cycle
The central bank and fractional reserve banks create new fiat money and make it available in credit transactions to individuals who intend to use the money for the purposes of purchasing factors of production .
Examples would be business loans .
It is likely , but not necessary that interest rates for such credit instruments will drop initially .
Some entrepreneurs may now enter into these new credit transactions and use the new money to purchase factors of production that they would n’t have purchased before .
But they did n’t do so by reducing their consumption , nor did anybody else sacrifice such purchases to make this money available .
It was created out of nothing .
No additional factors of production have been produced .
Also , a lot of risky projects will be embarked upon that no one was willing to make money available for , based on the entrepreneurial interest component offered .
The prices for the factors of production demanded will begin to increase .
Entrepreneurs will respond by abandoning the production of some consumer goods and turn out more factors of production instead .
So long as more credit is channeled into the system , prices will continue to increase while entrepreneurs try to catch up .
Businesses that produce factors of production will report higher profits , while profits for businesses producing consumer goods will lag behind .
A myriad of businesses that create productive factors will spring up over time .
The alignment for more / better future consumption vs. immediate consumption continues so long as businesses accept more debt and continue to be able to pay interest on the credit transactions performed .
But the consumers ’ demands have not changed .
They still desire the same amount of consumer goods as before .
The prices for immediate consumer goods will rise sharply while the workforce is aligned in projects that will only turn out more goods in the distant future .
This will continue until prices for immediate consumption goods move so high that businesses will be impelled to adjust their operations and service the immediate demands again .
They will abandon the usage of a part of the obtained productive factors and halt additional purchases thereof .
They will also slow down on efforts such as research and development that only yield an outcome in the farther future .
In addition to that , some of the riskier projects will naturally begin to fail .
They start realizing that they need to purchase fewer factors of production and produce more consumer goods in order to not have this happen again .
Their demand for additional credit drops sharply .
The fractional reserve banks will begin to slow down the creation of additional credit .
They begin reporting losses on existing business debt .
Employed resources will have to be released and channeled into more consumer goods based businesses .
A recession occurs , aligning resources back toward uses that match individuals ’ time preferences .
The longer entrepreneurs take to adjust their purchasing behavior , the longer the recession will take .
This applies particularly in the case where the government tries to step in and slow down the overall decline in demand for factors of production .
Summary
Both described cycles stem from the same root :
The re-alignment of resources , induced by fractional reserve banks , and in last resort , the government .
The Production Business Cycle starts by changing the behavior of entrepreneurs , the Consumption Business Cycle starts by changing consumer behavior .
Both cycles may appear with overlaps , or even simultaneously .
While they may or may not cancel each other out as far as the impact on time preference behavior is concerned , their impact on encouraging overly risky behavior remains , even multiplies , and thus causes severe risk - based distortions that will require recessionary adjustments .
This is due to the fact that lower interest rates for business and consumer loans encourage the funding of higher risk individuals in both cases , due to a lower perceived entrepreneurial interest component .

Title : Samurai Champloo
Genre : Action
Company : Fuji TV / Manglobe Inc .
Format : 26 episodes
Dates : 20 May 2004 – 23 Sep 2004 and 22 Jan 2005 – 18 Mar 2005
Synopsis : Fuu , a young waitress at a teahouse is harassed by the son of a nobleman while on the job .
When things start to get out of hand , she is saved by a bad - tempered samurai named Mugen , who is annoyed by the situation .
Later that day , Mugen causes trouble of his own when he picks a fight with another customer , a more traditional samurai named Jin .
The two samurai vow to kill each other , but Fuu intervenes and makes them promise to put off killing each other until they help her find a samurai who smells of sunflowers .
The Highlights
Action : Excellently choreographed ; each character has a unique style .
Characters :
Feel more like characters than actual people .
Plot : Serves as a device for holding the short stories together ; does not receive enough attention .
Art : Similar to ukiyo-e paintings ; creates a very stylized and unique look .
Watanabe Shinichiro may be done directing Cowboy Bebop in reality , but he isnâ€™t done with it in spirit .
Samurai Champloo , Watanabe â€™s first full length series since Bebop , is riddled with the same slick style and cinema quality choreography that made Cowboy Bebop into a hit .
It is too bad that Samurai Champloo does not deserve the same level of praise as Cowboy Bebop due to its shortcomings .
The quality of the swordplay is top notch and approaches the quality of other legendary samurai anime , such as Rurouni Kenshin : Tsuiokuhen ( 1,2 ) .
Mugen and Jin have their own unique and vastly different styles of fighting , which contrast each other very nicely .
Jin fights with a traditional technique that is simply textbook , while Mugenâ€™s sporadic and unpredictable fighting style is full of wild movement and resembles break dancing more than anything else .
Even episodic characters have their own fighting styles , which makes every battle a joy to watch .
Samurai Champloo takes style to a level rarely seen in anime .
The artwork is similar in style to classic ukiyo-e paintings , which give the show a historic feeling .
The music is mostly hip - hop and stands apart from the more traditional art style .
Champloo , coming from the Okinawan word meaning â€ œto blendâ€ is the perfect name for this anime , which is inspired by a mixture of classic movies , hip - hop , and historical drama .
With such outstanding action and style it is a shame that the rest of the series is mediocre .
Fuuâ€™s quest for the Sunflower Samurai serves more as a tool to hold together the short stories that make up most of Samurai Champloo than a driving force , although the quest is given its own time at the end .
Most of the short stories are sub-par and donâ€™t elicit the same kind of fulfillment or provide the â€œa - haâ€ moments that successful episodic anime like Kinoâ€™s Journey and Cowboy Bebop have .
Not enough time is spent getting to know the characters , or what makes them tick .
The characters have personality , but not depth which leaves them feeling as two dimensional as they look .
When it comes to sword fighting and samurai anime Samurai Champloo is a cut ( pun very much intended ) above most of the competition .
The wide variety of inspiration gives Samurai Champloo a wide appeal and will provide the viewer with at least a few good stories .
Samurai Champloo isnâ€™t a bad anime ; just donâ€™t go into it expecting the next Cowboy Bebop .

NZ dollar jumps vs pound as BoE prints more money
NZ dollar jumps vs pound as BoE prints more money ; kiwi holds above 67 US cts
By Paul McBeth
August 7 ( BusinessWire ) – The New Zealand dollar jumped against the pound after the Bank of England expanded its quantitative easing programme and revived demand for the greenback as stocks on Wall Street edged lower .
The British central bank held interest rates at a record low 0.5 % as expected , but surprised the market by boosting its asset purchasing facility 50 billion pounds to 175 billion pounds , saying the banking sector needs to repair its balance sheet and will restrict the availability of credit .
The downbeat comments from the BoE encouraged investors to eschew higher - yielding , or riskier , assets in favour of the relative safety of the world ’s reserve currency .
The Dollar Index , a measure of the greenback versus a basket of six trading partners , climbed 0.3 % to 77.95 .
The kiwi outperformed other so - called risk currencies and held above 67 U.S. cents .
The British central bank ’s “ downbeat outlook for U.K. growth paved the way for U.S. dollar strength , ” said Danica Hampton , currency strategist at Bank of New Zealand .
“ The kiwi held up relatively well , only nudging slightly lower . ”
The New Zealand dollar was little changed at 67.05 U.S. cents from 67.04 cents yesterday , and jumped to 39.95 pence from 39.44 pence .
It rose to 62.21 on the trade - weighted index , or TWI , a measure of the currency versus a basket of trading partners , from 62.05 yesterday , and increased to 63.95 yen from 63.87 yen .
It advanced to 79.78 Australian cents from 79.69 cents yesterday , and gained to 46.71 euro cents from 46.54 cents .
Hampton said the currency may trade between 66.60 U.S. cents and 67.60 cents today .
She expects it will push above 68 cents in the coming weeks as investors remain optimistic that the global economy is well on the road to recovery .
The Reserve Bank of Australia will announce its monetary policy statement today , and currency traders will be looking to see if Governor Glenn Stevens hints at when the central bank will start hiking interest rates .
Australia managed to avoid a recession , and its unemployment rate fell below New Zealand ’s yesterday when it held steady at 5.8 % compared to a nine - year high 6 % across the Tasman .
Non -farm payrolls out today in the U.S. “ will have to be a real shocker ” to dampen global optimism , Hampton said .
America shed around 320,000 jobs in July , according to a Reuters survey , but “ it would take something like twice that ” to knock the wind out of investors ’ sentiment , she said .

[ Pardon this lengthy post , but this is an issue central to science and skepticism , and is thus very important .
I ask my readers to please read the whole thing .
I am not exaggerating when I say this issue has profound ramifications . ]
Simon Singh is a journalist in the UK ; he writes for the Guardian .
Moreover , he 's a science journalist , and a good one who , like so many of us , prefers reality the way it is .
The British Chiropractic Association , however , prefers reality to bend to their will .
They 've been making some outrageous claims lately about the efficacy of their " treatment " , things that are clearly wrong .
Simon wrote about this in a column , saying ,
The British Chiropractic Association claims that their members can help treat children with colic , sleeping and feeding problems , frequent ear infections , asthma and prolonged crying , even though there is not a jot of evidence .
This organisation is the respectable face of the chiropractic profession and yet it happily promotes bogus treatments .
Unsurprisingly , the BCA took a dim view of this .
So of course they produced copious variable - controlled double blind studies with statistically significant testing procedures to back up their claim .
HAHAHAHAHAHAhahahahahaha !
No , that would be silly !
Of course they did n't do that .
They sued him instead .
In the US that would be a dumb thing to do , as our libel laws put the burden of proof on the claimant ( in this case , the BCA ) , as things should be .
However , the UK is very different : when party A sues party B for libel , it 's up to party B to prove their innocence .
The ramifications of this are obvious : a chilling effect on dissent in the media against , well , anything .
If you call someone on the carpet for making fallacious claims , they can basically shut you up by suing you .
Not surprisingly , there are many people dissatisfied with this approach to libel , but it's what Simon is dealing with currently .
Worse , in Simon 's case , a judge ruling in the preliminary hearing agreed with the BCA , citing Simon 's use of the word " bogus " to mean that the BCA knowingly is perpetrating fraud .
The judge is obviously wrong here ;
Simon went to some pains to indicate in that very article that his use of bogus did not mean intentional fraud , but instead to mean wrong , as in chiropractic techniques cannot be used to cure the ills the BCA claims .
To understand this breathtaking lack of judicial wisdom on the part of the judge , one need only read Jack of Kent 's entry on the ruling .
Certainly , one could say that Jack of Kent may be biased , and did n't give a fair account of the case .
However , Jack also posted the actual official ruling in the case , and I draw your attention to sections 12 and 13 :
What [ Singh's ] article conveys is that the BCA itself makes claims to the public as to the efficacy of chiropractic treatment for certain ailments even though there is not a jot of evidence to support those claims .
That in itself would be an irresponsible way to behave and it is an allegation that is plainly defamatory of anyone identifiable as the culprit .
In this case these claims are expressly attributed to the claimant .
It goes further .
It is said that despite its outward appearance of respectability , it is happy to promote bogus treatments .
Everyone knows what bogus treatments are .
They are not merely treatments which have proved less effective than they were at first thought to be , or which have been shown by the subsequent acquisition of more detailed scientific knowledge to be ineffective .
Bogus treatments equate to quack remedies ; that is to say they are dishonestly presented to a trusting and , in some respects perhaps , vulnerable public as having proven efficacy in the treatment of certain conditions or illnesses , when it is known that there is nothing to support such claims .
Emphasis mine .
This clearly comes down to the definition of the word " bogus " .
Merriam - Webster calls it " not genuine : counterfeit , sham " .
Of those three , only sham denotes knowledge on the part of the person involved ; something can be not genuine or counterfeit , yet presented honestly if mistakenly .
It seems to me that this is a very narrow ruling based on the use of the word bogus to mean knowingly fraudulent , but Simon meant it to mean wrong and useless .
That does not mean the BCA was aware of the treatment being wrong and useless .
After all , they may honestly be peddling quack medicine .
So the judge is wrong , and Simon is doing the right thing : he 's appealing .
This is an extremely important decision on his part .
If he can appeal this ruling , he stands a chance of at least easing the libel laws somewhat , if only as a precedent when a judge makes a bad call .
There 's a lot of support for him .
I personally support him , as is clear from this post .
Sense about Science , a group supporting science education in the UK , has started a campaign called Keep the Libel Laws out of Science .
If you are a blogger or web site owner they have a button you can download to put on your site .
I have mine in the sidebar now .
There was a support meeting for Simon recently , and a lot of great people showed up ( he was introduced by my friend Professor Brian Cox ) .
James Randi and I issued a statement which was read there :
We at the JREF support Simon in his quest for justice .
It 's clear from his writing that his intent was not to claim that the BCA knowingly commits acts of fraud , but that the BCA is nonetheless incorrect in their claims of the efficacy of chiropractic .
Simon is , of course , correct .
Furthermore , the ruling , as it stands , would produce a chilling effect on the ability of journalists to question the claims of anyone , including pseudoscientists .
Whatever path Simon chooses over this issue , the JREF will be there , and to the best of our ability we 'll have his back .
We are thrilled Simon is appealing this frankly incorrect ruling , and you can bet we 'll be watching the proceedings carefully .
I will continue to post more information as I find it , and you can also check in on Sense about Science and Jack of Kent for more as well .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The debate over whether to have a government - backed insurance plan is fast becoming the most divisive health care reform issue .
And it 's a debate devoid of serious details about how such a plan would work .
Those details , of course , will matter to supporters and opponents ... a lot .
" There are many ways to skin a cat , " said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , D - Mont. , a leader on the issue .
Of course , lawmakers are not entertaining an endless number of ways to craft a public plan .
One option not on the table is a single - payer system -- whereby everyone would be enrolled in a national health insurance plan based on Medicare .
Such a plan does n't have the votes , according to Baucus and House Ways and Means Chairman Charles Rangel , D - N.Y .
But excluding the single - payer idea is where clarity in the debate ends .
What form a public plan would take is anyone 's guess .
A competitor to private insurers : Supporters of a public plan say it would push private insurers to lower costs and provide better coverage .
Private insurers fear a public plan will be too hard to compete with , especially if the government dictates how much it reimburses providers .
The House Progressive Caucus , which has more than 70 members , put out a statement on Monday calling for " robust " public option in the absence of a single - payer system , which many of its members would prefer .
Specifically , the caucus wants a plan that charges premiums " at the lowest levels possible , not tied to the rates of private insurance plans " and would " have the ability to structure the provider rates to promote quality care ... . "
The caucus also wants a public plan to " establish or negotiate rates " with drug and health equipment companies " to achieve the lowest prices for consumers . "
It opposes any provisions that would undermine or limit where or to whom the public plan is available .
Democrats on the Senate 's Health , Education , Labor and Pension Committee want a public plan , said Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , who is leading the charge in the absence of committee chairman Ted Kennedy due to brain cancer .
But a framework for one will be left out of its bill intentionally , Dodd said Tuesday .
" I left those areas open for discussion -- not because they are open for some decision about whether or not we ought to move in that direction . "
Other lawmakers worry an unbridled public option would set the stage for unfair competition .
Last week , after a meeting of key senators from both parties , Baucus said they had agreed on some basic principles if there is a public option , according to Congress Daily .
" Make sure it does n't set prices , [ and ] there really is competition , where government is very , very light . "
A fallback : Fiscally conservative Democrats , known as the Blue Dogs , are not endorsing a public plan but will support one if it meets certain requirements .
Specifically , claims covered by a public plan would have to be paid for by premiums and co-payments .
And reimbursement rates would have to be negotiated with the health care providers rather than based on Medicare rates .
The Blue Dogs , a 51 - member coalition , do n't want medical providers to be forced to participate .
And the public plan must only be a " fallback " option triggered " in the absence of adequate competition and cost containment . "
" We cannot create a public option that stacks the deck -- through rate setting and forced participation -- against a system that currently provides coverage to 160 million Americans , " said Rep. Mike Ross , D - Ark. , in a statement from the coalition .
One way a fallback could be structured is for a public plan to take effect immediately in areas where there 's very little choice among insurance carriers .
But it would only be triggered nationally if lawmakers determine cost containment has n't worked .
" It 's basically a threat [ to private insurers ] , " said Paul Fronstin , director of the health research program at the Employee Benefit Research Institute .
A nonprofit cooperative : Sen. Kent Conrad , D - N.D. , has suggested a possible compromise on a public plan option that could satisfy opponents who fear government control .
Conrad is floating a proposal that would create state - based or regionally based nonprofit co-op insurance plans in which participants pay into the plan and if there 's any money left at the end of the year , it would be paid back to participants or used to lower premiums or improve benefits .
The co-op plans would be subject to the same rules as private insurers .
And they would not be run by the federal government , although they might receive seed money from Uncle Sam .
So whether a co-op plan would be considered " public " is a question mark .
And that could be its selling point .
On Monday , Baucus said , " we 're trying to figure out a way to help keep the insurance companies ' feet to the fire in a way that does n't frighten Republicans away because it sounds too much like government . "
How many people would join a public plan ?
No matter the details of a public plan , there 's no telling how it will alter the health insurance landscape .
" It 's very difficult to say what people will do without looking at health reform in general , " Fronstin said .
That 's because the interaction between all the reforms eventually enacted could influence employers ' decisions to keep or drop the coverage they offer .
For instance , some proposals mandate that individuals get insurance and that companies help them .
There are proposals to set up a public insurance exchange in which consumers chooses from a bevy of health plans .
And many proposals would prohibit insurers from denying anyone coverage based on health status .
Leaders from both parties say that however health reform is done , if you like the insurance plan you have , you can keep it .
" But what they do n't say is [ that it ] may not be around any longer , " Fronstin said .

How To Achieve Classy - sounding Results Mastering By Craig Anderton
Many home recordists hope to perfect their productions by doing their own mastering on their studio computer .
However , few seem to achieve the classy results they 're after .
So how much can you realistically achieve by going it alone , and what techniques will give the highest - quality results ?
Mastering is a vital part of the recording process , so much so that a substantial amount of mythology is associated with it .
We 've all heard stories of high - priced mastering engineers with mystical , proprietary gear based on gilded vacuum tubes salvaged from ancient Russian submarines ... or something similar .
But we 've also heard of computer studio owners with a two - track editor and a few plug-ins who have started mastering their own material .
What gives ?
Prior to the digital revolution , mastering had a very defined set of functions .
You brought your finished mixes on tape to a mastering engineer , who would often bounce them to another tape through various signal processors designed to sweeten the sound .
The tunes would then be assembled in the desired order , and acetate test pressings would be made to evaluate the final product prior to mass - producing albums .
Mastering was rightly regarded as an arcane , mystifying art .
Few musicians had access to the high - end , expensive tools needed to do mastering , nor did they have the experience of someone who had listened to thousands of recordings , and knew how to make them ready for the real world .
Today , the tools for quality mastering are finally within the financial and technical reach of anyone who 's serious about recording .
But 95 percent of mastering is not in the tools — it 's in the ears .
Unless you have the ears of a mastering engineer , you can't expect any plug - in to provide them for you .
Besides , much of the point of using a mastering engineer is to bring in an objective set of ears to make any needed changes prior to release .
So does this mean only experts should attempt to do mastering ?
No .
Firstly , not all mastering situations require a professional 's touch .
Maybe you have a live recording that you want to give to friends or sell at gigs .
Sure , you can just duplicate the mixes , but a mastered ' veneer ' will give your listeners a better experience .
Or perhaps you 've recorded several tunes and want to test how they flow together as an album .
Why not master it yourself ?
After you 've sorted out the order and such , you can always take the individual mixes to a pro mastering engineer .
And when you do , you 'll be able to talk about what you want in more educated terms , because you 're more familiar with the process , and you 'll have listened to your work with mastering in mind .
Besides , the only way to get good at anything is practice .
For years , I used only professional mastering engineers ; I would never have dreamed of doing mastering myself .
But I learned a lot from observing them , started mastering my own material , and now people hire me to master their recordings because they like the results I get .
Still , if you have any doubts whatsoever about your abilities , seek out a professional who can present your music in the best possible light .
Most mastering is done with specialised digital audio editing programs such as Sonic Foundry Sound Forge , Steinberg Wavelab , Bias Peak , Adobe Audition , and so on .
These offer good navigation facilities , the ability to zoom in on waveforms , pencil tools to draw out clicks , and plug-ins for mastering tasks ( along with the ability to host third - party plug- ins ) .
However , if your requirements are n't too demanding , there are several ways to master using conventional multitrack recording programs .
And , interestingly , some can even do tricks conventional digital audio editors can't .
The mastering process should actually begin with mixing , as there are several steps you can take while mixing to make for easier mastering .
You should do these whether you plan to master material yourself , or hand your project to a mastering engineer .
If you recorded your music in high - resolution audio , then mix as high - resolution files .
Maintain the higher resolution throughout the mastering process , and only dither down to 16 - bit at the very end , when you 're about to create CDs .
Do not dither individual mixes , and do n't add any fades while mixing — fades and crossfades should be done while mastering , when you have a better sense of the ideal fade time .
As for trimming the starts and ends of tracks , with some music you may decide it 's better to have a little room noise between cuts rather than dead silence , or to leave a few milliseconds of anticipatory space before the first note to avoid too abrupt a transition from silence to music .
Another consideration involves the possible need for noise reduction .
Sometimes there may be a slight hiss , hum , or other constant noise at a very low level .
If you can obtain a clean sample of this sound , it can be loaded into a noise - reduction program that mathematically subtracts the noise from the track .
Even if this noise is way down in level , removing it can improve the sound in a subtle way by opening up the sound stage and improving stereo separation .
Do n't add any processing to the overall mix , just to individual channels .
Processing completed mixes is best left for mastering .
As you mix , you should also watch closely for distortion — a few overloads may not be audible as you listen to the mix , but may be accentuated if you add EQ or limiting while mastering .
It 's better to concede a few decibels of headroom rather than risk distortion .
It 's not necessarily a good idea to add normalisation , as that means another stage of DSP ( which may degrade the sound , however slightly ) — and you may need to change the overall level anyway when assembling all the mixes into a finished album .
Finally , always back up your original mixed files prior to mastering .
If the song is later remastered for any reason — for a high - resolution re-release , a compilation , or for use in any other context — you 'll want a mix that 's as easy to remaster as possible .
Does It Work In Mono ?
As a final reality check , switch the master buss output to mono and make sure that there 's no weakening or thinning out of the sound .
At the mastering stage , there is n't much you can do to fix this ; you 'll need to go back to the mix and analyse the individual tracks to see where the problem resides .
Typical culprits include effects that alter phase to create a super - wide stereo spread , but problems can also occur when miking an instrument with two mics spaced at different distances from the source .
You can always try flipping the phase of one channel , and if that fixes the phase issues , great .
But the odds are against that doing any good .
In any event , do n't forget to switch the bussing back to stereo when exporting the file or burning a CD !
A major difference between mastering in a MIDI +
Audio sequencer and using a digital audio editor is that you have the option to adjust mastering processors ( which affect the final mixed output ) as you mix .
With digital audio editors , you are always working off - line with a previously mixed file .
However , there are advantages and disadvantages to both methods .
The process of mixing is daunting enough without throwing mastering into the equation ; however , mastering while you mix means you know exactly what the final version will sound like .
But remember that a huge part of conventional mastering is about involving someone who can be more objective about what needs to be done with your music .
Unless that person can sit in on the mix and adjust the mastering processors , you 're better off giving them your files and some space to do their job right .
If you decide to master as you mix , you 'll be putting your mastering processors in busses .
This is because when you create a non-surround multitrack project , eventually all the tracks are going to dump through a mixer into a master stereo output buss .
As with individual channels , this should have provisions for adding plug - in effects .
How effects are accommodated depends on the program ; for example , with Cakewalk Sonar , the busses have standard effects slots , just like tracks .
But Steinberg 's Cubase SX has a few extra touches : both pre-fader and post - fader slots for effects , as well as excellent dithering algorithms for cutting your high - resolution audio down to a lower bit resolution .
( If a program does n't include an effects slot after the main output level control , you may be able to feed one buss into another to achieve a similar signal chain — insert the effect into the second buss , and control overall level at the output of the first buss . )
Once your plug - in effects have been added and edited as desired , you have three main options to create a mastered file :
Render ( also called bounce or export ) the track to hard disk .
This reads the signal at the final output , including the results of any effects you 've added , and writes the file to hard disk .
This is your final , mastered track .
However , it still needs to be assembled with other tracks to create a complete CD .
Send the output to a stand - alone CD or DAT recorder .
This will record the final , mastered song although , again , you 'll still need to assemble these .
Send the output through analogue mastering processors , record their outputs into two empty tracks in your multitrack , then export those tracks to your hard disk .
( See the ' Adding Outboard Processors To A Multitrack Host ' box for more on this ) .
Of course , if you choose to do real - time mastering , you 'd better get things right the first time , because if you want to make any changes later you wo n't be working with the raw mix file .
For example , if you decide there 's too much multi- band compression , you wo n't be able to undo this , and neither will any mastering engineer ; you 'll have to do another mix .
Adding Outboard Processors To A Multitrack Host
There are some superb hardware outboard mastering tools , both analogue and digital , that you may prefer to plug-ins with similar functionality .
If your multitrack host has an audio interface with multiple outputs , there 's no reason why you can't use them .
Martin Walker wrote a lengthy article on using outboard gear with computer workstations in the SOS March 2004 , but the basic idea is that you send the mix buss to a hardware output on your audio interface , process the signal with the hardware processor , then blast the audio back into the computer 's audio interface inputs .
Once you 've selected the appropriate inputs within your recording software , you can record the processed results and then replace the original mix with the processed version .
Voilà — hardware processing for your tunes .
There is another technique which makes a compromise between mastering as you mix and mastering off - line .
After having a song mastered , you 'll sometimes wish you had mixed the song a little differently , because mastering brings out some elements that might have been less obvious while mixing .
For example , it 's not uncommon to find out when compressing at the mastering stage that the mix changes subtly , requiring you to go back and do a quick remix ( another reason why mix automation is so useful ) .
So , to create a more mastering - friendly mix , consider adding some multi-band compression and overall EQ ( usually a little more high - end ' air ' and some tweaks in the bass ) in the master buss to create a more ' mastered ' sound .
Mix the tune while monitoring through these processors .
Then , when you render or otherwise save the file , bypass the master effects you used .
This results in a raw mix you can master in a separate program ( or give to a mastering engineer ) and which anticipates the use of mastering processors without incorporating their effects in the file .
Should you do this , make sure that the levels remain optimised when you remove the processors — you may need to tweak the overall level .
If you plan to use a mastering engineer , do not be tempted to present them with a ' pre- mastered ' mix where you 've tried to take the sound part of the way towards where you want it .
Always provide the raw , two - track ( or surround ) mix with no mastering effects .
However , it may be worth creating a separate version of the tune that uses mastering effects to give the engineer an idea of the type of sound you like .
The engineer can then translate your ideas into something perhaps even better , while taking your desires into account .
Splitting The Stereo Channels
I 've also used a multitrack host to do audio restoration and remastering of a tune that was recorded in the '60s ; this would have been very difficult to do with a conventional digital audio editor .
One instrument was overly prominent in only the left channel and this needed to be fixed .
I split the stereo signal into two mono tracks , and loaded each one into the host .
Through a combination of equalisation , dynamics control , and level automation in just the right spots , I was able to reduce the level of the problematic instrument .
As this also reduced the apparent level of the left channel , I used a combination of panning on the individual tracks and balance control on the output buss to restore a better sense of balance .
Mastering a multitrack project in real time is a fairly new technique ; it 's definitely not for everyone , nor is it suitable for all situations .
So let 's look at two traditional approaches to mastering that use your computer more like a standard digital audio editor .
The more old - school approach is to take each tune , master it , then as a separate operation assemble all the tunes into a cohesive whole .
A newer approach is to assemble all the tunes first and then apply any processing on a more global level .
Basically , this combines both mastering and assembly into one operation .
Let 's look at the ' individual song ' approach first .
Open up a new file and import the mix into a track .
If you need to process the right and left channels independently ( for example , if there 's an instrument in the left channel that has excessive treble , and you want to EQ just that channel a bit without processing the right channel ) , then separate the stereo file into two mono files ( typically using a digital audio editor ) and import each one into its own track .
You may also be able to bring a stereo file into two tracks , use the balance control to separate the left and right tracks , then re-combine them .
Here are some of the editing operations you might want to do :
Reduce Peaks Using Automation :
If some peaks are significantly louder than the rest of the material , this reduces the chance to have a higher average level , as the peaks use up much of the headroom .
One solution is to add limiting , but another option that can affect the sound less is to use an automation envelope to reduce the levels of just those peaks .
If the automation works on just a single cycle of the waveform , you probably wo n't hear any difference compared to not reducing that peak ; but once the major peaks are reduced , you 'll be able to raise the overall level .
Furthermore , if you do add any compression , it wo n't have to work as hard .
Add Dynamics Processing : Generally , you 'll use a dynamics plug - in for the track holding the file , or possibly for the buss it feeds .
Multi - band dynamics processors are your best option ; compared to standard compressors , they 're more transparent , because dynamics control in one frequency band does n't affect other frequency bands .
However , some people like slamming a stereo compressor , because they can hear some ' pumping ' and ' breathing ' , which gives more of a vintage sound .
Another popular option is a loudness maximiser plug - in , like the venerable Waves L1 .
This type of processor can greatly increase the overall average level , producing a hotter sound .
These plug-ins are often overused on today 's recordings , which creates distortion and degrades definition .
As a rule of thumb , I advise increasing the amount of maximisation until you can hear the effect working .
Then reduce the amount so you do n't hear it working .
Eventually you 'll find a sweet spot where you can increase overall loudness while retaining good dynamics .
No matter what form of dynamics control you use , it will affect the mix by reducing peaks and bringing up lower - level sounds .
This is equivalent to having a more even mix , and might be desirable .
But if the mix ends up sounding too uniform , reduce the amount of maximisation .
Peaks and valleys are essential to a satisfying listening experience .
A really loud cut may seem impressive at first , but it becomes fatiguing after a short period of time .
Add Equalisation :
For mastering , you 'll hopefully be dealing in broad strokes — a mild bass cut , or a little high - end lift .
This is why many older equalisers are favoured for mastering , because they have a subtle , yet pleasing , effect on the sound .
Plug-ins like Steinberg 's TLA1 , PSP's MasterQ , and the UAD1's Pultec emulation fulfil this role in software .
Significant EQ problems , like large mid-range or low - end peaks , should have been fixed in the mixing process .
If they were n't , you 're likely need to plug in a full - blown parametric EQ , and tweak out the individual problems .
Your audio editor probably already includes EQ , but be careful about using it .
Built - in EQs are usually optimised so you can open lots of instances at the same time , which means they can't consume too much CPU power .
Mastering - oriented plug-ins , on the other hand , tend to eat more power , but it does n't matter because you 're using them on a simple stereo file rather than running a bunch of audio tracks and soft synths .
Other Processing Goodies :
Some people swear by particular plug-ins for mastering , like enhancers , stereo - image wideners , and the like .
I tend to avoid these because dynamics and EQ cover 99 percent of what 's needed in most cases .
But I have found situations where a little high - frequency exciter helps add a different kind of sparkle than EQ , and once I even added a phasing effect in the middle of a tune during a spoken - word part ( the client loved it ) .
I think if a mix has a certain direction , it 's often best to enhance what you have rather than try to turn it into something completely different .
You can do album assembly in a multitrack host , and once the tracks are in the desired order you render the whole thing to disk as one large file .
If needed , you can then import this file into a CD - burning program to add track markers , CD Text , and so forth .
If you 're editing within a multitrack application , the files can either be placed end to end in a single track , or you can spread them over several different tracks .
For example , one project I mastered had three distinctly different ' flavours ' of mixes : some were mixed in a studio which probably had bad acoustics , because the bass was too heavy ; another set of mixes was very neutral ( just the kind I like to work with ) ; and the third set had compression applied to the master buss , and were already somewhat squashed .
I sorted each type onto its own track , and applied the same processing to like - sounding files .
The bass - heavy ones needed a different kind of EQ to the neutral - sounding ones , and I also added multi-band compression to both of these tracks .
The songs that were already compressed did n't get any multi- band compression , but did need a fair amount of EQ — this created a few peaks , so I added a small amount of limiting .
As mentioned earlier , a multitrack host allows you to do tricks that may be difficult with a dedicated digital audio editing program .
This is particularly true with dance music , where you have a continuous stream of sound .
It 's easy to create crossfades , for example , either using an automatic crossfade function where overlapping two tracks creates a crossfade , or by having the tunes on separate tracks and adding fades manually .
You can also dedicate a separate track for transitions or sound effects when doing a dance mix , add track automation to bring effects in and out ( to increase a high - pass filter 's cutoff as a song fades , for instance , so it seems to disappear just before the next track comes in ) , and so on .
This process essentially creates a ' meta - mix ' where , instead of mixing individual tracks to create a two - track file , you 're mixing two - track files to create a final album .
We noted that Steinberg Cubase SX 's busses have slots both before and after the gain control .
In general , you would place your processing plug-ins prior to the gain control , and your dithering after the gain control .
However , things get more complex when you start using effects .
Suppose you 're mixing a tune that has an abrupt end , but you want a delay or reverb tail to spill over .
If the echo is generated before the master output and you pull down the master fader for the abrupt end , the echo will stop too .
Therefore , you need to place the delay after the fader , and place dithering after the delay .
If there 's only one post - fader slot , then chain two busses and insert the dithering in the second buss .
Some multitrack hosts do n't have an option to place effects after the final gain control , thus making it difficult to implement the delay effect mentioned above .
For example , Cakewalk Sonar 's master fader is always at the buss output .
But it also has a trim control that can change the incoming level to the buss .
This alters the level going to the effect , but not the effect output .
With the above example of delay , you might even want to use both controls : pull down on the input trim to create the abrupt end , then as the echoes fade out reduce the main buss fader .
Alternatively , you could use this technique if you had loudness maximisation patched into a master buss and you wanted to push the sound harder on some tracks .
For example , let 's say I inserted Waves L1 into the master buss in Sonar , with the threshold set to - 3.0dBFS , and the output ceiling set at - 0.1dBFS .
Any signal louder than - 3dBFS will force the limiter to start attenuating the signal .
Increasing the level of the input trim control pushes more signal into the L1 , causing a greater degree of loudness maximisation .
No matter how hard you push the input trim control , the clipping / overload indicators will remain unlit , because the L1 's output ceiling has been set to - 0.1dBFS , so you have to be careful that you do n't overdo things .
Mastering For Vinyl
Although the market for vinyl is now minuscule at best , it remains important for DJs and some audio purists who regard CDs as an invention of Satan that is destined to cause the end of Western civilisation as we know it .
So let 's address the issue of mastering for vinyl .
Despite what you may have heard , mastering for vinyl is the easiest type of mastering you can do , as it involves only two steps :
Present your final mixes to that person and say " Here , you do it . "
Vinyl is an unforgiving medium , and mastering for it is extremely difficult .
Its dynamic range is a puny 50 dB or so , even with decent vinyl , compared to the 80 dB or more we enjoy with even the most basic digital media .
As a result , compression is essentially mandatory to shoehorn music 's wide dynamic range into vinyl 's narrow dynamic range .
But vinyl has other problems .
There 's a trade - off between loudness and length .
This is because a groove in a record is just a waveform , and a louder waveform will cause the groove to have a wider physical excursion .
So , to get a lot of material on an LP , you have to cut the vinyl at a pretty low level .
Bass is also troublesome .
Bass waveforms have a very wide excursion and , with stereo , if the left and right channels are even slightly out of phase , the stylus can ' jump the track ' as it tries in vain to follow different curves for the right and left channels .
We take concepts like stereo bass for granted now , but back in the days of vinyl bass had to be mono .
And that 's not all !
As the record gets closer to the end , the tone arm hits the groove at more of an angle ( except with linear - tracking turntables ) , causing what 's called inner groove distortion .
As a result , song orders often used to be created with the softest songs coming at the end of an album 's side , so that the inner grooves would be less subject to distortion .
In the old days , recording engineers were well aware of the limitations of vinyl , and took them into account during the recording process .
Many of today 's engineers were brought up in an essentially vinyl - less world , and do n't consider the problems discussed above .
This makes it more important than ever to use a mastering engineer who is an expert in the art .
When it comes to mastering for vinyl , the advice is simple : do n't try this at home !
Although most modern audio software packages use 32 - bit floating - point audio engines and have lots of headroom , overloading can still occur unless levels are set properly , especially if the master buss is the sum of different channels .
Clipping indicators are helpful , but programs that include a numeric read - out of how much a peak level is above or below 0dBFS are far more useful .
This value , called the ' margin ' , is positive if the level is above 0dBFS and negative if below .
If possible , I generally enable any kind of peak - hold feature so that I can see the highest level attained at the end of a song without having to keep my eyes glued to the meters .
Note that if the margin indicator is n't reset automatically ( when you click the transport stop button , for instance ) , you 'll have to clear the value manually from time to time .
The faders themselves should also be calibrated ; here 's an example of how to use this feature .
Suppose the fader is currently set to 0 dB gain , and you send in a signal that reaches - 3dBFS .
The margin indicator will also show - 3dBFS .
If the master fader setting is - 1.5 d B and you feed in the same - 3dBFS signal , then the margin indicator would show - 4.5dBFS — the original value , less the amount of attenuation provided by the master fader .
Ideally , the margin should indicate not 0dBFS but slightly less — say - 0.1dBFS .
This is important , because if a tune has peaks that hit 0dBFS for more than a few milliseconds , it may be rejected by a CD pressing plant on the assumption that those peaks represent distortion .
To set the master fader for the highest possible level short of distortion , first reset the margin indicators , then play the tune through from start to finish .
When it 's over , check the margin and note the reading .
Let 's say it 's - 4.1dBFS .
As you want the margin to read - 0.1dBFS , that means the overall level needs to be raised by 4dB .
Now note the fader reading .
We 'll assume it shows 1.5dB .
We want to add another 4 dB of level , so if we set the fader reading to 5.5dB , then the next time the song plays from start to finish the margin should indicate - 0.1dBFS .
I certainly would n't want to imply that following the above techniques will make you a mastering engineer .
However , I believe that if you apply these ideas correctly you 'll end up with mixes that sound better than before — and that 's the whole point .
Besides , if you start working on your mastering chops now , you just might discover a whole new outlet for your creativity .

There is probably no better indicator of market volatility than the current price to earnings ratio of the S&P 500 .
The market volatility is spectacular and we are seeing more gyrations in this recession than we did during the Great Depression .
Since March when the S&P 500 touched the 666 mark , the rally has boosted the index by 54 percent .
Was this caused by stunning second quarter earnings ?
Absolutely not .
With nearly 97 percent of all companies now reporting earnings for the second quarter , the S&P 500 PE ratio sits at 129 .
This is by far the most over hyped rally in the world .
First , let us look at this insanity on a chart :
Source : Chart of the Day
I think when people see charts like this they start doubting the source .
This unfortunately is accurate .
Even during the Great Depression , when the market plunged to the depths , the PE ratio never even touched 20 and some of the many mini-rallies after the crash of 1929 involved legitimate looks at low PE ratios .
A PE ratio is important because it factors in the price of a stock to the actual earnings .
This matters .
Even right before the tech bubble burst in 2000 the S&P 500 had a PE ratio over 40 and this was extremely expensive .
In this case , we have 26,000,000 Americans unemployed or underemployed and earnings are simply not there with consumers pulling back .
So what is causing this massive rally if not earnings ?
This recent rally is being driven by the “ getting less worse ” mentality .
Sure , we lost 247,000 official jobs last month but sure beats 700,000 !
Okay , earnings are way low but it beats actually losing money !
This kind of thinking is leading many sheep to the slaughter again .
Take a look at some of the official data from S&P itself :
Source : S&P
At the end of last month , only three weeks ago the S&P 500 data had the PE ratio at 143 .
So to currently have it at 129 is a slight improvement .
But with only 3 percent of companies reporting to close out the quarter , we are massively over priced .
We have never seen the entire index suffer a negative earnings quarter that is until recently .
So the crash was n’t a panic but actually based on declining earnings .
That quarter saw $ 202 billion in negative earnings ( losses ) from S&P 500 companies reporting .
Q1 of 2009 saw reported earnings come in at $ 7.52 per share .
So right now , everything looks good when looking from the ground up .
Yet to show you how off predictions have been and how wrong analyst can have earnings , let us look at the Q3 2009 estimates and how they have evolved over one year :
Now this chart is something .
Back in June of last year , the Q3 2009 estimate was coming in at $ 27.68 .
Keep in mind we were already in recession at that point .
In September of 2008 , the EPS did n’t change much for analysts .
After the market crashed and the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve had to step in to save the financial world supposedly , they finally revised earnings lower .
The market went lower and lower and now , the latest estimate for Q3 of 2009 earnings is $ 14.57 .
This new revised estimate is a drop of 47 percent from the June 2008 estimate .
Sounds about right with the market .
Yet the market is up 50 percent while earnings estimates are down by 50 percent .
Any value investor will tell you that looking at PE ratios is absolutely crucial .
Some of the top experts avoided the tech stock mania because they were seeing stocks with PE ratios of 100 or even 200 on the prospect of making it big .
Some did survive but the vast majority did n’t .
Even a high flying stock like Google has a PE slightly above 30 .
Now assuming the $ 14.57 EPS for Q3 of 2009 .
Is this necessarily good ?
1026 ( current S&P level ) / ( $ 14.57 estimated EPS ) = 70 PE ratio
Even with this estimate , the PE ratio would still be at 70 !
At record levels .
And keep in mind , a big jump of earnings in these last few quarters involved massive infusions of free money into the banking sector .
Do they not realize that there are still some $ 3 trillion in toxic commercial real estate debt left ?
Of course on the estimates , you can see that the financial sector is having the best expectations .
The industry that brought us the credit and housing bubble is now going to lead us out of this massive recession .
We are in good hands .
Many now agree that this is the worst recession since the Great Depression .
Yet many think things will turn around in a few months .
These kind of market dislocations last years and impact generational thinking .
There is a new austerity out in the market .
In fact , this new spending habit is taking hold so deeply that the government had to entice people to trash their working vehicle for a new car .
People are surprised that the cash for clunkers program worked .
How are they shocked ?
Free money for your bucket and a new car ?
Who could have ever seen that coming !
Yet even the analyst estimates put the S&P 500 at a PE ratio of 70 for Q3 of 2009 .
A more normal average PE ratio even at the high end would be 20 .
From the mid-1930s to the 1980s the PE range would peak out in the low 20s .
But then , the technology bubble and housing bubble gave us two decades of wild valuations .
But let us assume a high 20 PE ratio .
What should the stock market be valued at ?
( X/ $ 14.57 Q3 2009 estimate ) = 20 PE ratio
291.40
This is the insanity of the current market .
For the PE ratio to come in at 20 for Q3 of 2009 and with estimated earnings of $ 14.57 per share , the S&P should have a value of 291.40 .
This is even less than that the 666 low reached in March .
So why the rally ?
Because people believe we ’ll be back to peak earnings again .
And insiders seem to have a different opinion .
Last week , insiders had 18 buys for $ 30 million while on the sell side some 131 sold for over $ 889 million .
Maybe the insiders know something that the public does n’t regarding the S&P casino ?

Click through to hear every lifestyle detail about the top gays who terrorize the gay ( and straight ) plebes inside the media spire … and can you believe that they wo n’t let non-Condé gays into the group even when their jobs may be in jeopardy and they may need those networking contacts !?
They wo n’t even let Anna in .
Now that ’s A - list !
Okay , self - described A - gay , tell us all about the Majority .
A - GAY :
It ’s still kind of an informal group that I started with a few other Condé gays a couple of months ago .
It ’s not affiliated with Condé .
We get together and drink and gossip about what ’s going on with the company .
Our first time was at Japonais on 18th Street and our last was during Gay Pride Week at g .
We ’re getting together again in September .
Does the Majority have a preferred drink , like the Majoritini ?
A - GAY : No , but we should probably come up with one .
Why are you called the Majority ?
A - GAY : Originally we called it Gays and Lesbians of Condé — or GLACK ! — but that was quickly changed based on the joke of , Who is n’t gay at Condé ?
We ’re not really the minority , we ’re the majority !
It ’s elusive — there ’s a little mystery to it .
So you ’re about 20 , 25 strong right now .
How many women ?
A - GAY : There ’s a little lesbian representation , two or three .
At some point we may open it up to straight allies .
A couple of people have brought non-Condé gays and we promptly blacklist those Condé employees .
I think for the next one , the first two hours will be exclusively Condé .
So what ’s the criteria to be asked into the Majority ?
A - GAY : Me and a couple of others created a list of people that we know personally .
People that are social .
And it does n’t hurt to be good - looking .
But we would n’t necessarily not welcome unattractive gays .
The group is n’t meant to screen the A - gays from the dumpy gays ?
A - GAY : Not necessarily ; it ’s more connected to friends and if they like another gay person .
But it screens in a pretty well - dressed , attractive type .
Though everyone at Condé is pretty well pulled - together .
What is the overall Majority look ?
A - GAY : Professional , preppy .
There ’s a lot of gingham , loafers , sometimes a pocket square here and there , and a lot of madras ties .
Everything from rag & bone to Gucci , Prada …
What are you wearing today ?
A - GAY : I ’m wearing a khaki suit I had custom - made in Asia with a white shirt .
It ’s a Prada cut .
Not a super - shortie Thom Browne cut ?
A - GAY : That ’s not a look for me .
Is most of the Majority on the business side or the editorial side ?
A - GAY : Most are on the business side , sales and marketing , but it ’s not excluding the editorial side .
Are you worried that Condé gays who are n’t invited in will be hurt and damaged ?
A - GAY :
If someone asked to come , we would probably allow them to .
Again , we ’d only exclude someone if they came to an event and brought a non-Condé gay .
But maybe it would be good right now for you guys to network with outside gays , given the shakiness at Condé …
A - GAY : [ Laughs incredulously ]
Why , in case we lose our jobs ?
There still have to be some things that are private .
It ’s still Condé Nast !
Do you experience bitterness and jealousy from non-Condé gays , or the public in general ?
A - GAY : Not bitterness , but certainly a kind of … curiosity about … people wonder how it is to work at Condé .
Is it that fabulous ?
A - GAY : I could n’t speak to that specifically .
I ’ve never worked at Vogue .
But it ’s very intense ; everyone ’s really smart and works really hard .
It ’s probably not for everyone .
Does everyone in the Majority have a share in the Pines [ on Fire Island ] ?
A - GAY : Many of us do .
I have my own place there , a half - share .
Some of us are Hamptons people .
Do Graydon and Anna know about you guys ?
A - GAY : Oh , no !
Would Anna come to one of your things ?
A - GAY : No , she would n’t be invited !
Maybe after those first two hours , as a straight ally , but it ’s really limited to those who are actually homosexual .
Who are the top five Condé gays ?
André Leon Talley and who else ?
A - GAY : I ’m not going to point anyone out .
Are the Majority gays tops or bottoms ?
A - GAY : Do you really think I ’m going to comment on that ?
I have no idea .
Maybe mostly bottoms because they ’re so in control and stressed out all day , then later they just want to lie back and let someone else do the work ?
A - GAY : [ Pause ]
I do n’t think you could make that correlation .
Where do you see the Majority going ?
A - GAY : We ’ve actually talked about doing a little community service .
Like bringing last season ’s gingham to the Housing Works stores ?
A - GAY : That might be something we ’d do .
We ’ve talked about coming together to form a team for the AIDS Walk .
Have you asked Chip Kidd to design your logo ?
A - GAY : [ Sniffs ]
We have graphic designers in the Majority , so we ’d probably rely on our own talent group .
It would be formatted after some kind of coat of arms .
I ’m not in that committee per se , so …
Who ’s bitchier at Condé , the gays or the girls ?
A - GAY : That ’s a good question .
It ’d be a toss - up .
Pneumococcal disease is the collective name for the infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria , also known as pneumococcus .
This bacteria finds a home all over the body .
The most common types of infections caused by S. pneumoniae are middle ear infections , pneumonia , bacteremia ( blood stream infections ) , sinus infections and bacterial meningitis .
There are more than 90 types of pneumococcus , with the 10 most common types responsible for 62 percent of the world 's invasive diseases .
Those infected carry the bacteria in their throats and expel it when they cough or sneeze .
Like any other germ , S. pneumoniae can infect anyone , but certain population groups are more at risk , such as the elderly , people with cancer or AIDS and people with a chronic illness such as diabetes .
The CDC blames pneumococcal disease for the deaths of 200 children under the age of 5 each year in the United States .
WHO estimates that annually pneumococcal disease is responsible for 1 million fatal cases of respiratory illness alone ; most of these cases occur in developing countries .

There are two types of vaccines available to prevent pneumococcal disease , which the CDC recommends that children receive .
In June 2019 , the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — the experts who advise U.S. vaccine policy — stopped saying that all adults 65 or older should get the vaccine , too , instead suggesting that senior patients should discuss it individually with their doctor .
Since pneumococcal diseases are bacterial , doctors may treat them with antibiotics , but as with other bacteria out there , resistance can get in the way of successful treatment .
Shots preventing diseases like polio and tetanus are now commonplace .
Continue reading to find out how these diseases were finally cured .
They came in their thousands , queuing through the night to secure one of the coveted wristbands offering entry into a strange parallel universe where medical care is a free and basic right and not an expensive luxury .
Some of these Americans had walked miles simply to have their blood pressure checked , some had slept in their cars in the hope of getting an eye - test or a mammogram , others had brought their children for immunisations that could end up saving their life .
In the week that Britain 's National Health Service was held aloft by Republicans as an " evil and Orwellian " example of everything that is wrong with free healthcare , these extraordinary scenes in Inglewood , California yesterday provided a sobering reminder of exactly why President Barack Obama is trying to reform the US system .
The LA Forum , the arena that once hosted sell - out Madonna concerts , has been transformed – for eight days only – into a vast field hospital .
In America , the offer of free healthcare is so rare , that news of the magical medical kingdom spread rapidly and long lines of prospective patients snaked around the venue for the chance of getting everyday treatments that many British people take for granted .

In the first two days , more than 1,500 men , women and children received free treatments worth $ 503,000 ( £ 304,000 ) .
Thirty dentists pulled 471 teeth ; 320 people were given standard issue spectacles ; 80 had mammograms ; dozens more had acupuncture , or saw kidney specialists .
By the time the makeshift medical centre leaves town on Tuesday , staff expect to have dispensed $ 2 m worth of treatments to 10,000 patients .
The gritty district of Inglewood lies just a few miles from the palm - lined streets of Beverly Hills and the bright lights of Hollywood , but is a world away .
And the residents who had flocked for the free medical care , courtesy of mobile charity Remote Area Medical , bore testament to the human cost of the healthcare mess that President Obama is attempting to fix .
Christine Smith arrived at 3 am in the hope of seeing a dentist for the first time since she turned 18 .
That was almost eight years ago .
Her need is obvious and pressing : 17 of her teeth are rotten ; some have large visible holes in them .
She is living in constant pain and has been unable to eat solid food for several years .
" I had a gastric bypass in 2002 , but it went wrong , and stomach acid began rotting my teeth .
I 've had several jobs since , but none with medical insurance , so I 've not been able to see a dentist to get it fixed , " she told The Independent .
" I 've not been able to chew food for as long as I can remember .
I 've been living on soup , and noodles , and blending meals in a food mixer .
I 'm in constant pain .
Normally , it would cost $ 5,000 to fix it .
So if I have to wait a week to get treated for free , I 'll do it .
This will change my life . "
Along the hall , Liz Cruise was one of scores of people waiting for a free eye exam .
She works for a major supermarket chain but can't afford the $ 200 a month that would be deducted from her salary for insurance .
" It 's a simple choice : pay my rent , or pay my healthcare .
What am I supposed to do ? " she asked .
" I 'm one of the working poor : people who do work but can't afford healthcare and are ineligible for any free healthcare or assistance .
I can't remember the last time I saw a doctor . "
Although the Americans spend more on medicine than any nation on earth , there are an estimated 50 million with no health insurance at all .
Many of those who have jobs can't afford coverage , and even those with standard policies often find it does n't cover commonplace procedures .
California 's unemployed – who rely on Medicaid – had their dental care axed last month .
Julie Shay was one of the many , waiting to slide into a dentist 's chair where teeth were being drilled in full view of passers - by .
For years , she has been crossing over the Mexican border to get her teeth done on the cheap in Tijuana .
But recently , the US started requiring citizens returning home from Mexico to produce a passport ( previously all you needed was a driver 's license ) , and so that route is now closed .
Today she has two abscesses and is in so much pain she can barely sleep .
" I do n't have a passport , and I can't afford one .
So my husband and I slept in the car to make sure we got seen by a dentist .
It sounds pathetic , but I really am that desperate . "

" You 'd think , with the money in this country , that we'd be able to look after people 's health properly , " she said .
" But the truth is that the rich , and the insurance firms , just do n't realise what we are going through , or simply do n't care .
Look around this room and tell me that America 's healthcare do n't need fixing . "
President Obama 's healthcare plans had been a central plank of his first - term programme , but his reform package has taken a battering at the hands of Republican opponents in recent weeks .
As the Democrats have failed to coalesce around a single , straightforward proposal , their rivals have seized on public hesitancy over " socialised medicine " and now the chance of far - reaching reform is in doubt .
Most damaging of all has been the tide of vociferous right - wing opponents whipping up scepticism at town hall meetings that were supposed to soothe doubts .
In Pennsylvania this week , Senator Arlen Specter was greeted by a crowd of 1,000 at a venue designed to accommodate only 250 , and of the 30 selected speakers at the event , almost all were hostile .
The packed bleachers in the LA Forum tell a different story .
The mobile clinic has been organised by the remarkable Remote Area Medical .
The charity usually focuses on the rural poor , although they worked in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina .
Now they are moving into more urban venues , this week 's event in Los Angeles is believed to be the largest free healthcare operation in the country .
Doctors , dentists and therapists volunteer their time , and resources to the organisation .
To many US medical professionals , it offers a rare opportunity to plug into the public service ethos on which their trade was supposedly founded .
" People come here who have n't seen a doctor for years .
And we 're able to say ' Hey , you have this , you have this , you have this ' , " said Dr Vincent Anthony , a kidney specialist volunteering five days of his team 's time .
" It 's hard work , but incredibly rewarding .
Healthcare needs reform , obviously .
There are so many people falling through the cracks , who do n't get care .
That 's why so many are here . "
Ironically , given this week 's transatlantic spat over the NHS , Remote Area Medical was founded by an Englishman : Stan Brock .
The 72 - year - old former public schoolboy , Taekwondo black belt , and one - time presenter of Wild Kingdom , one of America 's most popular animal TV shows , left the celebrity gravy train in 1985 to , as he puts it , " make people better " .
Today , Brock has no money , no income , and no bank account .
He spends 365 days a year at the charity events , sleeping on a small rolled - up mat on the floor and living on a diet made up entirely of porridge and fresh fruit .
In some quarters , he has been described , without too much exaggeration , as a living saint .
Though anxious not to interfere in the potent healthcare debate , Mr Brock said yesterday that he , and many other professionals , believes the NHS should provide a benchmark for the future of US healthcare .
" Back in 1944 , the UK government knew there was a serious problem with lack of healthcare for 49.7 million British citizens , of which I was one , so they said ' Hey Mr Nye Bevan , you 're the Minister for Health ... go fix it ' .
And so came the NHS .
Well , fast forward now 66 years , and we 've got about the same number of people , about 49 million people , here in the US , who do n't have access to healthcare . "
" I 've been very conservative in my outlook for the whole of my life .
I 've been described as being about 90,000 miles to the right of Attila the Hun .
But I think one reaches the reality that something does n't work ...
In this country something has to be done .
And as a proud member of the US community but a loyal British subject to the core , I would say that if Britain could fix it in 1944 , surely we could fix it here in America .

Pictured : Pamplona runner is gored in the chest by a 1,268lb bull - and survives
This is the terrifying moment a Pamplona reveller is tossed into the air and then gored by a rampaging bull .
The man was caught in the chest and legs when the large bull became separated from the pack on the slippery cobblestone streets of Spain 's Pamplona .
The bull - a 1,268lb Miura - jerked the runner upward and then rolled him along the ground like a rag doll .
Miuras are the largest and most famous of Spain 's fighting bulls .
Terrifying : A Miura fighting bull that became separated from the pack gores a runner during the sixth bull run of the San Fermin festival in Pamplona
The reveller was covered in blood and had his trousers torn off during the bull 's wild attack .
Screaming out in agony , the man was dragged away by two fellow runners before being rushed to hospital .
The bull initially got a horn caught on a wooden barrier at a bend in the route , slipped and became embroiled in a three - animal pile - up before resuming its gallop .
Bulls are at their most dangerous when the pack splits up , leaving individual animals disoriented and irritated by the large crowds traditionally clad in white , with red bandanna neckerchiefs and cummerbunds .
Mayhem :
The reveler is tossed to the ground as the bull 's horns rips apart his trousers
Horror :
The man 's face says it all as the bull rams its horns into him
In other graphic images , one man was gored in the neck during the five - minute run on the sixth day of the running of the bulls at the San Fermin festival .
Three other runners were also gored , while six received medical treatment for bruising .
One man was hit hard on the chin and knocked unconscious by a calf inside the bullring after the running of the bulls had finished .
It comes after a 27 - year - old man was gored to death on Friday - the first fatality since 1995 .
Lucky escape :
The man is dragged away by a fellow runner as soon as the bull appears to back off
Spaniard Daniel Jimeno Romero was gored in the upper chest and neck and was declared dead shortly after reaching the hospital .
Hundreds of revelers paid homage to Mr Romero by leaving traditional red neckerchiefs tied to wooden barriers at the spot where a bull gored him fatally in the upper chest and neck .
For more than 100 years thrill - seekers have accompanied the bulls from a pen outside the city walls on a dangerous , daredevil run to the bullring .
In the afternoon , the bulls face matadors and almost certain death .
The pack races along the often damp cobblestone course accompanied by six steers , each with a large clanking bell around its neck , whose function is to try to keep the group trotting together .
Dangerous : A runner ( right ) is gored in the neck by a Miura bull
Treatment :
He requires urgent medical attention as blood pours from his nose and neck
The bulls running yesterday belonged to breeder Dolores Aguirre , famed for producing hefty , strong animals .
The largest of the six animals weighed in at 1,378 pounds .
Despite the large number of runners and the separation of one bull from the pack , all of Aguirre 's animals entered the ring in 2 minutes , 52 seconds , a reasonably fast time .
When you have something that you do n't need anymore , but do n't want to trash , you tend to give it away .
Sometimes they go to friends , sometimes you post them on Craigslist .
But there 's no system based on merit or need .
After all , some people need a lightly - used baby stroller than others .
YCombinator - funded Listia intends to become the epicenter for giving away free things .
By doing things like signing up , giving away free items , and more , users can build up credits and bid on free items .
Is it an ingenious way to build a marketplace and community around free items , or is it an unnecessary complication to giving stuff away ?
If It 's Like eBay , Does It Also Have eBay 's Weaknesses ?
So Listia as a platform is very straightforward and intuitive .
Here 's the basic overview :
1 . You sign up and are automatically given 500 credits .
2 . You can use those credits to bid on free items - everything from iPods to magnets to invites to websites .
3 . At the end date , the bid with the most credits wins .
4 . To get more credits , you can either sell stuff , refer friends ( 50 credits per friend ) , or buy credits ( $ 0.10 per credit ) .
The latter is essentially Listia 's revenue model .
The service is really simple to understand and utilize .
We also see why Listia can get addicting .
Like eBay , you get swept up into swapping credits and getting rid of items so you can get that iPod .
There are some quality items on this site , plus a few gems .
We can't help but feel that Listia complicates the process of giving away stuff , though .
Is Listia the most efficient way to give away stuff ?
We 'd argue not - posting on Craigslist or just posting to your Facebook is going to be less time - intensive .
However , we do see the merit in the credit system - it 's entertaining and it helps make sure that the person who wants the item the most actually gets it .
Listia risks becoming entangled in the current situation plaguing eBay .
The world 's largest auction site , after years of growth , is now bleeding users and profits at a shocking pace .
The entertainment factor of eBay died off and users turned to more efficient alternatives to buy items - aka Amazon .
We 're interested to see how Listia avoids and overcomes these potential pitfalls .
We believe it will gain traction and build a strong community .
We 're not as sure about whether it can sustain users or growth in the long - term .
Still , Listia is a really fun way to give stuff away .

Dear Colleagues :
In today ’s Mail Online , the internet edition of the Daily Mail , a U.K. newspaper , there is a fascinating article about vivisection by Dr. Danny Penman , a former research biochemist who now does science journalism for New Scientist and the Daily Mail .
Penman makes it clear that he supports vivisection :
Like most people , I would sacrifice the lives of countless lab animals to save my fiancèe or other members of my family .
Putting aside that most people would , if in a situation which they were forced to choose , sacrifice the lives of countless other humans to save those close to them ( so the animal issue is beside the point ) , Penman goes on to express concern that there has been an increase over last year of half a million animals used in Britain labs and that the number of animals used for research in Britain now stands at 3.7 million .
Penman maintains that some use of animals is necessary but he argues that vivisection may actually threaten human health .
He quotes New Scientist as reporting that the results of vivisection are “ no more informative than tossing a coin , ” and although he , Penman , would not go so far , he does agree that “ vivisection is , at best , unreliable and , at worst , lethal . ”
He cites several examples where drugs that were tested on animals without there being any adverse reaction caused humans to become critically ill and to die .
He argues in favor of new technologies that do not involve animals and that are much more reliable .
Penman ’s critique of vivisection is quite remarkable given that he supports vivisection .
I cannot recall the last time that I saw such an essay .
Perhaps the lack of criticism of vivisection is explained by another observation that Penman makes :
Why are there so many animal experiments when there are alternatives ?
One reason , ironically , is that violence and intimidation by a handful of animal rights fanatics has clouded the debate .
For if you question the work of scientists today , you risk being lumped together with the extremists .
Thus the scientists have been able to expand their research on animals without anyone in authority examining whether their tests are truly necessary .
This seems to me both unjust and against the spirit of academic inquiry .
Penman is absolutely right .
As a result of a relatively small group of people who advocate violence against vivisectors , to question or debate vivisection even in academic contexts invites having one ’s views dismissed as part of an extremist or violent agenda .
This observation applies not just to vivisection but to animal issues generally .
The actions of a small number of people have allowed a reactionary press , together with institutional exploiters who would rather not have any discussion about these matters , to create the impression that those who oppose animal exploitation generally are violent misanthropes who value animal life but do not care about human life .
We must not allow that characterization to prevail .
As you know , I am opposed to all violence on moral grounds .
( See , e.g. , A Comment on Violence and More on Violence and Animal Rights ) I accept the concept of Ahimsa .
Violence against institutional exploiters is not only immoral but it is incoherent — it makes no sense .
The institutional exploiters are not “ the enemy . ”
We are the ones who demand animal products .
If we stopped consuming animal products , institutional users would shift their capital elsewhere .
We are the ones who continue to believe the myth that vivisection will make us live longer and better lives and , as a result , we continue to support it , if only by not demanding of our politicians that they ensure that the alternatives that Penman mentions are used and that others are developed .
Many “ animal people ” are not even vegan and are willing to tolerate and support the torture of nonhuman animals simply because they like the taste of animal products and just cannot give up the cheese , ice cream , or whatever animal products it is that they eat .
How are these people any different in a moral sense from vivisectors ?
At least some vivisectors think that they are performing some social good .
As I have indicated in my writing , I do not agree that the use of animals is necessary as an empirical matter and , like Penman and others , I maintain that vivisection is often clearly counterproductive .
Indeed , unlike Penman , I agree with the statement he attributes to New Scientist : the results of vivisection are “ no more informative than tossing a coin . ”
Even if that were not the case , and even if vivisection were useful in some sense , it could still not be justified morally .
But non-vegans support exploitation simply because of the whim of taste .
They have no excuse .
I would certainly hope that no one would advocate violence against all non-vegans , particularly since this would include much of what is referred to as the “ animal movement ” !
That being the case , and apart from whether you share my general rejection of violence , singling out institutional exploiters , be they farmers or vivisectors , simply makes no sense whatsoever .
I call on all animal advocates to unequivocally and without reservation reject violence .
The animal rights movement makes sense only as a movement of peace and nonviolence .
Gandhi said :
We must become the change we want to see in the world .
If we want to see a world in which there is no violence against the most vulnerable , we must ourselves become non-violent and present our views in a non-violent way .
Non-violence begins with our own veganism and our use of creative , non-violent ways to educate others about veganism .

A commercial critiquing CNN ’s Lou Dobbs is being shown on Fox News and MSNBC this week — but not CNN .
CNN has worked with the cable operators that carry its channel to block the commercial , which was produced by the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters .
According to a CNN employee who requested anonymity , CNN managers said in a morning staff meeting that the channel had invoked unspecified agreements with operators to stop the ad from running .
The ad accuses Mr. Dobbs of “ promoting the false , right - wing conspiracy that President Obama has n’t produced a valid U.S. birth certificate . ”
It calls on viewers to “ let CNN know there ’s nothing ‘ legitimate ’ about racially charged paranoia . ”
Media Matters sought to buy air time on the cable news channels in Washington , New York and Atlanta this week .
In a statement , CNN said that it “ retains the right to object to any ad run by the cable operator on our network whose purpose is to attack CNN or our employees . ”
A CNN spokeswoman said she did n’t know if the word “ agreement ” was used in the staff meeting .
WhoRunsGov first reported that CNN had “ privately pressed cable operators not to run ” the ad .
Eric Burns , the president of Media Matters , said that CNN ’s blocking of the ad “ seems like the actions of a network desperate to provide cover for its primetime host rather than living up to its standard of being the most trusted name in news . ”
It 's one thing to have a routing platform that can scale to high capacity -- it 's quite another to actually have products that can actually deliver on the promise of that scale .
Cisco ( NASDAQ : CSCO ) today is rolling out its highest - density 10 Gigabit Ethernet ( 10 GbE ) line card , sporting a total of sixteen 10 GbE ports that together deliver a whopping 160 Gbps of throughput bandwidth .
The new line card is for Cisco's ASR ( Aggregation Services Router ) 9000 platform , which debuted in Nov. 2008 .
The new 16x10 GbE card effectively doubles the capacity that Cisco had previously offered to ASR 9000 customers .

To celebrate the immense range of color in the Pantone Color Guides ( and to promote the book to college students in Jakarta ) , Basheer Graphic Books commissioned a giant rainbow from Bates 141 Jakarta , spanning 8 meters and made from 5,000 chips .
The rainbow was designed and built by Bates 141 creative director Hendra Lesmono and art directors Andreas Junus and Irawandhani Kamarga .
There is n't much more information available than that , but as far as I can tell from browsing Kamarga 's photostream , it looks like the rainbow was made by laminating graph paper onto a multi-part wood frame , which then acted as a guide for precise color chip placement .
More shots of the rainbow and fabrication process after the jump .

Mr Obama made his birth certificate public last July During the 2008 US presidential election , rumours began to circulate on the internet that Barack Obama had not been born in the United States , and was therefore not eligible for the presidency .
Mr Obama 's campaign provided plenty of evidence to rebut the claims , including the candidate 's birth certificate , but the chatter has not died down , and some people have even launched lawsuits to question Mr Obama 's eligibility .
With Mr Obama now installed in the White House , the number of Americans who believe - despite all evidence to the contrary - that he is not eligible to be president , and that his birth certificate is a forgery appears to be growing .
And " birthers " - as those who doubt Mr Obama 's eligibility for the presidency are pejoratively known - have started making their presence felt within the conservative movement .
What allegations are being made about Mr Obama ?
The principal allegation is that Barack Obama was not born in the United States , and that he is therefore ineligible to be president , according to the US constitution , which states that " no person except a natural born citizen ... shall be eligible to the office of President " .
It is further alleged that any documents purporting to prove Mr Obama 's eligibility are either insufficient or fraudulent .
Some of those challenging Mr Obama 's eligibility allege that he was actually born in Kenya , or that he adopted Indonesian citizenship as an infant .
What documents have been presented proving Mr Obama 's eligibility ?
In June 2008 , the Obama campaign - in an attempt to disprove another set of internet rumours that Mr Obama 's middle name was Muhammad - made public his birth certificate .
The document - a Certification of Live Birth - indicated that Mr Obama had been born at 7.24 pm on 4 August 1961 , in Honolulu , Hawaii .
Researchers have also dug up birth notices for Mr Obama printed in the Honolulu Advertiser and the Honolulu Star - Bulletin in 1961 .
The newspapers received information about births from Hawaii's Department of Health .
Did the documents stop the rumours ?
No .
When Mr Obama 's Certification of Live Birth was published , as a scanned document on the Obama campaign 's website , some people began to question its authenticity .
It was alleged in blog posts , chain emails and internet forums that the document did not have an official stamp or seal and that it lacked an official signature .
Some even suggested that the document had been faked using picture - altering software .
Was there any substance to these allegations ?
No. Representatives from the Annenberg Public Policy Center 's Political Fact Check project examined the hard copy of the document and verified that it did in fact bear an official seal , and had been signed by Hawaii state registrar Alvin T Onaka ( using a signature stamp ) .
Both the seal and the signature were on the ( unscanned ) reverse of the document .
Did that put the rumours to bed ?
No .
Although most people accepted the authenticity of the birth certificate , a new allegation emerged .
The document released by the Obama camp was a Certification of Live Birth , freshly created in 2007 by Hawaiian officials at the request of the Obama campaign , based on Hawaii 's computerised records , not the original hand - written long - form " Certificate of Live Birth " , created by the hospital at the time of Mr Obama 's birth .
A Certificate of Live Birth contains more information , including the hospital name , and the name of the attending physician .
Campaigners alleged that Hawaiian law permits the issuance of Certifications of Live Births to people born abroad , and began calling on the Obama campaign to release the long - form Certificate of Live Birth , which they said would answer all of their questions .
WorldNetDaily , a website that has been at the forefront of the campaign to probe Mr Obama 's presidential eligibility , has drawn up a petition calling on Mr Obama to release the document .
Has the Certificate of Live Birth been released ?
It has not .
But Dr Chiyome Fukino , Director of the Hawaii Department of Health , has released a statement confirming that she has " seen the original vital records maintained on file by the Hawaii State Department of Health verifying Barack Hussein Obama was born in Hawaii and is a natural - born American citizen " .
And , as Janice Okubo , director of communications for the Hawaii Department of Health , explains , no - one who was born abroad could get a certificate saying they were born in Hawaii .
" If you were born in Bali , for example , " Ms Okubo told the Washington Independent , " you could get a certificate from the state of Hawaii saying you were born in Bali .
You could not get a certificate saying you were born in Honolulu .
The state has to verify a fact like that for it to appear on the certificate . "
Have campaigners attempted to air their concerns in the courts ?
A number of lawsuits have been filed by people who question Mr Obama 's eligibility , but all of them have been dismissed at the earliest stages .
In July , Stefan Cook , a major in the US Army Reserve who was due to be deployed to Afghanistan , filed a lawsuit seeking to block his deployment , on the grounds that his orders were invalid , because President Obama was ineligible to serve as commander - in - chief .
His case was dismissed .
Have any mainstream politicians endorsed the campaigners ' views ?
Most Republicans have rejected the claims , but Alan Keyes , a former Republican presidential candidate , has filed a lawsuit questioning Mr Obama 's eligibility , and Republican Senator James Inhofe has said he does not " discourage " the movement .

[ Editorial ] Remembering Former Pres. Kim Dae-jung .
August . 19 , 2009 08:45 . .
Former President Kim Dae- jung died yesterday at age 85 .
Though he endured a tough life in leading the democratic movement against authoritarian governments , he eventually succumbed to old age .
May he rest in peace .
Few figures lived a life as dramatic and left many legacies like Kim in modern Korean history .
Born to a poor farmer , he was a six - time lawmaker before being elected the 15th president of the Republic of Korea despite having just a high school diploma .
He helped the government transfer power to his successor in a democratic way for the first time in the countrys history .
He also helped the economy overcome the 1998 Asian financial crisis in a relatively short period of time .
The 2000 inter -Korean summit was held for the first time in half a century of national division under his presidency , and Kim became the first Korean to receive the Nobel Prize .
Kim was a politician with a great presence in overcoming challenges with firm determination .
He was elected to the National Assembly in his fourth attempt .
As such , he was a man with persistence .
He thoroughly prepared for everything .
He always read books and studied , and wrote down what others said .
This is why he knew so much about everything .
Since he always practiced looking in the mirror before making an important speech , he rarely made a mistake .
Kim lived a tough life until becoming president .
He was a great leader to the people yearning for democracy , but an eyesore to the military governments led by Park Chung - hee and Chun Doo-hwan .
He was put under house arrest 55 times and imprisoned for six years .
He was banned from political activity and spent time in exile in Japan and the United States .
While in Japan , he was kidnapped by Korean spy agency and taken back to Korea .
Though sentenced to death for an alleged rebellion conspiracy , namely the 1980 pro-democratic movement in Gwangju , he was rescued by the U.S. government .
His contributions to ending military rule with the 1992 election of Kim Young - sam as Koreas first civilian president and advancement of national democratization will be forever remembered by the people .
Kim Dae-jung , Kim Young - sam and Kim Jong - pil formed the three Kims that dominated Korean politics for decades .
Kim Dae-jung was a victim of deep - rooted regional division but at the same time a beneficiary .
In the countrys first direct presidential election in 1987 , he disappointed the people by failing to agree on a unified candidate .
Unfortunately , Korean politicians have acted more in their political interests rather than for ideology or policy .
The three Kims era is over , but regional strife , politicians changing parties for their own interests , and an extreme political culture that denies representative democracy still remains .
In this regard , Kim Dae - jung gave politicians tasks to tackle .
With progress in democratization , frequent ideological conflict in society is another serious issue .
Regrettably , Kim Dae- jung could have done better when the anti-U.S. beef protests took place last year and the rallies in the wake of former President Roh Moo-hyuns death this year .
As a former president , Kim Dae - jung could have won more respect if he took the lead in unifying the people rather than encouraging political divisions by calling incumbent President Lee Myung - bak , who was democratically elected , as a dictator . 
His policy toward North Korea received mixed reviews .
He created a reconciliatory environment between the two Koreas through the 2000 inter-Korean summit and promoted people exchanges and cooperation and the reunion of separated families .
Though business cooperation at the Kaesong industrial complex and tours to Mount Kumgang are being hampered by the Norths provocations and stubbornness , they will be remembered as part of his legacy if they are resumed .
Yet he secretly gave more than 450 million U.S. dollars to Pyongyang in return for holding the summit , and failed to change the North in the way he intended to through his sunshine policy . 
By sticking to the policy , he helped the communist regime develop nuclear weapons and missiles , causing internal division in South Korea .
On previous persecutions of him , Kim Dae- jung paid extra attention to human rights while president .
Improvement in human rights came when he was in office .
Contrary to his reputation as a human rights president ,  however , he failed to end illegal eavesdropping and almost ignored human rights abuses in the North .
History will clarify the controversy over whether he retaliated against media that criticized him by ordering tax audits on them .
Creating glory and disgrace and praise and criticism , Kim Dae - jung is now part of history .
His footsteps hopefully can serve as the groundwork for the countrys democratic development , economic prosperity , and peaceful reunification .
May his funeral  a ceremony of saying good - bye amid the peoples mourning  be conducted solemnly and sincerely .
Safari , iPhone OS , and Mac OS all continued their slow and steady climb in the browser share wars last month , according to the latest data from Net Applications .
The firm , which gathers its numbers from visitors to its " member sites , " does not offer an entire picture of Apple 's market share numbers , but it does show trends in online device usage .
And when it comes to Apple 's offerings , those trends are looking good on all fronts .
In May of 2009 , Safari inched up to 8.43 percent of the browser share numbers ( from 8.21 percent in April ) , while Firefox grew to 22.51 percent ( up from 22.47 percent ) and Chrome went from 1.42 percent to 1.8 percent .
Internet Explorer dipped to 65.5 percent in May , down from 66.1 the previous month .
This drop came despite the official release of Internet Explorer 8 , though that may change as more average users check out the new offering from Microsoft .
Mac OS
X's market share went back up to 9.81 percent in May after making a temporary dip to 9.73 percent in April .
Again , Apple has yet to officially crack the 10 percent mark on the desktop , but this small rebound will undoubtedly help the company get closer to that milestone .
The iPhone OS also did pretty well in May , too ; combine the iPhone and iPod touch numbers from Net Applications , and the total is 0.75 percent — up from a combined 0.70 percent in April .
Linux , for those of you who follow the numbers , looks to be down to 0.99 percent from 1.02 in April .
Clearly , the current economic climate has slowed down some of Apple 's growth , but the trends are still moving upwards for Safari and the Mac in general .
Manchester City boss Mark Hughes has urged Chelsea captain John Terry to make the move to Eastlands to ' re - ignite ' his career .
City chief feels target needs Eastlands challenge
Challenge
Manchester City boss Mark Hughes has urged John Terry to make the move to Eastlands to ' re - ignite ' his career .
City are determined to continue their big - money spending spree with a move for England captain Terry following the arrivals of Gareth Barry , Roque Santa Cruz and Carlos Tevez .
Hughes has seen two bids rejected by Chelsea for Terry , but the cash - rich club are refusing to give up their relentless pursuit of the centre - half .
Terry has so far refused to comment publicly on his future , but Hughes believes the defender may need to join City for a new challenge at this stage of his career .
" We would like to think we could offer him a different challenge , " said Hughes .
" From my own experience , when you have been with a club a long time , you maybe get to a point when you need a new challenge , when you think a change of scenery would just re-ignite certain things within you .
" It is not a question of money .
It 's about a different challenge , a different stage in his life and career , and maybe that 's why there has n't been a response because John is seriously thinking in those terms .
" I went through that process myself and I can understand if that is the way he is thinking .
" We made an offer to Chelsea and I 've made known my feelings about John Terry .
" He 's an outstanding player and an outstanding person .
We 'd like the opportunity to speak to him but as yet that has n't been forthcoming . "
There is a growing consensus ( at least in Silicon Valley ) that the information age is about to give way to the era of synthetic genetics .
That was underscored recently when Harvard geneticist George Church and J. Craig Venter — of the race to decode the human genome fame — gave lectures before a small group of scientists , technologists , entrepreneurs , and writers in West Hollywood .
The event , billed as “ A Short Course on Synthetic Genomics , ” was organized by John Brockman , the literary impresario ( and book agent for several New York Times reporters , including this one ) who publishes the cybersalon - style website www.edge.org, a forum dedicated to scientists ( many of whom are his clients ) and their ideas .
In roughly six hours of lectures , both scientists tried to convey how the world will be changed by the ability to routinely read genetic sequences into computing systems and then store , replicate , alter and insert them back into living cells .
The rate at which this technology is now improving puts silicon to shame .
Dr. Church noted that between 1970 and 2005 gene sequencing had taken place on a Moore ’s Law pace , improving at about 1.5 times per year .
Since then it has improved at the rate of an order of magnitude , or ten times annually .
In the process the cost of sequencing the human genome has plunged from $ 3 billion to $ 5 thousand and continues to fall .
Dr. Church identified 17 companies and one “ open source ” project all pursuing different technologies to further push down cost and speed up the pace of sequencing .
As a consequence , the structure of the emerging synthetic genetics industry is beginning to mirror that of the semiconductor and computer industries , which are based on modular components and design tools .
The key to the vast growth of the computer industry took place during the 1970s when physicist Carver Mead helped give the industry a standard design approach based on modular components .
Now that appears to be happening in the synthetic biology world as well .
For someone who has spent the past three decades writing about computing , Dr. Venter ’s talk was eye - opening .
“ I view DNA as an analog information system , ” he said . “ and I hope to convince you in fact that it is absolutely the software of life . ”

Calculate the answer when n approaches infinity
WHAT relationship there is between the number of participants in a competition and the motivation of the competitors has long eluded researchers .
Does the presence of a lot of rivals stimulate action or lead someone to give up hope ?
It is more than an academic question .
Or , rather , it is a very academic question indeed , for it may affect the way that examinations are conducted if they are to be a fair test for all .
To investigate the matter two behavioural researchers , Stephen Garcia at the University of Michigan and Avishalom Tor at the University of Haifa in Israel , looked at the results of the SAT university entrance examination in America in 2005 .
This test generates a score supposedly based on the test - taker 's verbal and analytical prowess .
The two researchers used data on the number of test - takers in each state of the union and the number of test - taking venues in that state to calculate the average number of test - takers per venue in the state in question .
They found that test scores fell as the number of people in the examination hall increased .
And they discovered that this pattern was also true for the Cognitive Reflection Test , another analytical exam .
These results are intriguing , but lend themselves to more than one explanation .
To find out whether they were caused by a psychological effect related to the number of perceived competitors , or were merely a consequence of the greater distraction produced by crowding more people together , Dr Garcia and Dr Tor conducted an experiment .
They asked 74 university students to take a timed , easy general - knowledge quiz which they were asked to finish as quickly as possible without compromising accuracy .
Each student completed the test alone , but half were told they were competing against ten other people and the other half that they were competing against 100 .
All were informed that those whose completion times were in the top 20 % would receive $ 5 .
The results backed up the psychological hypothesis .
Students who believed they were competing against only ten people finished in an average of 28.95 seconds .
Those who believed they were competing against 100 averaged 33.15 seconds .
Curious as to why mere belief that he was facing more competitors would alter an individual 's performance , the two researchers ran a second experiment .
They asked students to imagine they were running a five - kilometre race against 50 people and then against 500 ( or , in half of the cases , the other way round ) .
In both notional races the top 10 % of competitors would get a $ 1,000 prize .
The researchers told the students to rate , on a seven - point scale , how much faster than normal they would run in each notional race , with a one being slightly faster than normal and a seven being the fastest of their lives .
The average value in the competition against 50 others was 5.43 ; in the competition against 500 it was 4.89 — a result consistent with the other two parts of the study .
When that bit of the test was over , Dr Garcia and Dr Tor then asked the participants a series of questions commonly used by psychologists to evaluate an individual 's tendency to compare himself with others in a social environment .
They found that those with the highest tendency to make such comparisons had the lowest scores in the notional race against 500 others .
These socially aware individuals are , as it were , looking around , assessing the situation and thinking that it is not worth trying too hard .
In their report on the matter in Psychological Science , Dr Garcia and Dr Tor dub their discovery the “ n - effect ” since “ n ” represents any numerical value in mathematics .
If confirmed , it may mean not only that examination halls should be kept small — or , at least , the same size for all participants so that the playing field is level — but also that other competitive activities should be scaled down for best results .
From the American Trucking Association : ATA Truck Tonnage Index Fell 2.4 Percent in June
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
The American Trucking Associations ’ advance seasonally adjusted ( SA ) For -Hire Truck Tonnage Index fell 2.4 percent in June .
In May , SA tonnage jumped 3.2 percent .
June ’s decrease , which lowered the SA index to 99.8 ( 2000=100 ) , was n’t large enough to completely offset the robust gain in the previous month .
...
Compared with June 2008 , tonnage fell 13.6 percent , which surpassed May ’s 11 percent year - over - year drop .
June ’s contraction was the largest year - over - year decrease of the current cycle , exceeding the 13.2 percent drop in April .
ATA Chief Economist Bob Costello said truck tonnage is likely to be choppy in the months ahead .
“ While I am hopeful that the worst is behind us , I just do n’t see anything on the economic horizon that suggests freight tonnage is about to rise significantly or consistently , ” Costello said .
“ The consumer is still facing too many headwinds , including employment losses , tight credit , and falling home values , to name a few , that will make it very difficult for household spending to jump in the near term . ”
He also noted that inventories , relative to sales , are still too high in much of the supply chain , especially in the manufacturing and wholesale industries .
“ As a result , this is likely to be the first time in memory that truck tonnage does n’t lead the macro economy out of a recession .
Today , many new product orders can be fulfilled with current inventories , not new production , thus suppressing truck tonnage . ”
Trucking serves as a barometer of the U.S. economy , representing nearly 69 percent of tonnage carried by all modes of domestic freight transportation , including manufactured and retail goods .
Trucks hauled 10.2 billion tons of freight in 2008 .
Motor carriers collected $ 660.3 billion , or 83.1 percent of total revenue earned by all transport modes .
Some interesting comments from Costello .
Maybe the cliff diving is over , but the sideways motion is " choppy " .
Not exactly little green shoots ...
Extremely obese people — those who are 80 or more pounds over a normal weight — live three to 12 fewer years than their normal - weight peers , a new study shows .
Just being overweight or moderately obese , however , has little or no effect on life span , the research found .
The finding adds to the growing body of evidence that being slightly overweight may have no influence on life expectancy , but being severely overweight trims years off people 's lives .
Overall , about 66 % of adults in the USA are either overweight or obese .
About one - third of people are in the obese category , meaning they have a body mass index of 30 or greater .
Body mass index , or BMI , is a measure based on height and weight .
About 6 % of people are extremely obese — that is , they have a BMI of 40 or greater .
Economists with RTI International , a non-profit research organization in Research Triangle Park , N.C. , analyzed national data on 366,000 people .
Among the findings being published online in the journal Obesity :
• Overall , excess weight was responsible for the loss of roughly 95 million years of life in the USA in 2008 .
• Non-smokers who are obese — those who are about 30 or more pounds over a healthy weight — have a shorter life span by a year or less .
• Non-smokers who are overweight — about 29 pounds over a healthy weight — do not have shortened lives .
• Smoking takes a toll , too , and very heavy smokers are affected most .
An 18 - year - old white male who is normal weight and does not smoke can expect to live to age 81 .
If he 's extremely obese and a smoker , his life expectancy is 60 , a difference of 21 years .
The effect of extreme obesity appears to be greater for men than women and for whites than blacks , says Derek Brown , a health economist with RTI International and co-author of the study .
Lead author Eric Finkelstein says being moderately overweight may not affect people 's life span because there are so many effective treatments to manage the health problems that often come with extra pounds , such as high cholesterol , high blood pressure and diabetes .
For instance , of the top 25 most prescribed medications , 10 target high blood pressure , high cholesterol or diabetes , he says .
Finkelstein and obesity experts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have conducted additional research that shows the high medical costs of extra pounds .

Up to 100 people were feared dead in a wave of co-ordinated explosions across Baghdad today .
A massive truck bomb outside Iraq 's Foreign Ministry near the secure Green Zone , knocked out concrete slabs and windows and left a mass of charred cars outside .
It was the deadliest attack in Iraq so far this year and marked a major challenge to the control of Baghdad .

A steady escalation of violence following the June 30 withdrawal of American troops from urban areas has heightened fears that government troops are not ready to provide security .
Iraqi officials blamed al - Qa'ida and other Sunni insurgents , echoing military warnings that the militant group is trying to provoke new bloodshed to undermine public trust in the Shiite - led Iraqi government .
" The terrorists are trying to rekindle the cycle of violence of previous years by creating an atmosphere of tension among the Iraqi people , " Iraqi President Jalal Talabani said in a statement .
" Our security forces must be more alert and firm .
Also , the political groups must unite . "
Sunni and Shia extremists remain active in Iraq , but truck bombs and suicide attacks bear the hallmarks of al Qaida .
The devastating strike outside the Foreign Ministry killed at least 60 people and wounded 250 , but the final toll is expected to be much higher .
The truck was parked in a largely unguarded car park across the street but the force of the blast tore through the 10 - storey building , which itself is surrounded by a concrete blast wall , as well as nearby apartment blocks .
A recent rise in bombings has dealt a blow to Iraqi government efforts to restore a sense of normalcy in the capital .
Iraqi security forces have begun removing concrete blast walls , which have been credited with helping reducing violence .
The walls have been coming down in residential and commercial areas with the aim of improving appearance and easing traffic congestion .

The Finance Ministry was the first of the midmorning attacks .
Minutes later mortars struck inside the Green Zone .
It was not known what damage the mortars caused or whether there were causalities .
Another car bomb targeted a joint Iraqi police and army patrol just outside the Finance Ministry , killing at least 19 people and wounding 22 .
Another blast in the commercial area of western Baghdad 's Baiyaa district killed two people and wounded 16 , while a bombing in the commercial district of Bab al - Muadham killed six people and wounded 24 , authorities said .
General Ray Odierno , the top US commander in Iraq , said this week that he wanted to deploy soldiers alongside Iraqi and Kurdish troops in northern Iraq where some of the worst attacks in recent weeks have been carried out .
US troops withdrew from Iraq 's cities on 30 June under a security pact that outlines the American withdrawal by the end of 2011 .
President Barack Obama has ordered all US combat troops out of Iraq by 31 August next year , leaving a contingency of up to 50,000 in training and advising roles .
The existence of the spot was confirmed by Venus Express
Astronomers are puzzled by a strange bright spot which has appeared in the clouds of Venus .
The spot was first identified by an amateur astronomer on 19 July and was later confirmed by the European Space Agency 's Venus Express spacecraft .
Data from the European probe suggests the spot appeared at least four days before it was spotted from Earth .
The bright spot has since started to expand , being spread by winds in Venus 's thick atmosphere .
Scientists are unsure as to what caused the bright spot tens of kilometres up .
However , a volcanic eruption is a possibility .
Much of the planet is thought to have been resurfaced by volcanism .
Though no firm evidence for present - day volcanism has been discovered , scientists suspect it could still be happening on Venus .
But an eruption would have needed to be extremely powerful to penetrate this far through the planet 's dense , mainly carbon dioxide , atmosphere .
Another potential source for the bright spot are charged particles from the Sun interacting with Venus 's atmosphere .
Alternatively , atmospheric turbulence may have caused bright material to become concentrated in one area .
This is not the first time bright areas have been spotted on Venus .
But this feature is unusual because it is confined to a relatively small region .
The spot was first identified by US amateur astronomer Frank Melillo , from Holtsville , New York .
Astronomers have recently been studying a " scar " on Jupiter , thought to have been caused by a comet or asteroid impact .

Greenland imposes self - rule , first step towards independence
The Arctic island Greenland , in their latest motion towards independence from Denmark , has announced that they will be now be implementing self - rule , following a referendum on greater autonomy in November .
The motion will allow Greenland greater authoritative and possessive powers to its natural resources .
The movement effectively lets the local government take control of the police and courts , and shifts the island ’s official language to Greenlandic ( Kalaallisut ) , but Denmark remains to be the final go - getter in terms of defence and foreign policy matters .
Greenlanders will now be treated as a separate people from Denmark ’s citizens by international law .

ABDULLAH AL - SAEED
In the Middle East as a whole , there is a growing awareness of the value of this technique , particularly given the volume and complexity of remains and the need to balance preservation with rapid industrial development .
Jordan has instituted and supports a program of aerial archeology , to which I have contributed .
Recently , however , archeologists have begun to use the satellite imagery publicly available since the launch in 2005 of Google Earth , particularly since its gradual incorporation , beginning in 2007 , of high - resolution images .
As a result , over some Arab countries — Jordan , Syria and Lebanon particularly — the resolution of available images is now generally high enough to conduct reliable , general archeological surveys .
Thanks also to the strong archive of historical aerial photographs from these regions , many dating from World War i to 1948 , the new information can often be compared to the more distant past .
Elsewhere , from North Africa to the Arabian Peninsula , Iran and Central Asia , there have been no traditions of aerial archeology , and the satellite photomaps on Google Earth remain an uneven patchwork of large areas insufficiently detailed for archeological searches .
There are , however , smaller but growing numbers of “ windows ” of high - quality imagery among the patches .
Both Saudi and international archeologists have long recognized that among the countries in the Middle East , Saudi Arabia remains one of the most tantalizing .
Though it is more than one - fifth the size of the us and almost nine times the area of the uk , only a handful of major Saudi sites were well known until the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s , when ground surveys began to identify smaller sites .
Quite recently , a major breakthrough came with the recognition that the Shuway - mas site south of Hayil , Saudi Arabia — which is not even mentioned in the 1998 edition of the Cambridge Illustrated History of Prehistoric Art — is the home of one of the four best collections of ancient rock art in the world .
At a stroke , the art and the people who created it in such abundance opened the possibility of further investigations of what Saudi Deputy Minister for Antiquities and Museums Saad Abdul Aziz al - Rashid observed were “ numerous ancient stone kites , mounds , tails and enclosures in the area . ”
Above and below , left :
In the Harrat Khaybar region of Saudi Arabia , however , “ kites ” take on entirely different shapes — most notably the “ square pocket ” and “ barbed arrow ” — and the low walls of many of them show ruler - straight lines , raising new questions for archeologists .
Now , some of these low walls of stone — many long known to archeologists inside Saudi Arabia — are newly visible from any computer in the world .
The high - resolution image swaths reveal stunningly well - preserved evidence of widespread human activity in the distant past : www.alsahra.org, the Web site of amateur archeologist Abdullah Al - Saeed , MD , and his fariq al - sahra ( “ Desert Team ” ) , is a good place to start .
Roughly 80 percent of the Google Earth imagery of central Saudi Arabia remains inadequately detailed for even rudimentary surveys .
However , among the high - resolution windows are those that cover parts of the Harrat Khaybar , an area of about 13,000 square kilometers ( 5000 sq mi ) centered about 100 kilometers ( 60 mi ) northeast of Madinah .
( A harrat is a lava flow and the associated lava boulders beyond it ; a series of harrats runs down western Saudi Arabia . )
Another high - resolution window opens on the Harrat Harrah , which runs from north of Al - Jawf to straddle the Jordanian panhandle and reach north into Syria .
In Jordan , the Harrat Harrah has been extensively explored for decades through the Aerial Archeology in Jordan project .
Its findings offer a key to at least some of what Al - Saeed and his colleagues have called attention to on their Web site and in the Harrat Khaybar .
The Jordanian aerial surveys date back to the 1920’s , when the British Royal Air Force opened an airmail route from Egypt to India .
The route ran across the northern Harrat Harrah , where the pilots were struck by the numbers and variety of archeological remains visible in that rugged , thinly populated landscape .
Bedouin told them the structures and walls they saw were “ the works of the ‘ Old Men . ’ ”
Now , Al - Saeed and his colleagues have posted on their Web site more “ works of the Old Men ” located 600 kilometers ( 372 mi ) south of the Jordanian panhandle and about 200 kilometers ( 125 mi ) north of Madinah .
The most striking are the so - called “ kites , ” the remnants of long stone walls most likely built by groups of hunters to trap game ; the walls outline the shape of a child ’s kite .
But the kites are huge :
The “ body ” is a wall enclosing a corral - like space often 100 or more meters ( 328 ' ) across .
The “ tails , ” two or more walls running out from the head , are typically each a few hundred meters long , but they can be as long as two or three kilometers ( 1.2 –1.8 mi ) .
On the ground , however , kites are almost impossible to find , because the walls , built of basalt boulders , are only about a meter ( 3 ' ) wide and their surviving height is seldom over half a meter , making them nearly invisible on a landscape already thickly strewn with the same rock .
From above , however , they stand out clearly , and their entire shape can be seen , as well as the wider patterns of neighboring kites and other structures .
Hundreds of these kites — and there may ultimately be thousands — are already widely recorded as far north as Syria .
Elsewhere in the world , they are known as far away as Uzbekistan and Scandinavia .
Alerted by Al - Saeed , I undertook a systematic search of this Google window north of Madinah and found 239 kites in the western part of an area of 1200 square kilometers ( 463 sq mi ) .
The density , about one per three square kilometers ( 1.16 sq mi ) , exceeds that in most of Jordan .
As in Jordan , the Saudi kites appear in great chains running broadly north - south , the tails splaying out and sometimes linked to a neighboring kite on either side .
In almost every case , the wide “ mouths ” represented by the kite tails open to the west or southwest — leading to speculation that this might reflect the grazing or migration patterns of the game that was hunted .
The novelty of the kites in the Harrat Khaybar region , however , is that , with few exceptions , they appear in two shapes not found elsewhere : “ barbed arrows ” and “ square pockets . ”
In addition , unlike the gentle , almost freehand curves that characterize the lines of most previously known kites , many of the Khaybar kites are precisely drawn , with ruler - straight lines that often meet at acute angles .
Why did the Harrat Khaybar kite builders feel the need to build such straight and angular walls ?
An elementary concept of precise geometric forms was clearly familiar to the designers .
Indeed , it was apparently not enough for the builders to broadly define an enclosure , tails and contiguous circular enclosures — possibly hides for hunters — but it was also important to carry that through into careful design on the ground at the building stage .
The square - pocket kite uses a line hidden at the end of each pocket .
Again this design is , so far , unique to the Harrat Khaybar area .
As these four images ( above and below , right ) , three from the Al - Hayit region , show , keyhole and pendant shapes vary in size from a few meters to dozens of meters , and they are often found arranged along “ avenues ” that are invisible to builders of modern highways .
Bottom right : A row of keyholes at the edge of a Google Earth high - resolution “ window ” in the Khaybar region is clearly discernible — but not in the bottom , low - resolution part of the image .
Although this is the greatest concentration of kites in any of the newly open windows in Google Earth , there are others : Some 100 kilometers east of Harrat Khaybar , in the vicinity of Al - Hayit , Al - Saeed had found more kites .
My systematic search , however , identified only 10 kites in a window of about 360 square kilometers ( 140 sq mi ) .
Here , most were relatively simple .
Is this disappointing ?
Not really — the number , variety and forms used in different regions will help answer many questions :
Why were they built ?
When were they built ?
By whom ?
As for the purpose of the kites , the archeological consensus has long been that they were animal traps , and that the stone walls we see may have supported wooden fence posts or piles of brush .
Gazelle and , to a lesser extent , oryx and onager could be driven into the widely spaced walls at the mouth of the kite and herded through the gradually narrowing space into the “ head , ” where more hunters awaited them for killing or capture .
At Harrat Khaybar , it appears the builders may have used the “ barbs ” as sub - traps , or traps - within - the - trap .
Although there have been dissenting scholars arguing for the use of kites as enclosures for livestock husbandry , that explanation is not convincing to most .
Nonetheless , there are no definitive answers , only hypotheses .
Two other structures known in Jordan were also found again in the new Saudi Arabian windows .
First are the “ wheels ” that have been encountered widely ; in Jordan , they are often located close to kites .
They come in a variety of forms , most simply a near - perfect circle of 20 to 50 meters ’ ( 65 – 165 ' ) diameter in which six or more spokes create wedge - shaped chambers around a central hub .
Others have a succession of small cairns running round the outside of the rim .
In the windows visible over Saudi Arabia , these wheels are rare ; they are usually smaller than the Jordanian ones , and they often consist of just four spokes .
Their purpose may be funerary , but that is no more than a conjecture .
ABDULLAH AL -SAEED
Second , and more abundantly , are two types of what also appear to be burial structures , which collectively must represent sustained activity over a long period of time .
First there are “ pendant tombs ” — circular burial enclosures at the end of a line of small cairns .
These have turned up in both the Harrat Khaybar and Al - Hayit areas .
In a few instances , they have a second enclosure at the other end ( “ double pendant tombs ” ) .
They often turn up in large groups , forming what appear to be entire cemeteries , or parts of them , and they are to be counted in the hundreds , perhaps even in the thousands .
Now we come to the “ keyhole tombs ” and the “ gates , ” both novelties of the Harrat Khaybar , structures that are striking because of their unexpected , unique forms and their astonishing numbers .
The keyhole tombs usually consist of a circular enclosure at the head of stone walls that form an isosceles triangle .
There are numerous variations in size and in the relationships of circles and courtyards :
In a few places the two are completely separated , and in others the triangle has been elongated so much it begins to look similar to the general form of some pendant tombs .
Al - Saeed and the Desert Team visited a number of these structures , and their ground photographs confirm that the walls are built of dry - laid masonry , but set out carefully and often still standing a meter or more high .
Above and below : Called “ gates ” by archeologists , these rectangular shapes appear to be unique to Saudi Arabia , and their purpose remains obscure .
I have yet to count the various tombs in the Khaybar and Al - Hayit areas , but they appear to number well into the thousands .
In some places they form necropolises , with the tombs arranged on either side of avenues : Around Al - Hayit , I counted 13 such avenues with an aggregate length of about 24 kilometers ( 15 mi ) .
Extrapolating from a count of a randomly selected section , I estimate there are about 1000 tombs on these avenues .
To that we should add as many more tombs scattered in between , plus an unknown number already overbuilt by modern development .
All around these are even larger numbers of small circular tumuli , which may be the remains of individual burials .
In all , we are looking at one of the most extraordinary prehistoric funerary landscapes on the planet — and that ’s still not all .
Also visible in the Harrat Khaybar window , mainly in the same area as kites but also further east , are hundreds of sites which can best be described as looking like simple gates laid flat : a “ post ” at either end with two ( but occasionally three to five ) “ rails ” in between .
They can vary a great deal in size , from five or 10 meters long ( 16–32 ' ) to a hundred meters ( 320 ' ) or more .
The key element is surely the posts , which appear to be dense heaps of boulders , and which may again be burial places .
My own count yielded 95 such gates , but only a future detailed survey , including ground visits , will fully catalogue them .
As to who built them and when , Jordanian fieldwork has concluded that kites and at least some of the associated structures date back to around the fifth millennium BC , to a time characterized by a wetter , lusher environment with far more vegetation , perennial water and the kind of abundant wildlife so richly depicted in the rock art .
Whether that is also true , even broadly , of the Khaybar kites is too soon to tell , for their more sophisticated forms and rather sharper appearance may imply less decay and thus a younger age .
As for the cemeteries , many of the keyhole and gate types are entirely new forms , but the pendants have parallels in Jordan , where a recent discovery of a necropolis from between the late Neolithic and the early Bronze ages , with hundreds of tombs and ritual structures dating back an estimated 9000 years , includes pendant tombs like those in Saudi Arabia .
Already these isolated areas of publicly available high - resolution satellite imagery have expanded our knowledge and understanding of ancient human activity in the west - central Arabian Peninsula .
Alongside the astonishing thousands of rock art records further north ( and worth searching for near the new kites , too , since kites and rock art are often found together in Jordan ) , the archeology , and indeed the cultural heritage , of Saudi Arabia continues to emerge as both astonishing and impressive .
As Google Earth gradually pieces in further high - resolution imagery , this “ archeological explosion ” will create immense opportunities for studying — and challenges for surveying , presenting and preserving — the sites in Saudi Arabia and , for that matter , all around our ever more visible world .
Lal Mohammed was determined to exercise his right to have a say in his country 's future and vote in the election .
It was a decision for which he paid a horrific price .
On his way to the polling station he was held by Taliban fighters , beaten brutally , and then had his nose and ears slashed off .
What happened to the 40 - year - old farmer is the savage and hidden side of the election in a country experiencing a bloody war .
This chilling account is the first from a victim of retribution
taken by insurgents on someone who had defied their order to boycott the polls .
And it helps to explain why so many people throughout the country were simply too afraid to vote .

The Independent listened to Mr Mohammed 's terrifying tale in a house where he has taken refuge and is being guarded by friends .
To add to the misery he has suffered , he has not received any serious medical treatment for three days because one of the main hospitals in the Afghan capital – where he had arrived after an arduous three - day journey – declared it had no room to keep him due to chronic overcrowding .
Eminent Afghan and international figures had encouraged citizens to defy the Taliban and vote in the elections .
Yet , as a casualty in the process , Mr Mohammed and his friends say he has received no official support .
We found Mr Mohammed , covered by a shawl , lying on a threadbare sofa in a tiny room , with shafts of dusty sunlight coming through a smashed window pane .
Two friends , fellow farmers from Uruzgan , carefully bolted the metal door behind us as we crowded into the compartment , which was little more than 10ft long and 5ft wide .
Nowhere , people have learnt to their cost , is beyond the reach of the insurgents .
In pain , and often in tears , the father of eight children described how his ordeal began when he left his village , Galpagel , in Uruzgan province , on the morning of election day , 20 August , at about 10 am to vote .
About half an hour into the 90 - minute walk , Mr Mohammed was stopped by three men with AK - 47 rifles and bandoliers of ammunition , who did not hide their faces and identified themselves as Talibs .
The gunmen searched him and found the electoral registration papers he was carrying and from that point his fate was sealed .
" They shouted at me and then they began beating me with their rifle butts , they said they were going to teach me a lesson .
The most painful of the blows was when they kept hitting me on the face , " he recounted , while shifting the bandage covering his face to show bruising and what looked like a fractured cheekbone .

" They were beating me so hard and kicking me that I fell to the ground .
Then one man sat on top of my chest and got out a knife and I began to feel terrible pain when he slit my nose .
I was passing out , but another man was still using knives and there was more pain , I could feel blood all over my face .
I thought it was better to die . "
Mr Mohammed fell into unconsciousness after that .
He woke up in agony after a man passing by found him , spreadeagled on the side of the road , possibly left by his attackers as an example to others .
No cars were available in the remote area of rough roads and the farmer , who was drifting in and out consciousness , was carried by a donkey for the best part of a day to a main road where , at last , a taxi driver was persuaded to take him to Kabul .
" The journey on the donkey was very hard , I did not think I would survive that , the road was bad and my face was really hurting , " recalled Mr Mohammed among bouts of coughing .
" I was very happy when I got to the hospital .
But they said they had no beds and I was told to come back in a few days . "
Mr Mohammed is a Hazara living in a province bordering Helmand , Kandahar and Zabul in the south of the country .
Uruzgan has a mixture of Afghanistan 's communities but has also been one of the hotbeds of the resurgent insurgency .
The Taliban fighters who ambushed him were Pashtuns , but Mr Mohammed and his Hazara friends do not believe the prime motive for the assault was sectarian .
" We have lived there for a long time .
The Talibs had been warning people not to vote , saying it was a conspiracy against Islam by foreigners , " said Mr Mohammed .
" But I had voted in the last election and I do not think I was doing anything wrong .
I am not involved in the war and I do not have anything to do with foreigners .
Look at my hands , I am only a farmer , I only work on the land . "
Mr Mohammed has now been promised surgery by the hospital .
His main concern , he says , is his family .
" There are 11 people and I am the only breadwinner .
My youngest child is two years old , I do not know what is going to happen to them , who will look after them ... " his voice broke into sobs .
The Taliban had vowed to disrupt the election and had repeatedly warned people against participating .
On polling day they carried out a series of attacks across the country killing 26 people and injuring about 80 .
There were subsequent reports , uncorroborated , that they cut off the ink - stained fingertips , which showed they had voted , of a number of people .
However , Afghan and Western officials accept , and The Independent can confirm , that election monitors failed to turn up in vast swaths of the south because it was deemed too dangerous and little or no record was kept of the intimidation which took place there .
One of Mr Mohammed 's friends who is now looking after him said with a bitter laugh : " All the foreigners , people like Mr Karzai , said we should go out and vote .
But look what happened to Lal Mohammed .
Will they look after him now ?
They have not given him medicine , we are having to gather food for him . "
Mr Mohammed said his family had borrowed 20,000 Afghanis ( around £ 250 ) from a local money lender to tide them over and buy medicine for him in the capital , Kabul .
" We have to pay back 40,000 Afghanis in three months , " he said .
" I do not know how we are going to do that , I think we will have to sell things .
I do not know when I 'll work again .
" Poor people suffer in this country , I do not know whether the elections will change that .
I do not think I will try to vote again , I am now very frightened . "
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
There is a " maker 's movement " gaining prominence on a global scale .
Mister Jalopy works out of converted hot - rod repair shop .
This is where he builds " the stuff of my dreams . "
One of its pied pipers is a man known by his pen name , Mister Jalopy .
His agenda is simple .
" You need to be able to modify , hack , repair , rebuild and reuse the stuff that you buy . "
Mister Jalopy 's name comes from a blog he started years ago .
From his Web site :
" When I started the Hooptyrides blog , I pictured a modest used car lot of broken - down , flat - tired junkers that represented great promise and little else .
Lit with strings of bare light bulbs , I dreamed of a little desert lot of plucky automobiles and a faded neon sign that erratically blinked ' Mister Jalopy 's Hooptyrides . ' "
Mister Jalopy owns a laundromat and a used - bicycle store , and he operates out of a converted hot - rod repair shop along an industrial strip of land in the shadow of Interstate 5 .
He calls his workshop " Hooptyrides World Headquarters . "
" It 's my personal shop where I do my writing , think up my crackpot business schemes , repair bicycles and do my auto maintenance ... where I build the stuff of my dreams . "
It 's brimming with high - quality tools , odds and ends from 20 years of harvesting garage sales , and machines like a lathe and welder that would delight a working tradesman .
He created the " world 's largest iPod . "
It 's housed in a 1950s record console that can now digitize his music off the turntable , and the original buttons control the iPod .
He also made an " urban guerrilla movie theater " -- a handmade movie projector sitting on an adult tricycle .
Watch Mister Jalopy at work »
His used - bike shop , Coco's Variety , is named after one of his two dogs .
" The credo of my store is ' Faded champions reborn for another chance at glory . ' "
He adds : " These old bikes , already manufactured , [ are ] tenderly brought back to life for someone to love anew .
The best bike for the environment is one that already exists .
Not one made fresh . "
Mister Jalopy goes to garage sales every week .
" Some of my favorite stuff ... are the things that were made or worn by human hands .
There 's an incredible feeling of soul . "
His most treasured find ?
" It was a lowly glass Skippy jar filled with all of the earthly treasures of a kid from the ' 50s . "
There was a chunky eraser , toy soldiers , and caps for a cap gun .
Mister Jalopy has a practical approach to saving the environment and surviving in a downturn economy .
" The hands - off era is over .
We were seduced by low prices .
Our landfills are filled with cheap plastic fans , broken vacuum cleaners .
We 're feeling the crunch economically .
Maybe this stuff should be repairable . "
He wrote an article for Make magazine called the " Maker 's Bill of Rights . "
It outlines the need for manufacturers to make products that are repairable , modifiable , have replaceable parts and come with a manual .
Of products that are glued shut , he has this to say : " The idea of the Maker 's Bill of Rights was to say , if you can't open it , you do n't own it . "
Dale Dougherty is the creator of Make magazine , which is at the core of the movement .
" We live in a complex world .
I wanted to make a magazine to showcase innovation and ideas around the world ... even in Third World countries . "
Make magazine sponsors the annual Maker Faire in Northern California .
More than 500 exhibitors will showcase their ideas and innovations on the last weekend in May .
Families are a big part of their business .
" There are no famous rock bands or stunts to bring people in , " Dougherty says .
Last year 65,000 people attended .
Mister Jalopy will be there hosting the main stage .
" There 's this amazing community of people that are makers : carpenters , fabricators , mechanics , electronics repair people , designers of products , garden designers ... that 's the great thing about the maker movement .
It is passionate individuals willing to make mistakes and build the stuff of our dreams . "
" I'm a professional amateur .
I have n't been trained to do anything .
I 'm not an expert carpenter , metalworker or mechanic .

Asked if he regretted what he said , Kerlikowske said , " Sometimes you make a mistake and you work very hard to correct it .
That happens .

Last month , Obama 's drug czar raised eyebrows by claiming that " marijuana is dangerous and has no medicinal benefit . "
Though not an unusual remark for a drug czar to make , the comment came as a surprise given the new administration 's stated policy of respecting state medical marijuana laws .
Well , it looks like someone in the administration had a little talk with the drug czar , because he 's already backtracking :
Of course , this is still utter nonsense given the abundance of scientific evidence that medical marijuana works .
But it 's remarkable to hear the drug czar acknowledge making " a mistake . "
As false and obnoxious as his corrected statement may be , it 's nice to know that the word " mistake " is in his vocabulary .
Lightning Joe Collins vs. Mogadishu Mike Steele ( Round II )
I ’ve just finished reading an investigation relating to a grudge Col. Michael Steele developed against one of his battalion commanders in Iraq .
Any sympathy I had for Steele , a veteran of the “ Black Hawk Down ” battle in Somalia in October 1993 , pretty much evaporated as I read the report by Brig .
Gen. Rickey L. Rife , the 101st Airborne ’s assistant division commander for support , on how Steele handled his brigade ( also called a BCT , for “ brigade combat team ” ) .
“ Four of seven battalion commanders thought the 3rd BCT command climate could best be described as negative , intimidating , oppressive , frustration and zero tolerance .
This was echoed by five of the seven battalion command sergeants major [ the most senior enlisted soldiers in the brigade ] , two of whom had been threatened with relief . ”
Two of the battalion commanders said they wanted to get out of the brigade because of “ the demoralizing climate created by the 3rd BCT commander ” - that is , Col. Steele .
The majority view of battalion leadership was that the brigade had a “ uniformly poor ” climate , Rife found .
Rife ’s report exonerated Steele of the charge that he had created a command climate that encouraged “ illegal , wanton , or superfluous killing . ”
But his findings beg the question of why Steele was left in command for so long when he clearly was at odds with where the Army was trying to go in Iraq , and was leading a unit that had many officers and NCOs chafing under his macho bullshit leadership .
“ Soldiers repeatedly stated the brigade commander ’s expectation was for insurgents to be killed , rather than captured or detained — if the ROE [ rules of engagement ] permitted , ” Rife notes .
Actually , in a counterinsurgency campaign , many in the Army had learned by this time , the best thing to do with most insurgents , but not with the hard - core al Qaeda guys , was to turn them — that is , bring them over to the American side .
The second best was to capture them and interrogate them .
The third and worst option was to kill them , which meant their intelligence value was lost , and their relatives were antagonized and looking for revenge .
Indeed , just a year later , U.S. policy in Iraq was to put the Sunni insurgents on the American payroll — almost 100,000 of them , by some accounts .
I find Steele ’s case more egregious than that of a similar officer , Lt. Col .
Nate Sassaman , because it occurred after two years of additional hard - won experience in Iraq .
Back in 2004 , at the time that Sassaman ’s battalion engaged in crimes such as making hand - cuffed Iraqi prisoners jump into the Tigris River , it was arguable to some that fear and intimidation of Iraqis was still the way to go .
By the time Steele got to Iraq , that debate was pretty much over inside the Army .

It is a good time for statically recompiled versions of BASIC from old computers .
Â
First there was Apple I BASIC .Â
Then came Commodore BASIC .Â
Now , due to overwhelming demand , we ’re proud to release TI - 99 / 4A BASIC .
For those unfamiliar the TI - 99 / 4A was a home computer by Texas Instruments released in 1981 .
Unusually for the time it had a 16 - bit CPU : the TMS9900 .
Download the program from the project page on SourceForge .
Binaries for Windows and Mac OS X are available and the source should compile on most POSIX - like systems .
If you port it to a new platform please drop us a line ; we ’d love hear about it .
It supports the same interfaces as the previous projects .
Â
You can use it interactively in direct mode :
$ tibasic TI BASIC READY > print 4 * atn (1 ) 3.141592654 > bye
Or you can write a line - numbered program :
$ tibasic >10 FOR I=1 TO 10 > 20 PRINT TAB ( I ) ; " Hello , world ! "
>30 NEXT I >RUN Hello , world !
Hello , world !
Hello , world !
Hello , world !
Hello , world !
Hello , world !
Hello , world !
Hello , world !
Hello , world !
Hello , world !
** DONE ** >BYE
You can also run programs from a file :
$ cat name .bas 10 INPUT
" What is your name ?
" : N$ 20 PRINT " Hello , " ; N$ ; " ! " $ tibasic .
exe name .
bas
What is your name ?
James Hello , James !
There are a few sample programs available on the homepage that you can run in this manner .
How it works
This program works much like the already mentioned Commodore BASIC project .
The original program is statically recompiled to produce a new native binary .
The recompiler is the work of Michael Steil and theÂ support for the TI - 99 / 4A is by James Abbatiello .
The output of the recompiler is tibasic .c which is platform independent .
The support functions are in runtime_functions .c and it is this file that you would edit to port to a new system or to add new features .
There are a couple quirks of the TI - 99 / 4A which made this a bit trickier to support than the C64 version :
The BASIC interpreter was not written in assembly language as you might expect .
Instead it was programmed in something called Graphics Programming Language ( GPL ) .
GPL was much like an assembly language with some high - level primitives for commonly needed functions .
A program written in GPL would be assembled to bytecode and then run on an interpreter that was written in TMS9900 assembly language .
This made BASIC programs on the machine rather slow .
The CPU would execute the GPL interpreter .
The GPL interpreter would run the BASIC interpreter .
Finally , the BASIC interpreter would run your program .
Only the TMS9900 code is statically recompiled in this program .
The GPL still runs interpreted just as it did on the original machine .
While it would theoretically be possible to statically recompile the GPL code as well this would be significantly more difficult since GPL was never officially documented by TI .
The only definitive reference is the original interpreter .
C64 BASIC outputs characters to the screen via one function ( CHROUT ) which was easy to trap .
TI - 99 / 4A BASIC outputs to the screen with direct writes to video memory from multiple different places in the code .
This requires some ugly hacks to get anything approximating reasonable on stdout .

The Cassette , Disk , and Sound devices are not currently emulated .

Apple is working on a software update to address hard drive issues affecting its latest 15 - inch and 17 - inch MacBook Pro laptops .
Users are complaining in droves on Internet forums that machines configured with faster , 7,200 - rpm Seagate hard disk drives ( HDD ) make clicking and beeping noises that are often a precursor to slowdowns and freeze - ups .
An Apple spokeswoman could not elaborate about what fix the company is working on or when it might be available , but said Apple is aware of recent complaints .
Comments on Apple support forums , which have grown to more than 80 pages in length , indicate that the drive problems are related to the anti-drop sensor in the Seagate Momentus 7200.4 HDD ( model ST9500420ASG ) .
Even though the issue may be related to the motion sensor , the problem occurs whether the computer is being moved or is stationary , users said .
One user from Southern California , " wessto , " posted comments on an Apple discussion forum describing the problem : " I recently purchased a new MBP [ MacBook Pro ] 15 , 3GHz , 500 GB 7200 rpm hard drive , build - to - order .
The hard drive appears to be a Seagate ST9500420ASG .
I am experiencing a strange hard drive click followed 80 % of the time by a beep .
It is definitely not a beep from the speaker .
Additionally , it happens at any time , even when the computer is sitting on a perfectly still table . "
Upset MacBook
Pro owners also weighed in on forums at AppleInsider .
On the AppleInsider site , a user named " mgoldman " said : " I bought a 3.06GHz , 4GB RAM , 500 GB 7200 RPM MPB the week they were announced .
For the first week after I got it , it was normal , except for the weird electronic beeping coming from the HD .
At first , I thought it was just a new HD technology that occasionally made noise .
Then , performance got progressively worse .
I usually give this machine a workout -- running VMWare virtual machine with a host of other apps on the Mac side .
It started to get sluggish after about 2 - 3 days .
The hard drive would seem to hang up ....
Then ... , 2 weeks into owning the machine , a cold start first thing in the morning took 10 minutes .
After it booted , any click on an icon rendered the MBP useless -- beach ball and unresponsive .
Sometimes , after about a minute , the machine will carry out the task you clicked to do , but then immediately go back to being unresponsive . "
AppleInsider said users appeared to solve the problem by replacing the beeping / clicking Momentus 7200.4 drive with a more recent models .
" But this has n't been broadly confirmed as of this writing , " the site reported .
Among those who have also seen the problem is a Computerworld editor who in July bought a 15 - in MacBook Pro with the 7,200 - rpm drive .
A few days later , he began hearing a series of clicks .
The noise went away for a few days , then returned -- this time with an intermittent beeping .
Following the advice on Apple 's forum from other users , the editor turned off unnecessary services running in the background , to no avail .
" It 's just the beeps I hear and sometimes it 's click - click - beep .
The click sounds like a [ drive ] head parking .
The beep sounds like an error message . "
Today , the editor experienced a drive pause that lasted about 15 seconds .
When the computer was again usable , multiple windows he had been trying to open popped up all at once .
This is also not the first time this year Seagate has had problems with its 7,200 - rpm hard drives .
In January , Seagate 's support forums were flooded with complaints over drives freezing up during data transfers -- or failing all together .
The company said that problem was caused by a firmware bug affecting not only the 7200.11 model but several other models manufactured through December 2008 , including the DiamondMax 22 , the Barracuda ES.2 SATA and the SV35 .
Seagate issued a firmware upgrade .
Several MacBook
Pro users have posted videos to YouTube demonstrating the beeping and clicking noises associated with the drives .
Some even added a dash of humor by mixing the sounds in with a MacBook Pro commercial .
The Leisure Suit Larry games embody the worst excessess of late 80's / early 90's design .
I 've said it before and I 'll say it again :
There is a seriously ugly and amazing coffee table art book dying to be made out of this .
Australia ’s centre - left ruling party on Saturday voted for national recognition of same - sex unions but stopped short of lifting a ban on gay marriage .
The national Labor conference voted to develop a system for the registration and recognition of same - sex relationships , after gay rights advocates failed to gather enough numbers for a resolution to legalise gay marriage .
But frontbencher Anthony Albanese told delegates while it was not his “ ideal position ” , the watered - down resolution was an important reflection of shifting public attitudes .
“ History is moving forward on these issues , ” said Albanese , presenting the motion for vote …
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd won the 2007 election on a platform that supported the former conservative government ’s legal definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman .
Rudd , who considers himself a moderate Christian , said earlier this week that he “ fully respected ” the integrity of same - sex relationships but would not change Labor ’s ban on gay marriage .
His government has moved a raft of legislation to remove same - sex discrimination from almost 100 national laws , in areas such as pensions , tax and employment .
Thousands of people held rallies and demonstrations across the nation as the vote was held , calling on Labor to legalise gay marriage …
A recent poll suggested up to 60 percent of Australians supported gay marriage and the statistics bureau in May announced it would count same - sex couples who declared themselves married in the national census .
Civil Rights means everyone has an equal opportunity under law .
Keep the crap archaic religious definitions out of how you run the state .
Federal regulators wanted to know why Apple rejected Google 's innovative Voice app from its iPhone app store and what role AT&T played in the rejection .
The rejection drew sharp criticism from around the net that Apple and AT&T were using their dominant position in the smartphone market to stifle innovation .
On Friday , AT&T told the FCC it had no part in the decision , while Apple claims it never happened .
Instead , the company is still just " studying " Google 's application , which is taking a long time because the Voice service might be too confusing for iPhone users , Apple vice president Catherine Novelli wrote in a seven - page letter .
As for Google 's side of the story ?
We still do n't know .
The search giant , which likes to pride itself on openness and transparency and doing no evil , told its side to the FCC in a confidential filing , but blacked it out in the accompanying public one .
Google was the only one of the three companies to use this option .
The FCC asked the tech giants three weeks ago to explain why the app was rejected , what role AT&T played in keeping a competitive service off the popular device and what rules Apple and Google use to decide which apps get sold by their respective app stores ( Android , in the case of Google ) .
Google Voice lets users use a single number to handle all calls , and Google redirects the calls to users ' home , mobile and work phones .
It also provides free SMS and cheap long - distance calling , but phone calls and SMS message still use voice minutes and SMS services on a cell phone plan .
AT&T initially declined comment on the matter in July — leading many to blame the telecom giant for blocking a competitive service .
But AT&T 's denial to the FCC left no wiggle room .
AT&T was not asked about the matter by Apple at any time , nor did it offer any view one way or the other .
More broadly , AT&T does not own , operate or control the Apple App Store and is not typically consulted regarding the approval or rejection of applications for the App Store or informed when an application is approved or rejected .
Furthermore , AT&T does not block consumers from accessing any lawful website on the Internet .
Apple was less forthcoming :
Apple has not rejected the Google Voice application , and continues to study it .
The application has not been approved because , as submitted for review , it appears to alter the iPhone ’s distinctive user experience by replacing the iPhone 's core mobile telephone functionality and Apple user interface with its own user interface for telephone calls , text messaging and voicemail ....
In addition , the iPhone user 's entire Contacts database is transferred to Google 's servers , and we have yet to obtain any assurances from Google that this data will only be used in appropriate ways .
These factors present several new issues and questions to us that we are still pondering at this time .
AT&T and Apple told the FCC that they did have an agreement that Apple would not help iPhone owners use VOIP calling services like Skype on the iPhone .
VOIP calls use the data , rather than the voice plan , and would cut into the companies ' profits .
Thus , Apple and AT&T agreed to cripple the Skype iPhone app so it would only work when the iPhone used a Wi -Fi connection .
The companies say they also agree not to let in apps that stream live television , which AT&T says would strain its network .
As for Google and its app store ?
Its FCC filing emphasizes that Android phone users can get apps from outside the store — unlike iPhone users .
( Users can " jailbreak " their iPhones to do so , but this invalidates the warranty . )
It says only 1 percent of apps in its online marketplace have been rejected , mostly because of copyright or obscenity reasons .
Google did not , however , mention that it , too , crippled mobile apps at the request of a telecom .
T - Mobile asked Google to remove apps that let customers use their phone as a modem for a laptop , a practice known as tethering , and Google complied .
T - Mobile , like all of the United States ' largest carriers , charges customers extra for that service .
Google later re-allowed the app , but not for T - Mobile customers .

Getting lost ( Image : Heads Of State )
THE journey seemed simple enough , on the map anyway .
Allison
Fine left her home to drive to Vermont , just a few hours north on a major highway .
She had studied the route and had a GPS gadget to help her .
Nevertheless , she soon had absolutely no idea where she was .
“ I do n’t know what happened , ” she says , “ but I pulled over in tears , called my husband and said , ‘ find me on Google Maps and talk me to Vermont ’ . ”
This he did , staying on the line for more than an hour .
Fine is an extreme case , but the feeling of getting hopelessly lost is something that most of us can relate to .
In fact , along with our flair for language and our unparalleled intelligence , less - than - stellar navigational skills are among the things that can be considered uniquely human .
While the vast majority of animals have no trouble finding their way around , most people , when stripped of maps or signs , are notoriously bad at it .
A handful are so terrible at orienting themselves , even in places they know well , that they rarely leave the house alone ( see “ Lost in space ” ) .
“ I try to study maps , ” says Fine .
“ But when I get out into the real world , it just looks completely different . ”
Until recently , little was known about how the human inner compass works .
This is partly because “ sense of direction ” is not one neatly defined ability .
Instead , it is made up of many different skills , such as awareness and memory of your surroundings , sensing your speed and direction changes over time , and tracking the location of …
Back in 1996 , after the initially very mysterious explosion and crash of Flight 800 from JFK to Rome , there were numerous eyewitness accounts of a " streak in the sky " just before the crash .
This led to the " missile theory " of the crash , which was eventually attributed to the explosion of the center fuel tank by the NTSB .
But , also at the time , it was suggested that a meteor of sufficient size could have struck the plane , bringing it down .
Could a meteor have brought down Air France 447 ?
Today we are starting to see reports that there actually may have been a meteor :
However , both pilots of an Air Comet flight from Lima to Lisbon sent a written report on the bright flash they said they saw to Air France , Airbus and the Spanish civil aviation authority , the airline told CNN .
" Suddenly , we saw in the distance a strong and intense flash of white light , which followed a descending and vertical trajectory and which broke up in six seconds , " the captain wrote .
Obviously for any given flight the chances are very , very small that a meteor will bring down an airliner , but as Hailey and Helfand pointed out in a letter to the NYT in 1996 , the correct question to ask is this : " What is the probability that , for all flights in history , one or more could have been downed by a meteor ? "
They concluded that there was a 1 - in - 10 chance that this could happen ... let 's use their logic , brought up to date somewhat , for 2009 , for Flight 447 .
Helfand , an astronomer , is presumably the one who estimated that " approximately 3,000 meteors a day with the requisite mass strike Earth " .
This is a difficult number to get .
How much mass ?
How fast does it need to be moving ?
But let 's assume that this number is correct ; it translates to 125 meteors per hour .
Next we need to know the total number of flight hours at altitude for all commercial planes .
In 2000 there were about 18 million flights per year .
Clearly in the past 20 years ( which we 'll take as our reference , since it spans 1989 - 2009 , with both flights 800 and 447 ) it was not always so ... but let 's take a guess that the 18 million figure is roughly correct for that 20 year period .
That would yield 360 million commercial airline flights from 1989 - 2000 .
Hailey and Helfand assumed that each flight was two hours in duration .
Again , a tough number to find on line , so we 'll take it at face value , giving us 720 million flight hours in our reference period .
They also claim that if there were 3500 planes in the air at any time , this would correspond to covering two - billionths of Earth 's surface .
Now the earth 's surface area is 5x10 ^ 14 m ^ 2 .
Using my trusty HP - 15 c , I get that this would imply an average target area for a commercial airliner of 291 m ^2 , which is reasonable .
Each plane , that is , covers 5.7x10 ^ - 13 of Earth 's surface .
If a meteor hits the earth it has that probability of hitting a given plane on average .
So , in our reference 20 - year period we have 720 million hours of flight time , times 125 meteors per hour , times 5.7x10 ^ - 13 = 0.051 , which we can take as the average number of airliners struck by meteors in the period 1989 - 2009 .
That 's a one - in - twenty chance of some plane going down for this reason in that 20 year period .
Extrapolating to all flights ever would require a better estimate of total flight hours , but it 's not twenty times the number in the past 20 years , for sure - that is , it 's not yet close to one .
Obviously there are a lot of uncertainties in this estimate ; perhaps a factor of two from the number of meteors of sufficient mass per day , the average flight duration and number of flights ?
Anyway the meteor idea is not crazy , though not likely .
The weather seems more likely to be at the root of the tragedy ... but we may never know .
One thing , though , is clear : if we keep flying big planes at high altitude , eventually one will get hit by a meteor .

The incandescent light bulb is being phased out , but what will replace it ?
Stefano Tonzani investigates the technologies that are vying for our sockets .
The Centennial Light , which hangs in a fire station in Livermore , California , is the oldest working light bulb on Earth .
The four - watt night - light was switched on in 1901 and has been shining almost non -stop ever since , consuming roughly 3,500 kilowatt - hours of energy in total .
As the picture below shows , the bulb also looks surprisingly familiar : the technology of incandescent lights has changed very little over its lifetime .
Inside the bulb is a filament — carbon in this case , tungsten in today 's models — that is heated by the flow of electricity until it glows white and lights up the room .
The design is simple , versatile and cheap , just as it was when Thomas Edison first made it a commercial success in the 1880s .
Nonetheless , that technology is now on the way out .
In today 's energy - hungry world , the devices are too wasteful : some 98 % of the energy input ends up as heat instead of light .
Halogen lamps , which look more high - tech , are not any better .
Multiply that waste by the number of incandescent bulbs in residential , industrial and commercial settings — an estimated 4 billion standard light sockets in the United States alone — and it is clear why several countries are seeking to eliminate the bulbs entirely as a way to control carbon dioxide emissions .
In 2007 , for example , Australia became the first country to ban incandescent bulbs entirely ; the phase - out is scheduled to be completed by 2012 .
The member states of the European Union agreed to a similar ban in 2008 .
And the United States has pledged to eliminate most incandescents by 2014 .
“ Government mandates are putting welcome pressure on the field to evolve . ” Karl Leo
" The lighting field is a fairly conservative one , so these government mandates are putting on some welcome pressure to evolve , " says Karl Leo , an optoelectronics specialist and a founder of Novaled , a company in Dresden , Germany , that develops organic light - emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) .
But evolve into what ?
Although getting rid of incandescent bulbs makes environmental and economic sense , the race for a long - term replacement is wide open .
The Centennial Light : going strong 108 years on .
D. JONES
At present , the only technology that is mature enough to take over from the conventional light bulb is fluorescent lighting , which can turn 10 – 15 % of the input energy into light .
Fluorescent technology has improved substantially since the days when it was synonymous with being harsh and funny - coloured , and has come to dominate in industrial and commercial settings , where energy efficiency and long life are prime concerns .
In recent years , compact fluorescent bulbs that can be screwed into standard sockets have brought it ever farther into the home .
But fluorescent lighting has a number of drawbacks .
For example , fluorescent lamps do not work well in cold temperatures , and their lifespan can be significantly shortened if they are turned on and off frequently .
Perhaps worst of all , each lamp contains a small amount of mercury , which is toxic .
This presents consumers with a disposal problem at the end of the lamp 's life .
Some people also still complain about the colour rendering of fluorescent lights — the way the lamps make objects look compared with their appearance in natural sunlight .
Despite the substantial progress , domestic users in particular tend to prefer the warmer , slightly red-tinged tones of incandescent lights — although that preference is highly individual , says Charles Hunt , an electrical engineer at the University of California , Davis .
" The subjective fondness for particular light shades depends on gender ( women tend to prefer less harsh , warmer - coloured lights ) and origin of the person ( people from northern European countries prefer warmer lights whereas southern Europeans prefer colder , more blue - tinged ones ) . "
Another issue is that fluorescent lights require special circuitry to work with a dimming switch .
And dimmable is desirable : " Fifty per cent of home lights in the United States are dimmable , " says Hunt .
These problems may be overcome — but they seem serious enough to encourage innovators to search out successor technology .
Heavy investment
Perhaps the most widely anticipated of the technologies vying for centre stage is the light - emitting diode ( LED ) , which consists of two types of semiconductors in contact .
When a voltage is applied , positive charges coming from one side flow towards the junction and meet negative charges coming from the other side .
As these charges combine , they release their energy in the form of light , usually as one particular colour .
LEDs are long - lived , robust and roughly twice as efficient as fluorescents .
Indeed , they are already widely used for computers , television sets and other consumer electronics , and are becoming a market leader for outdoor applications such as traffic lights and indicator lights on cars .
" There are so many advantages to LEDs that we think there lies the future of lighting , " says Hans van Sprang , a senior scientist at Philips Research Laboratories in Eindhoven , the Netherlands .
Philips and other big industry players are investing heavily in the technology , supporting materials - science research that has helped LED technology to evolve rapidly .
Despite this , LEDs have not yet been adopted on a large scale for general lighting applications .
One problem is that an LED light powerful enough for room lighting has a very high initial cost compared with an equivalent incandescent bulb .
This can be a large psychological barrier for consumers , even though the cost of energy and maintenance is considerably lower .
Another problem is that an LED 's lifetime can reduce dramatically if it is operated at a high temperature .
This makes heat dissipation an important issue , especially for powerful lamps , and complicates efforts to reduce costs .
Making the LED semiconductors from substrates other than sapphire would be cheaper , and the alternatives , including silicon - based substrates , might improve heat management .
Light - emitting diodes , such as these in Craigieburn , Australia , can be combined to create huge displays .
J. GOLLINGS / ARCAID / CORBIS
Another challenge is how to generate white light from LEDs .
The preferred technique for commercially available devices is to coat a blue or ultraviolet LED with a phosphorescent material that will absorb the monochromatic emissions , and then re-emit the energy as a broad - spectrum white light .
Another , potentially more energy - efficient , way of generating white light is to mix the light of red , blue and green LEDs .
But both of these methods have issues with colour rendering .
And the latter method has the added problem that the lifespans of the three different LED types are not the same , so the light will change in colour as the lamp ages .
Gain in one dimension and you can lose in another — devices that have very good colour rendering tend to have poor energy efficiency .
One potential solution is now under development by Sandra Rosenthal , a chemist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville , Tennessee .
Her idea is to use an ultraviolet - emitting LED to energize the electrons in cadmium selenide nanocrystals , which respond by re-emitting a white light with very good colour rendering .
" This could be a viable alternative if we could substantially improve their efficiency , " says Rosenthal .
Organic compounds , which have already been looked at as a possible alternative to silicon in solar cells , are being investigated for use in LEDs .
OLEDs produce light in much the same way that ordinary LEDs do , except that the positive and negative charges originate in organic compounds rather than in crystalline semiconductors .
Typically , these organic compounds are attached to a fixed polymer sheet .
The advantage of organic materials is that , at least in theory , they can be produced comparatively cheaply with the same roll - to - roll technology used to handle other types of plastic films .
The main problem with OLEDs is that the organic materials are degradable by water and oxygen , which tends to give the devices a short lifespan .
This can be solved , to some extent , by encapsulating the organic compounds in an inert , transparent polymer such as epoxy resin .
But the compounds degrade intrinsically anyway , especially the blue OLEDs that are required for mixing with red and green to generate white light .
The outsiders
Farther out of the mainstream — in the sense that the technologies are being developed by smaller start - up companies — are induction lamps and cathodoluminescence .
Induction lamps , also known as electrodeless lamps , have been around since the 1890s , when Nikola Tesla invented a fluorescent light powered by currents oscillating in a coil of wires on the outside of the tube , rather than by electrodes on the inside .
But some people think that these lamps are finally ready for prime time .
The newest devices feature an electrodeless bulb that is filled with argon gas plus a small amount of metal halide salts .
A microwave generator , much like the ones in microwave ovens , produces a wave that is channelled through a waveguide and concentrated on to the container , where it ionizes the gas to form a plasma and vaporizes the salts .
The plasma and vapour together generate a broad - spectrum white light with an efficiency similar to that of LEDs .
The devices are also very bright , which means they are likely to find their initial applications where intense light is required , such as in car headlights or industrial illumination .
" It will take LEDs a long , long time to catch up with the intensity of illumination possible with induction lamps , " says Robin Devonshire , chief scientist of Ceravision , a company in Milton Keynes , UK , that is one of several developing this technology .
As these lamps do not place electrodes in contact with the harsh plasma environment , they can potentially last for decades .
“ It will take LEDs a long time to catch up with the light intensity of induction lamps . ” Robin Devonshire
Cathodoluminescence works like the cathode - ray tubes found in old - fashioned television sets .
It uses a source of electrons to bombard a phosphorescent material coated on the inside of a glass bulb , causing the material to emit light .
An electrical field , high temperature or photoelectric effect is used to make a metal surface emit the electrons .
Such a light source can be quite efficient , comparable to compact fluorescent sources .
It renders colours well , and the lamps can be shaped to look like incandescent bulbs .
Initial applications will be geared towards home usage .
However , both induction lamps and cathodoluminescence lamps have a perception problem .
" There is scepticism in industry with respect to these technologies that are not solid state , " says Bruce Pelton , director of engineering of the University of California , Davis , California Lighting Technology Center .
This is partly because solid - state devices such as LEDs — which generate light through processes in solid material , having no moving parts or bulbs that can break — are thought to have major advantages in the long run when it comes to ruggedness and long life .
But it is also because a previous incarnation of the induction lamp , based on sulphur , failed to gain a foothold in the market .
The sulphur lamp was efficient and bright , but was large and required air cooling to stop parts melting in the high temperatures reached by the sulphur plasma .
Blazing competition
The competition to replace incandescent light bulbs is likely to be fierce .
But consumer acceptance is far from guaranteed for any of the rival technologies .
One problem is the confusion generated by the sheer number of alternatives .
Another is that each of these devices has several parts , so that the lifespans and energy efficiencies reported for basic technology do not correspond to those of the whole device , which are , as yet , not that far ahead of incandescent bulbs .
In LED lamps , for example , the electronics or the phosphors are likely to degrade much earlier than the solid - state device itself .
US Department of Energy data published in 2008 found that commercially available LEDs were about half as efficient as compact fluorescent lights .
And , although development since then has been fast , the problems remain .
ADVERTISEMENT
Meanwhile , because widespread acceptance of these technologies is crucial to changing the habits of consumers — and ultimately , to saving substantial amounts of energy — governments are keen to avoid the errors made with previous technologies , such as the early fluorescent lamps , which many end - users hated .
If a technology is initially viewed negatively by the public , this can mar its subsequent evolution — a good reason not to mandate a technology before it is market - tested and ready .
Comments on websites mentioning the planned phase - outs of incandescent lights have highlighted that many people 's opinions of fluorescent lights have not changed much over time .
Cost , colour rendering , flicker and the presence of mercury are only a few of the issues mentioned .
Fluorescent lights are still a small percentage of the market compared with more energy - intensive lamps .
For all these reasons , the general - purpose incandescent light bulb might not be replaced by a single new source , but by a range of technologies , each suited to a particular use .
For example , if OLED lighting can economically be produced in continuous sheets by industrial roll - to - roll techniques , it will be a natural candidate for flat panels that generate a diffuse glow for area lighting .
That would make OLEDs a natural complement to the bright , directional light coming from semiconductor LEDs , which could instead be used for more light - intensive tasks such as reading .
Such combinations could lead to new concepts of lighting design , so that architects could help save energy by not wasting light where it is not needed .

Florida Governor Charlie Crist knows exactly why there have been no major hurricanes in his home state the past few years :
“ Do you know the last time it was we had a hurricane in Florida ?
It ’s been awhile .
In 2007 , I took my first trade mission .
Do you know where I went ? ” said Crist , a Methodist , referring to a trip to Israel .
He then told of going to the Western Wall and inserting a note with a prayer .
He said it read , “ Dear God , please protect our Florida from storms and other difficulties .
Charlie . ”
“ Time goes on — May , June , July , August , September , October , November , December — no hurricanes , ” Crist said .
“ Thank God . ”
Paul Fidalgo points out that this is n’t exactly true …
… in 2008 , Hurricane Gustav caused widespread damage throughout the gulf region of the South .
It did n’t hit Florida directly , but four people were killed on Florida beaches due to resulting rip currents .
So I suppose that means God was keen on the landmass of Florida , just not so much all the people living in it .
And it ’s not as though Florida has seen no storm activity since Saint Charlie took office .
In 2007 alone , Tropical or Subtropical Storms Andrea , Barry and Ingrid , plus another unnamed tropical depression , made landfall in Florida .
And in 2008 , Tropical Storm Fay hit Florida four times — a record — killing six Floridians .
So maybe Crist should double - check his facts .
And when the next hurricane hits Florida , we can also remind Crist that no god is paying attention to his personal messages .

Advertisement " Alien - like " scenes of tadpoles feasting on eggs emerging from their mother have been caught on camera .
The footage marks the success of a captive breeding programme for the critically endangered mountain chicken frog , one of the world 's largest frogs .
In April , 50 of the amphibian giants were airlifted from Montserrat after a deadly fungus swept through the island , devastating the population .
Now several breeding programmes are under way to save the frogs .
Once numbers have been boosted in captivity , researchers hope to reintroduce the frogs back into the wild within the next two years .
Bizarre sight
The remarkable footage was recorded at the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust , in Jersey , which took in 12 of the rescued frogs .
Twenty - six others went to Parken Zoo in Sweden , and 12 are now housed in ZSL London Zoo .
Giant of the forest

So far , four pairs of mountain chicken frogs have started to breed - which could result in hundreds of frogs .
And this has given researchers an insight into the way that these unusual amphibians care for their offspring .
" Mountain chickens have very peculiar breeding habits because they form foam nests in burrows in the ground , " said professor John Fa , director of Durrell .
The females lay their eggs in these nests , which eventually hatch into tadpoles .
But as the nests are underground , food is scarce - so the frogs need to find a way to provide nutrition for their young .
" In the case of mountain chickens , we have discovered that the female comes into the nest and starts laying a string of infertile eggs .
The tadpoles feast on the unfertilised eggs " We thought that the eggs would come out and drop to the bottom of the nest and then the tadpoles would start eating them .
But the footage shows about 40 tadpoles congregating around the female and eating the eggs as they come out of the female 's body .
" Every now and again , the female uses her back legs to push the tadpoles away from her body so another set can come up and eat as much as they can . "
" It is really weird - it is an alien scene .
This is the first time we have caught this on film , " professor Fa said .
Frog killer
The mountain chicken frog ( Leptodactylus fallax ) is one of the world 's most threatened frogs .
The frog is so called because its meat tastes like chicken .
It was once found on seven Caribbean Islands , but thanks to hunting and environmental pressures it is currently found only on Montserrat and Dominica .
Q&A : The frog - killer fungus Now , however , the deadly chytrid fungus , which has devastated amphibian populations around the globe , has also ravaged Dominica 's mountain chickens .
The fungus was first detected on the island in 2002 , and within 15 months , 80 % of the mountain chicken population had been obliterated .
Conservationists were extremely concerned when they found that the chytrid fungus had spread to Montserrat earlier this year , and was sweeping quickly through the last mountain chicken population .
The team made a decision to airlift some of the last healthy frogs and bring them into captivity in a bid to save the creatures from extinction .
" Things are not going terribly well in Montserrat because chytrid has now infected the safe population - or at least the one we thought was safe , " professor Fa said .
The breeding success has offered scientists a ray of hope in an otherwise bleak situation , and they are now concentrating on increasing the frogs ' numbers .
The team hopes to get the mountain chickens back into the wild
They hope to eventually release the captive mountain chickens back to their native home of Montserrat , and are currently looking for sites that are free of the deadly fungus .
" If that does n't work , if the area is infected , we will have to think again , and it could be that we take the animals to another island .
" Within a year or two we have to get these animals back to the wild .
The longer you keep them in captivity , the more difficult it is for them to enjoy a life in the wild again , " professor Fa said .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday he saw encouraging signs that Israel ’s resistance to his call to freeze settlement - building in the occupied West Bank was weakening .

Earlier Tuesday , an Israeli government minister said no tenders had been issued for new housing projects in settlements since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s right - leaning government took office five months ago .
Netanyahu has rejected Obama ’s push for a complete freeze and the impasse has created the most serious rift in U.S. - Israeli relations in a decade .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas says he will not resume peace talks with Israel until it stops adding to its settlements .
“ There has been movement in the right direction , ” Obama said when asked about the latest development after talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , 81 , at the White House .
While Netanyahu appeared to be trying to appease Washington , Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now said construction was continuing on 1,000 housing units .
“ My hope is that we are going to see not just movement from the Israelis , but also from the Palestinians around issues of incitement and security , from Arab states that show their willingness to engage with Israel , ” Obama said .
The two leaders , meeting for the third time in as many months , discussed how to jump - start the stalled peace process , a high foreign policy priority for Obama since taking office .
The emergence of a hardline Israeli government and divisions among the Palestinians have stymied his efforts .
TAKING RISKS
It was Mubarak ’s first U.S. visit since 2004 .
He had stayed away to show displeasure with former President George W. Bush ’s calls for democracy in the Arab world and his administration ’s criticism of human rights in Egypt .
Mubarak said differences with the former Bush administration had not hurt relations with Washington , which continues to send $ 1.5 billion in direct aid to its ally annually , making Cairo one of the top U.S. aid recipients .
The visit comes as the Obama administration has been pushing moderate Arab states to take conciliatory steps that could encourage Israel to freeze settlement building .
Mubarak , however , suggested gestures would only come after Israel resumed negotiations .

“ If negotiations start this will lead the Arab states to support the peace process and to move it forward , ” he said .
Arab states have put the onus on Israel to revive the peace process , while Israel has said the Palestinians and Arab states must first do more to advance the process .
“ Everybody is going to have to take some risks , ” Obama said .
Obama said he was encouraged by what he was seeing in the West Bank , where Palestinian security forces had “ greatly improved . ”
Abbas ’s Palestinian Authority controls the West Bank , while the Islamist group Hamas , sworn to Israel ’s destruction , rules the Gaza Strip .
Human rights groups had hoped Obama would press Mubarak for democratic reforms .
Mubarak said he had told Obama “ very frankly and very friendly ” he had campaigned for election on a platform of reform and had begun to implement change .
Human Rights
Watch has called Mubarak an authoritarian ruler “ presiding over a system in which opponents are muzzled and imprisoned , and where torture is widespread . ”
Sirius XM , the satellite radio service provider , is set to introduce a satellite radio dock called XM SkyDock for the iPhone and iPod Touch , says the XMFan.com website .
The company has scheduled a press event on Wednesday to talk about new products .
The SkyDock will turn the iPhone or the iPod Touch into a satellite Sirius XM radio receiver .
And it is expected to come with a wallet - friendly price tag of $ 100 .
Customers will still have to pay subscription fees for the service but this product makes satellite radio an exciting possibility for iPhone or iPod Touch users .
In June , Sirius XM released an iPhone app for their service .
But the application left out many of the most popular shows on the network such as Howard Stern , MLB games and NFL because of contract issues over the right to stream to phones .
We hope the SkyDock wo n't be crippled with similar problems .
Sirius also plans to introduce a new XM radio with color screen for $ 80 , says XMFan.com

Bill Maher has a piece at HuffPo arguing that Americans are a bunch of idiots who should just shut up and let people who know what they ’re talking about make decisions on tough issues like health care reform .
[ T] ake the health care debate we ’re presently having : members of Congress have recessed now so they can go home and “ listen to their constituents . ”
An urge they should resist because their constituents do n’t know anything .
At a recent town - hall meeting in South Carolina , a man stood up and told his Congressman to “ keep your government hands off my Medicare , ” which is kind of like driving cross country to protest highways .
I ’m the bad guy for saying it ’s a stupid country , yet polls show that a majority of Americans cannot name a single branch of government , or explain what the Bill of Rights is .
24 % could not name the country America fought in the Revolutionary War .
More than two - thirds of Americans do n’t know what ’s in Roe v. Wade .
Two - thirds do n’t know what the Food and Drug Administration does .
Some of this stuff you should be able to pick up simply by being alive .
You know , like the way the Slumdog kid knew about cricket .
Not here .
Nearly half of Americans do n’t know that states have two senators and more than half ca n’t name their congressman .
And among Republican governors , only 30 % got their wife ’s name right on the first try .
Sarah Palin says she would never apologize for America .
Even though a Gallup poll says 18 % of Americans think the sun revolves around the earth .
No , they ’re not stupid .
They ’re interplanetary mavericks .
A third of Republicans believe Obama is not a citizen , and a third of Democrats believe that George Bush had prior knowledge of the 9/11 attacks , which is an absurd sentence because it contains the words “ Bush ” and “ knowledge . ”
People bitch and moan about taxes and spending , but they have no idea what their government spends money on .
The average voter thinks foreign aid consumes 24 % of our federal budget .
It ’s actually less than 1 % .
And do n’t even ask about cabinet members : seven in ten think Napolitano is a kind of three - flavored ice cream .
And last election , a full one - third of voters forgot why they were in the booth , handed out their pants , and asked , “ Do you have these in a relaxed - fit ? ”
And I have n’t even brought up America ’s religious beliefs .
But here ’s one fun fact you can take away : did you know only about half of Americans are aware that Judaism is an older religion than Christianity ?
That ’s right , half of America looks at books called the Old Testament and the New Testament and cannot figure out which one came first .
And these are the idiots we want to weigh in on the minutia of health care policy ?
Please , this country is like a college chick after two Long Island Iced Teas : we can be talked into anything , like wars , and we can be talked out of anything , like health care .
We should forget town halls , and replace them with study halls .
There ’s a lot of populist anger directed towards Washington , but you know who concerned citizens should be most angry at ?
Their fellow citizens .
“ Inside the beltway ” thinking may be wrong , but at least it ’s thinking , which is more than you can say for what ’s going on outside the beltway .
And if you want to call me an elitist for this , I say thank you .
Yes , I want decisions made by an elite group of people who know what they ’re talking about .
That means Obama budget director Peter Orszag , not Sarah Palin .

Full crosstabs here .
This poll is updated every Friday morning , and you can see trendline graphs here .
This week 's edition of the Daily Kos Weekly National Tracking Poll tends to fly in the face of conventional wisdom , even as it mirrors other national pollsters .
We see Obama 's favorabilities drop into the 50s for the first time this year in our survey ( remember that there is a marked distinction between " job approval " and " favorability " ratings , with favorability ratings usually being several points higher ) .
This drop , as well as drops across the board for Democrats this week , have been witnessed in other surveys , as well .
The conventional wisdom , however , has been that the Democrats are suffering from some sort of political Icarus syndrome .
They are flying too high and too soon , and the public disapproval will send them crashing back to earth .
The problem with that rationale , at least in our numbers this week , is that it does n't match with the data .
Across the board , the drops among Obama and the Democratic Party have come not from the loyal opposition , nor have they come from dismayed Independents .
They have come from Democrats .
A cursory look at the graph for Obama 's favorability , broken down by party , shows that after a long period of relative stability among Democrats , there was a sharp drop this week :
Looking at the raw numbers , the drop in Democratic support is even more notable :
Net Favorability Ratings For President Obama , By Party ( Last Week in Parens )
DEMOCRATS : +72 ( +78 )
REPUBLICANS : - 86 (- 84 )
INDEPENDENTS : +35 ( +39 )
As you can see , the needle barely moved among Republicans ( with 6 % favorability , there was n't a whole lot of ground to concede ) .
Independents moved , but it was Democrats that saw the sharpest drop .
This effect was even more magnified when looking at the perception of the electorate towards Congressional Democrats :
Net Favorability Ratings For Congressional Democrats , By Party ( Last Week in Parens )
DEMOCRATS : +55 ( +65 )
REPUBLICANS : - 90 (- 90 )
INDEPENDENTS : - 20 (- 15 )
Anyone who thinks the protracted arguments over health care are n't frustrating the Democratic base need look no further .
A ten - point dip in net favorability , in a single week , is a pretty solid statement .
A quick look at the generic Congressional ballot confirms that the Democrats have shed a great deal of soft supporters over the last few weeks .
The margin between the Democrats and Republicans now rests at six points ( 35 - 29 ) , the closest we have seen on that question since the item was inserted into the poll a couple of months back .
Interestingly , the Republicans have gained virtually nothing over that time .
The steady stream of voters no longer willing to commit to the Democrats on the ballot test have almost uniformly gone into the ranks of the undecided .
This is the first evidence we have seen that the Democratic base is starting to get impatient .
The disgruntled Democratic base is also paying dividends the other way .
The GOP sees rebounding numbers across the board .
A quick look at the internals tells us that this is being driven , in no small part , by a boost from their own base .
Yet another piece of evidence to bolster the long - held maxim that who is on offense , and who is on defense , matters a great deal in American politics .
As great a competitor as Norifumi “ Kid ” Yamamoto is at mixed martial arts , the same success has not followed him into K - 1 . Kid Yamamoto recently suffered a devastating knockout loss to Jae Hee Cheon .
Sure , it ’s not an MMA highlight , but this is definitely “ Killer Finish ” material .

A Toronto man charged with mischief for allegedly faking his own gunpoint abduction has been released on $ 20,000 bail .
He is also now under house arrest , and was ordered to see a doctor about any mental health issues .
Furqan Muhammad - Haroon , 22 , was found in St. Catharines on Tuesday .
He went missing hours before he was supposed to board a flight to Dubai on Saturday .
Earlier Tuesday , investigators stopped calling the disappearance a kidnapping , saying they considered him to be " missing " instead .
Police had originally released a photo of Muhammad - Haroon , saying he was abducted at gunpoint but failed to find any evidence to support the theory for several days .
His father said his son had a large amount of cash on him when he went missing , hours before his flight .
The University of Toronto engineering student was charged with theft earlier this month .
He 's accused of stealing computer equipment from IBM , where he had been employed .
Muhammad - Haroon has been charged with public mischief and was scheduled to appear in court on Wednesday .
The man 's parents , brother and several family friends were waiting in the courthouse for his appearance which could happen at any point Wednesday and declined to make comments to reporters .
The family appeared grim - faced as they entered court , and the accused 's lawyer says Muhammad - Haroon 's parents did n't know about the alleged theft from IBM .
Muhammad - Haroon 's family had said they believed he was forced off the road and abducted at gunpoint on his way to Pearson International Airport .
If convicted of mischief , he could receive a maximum sentence of 5 years in jail .
Cassandra is a hybrid non-relational database in the same class as Google ’s BigTable .
It is more featureful than a key / value store like Riak , but supports fewer query types than a document store like MongoDB .
Cassandra was started by Facebook and later transferred to the open - source community .
It is an ideal runtime database for web - scale domains like social networks .
This post is both a tutorial and a “ getting started ” overview .
You will learn about Cassandra ’s features , data model , API , and operational requirements — everything you need to know to deploy a Cassandra - backed service .
April 28 , 2011 : post updated for Cassandra gem 0.10 and Cassandra version 0.7 .
features
There are a number of reasons to choose Cassandra for your website .
Compared to other databases , three big features stand out :
Flexible schema : with Cassandra , like a document store , you do n’t have to decide what fields you need in your records ahead of time .
You can add and remove arbitrary fields on the fly .
This is an incredible productivity boost , especially in large deployments .

This is an incredible productivity boost , especially in large deployments .
True scalability : Cassandra scales horizontally in the purest sense .
To add more capacity to a cluster , turn on another machine .
You do n’t have restart any processes , change your application queries , or manually relocate any data .

Multi - datacenter awareness : you can adjust your node layout to ensure that if one datacenter burns in a fire , an alternative datacenter will have at least one full copy of every record .
Some other features that help put Cassandra above the competition :
Range queries : unlike most key / value stores , you can query for ordered ranges of keys .

List datastructures : super columns add a 5th dimension to the hybrid model , turning columns into lists .
This is very handy for things like per-user indexes .

This is very handy for things like per-user indexes .
Distributed writes : you can read and write any data to anywhere in the cluster at any time .
There is never any single point of failure .
installation
You need a Unix system .
If you are using Mac OS 10.5 , all you need is Git. Otherwise , you need to install Java 1.6 , Git 1.6 , Ruby , and Rubygems in some reasonable way .
Start a terminal and run :
sudo gem install cassandra
If you are using Mac OS , you need to export the following environment variables :
export JAVA_HOME= " / System/Library /Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6/Home " export PATH= " / System / Library / Frameworks / JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6/Home/bin:$ PATH "
Now you can build and start a test server with cassandra_helper :
cassandra_helper cassandra
It runs !
In another terminal run :
cassandra_helper data:load
Now your schema is loaded too .
live demo
To insert some data and make some queries , open another terminal window and start irb , the Ruby shell :
irb
In the irb prompt , require the Ruby client library :
require ' rubygems ' require ' cassandra ' include SimpleUUID
Now instantiate a client object :
twitter = Cassandra.new ( ' Twitter ')
Let ’s insert a few things :
user = {' screen_name ' => ' buttonscat'} twitter.insert(: Users , ' 5 ' , user ) tweet1 = {'text ' =>
' Nom nom nom nom nom . ' , ' user_id ' => ' 5'} twitter .
insert ( : Statuses , ' 1 ' , tweet1 ) tweet2 = {'text ' => ' @evan Zzzz ....' , ' user_id ' => ' 5 ' , ' reply_to_id ' => ' 8'} twitter.insert ( : Statuses , ' 2 ' , tweet2 )
Notice that the two status records do not have all the same columns .
Let ’s go ahead and connect them to our user record :
twitter.insert(: UserRelationships , ' 5 ' , {'user_timeline ' => { UUID.new => ' 1'}} ) twitter.insert(: UserRelationships , ' 5 ' , {'user_timeline ' => { UUID.new => ' 2'}} )
The UUID .new call creates a collation key based on the current time ; our tweet ids are stored in the values .
Now we can query our user ’s tweets :
timeline = twitter.get ( : UserRelationships , ' 5 ' , ' user_timeline ' , : reversed => true ) timeline .map { |time , id| twitter .
get ( : Statuses , id , ' text ' ) } # => [ " @evan Zzzz .... " , " Nom nom nom nom nom . " ]
Two tweet bodies , returned in recency order — not bad at all .
In a similar fashion , each time a user tweets , we could loop through their followers and insert the status key into their follower ’s home_timeline relationship , for handling general status delivery .
the data model
Cassandra is best thought of as a 4 or 5 dimensional hash .
The usual way to refer to a piece of data is as follows : a keyspace , a column family , a key , an optional super column , and a column .
At the end of that chain lies a single , lonely value .
Let ’s break down what these layers mean .
Keyspace ( also confusingly called “ table ” ) : the outer - most level of organization .
This is usually the name of the application .
For example , ' Twitter ' and ' Wordpress ' are both good keyspaces .
Keyspaces must be defined at startup in the storage - conf.xml file .
( also confusingly called “ table ” ) : the outer - most level of organization .
This is usually the name of the application .
For example , and are both good keyspaces .
Keyspaces must be defined at startup in the file .
Column family : a slice of data corresponding to a particular key .
Each column family is stored in a separate file on disk , so it can be useful to put frequently accessed data in one column family , and rarely accessed data in another .
Some good column family names might be : Posts , : Users and : UserAudits .
Column families must be defined at startup .
: a slice of data corresponding to a particular key .
Each column family is stored in a separate file on disk , so it can be useful to put frequently accessed data in one column family , and rarely accessed data in another .
Some good column family names might be , and .
Column families must be defined at startup .
Key : the permanent name of the record .
You can query over ranges of keys in a column family , like : start => ' 10050 ' , : finish => ' 10070 ' — this is the only index Cassandra provides for free .
Keys are defined on the fly .
After the column family level , the organization can diverge — this is a feature unique to Cassandra .
You can choose either :
A column : this is a tuple with a name and a value .
Good columns might be ' screen_name ' => ' lisa4718 ' or ' Google ' => ' http://google.com'
.
It is common to not specify a particular column name when requesting a key ; the response will then be an ordered hash of all columns .
For example , querying for ( : Users , ' 174927 ' ) might return : {' name ' => ' Lisa Jones ' , ' gender ' => 'f ' , ' screen_name ' => ' lisa4718 '}
In this case , name , gender , and screen_name are all column names .
Columns are defined on the fly , and different records can have different sets of column names , even in the same keyspace and column family .
This lets you use the column name itself as either structure or data .
Columns can be stored in recency order , or alphabetical by name , and all columns keep a timestamp .
: this is a tuple with a name and a value .
Good columns might be or .
It is common to not specify a particular column name when requesting a key ; the response will then be an ordered hash of all columns .
For example , querying for might return : A super column : this is a named list .
It contains standard columns , stored in recency order .
Say Lisa Jones has bookmarks in several categories .
Querying (: UserBookmarks , ' 174927 ' ) might return : {' work ' => { ' Google ' => ' http://google.com', ' IBM ' => ' http://ibm.com'}, ' todo ' : {...} , ' cooking ' : {...}} Here , work , todo , and cooking are all super column names .
They are defined on the fly , and there can be any number of them per row .
: UserBookmarks is the name of the super column family .
Super columns are stored in alphabetical order , with their sub columns physically adjacent on the disk .
Super columns and standard columns cannot be mixed at the same ( 4th ) level of dimensionality .
You must define at startup which column families contain standard columns , and which contain super columns with standard columns inside them .
Super columns are a great way to store one - to - many indexes to other records : make the sub column names TimeUUIDs ( or whatever you ’d like to use to sort the index ) , and have the values be the foreign key .
We saw an example of this strategy in the demo , above .
If this is confusing , do n’t worry .
We ’ll now look at two example schemas in depth .
twitter schema
Here is the schema definition we used for the demo , above .
It is based on Eric Florenzano ’s Twissandra , but updated for 0.7 :
{ " Twitter " : { " Users " : { " comparator_type " : " org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.UTF8 Type " , " column_type " : " Standard "} , " Statuses " : { " comparator_type " : " org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.UTF8 Type " , " column_type " : " Standard "} , " StatusRelationships " : { " subcomparator_type " : " org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.TimeUUIDType " , " comparator_type " : " org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.UTF8 Type " , " column_type " : " Super "} , }}
You can load a schema with this command ( replace schema. json with your own filename ) :
bin/cassandra-cli -- host localhost -- batch < schema.json
The server must be running ; as of version 0.7 , Cassandra supports updating the schema at runtime .
What could be in StatusRelationships ?
Maybe a list of users who favorited the tweet ?
Having a super column family for both record types lets us index each direction of whatever many - to - many relationships we come up with .
Here ’s how the data is organized :
Cassandra lets you distribute the keys across the cluster either randomly , or in order , via the Partitioner option in the storage - conf.xml file .
For the Twitter application , if we were using the order - preserving partitioner , all recent statuses would be stored on the same node .
This would cause hotspots .
Instead , we should use the random partitioner .
Alternatively , we could preface the status keys with the user key , which has less temporal locality .
If we used user_id : status_id as the status key , we could do range queries on the user fragment to get tweets - by - user , avoiding the need for a user_timeline super column .
multi- blog schema
Here ’s a another schema , suggested to me by Jonathan Ellis , the primary Cassandra maintainer .
It ’s for a multi-tenancy blog platform :
{ " Multiblog " : { " Blogs " : { " comparator_type " : " org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.TimeUUIDType " , " column_type " : " Standard "} , " Comments " : { " comparator_type " : " org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.TimeUUIDType " , " column_type " : " Standard " } } , } Imagine we have a blog named ' The Cutest Kittens ' .
We will insert a row when the first post is made as follows : require ' rubygems ' require ' cassandra/0.7 ' include SimpleUUID multiblog = Cassandra.new ( ' Multiblog ' ) multiblog.insert(: Blogs , ' The Cutest Kittens ' , { UUID.new => ' { " title " : " Say Hello to Buttons Cat " , " body " : " Buttons is a cute cat . " } ' })
UUID.new generates a unique , sortable column name , and the JSON hash contains the post details .
Let ’s insert another :
multiblog.insert(: Blogs , ' The Cutest Kittens ' , { UUID.new => ' { " title " : " Introducing Commie Cat " , " body " : " Commie is also a cute cat " } ' })
Now we can find the latest post with the following query :
post = multiblog.get ( : Blogs , ' The Cutest Kittens ' , : reversed => true ).to_a.first
On our website , we can build links based on the readable representation of the UUID :
guid = post.first.to_guid # => " b06e80b0-8c61-11de-8287-c1fa647fd821 "
If the user clicks this string in a permalink , our app can find the post directly via :
multiblog.get ( : Blogs , ' The Cutest Kittens ' , : start => UUID.new ( guid ) , : count => 1 )
For comments , we ’ll use the post UUID as the outermost key :
multiblog.insert(: Comments , guid , { UUID.new =>
' I like this cat . - Evan'} ) multiblog.insert(: Comments , guid , { UUID.new => ' I am cuter .
- Buttons'} )
Now we can get all comments ( oldest first ) for a post by calling :
multiblog.get ( : Comments , guid )
We could paginate them by passing : start with a UUID .
See this presentation to learn more about token - based pagination .
We have sidestepped two problems with this data model : we do n’t have to maintain separate indexes for any lookups , and the posts and comments are stored in separate files , where they do n’t cause as much write contention .
Note that we did n’t need to use any super columns , either .
storage layout and api comparison
The storage strategy for Cassandra ’s standard model is the same as BigTable ’s .
Here ’s a comparison chart :
multi - file per-file intra-file Relational server database table * primary key column value BigTable cluster table column family key column name column value Cassandra , standard model cluster keyspace column family key column name column value
* With fixed column names .
Column families are stored in column - major order , which is why people call BigTable a column - oriented database .
This is not the same as a column - oriented OLAP database like Sybase IQ — it depends on whether your data model considers keys to span column families or not .
In row - orientation , the column names are the structure , and you think of the column families as containing keys .
This is the convention in relational databases .
In column - orientation , the column names are the data , and the column families are the structure .
You think of the key as containing the column family , which is the convention in BigTable .
( In Cassandra , super columns are also stored in column - major order — all the sub columns are together . )
In Cassandra ’s Ruby API , parameters are expressed in storage order , for clarity :
Relational SELECT `column` FROM `database`.`table` WHERE `id` = key ; BigTable table .
get ( key , " column_family : column " ) Cassandra : standard model keyspace.get ( " column_family " , key , " column " )
Note that Cassandra ’s internal Thrift interface mimics BigTable in some ways , but this is being changed .
going to production
Cassandra is an alpha product and could , theoretically , lose your data .
In particular , if you change the schema specified in the storage - conf.xml file , you must follow these instructions carefully , or corruption will occur ( this is going to be fixed ) .
Also , the on - disk storage format is subject to change , making upgrading a bit difficult .
The biggest deployment is at Facebook , where hundreds of terabytes of token indexes are kept in about a hundred Cassandra nodes .
However , their use case allows the data to be rebuilt if something goes wrong .
Proceed carefully , keep a backup in an unrelated storage engine … and submit patches if things go wrong .
( Some other production deployments are listed here . )
That aside , here is a guide for deploying a production cluster :
Hardware : get a handful of commodity Linux servers .
16 GB memory is good ; Cassandra likes a big filesystem buffer .
You do n’t need RAID .
If you put the commitlog file and the data files on separate physical disks , things will go faster .
Do n’t use EC2 or friends without being aware that the virtualized I/O can be slow , especially on the small instances .

Configuration : in the storage - conf.xml schema file , set the replication factor to 3 .
List the IP address of one of the nodes as the seed .
Set the listen address to the empty string , so the hosts will resolve their own IPs .
Now , adjust the contents of cassandra .in.sh for your various paths and JVM options — for a 16GB node , set the JVM heap to 4GB .

Deployment : build a package of Cassandra itself and your configuration files , and deliver it to all your servers ( I use Capistrano for this ) .
Start the servers by setting CASSANDRA_INCLUDE in the environment to point to your cassandra .in.sh file , and run bin / cassandra .
At this point , you should see join notices in the Cassandra logs : Cassandra starting up ...
Node 10.224.17.13:7001 has now joined .
Node 10.224.17.14:7001 has now joined .
Congratulations !
You have a cluster .

Cassandra also exposes various statistics over JMX .
Note that your client machines ( not servers ! ) must have accurate clocks for Cassandra to resolve write conflicts properly .
Use NTP .
conclusion
There is a misperception that if someone advocates a non-relational database , they either do n’t understand SQL optimization , or they are generally a hater .
This is not the case .
It is reasonable to seek a new tool for a new problem , and database problems have changed with the rise of web - scale distributed systems .
This does not mean that SQL as a general - purpose runtime and reporting tool is going away .
However , at web - scale , it is more flexible to separate the concerns .
Runtime object lookups can be handled by a low - latency , strict , self - managed system like Cassandra .
Asynchronous analytics and reporting can be handled by a high - latency , flexible , un - managed system like Hadoop .
And in neither case does SQL lend itself to sharding .
I think that Cassandra is the most promising current implementation of a distributed OLTP database , but much work remains to be done .
Cassandra has excellent performance .
There some benchmark results for version 0.5 at the end of the Yahoo performance study .

The Original CAMPAGNOLO Timeline
A history of Campagnolo from 1901 to 1987 .
1901
August 26th , Gentullio ( Tullio ) Campagnolo is born to Valentino Campagnolo and Elisa Paiusco in Vicenza .
1922
Tullio Campagnolo begins his amateur racing career ( with Veloce Club Vicenza on a Cicli Aliprandi ) that lasts until 1930 .
1927
November 11th , Tullio Campagnolo's frozen hands can't loosen the wingnuts of his wheel to flip it over to a different sprocket during the Gran Premio della Vittoria race across snowy Croce d'Aune Pass ( he finishes fourth ) .
" Bisogna cambià qualcossa de drio . " ...
" Something needs to be changed in the rear . "
He vows to invent a product that will eliminate this problem : the creation of galletti automatici ... automated wingnuts or , as we now know it , the quick release .
1930
February 8th , the quick release hub is patented , the first of more than 135 patents for Tullio Campagnolo .
1933
After fabricating parts in the backroom of his father 's hardware store ( Corsa Padova 101 , Vincenza ) , Tullio starts Campagnolo , S.r.l. with the production of the quick release hub .
The sliding hub , dual seatstay rod operated , back pedal derailleur ( cambio prototype ) is patented on May 4th and introduced in August .
The pieces of the prototype derailleur are all handmade requiring a massive investment of time and labor .
Fratelli Brivio of Brescia ( F.B. ) becomes the subcontractor for the parts and supplier of the three - piece ( steel barrel with aluminum flanges ) hubs .
Later , the official corporate name becomes Campagnolo Brevetti Internazionali SpA ( translation : Campagnolo International Patents Incorporated ) .
1934
Cambio a bacchetta ( translation : rod changer ) or Cambio " CAMPAGNOLO " is the name used for sliding hub , dual seatstay rod operated , back pedal derailleur .
The slogan becomes " Senza attriti e senza rumore " ( i.e. , Friction - free and noise - free ) .
The first advertisement for the Cambio " CAMPAGNOLO " appears in Gazzetta dello Sport .
1940
Tullio Campagnolo hires his first fulltime employee , Enrico Piccolo .
1941
A single page flyer is printed .
1942
The first official Campagnolo logo : the winged wheel highlighting the quick release , a component that remains today the universal standard .
1946
The Cambio Corsa ( translation : race changer ) is the new name for sliding hub , dual seatstay rod operated , back pedal derailleur ; later referred to in Italian as the due leve ( translation : two lever ) when the una leve ( translation : single lever ) race changer is introduced in 1949 .
Two versions of the Cambio Corsa derailleur are available : the short lever Corsa and the long lever Sport .
The quick release nut is the original rounded screw head version .
On January 12 , the Campagnolo winged wheel with quick release logo with the words " Cambio Campagnolo " is registered .
1947
The beginning of the export of parts .
Photo of company excursion ( company picnic ? ) pictures 37 employees .
1948
Campagnolo's first foreign plant ( assembling and finishing ) is built in Cognin , France ; the quick release lever is stamped " Brevet France . " .
F.B. and Campagnolo shared a small production facility in Cognin , France in 1948 to service the French market given restrictive import tariffs of the time .
The company logo , the winged wheel , is modified with the dropping of " cambio " ( translation : changer ) and redesigning the wing and quick - release .
Gino Bartali wins the 1948 Tour de France in July using a Cambio Corsa derailleur .
1949
The Tipo Paris - Roubaix sliding hub , single seatstay rod operated , back pedal derailleur is introduced ; originally referred to in Italian as the " una leva " ( translation : single lever ) until renamed in honor of Coppi's April 1950 Paris - Roubaix victory .
The quick release nut is now the oval - ring version .
The Gran Sport twin cable , parallelogram rear derailleur prototype is shown at the Milan Show in the Fall ; it is believed that ten prototypes were made .
1950
Campagnolo employs 123 workers .
The Gran Sport single cable , parallelogram rear derailleur prototype is shown at the Fall trade shows .
Fausto Coppi wins Paris - Roubaix in April using the Paris - Roubaix derailleur .
1951
The Gran Sport single cable , parallelogram rear derailleur ( chromed bronze , large chromed mounting bolt and pivot bolt and holes in pulleys , set screw - style cable clamp , and " B " adjusting screw for changing derailleur mounting angle that is eliminated by the next year ) paired with bar - end shift levers ( chromed bronze , then aluminum ) without rubber covers and Gran Sport sliding rod , cable operated front derailleur are introduced , along with conventional small flange three - piece hubs ( alloy flanges pressed onto a steel barrel and D - ring type quick release nuts ) .
A forged dropout with integral Gran Sport derailleur hanger is introduced that measures 6 mm thick with 4 mm adjusting screw and derailleur stop at 4 o'clock ; easily identified by bulge formed around adjusting screw .
Later the same year a new forged dropout is introduced that measures 7 mm thick with 4 mm adjusting screw and derailleur stop at 7 o'clock ( no Sport derailleur spring hole ) .
Hugo Koblet wins the 1951 Tour de France in July using Gran Sport derailleurs paired with Gran Sport bar - end shifters .
Fausto Coppi and Gino Bartali also racing with same set up ( only six Gran Sport derailleurs available for their TdF debut ) .

NOTES :
Typically the development of Campagnolo parts was carried out with the help of professional road and track riders on teams sponsored by Campagnolo .
Consequently , Campagnolo parts were in use one or more years before they were ever offered for sale to the public .
Campagnolo parts could appear in stores or on bikes before ever appearing in a catalog or , on the other hand , were not necessarily available at the time a catalog was issued .
The catalogs were typically printed for the trade shows which occurred late in the year ( the Milan bicycle trade show was held biannually , odd numbered years ) .
For these reasons , all dates in the Timeline are approximate .
Some Campagnolo parts can be dated by codes or patent dates .
For example , the Nuovo Record rear derailleur has a patent date that corresponds to its manufacturing date starting in 1970 ( example " PAT. 70 " ) ; marked " PATENT " without a date before 1970 .
The lock nut on the hub axle typically is stamped with " CAM . 60 " or some other number denoting the last two digits of the year of manufacture .
The word " RECORD " was added to the hub barrels around 1963 .
The original " Open C " style Campagnolo logotype ( imagine a U turned on its side ) on the Q.R. levers was changed to a " closed C " in 1958 with the introduction of the one - piece alloy Record hubs and a little later to the shift levers .
Starting in 1973 the crank arms have a code consisting of a diamond ( 1970 's ) or circle ( 1980's ) with a number in the center denoting the last digit of the year of manufacture , and then in 1985 - 9 with square and number in the center : 11 = 1985 , 21 = 1986 , 31 = 1987 , 41 = 1988 , 51 = 1989 plus some other examples .

( CNN ) -- Olympic champion Usain Bolt smashed his own record to end the reign of 100 - meter title - holder Tyson Gay at the world athletics championships in Berlin on Sunday night .
Usain Bolt celebrates after adding the world 100 m title to the gold he won in Beijing , both in record times .

The Jamaican clocked an incredible 9.58 seconds to surpass the 9.69 he set in winning gold at the Beijing Games last year , with Gay finishing second after setting an American record of 9.71 .
Former world record - holder Asafa Powell clinched a second medal for Jamaica as he finished third in 9.84 .
Is Usain Bolt the greatest athlete in history ?
The race had been billed as the highlight of the championships , with Gay returning to form this year after failing to make the Olympic final .
Watch CNN 's interview with Usain Bolt . »
The 22 - year - old Bolt , by contrast , had his season disrupted after needing minor surgery following a spectacular car crash in May -- but has shown no lingering effects , physical or mental , from that setback .
" I was feeling good after the semis .
I knew it was going to be a great race and I executed it , " Bolt told reporters .
CNN's Mark McKay predicts
Bolt 's greatness .
" It 's a great time , a great feeling .
I feel good in myself and I knew I could do it .
There was a big build - up , great atmosphere .
It was n't going to be an easy race but I had a perfect start and just went from there .
" I came out here to do my best , and I did what I had to do .
There 'll be no partying for me ahead of Tuesday .
I 'll rest up as always , I need to rest up for the 200m . "
Gay took some solace in that he managed to run the third fastest time in history .
" I ran the best I could .
I just wanted to give my best tonight , it was n't enough but I 'm happy to have the national record , " he said .
" I knew I had to put out a championship performance .
I gave it my best and that 's all I could do . "
Bolt 's training partner Daniel Bailey of Antigua was fourth in 9.93 , ahead of Trinidad 's Richard Thompson in a photo - finish , while Britain 's Dwain Chambers ran his season 's best of 10.00 to claim sixth on his top - level return following a two - year ban for using drugs .
Earlier on Sunday , Bolt had few worries in qualifying fastest for the final despite suffering a rare false start .
He clocked the fastest time of the two semifinals as he came home in 9.89 seconds , again being able to take his foot off the pedal long before the finish .
Gay won the second semifinal in 9.93 as he needed to dig deeper in edging out Powell at the finish .
Bolt was clearly up out of the blocks before the starting gun -- which under next year 's new rules would have disqualified him automatically .
British sprinter Tyrone Edgar was then unlucky to have been adjudged to start just 0.094 seconds too quickly and be disqualified , setting nerves jangling among the competitors .
But Bolt kept calm and surged ahead of the field , slowing down as far as 20 meters from the finish as he allowed training partner Daniel Bailey of Antigua to gain ground on him .
Bailey clocked 9.96 with American Darvis Patton third and Burns claiming fourth in 10.01 to also qualify for the final .
Powell timed 9.95 while Richard Thompson of Trinidad ( 9.98 ) and Britain 's Dwain Chambers ( 10.04 ) also qualified .
Meanwhile , American Sanya Richards again dominated Olympic and world champion Christine Ohuruogu as she qualified for Monday 's women 's 400 m final .
Richards , who also defeated the Briton in the opening round , won the third and slowest of the three semifinals in a time of 50.21 seconds , while Ohuruogu clocked a season 's best 50.35 as she made a traditional strong finish .
Jamaica 's Shericka Williams qualified fastest in winning the second semifinal in 49.51 ahead of Russia 's Antonina Krivoshapka ( 49.67 ) , with Debbie Dunn of the U.S. claiming one of the two other spots up for grabs in 49.95 .
Novlene Williams - Mills of Jamaica won the opening semi in 49.88 , edging out Botswana 's Amantle Montsho ( 49.89 ) , while Russia 's Anastasiya Kapachinskaya also went through in 50.30 .
Jessica Ennis claimed Britain 's first world heptathlon title as she capped a dominant weekend by winning the final heat of the 800m on Sunday night to finish 238 points ahead .
The 23 - year - old had led Kamila Chudzik by 171 points going into the seventh and final discipline after placing ninth in the javelin , with the Pole finishing second overall ahead of Germany 's Jennifer Oeser , who kept Olympic champion Natallia Dobrynska of Ukraine out of the medals .
Olympic champion Valerie Vili of New Zealand retained her women 's shot - put title , coming from fourth to beat Germany 's Nadine Kleinert .
Vili managed a best throw of 20.44 meters , while Kleinert posted 20.20 m to take silver ahead of China 's Lijao Gong ( 19.89 m ) .

A YEAR ago , the American economy was in recession .
Now it may be about to emerge from that downturn .
But if the economy is about to begin growing again , it will be from a very low level .
The recession has produced declines far greater than in previous downturns over the past half - century .
As a result , the economy may seem to be depressed even after growth resumes .
One area where that can be seen is shipments of durable goods produced by American companies .
The rate of such shipments fell by more than 20 percent during this recession , and would have declined further were it not for increased production of weapons .
In no previous downturn since 1958 , when the figures began being recorded , had the decline been as much as 14 percent .

Making Sense of Revision - control Systems
Whether distributed or centralized , all revision - control systems come with complicated sets of tradeoffs .
How do you find the best match between tool and team ?
Bryan O'Sullivan
Modern software is tremendously complicated , and the methods that teams use to manage its development reflect this complexity .
Though many organizations use revision - control software to track and manage the complexity of a project as it evolves , the topic of how to make an informed choice of revision - control tools has received scant attention .
Until fairly recently , the world of revision control was moribund , so there was simply not much to say on this subject .
The past half - decade , however , has seen an explosion of creativity in revision - control software , and now the leaders of a team are faced with a bewildering array of choices .
CVS ( Concurrent Versions System ) was the dominant open source revision - control system for more than a decade .
While it has a number of severe shortcomings , it is still in wide use as a legacy system .
Subversion , which was written to supplant CVS , became popular in the mid-2000s .
( A notable commercial competitor to Subversion is Perforce . )
Both Subversion and CVS follow the client - server model : a single central server hosts a project 's metadata , and developers " check out " a limited view of this data onto the machines where they work .
In the early 2000s , several projects began to move away from the centralized development model .
Of the initial crop of a half - dozen or so , the most popular today are Git and Mercurial .
The distinguishing feature of these distributed tools is that they operate in a peer - to - peer manner .
Every copy of a project contains all of the project 's history and metadata .
Developers can share changes in whatever arrangement suits their needs , instead of through a central server .
Whether centralized or distributed , a revision - control system allows members of a team to perform a handful of core tasks :
It allows a team to track the history of the files they work on during the development of a project .
People can see who made a change ; understand when and why it was made ; inspect the details of the change ; and re-create the state of the project at the time the change was made .
People can work on independent subprojects without being disturbed by other people 's changes and without affecting the work of their colleagues .
These self - contained lines of development are usually referred to as branches .
Branches are also used to manage the maintenance of releases that are no longer actively developed .
.
Branches are also used to manage the maintenance of releases that are no longer actively developed .
When the work on a subproject is complete , it can be integrated back into the larger project .
This is referred to as merging .
Each revision - control tool emphasizes a distinct approach to working and collaboration .
This in turn influences how a team works .
As a result , no revision - control tool will suit every team : each tool comes with a complicated set of trade - offs that can be hard even to see , much less to evaluate .
Branches and Merging : Balancing Safety and Risk
On a large project , managing concurrent development is a substantial sticking point .
Developers are sadly familiar with progress on their feature being stalled by a bug in an unrelated module , so they prefer to manage this risk by working in isolated branches .
When a branch is sequestered for too long , a different kind of risk arises : that of teams working in different branches making conflicting changes to the same code .
Merging changes from one branch into another can be frustrating and dangerous — one that can silently reintroduce fixed bugs or create entirely new problems .
These risks can arise in several ways :
Developers working in separate branches may modify the same sections of one or more files in different ways .
A revision - control system will identify these sections as conflicts that need to be resolved by hand .
Whoever resolves the conflict must choose one branch 's version , the other , or a hybrid .
Code in one branch may depend on functionality that has changed in the other branch .
In many cases , this dependency will be obvious : it will lead to a broken build .
Sometimes the effects can be much more insidious , causing an unanticipated kind of failure .
Some systems do not cope well if files have been renamed or copied in one branch but modified under their old names in another .
( These are more often bugs than fundamental deficiencies , but longstanding bugs are important in their own right . )
Since merges introduce risk beyond the sort that normal development incurs , how a revision - control system handles both branches and merges is of great importance .
Under Subversion , creating a new branch is a matter of making a copy of an existing branch , then checking out a local view of it .
Although branches are relatively cheap to create , Subversion allows several developers to work concurrently in a single branch .
Since working out of a single branch carries no immediately obvious costs , most teams maintain few branches .
This mode of work introduces a new risk .
Suppose Alice and Bob are concurrently working on the same files in a single branch .
Subversion treats the history of a branch as linear : revision 103 follows revision 102 and precedes revision 104 .
Alice and Bob have each checked out a copy of revision 105 of the branch from the server onto their own laptops .
These working copies contain their uncommitted work , isolated from each other until one commits his or her changes .
If Alice commits her work first , it will become revision 106 .
Subversion will not allow Bob to commit his work as revision 107 until he has merged his work with Alice 's revision 106 .
Since Bob cannot commit his work , what will happen if something goes wrong with his merge ?
He will have no permanent record of what he did and faces some scary possibilities : his work might be lost or quietly corrupted .
Because Subversion offers working out of a shared branch as the path of least resistance , developers tend to do so blindly without understanding the risk they face .
In fact , the risks are even subtler : suppose that Alice 's changes do not textually conflict with Bob 's ; she will not be forced to check out Bob 's changes before she commits , so she can commit her changes to the server unimpeded , resulting in a new tree state that no human has ever seen or tested .
Mercurial and Git are distributed , so they lack Subversion 's concept of a single central server where metadata is hosted .
A repository contains a stand - alone copy of a project 's complete history and a working directory that contains a snapshot of the project 's files .
If Alice and Bob are working together on a project , Alice might clone a copy of Bob 's repository , or she could clone a copy from some server .
When she commits a change , it stays local to her repository on her machine until she chooses to share it somehow .
She could do this by publishing it to a server or by letting Bob pull it directly from her .
Both Mercurial and Git decouple fetching remote changes from merging them with local changes .
If Bob fetches Alice 's revisions , he can still commit his changes without needing to merge with hers first .
When he merges afterward , he will still have a permanent record of his committed changes .
If the merge runs into trouble , he will be able to recover his earlier work .
Under the distributed view of revision control , every commit is potentially a branch of its own .
If Bob and Alice start from the exact same view of history , and each one makes a commit , they have already created a tiny anonymous fork in the history of the project .
Neither will know about this until one pulls the other 's changes in , at which point they will have to merge with them .
These tiny branches and merges are so frequent with Mercurial and Git that users of these tools look at branching and merging in a very different way from Subversion users .
The parallel and branchy nature of a project 's development is clearly visible in its history , making it obvious who made which changes when , and exactly which other changes theirs were based upon .
Both Mercurial and Git can associate names with longer - lived lines of development ( e.g. , " the code that will become version 2.0 " ) , so a development that is important enough to deserve a name can have one .
Degrees of Freedom
It is instructive to take a look at where Subversion and the distributed tools give users degrees of freedom .
Subversion imposes almost no structure on the hierarchy of files and directories that it manages .
It lacks the concept of a branch , beyond what it provides via the svn copy command .
Users find branches by convention in a portion of the hierarchy where people agree that branches ought to live .
By convention , a single " main line of development " is called / trunk , and branches live under / branches .
Since Subversion does n't enforce a policy for structuring branches , it has some interesting behaviors .
To perform an operation across an entire branch , you have to know where in the namespace the root of the branch is .
Most Subversion commands operate only on whatever portion of the namespace they are told to .
If Alice has checked out / branches / myfeature and runs svn commit in her working copy of / branches / myfeature / deep / sub / dir , she will commit changes only in and beneath the deep / sub / dir directory of the branch .
An absent - minded commit from the wrong directory can leave Alice thinking that everything is fine but leave her colleagues with an inconsistent , broken tree .
The svn update command operates in the same way : it is possible to have portions of a working copy synced up to different revisions of a branch 's history .
This can easily lead to a working copy looking inconsistent when in fact it is accidentally composed of fragments from different times in a branch 's history .
In contrast , the distributed tools treat the entire contents of a repository as the unit to work with .
If you run git commit - a in any directory inside a repository , then it will take a snapshot of all outstanding changes .
With Mercurial , hg update operates similarly , bringing the entire working directory up to date with respect to a specific point in history .
Neither tool makes it possible to check out an inconsistent view of a branch accidentally .
If you manually revert a file or directory to some specific revision , the user interfaces make this clear by displaying the affected files as modified .
Publishing Changes
Even though Subversion does not impose a structure on projects that use branches , it suggests a convention for naming branches .
Thus , Subversion users who collaborate through a central server are likely to have an easy time finding each other 's projects .
Both Mercurial and Git make it fairly easy to publish a read - only repository on a server , but the repository 's owner has to tell other people where the repository is : it could be anywhere on the Internet , not merely a well - known location on a single server host .
In addition , neither system makes read - write publishing especially easy .
This is by design .
Subversion 's single - server model demands that collaborators who want to share changes with other people must have write access to the shared repository , so that they may publish their changes .
With Git and Mercurial , it is certainly possible to follow this centralized model , but this is a matter of convention .
Users often host their repositories on their own servers or with a hosting provider .
Instead of publishing their changes to a shared server , their collaborators pull changes from them and publish their own modifications elsewhere .
The major difference between Subversion and the distributed tools is this : with Subversion , committing a change implicitly publishes it , whereas with the distributed tools , the two are decoupled .
Combining committing with publishing is convenient in settings where all participants have write access to the server and where everyone is always connected to the same network .
Separating the two adds an extra publication step but opens up the possibilities of working offline and using novel publication techniques .
For an example of novel publication , Mercurial supports ad hoc publication of repositories over a LAN using its built - in Web server , and it supports discovery of repositories using the Bonjour protocol .
This is a potent combination for rapid development settings such as a software project 's sprint : just open your laptop , share your repositories , and your Wi-Fi neighbors can find and pull your changes immediately , with no server infrastructure required .
Both the centralized and distributed approaches to publication offer trade - offs .
With a small , tightly knit team that is always wired , commit - as - publish can look like an easier choice .
In a more loosely organized setting — for example , where team members travel or spend a lot of time at customer sites — the decoupling of commit from publication may be a better fit .
Centralized tools can be a good fit for highly structured " rule the team with an iron fist " models of management .
Access can be controlled by managers , not peers .
Whole sections of the tree can be made writable or readable only by employees with specific levels of clearance .
Decentralized systems do n't currently offer much here other than the ability to split sensitive data into separate repositories , which is a touch awkward .
The Pull Model of Development
Many teams begin using a distributed revision - control system in almost exactly the same way as the centralized system they are replacing .
Everyone clones one of a few central repositories and pushes the changes back .
This familiar model works well for getting comfortable , but it barely scratches the surface of the possible styles of interaction .
Since the distributed model emphasizes pulling changes into a local repository , it naturally fits well with a development model that favors code review .
Suppose that Alice manages the repository that will become version 2.4 of her team 's software project .
Bob tells her that he has some changes ready to submit and gives her the URL from which she can pull his changes .
When she reads through his changes , she notices that his code does n't handle error conditions correctly , so she asks him to revise his work before she will accept , merge , and publish it .
Of course , a team may agree to use a " review before merge " policy with a centralized system , but the default behavior of the software is more permissive .
Therefore , a team has to take explicit steps to constrain itself .
Merges , Names , and Software Archaeology
Given their backgrounds , it is no surprise that Mercurial and Git have similar approaches to merging changes , whereas Subversion does things differently .
Since merges occur so frequently with Mercurial and Git , they have well - engineered capabilities in this realm .
The typical cases that trip up revision - control systems during merges are files and directories that have been renamed or deleted .
Both Mercurial and Git handle renames cleanly .
Subversion 's merge machinery is complicated and fragile .
For example , files that had been renamed used to disappear in merges .
This severe bug has been partly addressed so that files are now renamed , but they may contain the wrong contents .
It is not clear that this is really a step forward .
A subtler problem with file naming often hits cross-platform development teams .
Windows , OS X , and Unix systems have different conventions for handling the case of file names ( i.e. , different answers to the question of whether FOO .
TXT is the same name as foo. txt ) .
Mercurial outshines its competition here .
It can detect — and work safely with — a case - insensitive file system that is being used on an operating system that is by default sensitive to case .
Often , a developer 's first response to receiving a new bug report will be to look through a project 's history to see what has changed recently or to annotate the source files to see who modified them and when .
These operations are instantaneous with the distributed tools , because all the data is stored on a developer 's computer , but they can be slow when run against a distant or congested Subversion server .
Since humans are impatient creatures , extra wait time will reduce the frequency with which these useful commands are run .
This is another way in which responsiveness has a disproportionate effect on how people use their software .
A Powerful New Way to Find Bugs
Although a simple display of history is useful , it would be far more interesting to have a way of pinpointing the source of a bug automatically .
Git introduced a technique to do so via the bisect command ( which proved so useful , Mercurial acquired a bisect command of its own ) .
This technique is trivial to learn : you use the bisect command on a revision that you know did not have the bug , and the revision that you know does have the bug .
It then checks out a revision and asks you whether that revision contains the bug ; it repeats this until it identifies the revision where the bug first arose .
This is appealing to developers in part because it is easy to automate .
Write a tiny script that builds your software and tests for the presence of the bug ; fire off a bisect ; then come back later and find out which revision introduced the problem , with no further manual intervention required .
The other reason that bisect is appealing is that it operates in logarithmic time .
Tell it to search a range of 1,000 revisions , and it will ask only about 10 questions .
Widen the search to 10,000 revisions , and the number of questions increases to just 14 .
It would be difficult to overemphasize the importance of bisect .
Not only does it completely change the way that you find bugs , but if you routinely drive it using scripts , you 'll have effectively developed regression tests on the fly , for free .
Save those tests and use them !
The wily reader will observe that searching the commit history is much easier with Subversion than with the distributed tools , since its history is much more linear .
The counterpoint to this is that the bisect command is built into the other tools , and hence more readily available and amenable to reliable automation .
Daggy Fixes and Cherry - picking
Once you have found a bug in a piece of software , merely fixing it is rarely enough .
Suppose that your bug is several years old , and there are three versions of your software in the field that need to be patched .
Each version is likely to have a " sustaining " branch where bug fixes accumulate .
The problem is that although the idea of copying a fix from one branch to another is simple , the practice is not so straightforward .
Mercurial , Git , and Subversion all have the ability to cherry - pick a change from one branch and apply it to another branch .
The trouble with cherry - picking is that it is very brittle .
A change does n't just float freely in space : it has a context — dependencies on the code that surrounds it .
Some of these dependencies are semantic and will cause a change to be cherry - picked cleanly but to fail later .
Many dependencies are simply textual : someone went through and changed every instance of the word banana to orange in the destination branch , and a cherry - picked change that refers to bananas can no longer be applied cleanly .
The usual approach when cherry - picking fails because of a textual problem ( sadly , a common occurrence ) is to inspect the change by eye and reenter it by hand in a text editor .
Distributed revision - control systems have come up with some powerful techniques to handle this type of problem .
Perhaps the most powerful approach is that taken by Darcs , a distributed revision - control system that is truly revolutionary in how it looks at changes .
Instead of a simple chain or graph of changes , Darcs has a much more powerful theory of how changes depend on each other .
This allows it to be enormously more successful at cherry - picking changes than any other distributed revision - control system .
Why is n't everyone using Darcs , then ?
For years , it had severe performance problems that made it completely impractical .
These have been addressed , to the point where it is now merely quite slow .
Its more fundamental problem is that its theory is tricky to grasp , so two developers who are not immersed in Darcs lore can have trouble telling whether they have the same changes or not .
Let us return to the fold of Mercurial and Git .
Since these tools offer the ability to make a commit on top of any revision , thereby spawning a tiny anonymous branch , a viable alternative to cherry - picking is as follows : use bisect to identify the revision where a bug arose ; check out that revision ; fix the bug ; and commit the fix as a child of the revision that introduced the bug .
This new change can easily be merged into any branch that had the original bug , without any sketchy cherry - picking antics required .
It uses a revision - control tool 's normal merge and conflict - resolution machinery , so it is far more reliable than cherry - picking ( the implementation of which is almost always a series of grotesque hacks ) .
This technique of going back in history to fix a bug , then merging the fix into modern branches , was given the name " daggy fixes " by the authors of Monotone , an influential distributed revision - control system .
The fixes are called daggy because they take advantage of a project 's history being structured as a directed acyclic graph , or dag .
While this approach could be used with Subversion , its branches are heavyweight compared with the distributed tools , making the daggy - fix method less practical .
This underlines the idea that a tool 's strengths will inform the techniques that its users bring to bear .
Strengths of Centralized Tools
One area where the distributed tools have trouble matching their centralized competitors is with the management of binary files , large ones in particular .
Although many software disciplines have a policy of never putting binary files under the management of a revision - control system , doing so is important in some fields , such as game development and EDA ( electronic design automation ) .
For example , it is common for a single game project to version tens of gigabytes of textures , skeletons , animations , and sounds .
Binary files differ from text files in usually being difficult to compress and impossible to merge .
Each of these brings its own challenges .
If a moderately large binary file is stored under revision control and modified many times , the space needed to store each revision can quickly become greater than the space required for all text files combined .
In a centralized system , this overhead is paid only once , on the central server .
With a distributed system , each repository on every laptop will have a complete copy of that file 's history .
This can both ruin performance and impose an unacceptable storage cost .
When two people modify a binary file , for most file formats there is no way to tell what the differences are between their versions of the file , and it is even rarer for software to help with resolving conflicts between their respective modifications .
As a way of avoiding merging binary files , centralized systems offer the ability to lock files , so that only one person can edit a file in a given branch at any time .
Distributed systems cannot by their nature offer locking , so they must rely on social norms ( e.g. , a team policy of only one person ever modifying certain kinds of files ) .
Relative to its distributed counterparts , a centralized tool will make the history of a branch appear more linear .
Whether this is a strength or a weakness seems to be a matter of perspective .
A more linear history is easier to understand , and so requires less revision - control sophistication from developers .
On the other hand , a history containing numerous small branches and merges more accurately reflects the true history of a project and makes it clearer which project state a team member 's code was based on when working .
For teams that prefer to keep project history tidy , both Git and Mercurial offer rebase commands that can turn the chaotic history of a feature into a neater collection of logical changes , more suited to an eventual merger into a project 's main branch .
Centralized tools can offer policy advantages that are more difficult to achieve with distributed tools .
For example , it is possible to configure a pre-commit script that will reject an attempted commit if it introduces an automated test - suite failure .
With a distributed tool , this kind of check can be put in place on a shared central server , but that cannot protect developers from sharing inadvertently broken changes with each other horizontally , from one laptop to another .
What Behaviors Does a Distributed Tool Change ?
The availability of cheap local commits makes the use of a rapid - fire style of development attractive with distributed tools .
Suppose Alice is partway through a complicated change and decides that she wants to speculatively refactor a piece of code .
With a distributed tool , she can commit her change as is , without worrying too much about whether the project is in a sane state , and try her speculative change .
If that experiment fails , she can revert it and continue on her way , eventually using the rebase command to eliminate some of the in - progress commits she made while she figured out what she was doing .
While this style of development is certainly possible with Subversion , experience suggests that it is far more common with the distributed tools .
My conjecture is that the privacy of a branch on a developer 's laptop , coupled with the instantaneous responsiveness of the distributed tools , somehow combine to encourage more aggressive and pervasive use of revision control .
I have observed a similar effect with merges .
Because they are such bread - and - butter activities with distributed tools , in many projects they occur far more frequently than with their centralized counterparts .
Although all merges require effort and incur risk , when branches merge more frequently , the merges are smaller and less perilous .
Ask any seasoned developer about a long - delayed merge following a few months of isolated work , and watch the blood drain out of his or her face .
What the Future Offers
We are not by any means near the end of the road in the evolution of revision - control systems .
The field has received only fitful attention from academia .
Much work could be done on its formal foundations , which could lead to more powerful and safer ways for developers to work together .
Alas , I know of only one notable publication on the topic in the past decade .
1
As a simple example , when merging potentially conflicting changes , almost everybody uses either three - way merging , which is decades old , or unpublished ad hoc approaches in which there is little reason to be confident .
More practically , there are plenty of advances to be made in the way that distributed tools handle large projects with deep histories , for which they are a poor fit because of the volume of data involved .
For organizations that have sensitive needs around assurance and security , the centralized tools do somewhat better than the distributed ones , but both could improve substantially .
Conclusions
Choosing a revision - control system is a question with a surprisingly small number of absolute answers .
The fundamental issues to consider are what kind of data your team works with , and how you want your team members to interact .
If you have masses of frequently edited binary data , a distributed revision - control system may simply not suit your needs .
If agility , innovation , and remote work are important to you , the distributed systems are far more likely to suit your needs ; a centralized system may slow your team down in comparison .
There are also many second - order considerations .
For example , firewall management may be an issue : Mercurial and Subversion work well over HTTP and with SSL ( Secure Sockets Layer ) , but Git is unusably slow over HTTP .
For security , Subversion offers access controls down to the level of individual files , but Mercurial and Git do not .
For ease of learning and use , Mercurial and Subversion have simple command sets that resemble each other ( easing the transition from one to the other ) , whereas Git exposes a potentially overwhelming amount of complexity .
When it comes to integration with build tools , bug databases , and the like , all three are easily scriptable .
Many software development tools already support or have plug-ins for one or more of these tools .
Given the demands of portability , simplicity , and performance , I usually choose Mercurial for new projects , but a developer or team with different needs or preferences could legitimately choose any of them and be happy in the long term .
We are fortunate that it is easy to interoperate among these three systems , so experimentation with the unknown is simple and risk - free .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's resignation -- announced last Friday -- fueled speculation that she may be setting up a run for president in 2012 .
A new USA Today / Gallup poll conducted Monday night finds a core of 19 % of U.S. voters who say they are " very likely " to vote for her should she run , and an additional 24 % who are somewhat likely to do so , giving her a decent reservoir of potential support to build upon .
However , nearly as many voters ( 41 % ) currently say they would be not at all likely to vote for her .
By way of comparison , when Gallup in 2005 asked a similar question about Hillary Clinton running for president in 2008 , 52 % of registered voters said they were at least somewhat likely to vote for her , including 28 % who said they were very likely to do so .
Predictably , most Democratic registered voters ( 70 % ) say they are not at all likely to vote for Palin .
While most Republican registered voters ( 72 % ) say they are likely to vote for Palin , only about half of these ( 35 % of all Republican voters ) can be considered solid supporters who say they are very likely to support Palin at this time .
Even if Palin ultimately decides against a run for the White House , her high profile may allow her to take on a role as a major national political figure .
When asked about her possibly having such a role , 39 % of Americans say they would like to see her do this , including 67 % of Republicans , 34 % of independents , and 18 % of Democrats .
Palin 's announcement last Friday may have taken many political observers by surprise , but the data show her decision to resign the governorship did not affect most Americans ' opinions of her .
The poll finds 70 % saying their opinion of Palin has not changed as a result of her resignation .
Though this is clearly the minority of Americans , more say their opinion of her has gotten worse ( 17 % ) than improved ( 9 % ) .
Palin was a relatively unknown political figure when tapped to be John McCain 's running mate , but she quickly energized the GOP ticket , drawing large crowds to their rallies during the presidential campaign .
But news coverage of her quickly took a negative turn and many in the political world came to view her as a drag on the McCain campaign .
Palin herself has argued that she has been unjustly attacked by the news media , and most Americans seem to agree .
The new poll finds 53 % describing the news media 's coverage of Palin as " unfairly negative , " while just 9 % say it has been " unfairly positive " and 28 % say it has been " about right .
" When Gallup asked a similar question about news coverage of Palin shortly after the Republican National Convention last September , Americans were more evenly divided in their views , with 33 % saying the coverage was unfairly negative and the plurality of 36 % saying it was about right .
At that time , 21 % thought the media were being unfairly positive toward Palin .
Palin 's abrupt resignation with 18 months left in her first term as governor has probably raised more questions than answers about her political future .
But the move has apparently not affected Americans ' basic opinions of her to a large degree .
As political observers eagerly await her next career move , roughly 19 % of U.S. voters say they would be very likely to vote for her should she run for president in 2012 , and another 24 % say they would be somewhat likely to do so .
While still the minority of all voters , it is perhaps not a bad start for an election still three years away , and arguably could put Palin in a better starting position than some of the lesser - known GOP candidates who may also seek the party 's presidential nomination .

Train kills 2 pedestrians in Berkeley , Oakland EAST BAY
An Amtrak commuter train struck and killed two pedestrians in separate incidents in Berkeley and Oakland Friday afternoon , according to train officials and the Alameda County Coroner 's office .
The first incident occurred at 12:20 p.m. just north of the Berkeley Amtrak , said Amtrak spokesman Cliff Cole .
About two hours later , Cole said , the same train struck and killed another pedestrian just south of the Oakland station near the intersection of East 12th Street and 29th Avenue .
Officials with the Capitol Corridor train system , which travels between the South Bay and the Sacramento area , said it was the No. 535 train heading south from Sacramento to San Jose .
There were delays to the system shortly after the incident , said spokeswoman Luna Salaver .
According to the Alameda County Coroner 's Office , an unidentified woman who appeared to be in her late 60s was the victim of the Berkeley collision , and an unidentified male whose age is unknown was the victim of the Oakland collision .
Deputy Coroner T. Engel of Alameda County said Friday evening that both victims appear to have been killed instantly by blunt trauma , and that the incidents are " both possibly suicide . "
He said the identification process is continuing , and next of kin have not yet been identified .
Cole said that after an investigation into the first collision , the train was given a new crew .
The train continued south from the area about 1:50 p.m .
At about 2:15 p.m. , the second collision occurred , Cole said .
The train was taken out of service for the day and its 15 passengers were transferred to another train .
He said that in both incidents it appears that the victims were trespassing on the tracks .
Honeymoon bride spends too much time in airport toilet ... so new husband flies home without her
They were preparing to fly home after an idyllic honeymoon in Malaysia .
But after only a week of married life , one couple 's romance came to a dramatic end after the bridegroom decided his wife simply spent too long in the bathroom .
His solution was simple .
Get on the plane without her .
The woman in question , a teacher , had gone to use the facilities at the airport before boarding a flight back in Saudi Arabia .
Honeymoon :
The couple had spent a week in Malaysia after getting married ( file picture )
Quite how long she stayed in the toilet remains unclear .
What is certain is she emerged to discover her husband had vanished without trace .
The woman , who had paid for the holiday , began a desperate search of the airport and grew increasingly concerned that something terrible had happened to him .
It eventually emerged that he had in fact boarded a plane , according to the Saudi Gazette .
When he arrived at his destination , he calmly told relatives his new wife was still in Malaysia .
His bride was not so calm about his behaviour .
She has demanded an immediate divorce .

In the past , research into the negative health impact of spending too many hours each day glued to a TV set , video game console or computer screen has focused on “ tweens ” and adolescents , generally between the ages of 8 - 18 .
While this age group certainly earns their reputation as gamers — with 59 – 73 % manning the controller on an average day — new research published in the October issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine turns the microscope on a different class of video game enthusiasts , adults .
In a study of 562 people between the ages of 19–90 living in the Seattle - Tacoma area , 45.1 % said they played video games regularly .
The concentration of gamers did n’t surprise researchers too much , considering that the hub of Microsoft and Amazon is the country ’s 13th largest media market , and has its highest level of internet use .
Yet , what was illuminating for researchers led by James B. Weaver from the National Center for Health Marketing at the Centers for Disease Control , was the strong correlation between regular gaming and internet use , and increased risk for depression , higher body mass index ( BMI ) , and other negative physical and mental health issues .
Women who regularly played video games had both higher levels of depression and lower overall health status compared with women who did n’t play , and men who concentrated time on the console were more likely to have elevated BMI and report more time spent on the internet than men who were n’t gamers .
Overall there were more male than female video game devotees ( 55.9 % of those who reported playing regularly in this survey were men ) , but for both men and women , regular gaming was strongly correlated with a higher dependence on the internet for social interaction .
While this is among the first major studies to analyze the adverse effects of excessive gaming among adults , its findings are consistent with previous research in adolescents , which also found a significant correlation between hours spent logged on and elevated BMI , higher numbers of “ poor mental health days , ” and lower levels of sociability and assertiveness .
The factors driving those negative physical and mental health outcomes may have to do with the real world activities gamers forgo in order to spend more time in the virtual world .
“ Internet community support and time spent online also distinguished adult video - game players from non-players , a finding consistent with previous research pointing to the willingness of adult video - game enthusiasts to sacrifice real - world social activities to play video games , ” the researchers write .
In an accompanying editorial , Dr. Brian A. Primack , a professor of medicine and pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , applauds the efforts to shine light on the apparently growing phenomenon of adult gamers , highlighting the statistic that the average age of video game enthusiasts is actually 35 .
He also laments the growing prevalence of “ playlike activities ” — that is , things that stimulate similar parts of the brain as old fashioned running around does , but with out all of the sweating and , you know , being outside .
Yet he does n’t pan gaming altogether , suggesting it may be beneficial in helping develop hand - eye coordination , and that games like Wii Fit , which simulate sports and actually get you moving may be better than just sitting around .
But Primack does raise offer a word of caution :
With video games now being developed for everything from pure entertainment to surgical training and street safety , he says , it may not be too long before the virtual world starts to eclipse the real one .

There have been problems on the moors in advance of the Glorious Twelfth , today 's opening of the grouse - shooting season .
Successive damp summers have accelerated the spread of the heather beetle , which destroys the birds ' habitat .
There have been worries that the rare and beautiful bird of prey , the hen harrier , has been unsportingly killing grouse in spite of ( illegal ) persecution by gamekeepers .
Police have warned that gangs have targeted licensed shotguns for theft .
Nevertheless , grouse numbers have increased on the moors and so , more importantly , has the amount of people who wish to spend a lot of money for the privilege of shooting them .
The Glorious Twelfth , one of Britain 's great institutions of privilege , has – surprise , surprise – turned out to be recession - proof .
In fact , it looks like being a bumper year for all kinds of class division .
As hard times have hit the economy , there may have been anguished mutterings from ministers about the need to put an end to unfair advantages in society .
But then there is nothing new in that – the war on privilege has been a governmental mantra for the past 13 years .
The more the British are reminded what a terrible thing snobbery is , the more they cling to it .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
If anything , class prejudice has increased since that bright new false dawn in 1997 .
The trend can be seen at a trivial level – it has just been revealed that the debutante season , culminating in Queen Charlotte 's Ball – is to return .
The rationale for reviving this absurd social crash course in privilege and division offered to the rich and dim is that ever - useful party - goers ' excuse , charity .
In the media , class is everywhere .
Those who thought John Prescott 's investigation into the subject last year was stretching an obvious idea too thinly are in for a shock – Mr and Mrs Prescott are back for another series .
More embarrassingly , Channel Four is playing the class game by broadcasting a grim form of OK !
magazine - style documentaries .
The formula is simple : find a story involving the upper - middle classes and a bit of naughtiness ( Boothby , Princess Margaret , Aspinall , and , this week , the run-up to the Queen 's coronation ) , talk to a few washed - up toffs , then film imagined scenes played by actors .
Snobbery has been behind much of the best British comedy , from Dad's Army and Fawlty Towers to I'm Alan Partridge and Little Britain , but now it reaches every part of the media .
It seethes near the surface of reality shows ( why else but snobbery would the goofy former junkie , the Marquess of Blandford , be invited on to a programme about homelessness ? )
It is to be found on BBC radio , where a new form of received English holds sway : Scottish , Welsh , Irish , West Indian and home counties accents are fine , but you 'll wait a long time to hear the news read by a Liverpudlian , a Geordie or someone from the West Country .
For all the talk of classlessness , there are forms of snobbery in politics , too .
It is there in the friends with whom Labour ministers take their holidays .
It is evident in the general fascination with the ennoblement of Lord Sugar – indeed , it is part of the whole farrago of privilege and self - importance which surrounds the House of Lords .
Next year , there will almost certainly be toffs in government , although they will studiously be cranking down their accents , awkwardly dropping consonants like trustafarians slumming it in Notting Hill .
The truth is that snobbery in its various forms remains a great national weakness .
Somehow we feel more at ease when some sort of hierarchy of privilege , however absurd and unfair , is in place .
A plague of unnecessary pessimism
Because our default setting is towards pessimism and paranoia , the stories of the summer have been of bad weather and of nature behaving badly .
Over recent days , for example , grim reports of " plagues " of ladybirds have been appearing in the press .
But wait .
Surely it was only last year that we were reading another depressing , but very different , story .
The sweet and good little seven - spot British ladybird was declining in numbers and its survival was being seriously threatened by an invasion of its larger , more brutal American cousin , the Harlequin .
Now , without warning , it is a plague .
The truth is that the summer of 2009 has been an astonishing one for insects .
Butterflies , in particular , have done well .
In my part of East Anglia , there are more Meadow Browns , Small Heaths , Commas , Peacocks , Skippers ( pictured ) , Speckled Woods and , the year 's big migrant , Painted Ladies , than there have been for a long time .
If this has been the year when more families than usual holiday in Britain , then the glorious bonanza of butterflies and indeed of the wholly beneficent ladybird has been well timed .
Not that our perennially gloomy media will be mentioning that .
Aussie cricketer scores an own goal ...
The Australian cricketer Justin Langer has been helping his team - mates as they compete for the Ashes with a crib - sheet into the strengths and weaknesses of English sportsmen .
Excellent front - runners , they tend to " taper off very quickly " when they start losing .
" They love being comfortable , " Langer wrote .
" Take them out of their comfort zone and they do n't like it for one second . "
A perfect example of this kind of collapse occurred on the first day of the English football league .
Norwich , playing in England 's third tier for the first time in 50 years and one of the favourites to be promoted , were doing well in front of a large home crowd until the other side scored two quick goals .
Out of their comfort zone , the home team fell apart and ended up being thrashed 7 - 1 .
Unfortunately for Langer 's analysis , it was the Norwich goalkeeper Michael Theoklitos who tapered off rather more quickly and disastrously than anyone else on the pitch .
Theoklitos has previously played for his country – Australia .

Advertisement Police have been criticised for refusing to let a woman who told them she was bleeding leave a cordon for five hours during the G20 protests .
Her GP later told her the bleeding she suffered could have been a miscarriage - though this was never confirmed .
The Independent Police Complaints ( IPCC ) Commission said the likelihood she miscarried was " low " but called for changes to the policing of protests .
Scotland Yard said there was an " opportunity for lessons to be learnt " .
' Inhuman '
The unnamed 23 - year - old graduate recalled events at the protests in April in the City of London .
She told the BBC Two Newsnight programme : " There were hundreds of people behind me and I had nowhere to go so I was being crushed .
I could n't breath , my weight was not on my feet , I was lifted by the full force .
It was a horrendous situation for a human being to be in .
I felt completely dehumanised
The female G20 protester " I was being struck very violently with shields and pushed very violently into nowhere ...
I was being shouted at and screamed at continuously to get back ...
" I remember having a moment thinking 'oh god this is how people die in crowds , getting crushed ' " .
She also said she was hit on the head , repeatedly kicked in the shins and struck with truncheons which left her arms bruised .
She continued : " I told them I was bleeding - they looked quite shocked in the sense that men are n't very comfortable talking about that ...
" They said ' ca n't you ask someone in there to help ? '
It made me feel inhuman . " ' Disproportionate '
She added she was not offered any medical help and did not request any , but told officers she needed to leave .
" It was a horrendous situation for a human being to be in .
I felt completely dehumanised .
I was very cold and there was no water , " she said .
One man died after the London protests and investigators are looking at other formal complaints about police actions .
Chief Inspector of Constabulary Denis O'Connor has branded the actions of some G20 officers as " unacceptable " .
A senior Scotland Yard officer has offered to meet the woman
The woman made a complaint to the IPCC about her treatment by officers at the Climate Camp in Bishopsgate on the day of the demonstration .
She said police kicked and pushed her with shields and batons and that she may have had a miscarriage , a report has said .
As a result , she said , she was left with bruising on her arms and legs as well as heavy intimate bleeding .
The woman had not been aware that she was pregnant and medical staff had been unable to confirm that this had been the case .
The IPCC concluded the woman was forcibly pushed by an officer and she was not allowed to leave the area of Bishopsgate for four to five hours to make herself more comfortable with regard to her bleeding .
It found officers used shields to move the crowd backwards , a tactic which has not been approved nationally by senior officers .
' Real opportunity ' Deborah Glass of the IPCC said , while her alleged injuries were more serious than most suffered that day , her experience " appears to have been typical of many peaceful protestors on 1 April " .
She added : " She was caught up in what appears to have been a frightening experience over which she had little or no control .
" Like many others that day , she had no prior warning of the police intention to use force in containing the crowd , and no prior warning of a containment tactic that prevented her leaving when she began to bleed . "
It has sent a report to the Inspectorate of Constabulary and Scotland Yard and called for an " immediate change " to the policing of protests .
A spokesman for Scotland Yard said a senior officer had offered to meet the woman to discuss the case .
The spokesman added : " It is only right and proper that public complaints are investigated thoroughly , and where appropriate , independently .
" Though we note that the medical opinion was that there was a low probability of the complainant being pregnant , there is a real opportunity for lessons to be learnt here .
" We are committed to ongoing organisational learning and we are currently examining the HMIC recommendations - reiterated as recommendations in this report - following the Commissioner 's request for a review of public order tactics . "

This past Saturday , an entire apartment building in Shanghai collapsed .
To be fair , the building was under construction and thus unoccupied , but it 's still a minor miracle that there was only one fatality .

Sounds like there was a problem with some nearby flood prevention walls at the Dianpu River , but there 's no hard evidence as to why this huge building simply fell over .
Anyway , here are some sweet pictures of the architectural carnage .

Advertisement A human bone found in Devon with tool cuts thought to have been made during a ritual ceremony 9,000 years ago may be evidence of cannibalism .
Torquay Museum staff identified the arm bone as they documented animal remains discovered in Kents Cavern in Torquay .
The bone 's marks are thought to have been made by stone tools and could indicate a ritual - or that the victim was devoured by other people .
The caves are the oldest Scheduled Ancient Monument in Britain .
The bone was first unearthed in 1866 by archaeologist William Pengelly , who spent 15 years excavating the cavern .
It was put into storage in the museum and " rediscovered " in December 2008 .
The marks are believed to be from a stone tool
Enlarge Image
It was found as part of a cataloguing programme , which has been examining about 15,000 animal bones excavated from the cavern that had been housed in the museum 's store .
The museum 's researchers found the butchered bone in June , and , working with the University of Oxford 's School of Archaeology and Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit , identified it as a fragment of human arm bone .
It was then radiocarbon dated to 8,185 years BP [ Before Present , an archaeological term meaning before 1950 ] .
Tom Higham , from the radiocarbon unit , said : " The bone was particularly well preserved and the result is seen as very reliable . "
Dr Rick Schulting , of the University of Oxford 's School of Archaeology , said : " Finds like this highlight the complexity of mortuary practices in the Mesolithic ( Middle Stone Age ) , many thousands of years before the appearance of farming , which is more usually associated with complex funerary behaviour . "
The museum said only one other site in Britain had yielded similar human remains with cut marks of this age - Gough 's Cave at Cheddar Gorge .
" Some archaeologists have interpreted these marks as evidence of cannibalism , but ritual burial practice or dismemberment for transportation has not been ruled out , " a museum spokesman said .
Archaeological digs there have unearthed a 37,000 - year - old human jawbone and stone tools that were more than 40,000 years old .

LearningjQuery.com has a pretty cool presentation of the dates of their blog posts .
Check it :
The typeface and the year being vertical should tip you off right away that images are being used to accomplish this .
But also note that the date information is presented as text , as it should be , in the markup :
A quick peak in Firebug reveals the beautiful simplicity !
Sprites at Their Best
Hopefully it ’s fairly obvious that each date does n’t have it ’s own unique graphic .
The dates are pieced together from a single graphic ( css sprites ! ) , where different smaller parts of the graphic are shown in the three different regions : day , month , and year .
Perhaps you ’ll recognize this from a similar technique Joost de Valk posted about nearly a year ago .
Take a look at this beauty :
The HTML :
The end result HTML is going to be like this :
< div class= " postdate " > < div class= " month m-06 " > Jun</div > < div class = " day d-30 " >30</div > < div class= " year y- 2009 " >2009</div > </div >
We have a wrapper , and three regions .
This gives us what we need to match these schematics :
In a CMS like WordPress , the backend code to produce that would be like this :
< div class= " postdate " > < div class = " month m-<? php the_time ( 'm ' ) ?>" ><? php the_time ( ' M ' ) ?></div> < div class = " day d-<? php the_time ( 'd ' ) ?>" ><? php the_time ( 'd ' ) ?></div> < div class = " year y-<? php the_time ('Y ' ) ?>" ><? php the_time ('Y ' ) ?></div> </div>
The CSS
The CSS is where the sprite action really happens .
With those special class names that we have set up in the HTML , we can set which portions of the image to use .
First , we set relative positioning on the parent .
Then we absolutely position each of the three regions within .
We set all three of them to use the same background image ( our sprite ) , set their respective widths and heights , and kick the text off the page .
Then , we set each of the months ( 12 possibilities ) , days ( 31 possibilities ) , and years ( goes 10 years out ) with the specific background positioning needed to show the specific region we need .
. postdate { position : relative ; width : 50 px ; height : 50 px ; float : left ; } .month , .day , . year { position : absolute ; text - indent : - 1000 em ; background - image : url(/wp-content/themes/ljq/images/dates.png ) ; background - repeat : no - repeat ; } . month { top : 2 px ; left : 0 ; width : 32 px ; height : 24 px ; } .day { top : 25 px ; left : 0 ; width : 32 px ; height : 25 px ; } . year { bottom : 0 ; right : 0 ; width : 17 px ; height : 48 px ; } .m-01 { background - position : 0 4 px ; } .m- 02 { background - position : 0 - 28 px ; } .m-03 { background - position : 0 - 57 px ; } ... more like this ... .d-01 { background - position : - 50 px 0 ; } .d-02 { background - position : - 50 px - 31 p x ; } .d-03 { background - position : - 50 px - 62 p x ; } ... more like this ... .y - 2006 { background - position : - 150 px 0 ; } .y - 2007 { background - position : - 150 px - 50 p x ; } .y - 2008 { background - position : - 150 px - 100 p x ; } ... more like this ...

Huckabee : Evangelicals more supportive of Israel than Jews
Mike Huckabee , a longtime Christian Zionist wrapping up a trip to Israel , tells CBN that he was struck by firmer support for Israel — as he sees it — from American Christians than from American Jews .
" One of the things I find most interesting is that generally Evangelicals are so much more supportive of Israel than the American Jewish community , " Huckabee , an ordained Baptist minister , said .
His words help explain the large role debates over Israel and Jewish politics played in the general election campaign , as Israel is a focus for a large piece of the electorate and , at times , a proxy for broader security questions .
" There 's great division within the American Jewish Community about the level of support for Israel , " he went on .
" I think they all support Israel , want to see it succeed .
But you 'll find people all over the board about whether they think ii ought to have ... absolute control over its border and whether they should give up land for peace and just how many countries can oversee Jerusalem at one time . "
" I do n't find that kind of dichotomy generally within the Evangelical community , " Huckabee said .
" It 's pretty adamant :
There ought to be one city .
It ought to be a Jewish state .
And it ought to be secure .
So maybe one of the hard things is to convince some of our Jewish friends that Evangelicals are the best friends they 've got — because I think generally , that 's the case . "
LONDON : As Italy authorised the use of the abortion pill Mifepristone , the Vatican threatened to excommunicate doctors who prescribe it and women who take the pill .
After a heated four - hour session , Italy���s drug regulation agency announced its decision on Saturday following opposition from the church and Catholic politicians , including many from PM Silvio Berlusconi���s centre - Right government .
The Vatican , which has battled in the United Nations and other forums to halt acceptance of the abortion pill , reacted with dismay to the decision to approve limited use of the Mifepristone that has been available in much of the rest of Europe since the 1990s .
Archbishop Rino Fisichella , head of the Pope 's thinktank on bioethical issues , the Pontifical Academy for Life , said : �� �The fact of taking a pill may be less traumatic for a woman , but it does not change the substance .
It is still abortion .���
He underlined that the consequences for a Catholic - automatic excommunication - were " the same as those for surgical abortion " , the Guardian newspaper reported on Satuday .
Elio Sgreccia , another top official from the Academy for Life , said that women taking the pill or doctors administering it incur automatic excommunication under church law , according to media reports .
Yesterday 's high of 106 degrees is about as close as you can get to Portland 's all - time record high of 107 degrees , and seriously , could anyone out in that kind of heat tell the difference ?
Today 's forecast high -- depending on what weather forecaster or agency you talk to -- is somewhere between 105 and 109 degrees .
If you were taking bets , one way to tell where today 's high in Portland will top out is to look at where the temperature was yesterday at a particular time .
At 11 a.m. yesterday , the temperature at the airport was 88 degrees .
At 11 a.m. today , it was 90 degrees .
By 2 p.m. , the temperature had soared to 104 degrees , and was closing fast on the record and threatening to create a new all - time high .
Smart money would bet on a high today of 108 degrees , breaking a record that seemed unbreakable , but now seems reasonable .
The last time it was that hot was the week of Aug. 7 - 10 , 1981 ; on Aug. 8 and 10 it hit 107 degrees .
Before that , the temperature reached 107 degrees July 30 , 1965 .
" I think we 're on the fence when it comes to breaking that record , and tying the record of five consecutive 100 - degree days , " said Dan Keirns , a forecaster for the National Weather Service in Portland .
Keirns said what may put us over the top is an east wind that began blowing near Troutdale this morning , something that had been lacking for the past two days and often makes temperatures rise in the Portland area .
It 's also what may the first salvo in the gradual breakdown of the heat wave , namely , an upper level low - pressure system that is meandering off the coast and slowly moving our way .
If it arrives on time ( or when the forecast models say it will ) , the heat wave will gradually begin losing its grip tomorrow , when the high is expected to be at 100 or just below .
" Either way , it 's still hot when it 's 97 , and for the people without air conditioning , it 's going to be pretty annoying , '' Keirns said .
The heat low that had been in the Coast Range has moved into the central Willamette Valley , Keirns said , and that 's another reason today could be a degree or two hotter than yesterday .
" You had to get almost in the surf yesterday to find relief at the central and north coast , '' Keirns said .
" Some of that heat was from all the exhaust from people driving around trying to find a parking space . "
Forecasters at Accuweather said the jet stream is unusually far north over western North America , which has allowed this intense heat wave to develop .
Even parts of the Arctic Circle , including the Yukon and Canada 's Northwest Territories , are n't escaping the heat , with highs 30 degrees above normal .
Not until it moves off to the east will temperatures begin to moderate , as marine air from the Pacific begins to migrate up the Columbia River and the gaps in the Coast Range .
" If I had wanted weather like this I would have moved to Las Vegas , " Keirns said .
At least in Vegas you might have a decent chance of buying an air conditioning unit .
In Portland , forget about it .
" We are 100 percent out and so are all our competitors , '' a sales associate at the Delta Park Lowe 's home improvement center .
Lowe 's has sold more than 200 fans in the past few days , and its supply as of Wednesday afternoon was down to one 7 - inch fan .
" That would barely blow the papers around on your desk , '' another sales associate said .
" We get new deliveries every day , but we do n't know what 's going to be on them . "
Craigslist , however , had numerous postings for air conditioners on sale , anywhere from $ 75 to $ 675 , some with delivery options .
The forecast high in Las Vegas today is 108 degrees .
Yesterday 's high was 112 .
Other records that could fall today :
If it stays at 90 or above through Saturday , that breaks the all - time record of consecutive days at or above 90 degrees , which was 8 days ending on Aug. 19 , 1967 .
If it stays at 95 or above through Saturday , that would break the old record of six days , which ended Aug. 11 , 1981 .

Sudoku Solver
This little robot solves a sudoku puzzle all by itself .
It scans the sudoku puzzle using a light sensor .
It calculates the solution to the puzzle and then writes the digits .
Scanning
It first performs a quick scan to determine which cells are empty .
It sweeps the light sensor over the sudoku puzzle while continuously reading the sensor values .
Each non-empty cell is then handled .
An image of the digit is created by scanning the cell line by line moving the robot forward a tiny bit for every line .
Thresholding
The scanned image is very noisy and blurred .
To make it more sharp the image is transformed to a binary image ( black and white ) .
Each pixel with a value below a threshold value is set to black .
And the rest of the pixels are set to white .
The values from the light sensor are very close to each other and the overall values are affected by surrounding light , distance between surface and sensor and so on .
The threshold value is calculated by applying an automatic threshold algorithm ( The Otsu Method ) .
Segmentation
The binary image may have more than one segment .
It may have pixels not belonging to the digit .
The center segment is found and other segments are deleted .
Thinning
The image is converted to 1 - pixel wide lines with a thinning algorithm .
Feature extraction
Now the digits are classified by extracting some features from them :
Width of the digit
Number of tips
Position and direction of tips
For example a digit with only one tip which is pointing to the right is classified as 6 .
Raw image Thresholding Segmentation Thinning
Solving the Sudoku
Solving a sudoku puzzle is a quite simple task for a computer .
It is usually implemented using a recursive backtracking algorithm .
But since the Mindstorms processor is rather slow , and since it does n't allow for recursive functions , it took some care to optimize it .
When John G. Roberts Jr. was named to the Supreme Court , he had a net worth of more than $ 6 million , accumulated during his lucrative years in private practice .
When Samuel A. Alito Jr. was appointed , he had a net worth of more than $ 2 million , even though he had spent his entire professional career either in government or on the bench .
So how is it that Judge Sonia Sotomayor , nominated by President Obama to follow those two men onto the nation ’s highest court , reported a net worth of just $ 740,000 this week , with no stocks or bonds and a savings account of $ 31,985 , just marginally more than she owes her dentist and credit card companies ?
To start with , although Judge Sotomayor became a partner during her eight years at the New York law firm Pavia & Harcourt before becoming a federal district judge in 1992 , her salary in her final year at the firm was $ 151,761 , a far cry from the $ 776,000 that Justice Roberts reported pulling down in his last full year at the Washington - based law firm Hogan & Hartson .
Between her salary as a circuit court judge and the money she made as a lecturer at Columbia University Law School , Judge Sotomayor made $ 205,330 last year .
Still , the judge , divorced and with no children , does live in Greenwich Village , one of the more expensive neighborhoods in perhaps the most expensive city in the country .
Just parking a car here  she drives a white Saab convertible  can cost hundreds of dollars a month .
Benen rights in this post at the W.M an about conservative nutcase activist Kenneth Gladney , and how his fight against health care reform is so irony at its quintessence .
Over the last few days , a conservative activist in St. Louis named Kenneth Gladney seems to have become something of a cause for celebration in far - right circles .
Depending on which version of events you choose to believe , Gladney either initiated or was involved in a scuffle at a town - hall event late last week .
At least one prominent conservative blogger said Gladney was " brutally attacked " by SEIU members outside the event .
After watching the video , there 's ample reason for skepticism .
Gladney was , in fact , pulled to the ground during the fracas , but he seemed to bounce back up quickly , and is seen walking around soon after without any obvious injuries .
His attorney has argued that Gladney was beaten during the fight , but there 's nothing in the clip to support that .
Gladney later went to the hospital , claiming to have sustained injuries to his " knee , back , elbow , shoulder and face . "
Now get this :
Gladney is a hero right now to most on the " regular " Right ( go figure ) and the Fringe nutcase Right for this .
He 's been bestowed plenty of accolades as Benen has noted , and you know somewhere on some of those lunatic sites that his name is getting preached to the highest of their irrationalities .
But besides the already insane element in this , the next thing if you did n't see this post today will shock you , and exhibit clearly how it truly is scary on the other side .
Reader R.D. alerted me to this tidbit in the local news account of the protest : Gladney did not address Saturday 's crowd of about 200 people .
His attorney , David Brown , however , read a prepared statement Gladney wrote .
" A few nights ago there was an assault on my liberty , and on yours , too . "
Brown read .
" This should never happen in this country . "
Supporters cheered .
Brown finished by telling the crowd that Gladney is accepting donations toward his medical expenses .
Gladney told reporters he was recently laid off and has no health insurance .
[ emphasis added ]
Wow .
A guy fighting against the thing that would help him .
A thing that could help save his life , he is fighting against .
And his ignorance and blindness is clearly making him act in ways that his harming him greatly .
But it shows clearly that he is not the only person in this same particular boat with the same type of thinking .
Gladney is just an example of how misinformed and frankly just plain stupid these people are in this nation .
And they would jeopardized the rest of us and themselves , all because of their incorrigible anger , total lack of knowledge , and overall well being .

Salutations ! )
( CNN ) --
The presiding judge of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals went on trial Monday , facing misconduct allegations over her refusal to accept a last - minute filing to delay an execution .
Protesters demonstrate outside the courthouse on Monday .
The State Judicial Commission has charged Judge Sharon Keller with failing to follow the court 's execution - day procedures in the case of death - row inmate Michael Wayne Richard , and denying Richard access to open courts and the right to be heard .
Asked whether she would allow the court clerk 's office to stay open past 5 p.m. , as Richard 's attorneys were having computer problems and might be late filing emergency paperwork , Keller refused to do so , according to the complaint filed against her by the judicial commission .
Richard was executed that night .
In her response to the complaint , Keller maintained that she was asked whether the clerk 's office stayed open past 5 p.m. , and she " said no in accordance with long - standing custom . "
Watch why the judge is on trial »
" Judge Keller knew that pleadings had been filed after hours on execution days but not with the clerk 's office , " said the response .
" She also knew that the general counsel , in this case Mr. Marty , stayed after hours on execution day . "
Keller knew that after - hours filings are provided for in the state 's rules of appellate procedure , but also knew that regular office hours for state employees are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. under state law , the response said .
District Judge David Berchelmann Jr. was appointed to preside over the hearing , according to judicial commission documents .
Based upon his findings , the commission can take action ranging from dismissal of charges against Keller to her removal .
The afternoon of Richard 's scheduled execution day , September 25 , 2007 , the U.S. Supreme Court announced it would hear oral arguments in a Kentucky case over the constitutionality of lethal injection .
The court 's general counsel , Edward Marty , had told judges that he had been informed by the Harris County prosecutors that Richard 's attorneys were planning to file paperwork seeking to stay Richard 's execution , according to the complaint against Keller .
At about 4:40 p.m. that day , Texas Defender Service , whose lawyers were representing Richard , called the court clerk 's office and asked if their filing could be accepted a few minutes late , as they were having computer problems .
The court 's deputy clerk called Marty , who called Keller at home .
The judge had left earlier in the afternoon to meet a repairman , according to the complaint .
Marty " asked her whether the clerk 's office ( or the court ) could stay open past 5 p.m. , " the complaint said .
" Judge Keller said , ' No , ' and asked , ' Why ? '
Mr. Marty replied : ' They wanted to file something , but they were not ready . '
Judge Keller again said ' no . ' "
Time magazine , citing a newspaper interview with Keller in October 2007 and pretrial testimony last year , reported Keller told Marty : " We close at 5 . "
" This execution proceeded because the highest criminal court could n't be bothered to stay an extra 20 minutes on the night of an execution , " Andrea Keilen , executive director of Texas Defender Service , told ABC News in October 2007 .
Two other judges on the court told the Houston Chronicle they were willing to work late that night , and were unaware Keller refused to allow the filing of the appeal .
" It was an important issue , " Judge Paul Womack told the Chronicle in the October 2007 story .
He said he stayed at the court until 7 p.m. because " I wanted to be sure to be available in case it was raised . "
Keller pointed out in her response that there were no written execution - day procedures in place the day of Richard 's execution .
She said she did not tell the other judges about her conversation with Marty because she thought they knew about it .
In a virtually unprecedented move , the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers in October 2007 filed a complaint with the State Commission on Judicial Conduct over the incident .
" To the best of my knowledge , this is the first time that NACDL has ever filed a judicial conduct complaint against a sitting judge , " then - president Carmen Hernandez wrote .
" Only a full and complete investigation of this incident will suffice .
...
Whatever the findings of the judicial conduct commission , the handling of Mr. Richard 's case -- and his death -- will remain unacceptable . "
In her response to the charges , Keller also recounts Richard 's case .
He was convicted of sexually assaulting and killing a woman in 1986 , months after he had been released from prison .
By the time of his execution , Keller noted , Richard had two trials , two direct appeals -- one to the U.S. Supreme Court -- two state review proceedings and three federal review proceedings or motions hearings .
" The suggestion ... that Richard was not accorded ' access to open courts or the right to be heard according to law ' is patently without merit , " the response said .
In June 2008 , the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Kentucky 's use of lethal injection , ruling that the method -- used in 35 states -- is properly and humanely applied .

New genetic evidence suggests Australia may have been populated by two separate groups of humans - one arriving via Papua New Guinea , the other via Indonesia , a researcher says .
But more work is needed to confirm the idea .
And not all scientists agree that these latest results shed new light on the long - standing debate on how humans colonised Australia .
Dr Sheila van Holst Pellekaan , a molecular anthropologist from the University of New South Wales in Sydney , will present her research at a Australian Archaeological Association conference in Melbourne next month .
Previous genetic analysis shows that modern humans took two migration routes out of Africa 100,000 to 150,000 years ago , she says .
One group went north into Europe and Northern Eurasia , the other along the coast via Saudi Arabia , India and South - East Asia .
Dr van Holst Pellekaan analysed mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) from Aboriginal people in western New South Wales and Central Australia .
She says she found evidence of two ancient genetic groups that appear to be linked to these two migration routes .
Dr van Holst Pellekaan says some archaeologists argue there was more than one founding population of Australia , and her research is the first genetic evidence that could be used to support this .
It is possible that some Australians came in from the north via Papua New Guinea and the other took a more southerly route via Indonesia , she says .
Different views
Archaeologist Dr Colin Pardoe , who is speaking at the conference on a related topic , disagrees .
He believes the diversity of early Australians could have arisen from one group that came in from South - East Asia and then diversified as it adapted to different environments .
DR Pardoe is not convinced Dr van Holst Pellekaan has identified two founding groups .
" Are these two totally distinct groups that came in or are they representatives of one major group that came in that has all that diversity within it ? " he asks .
This is a possibility that Dr van Holst Pellekaan accepts .
" The idea of two founding populations is speculative , " she says .
" I can't prove it either way . "
Dr Pardoe says more DNA samples from other places such as the Indonesian islands and Papua New Guinea would need to be analysed .
" We need to understand the pattern of variation in these large groupings to see where Australians are coming from , " he says .
Professor Peter Brown of the University of New England in Armidale also says further data is required , including studies of Y chromosome DNA , as mtDNA only reflects the maternal line .
Dr van Holst Pellekaan says some Y - chromosome studies of Aboriginal people from Central Australia have found a connection with India , but there have been no comprehensive studies of this type .
Long Aboriginal history
Dr Van Holst Pellekaan says despite the links with the global lineages that came out of Africa , the Australian groups are quite different from those shown in samples from Papua New Guinea , the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Malaysia .
" [ People ] have to have been in Australia for a very long time for that diversity to generate .
We 're saying at least 40,000 years , " she says .
Dr Van Holst Pellekaan accepts the idea of tracing Aboriginal people back to Africa can clash with some cultural beliefs , which she respects .
" I simply present it to them as a scientist 's way of seeing how the language groups might have related to each other , " she says .
" I can only give them the information I come up with .
I do n't ask them to believe it . "
Publisher Activision has filed suit against Brütal Legend developer Double Fine Productions to prevent the release of the heavy metal game starring Jack Black , putting the title 's Rocktober release in jeopardy .
Advertisement
According to a report from the Associated Press , Activision claims that Double Fine failed to deliver Brütal Legend on time and mostly on its dime .
The suit contends that the Brütal Legend dev was paid $ 15 million to finish the game , but missed a key deadline , with Double Fine asking for another $ 7 million in development monies and a nine month extension .
When Vivendi and Activision merged last year , Brütal Legend was missing from the list of titles that Activision would inherit and publish .
But Activision claims it still retains its rights to the open world action adventure and that the mega- publisher has suffered " irreparable harm " in losing the game .

The lawsuit is unlikely a surprise for EA and Double Fine , as Activision expressed its unhappiness with the game being handed over to its biggest competitor earlier this year .
EA 's response to Activision 's legal threats called them as ridiculous as " a husband abandoning his family and then suing after his wife meets a better looking guy . "
Brütal Legend 's presence at E3 2009 is big .
New publisher Electronic
Arts is banking heavily on the game , but if Activision is successful in its latest round of litigation , it 's possible that we might have to start looking forward to a Rockvember or Rockcember release .

Hollywood 's hopes that high - definition Blu-ray discs could help make up for the sagging market for standard DVDs got a boost today thanks to a long awaited price cut of Sony 's Playstation 3 video game console , which also plays Blu-ray movies .
The PS3 is far and away the most popular Blu-ray player in the world , with 24 million units sold thus far .
However , many studios had been counting on the console being even more popular and serving as a " Trojan horse " to get Blu- ray into many consumers ' homes .
While the Playstation 2 was the dominant video game console of the last generation of devices , the PS3 is a distant third behind Microsoft 's Xbox 360 , which has sold more than 30 million units , and Nintendo 's Wii , which has moved more than 50 million .
One of the main reasons has been the PS3's high price :
It launched at a $ 599 and for the last two years has been $ 399 , compared with $ 299 for the Xbox 360 and $ 249 for the Wii .
With today 's price cut , it 's now $ 299 .
Blu-ray movie and TV sales rose 91 % in the first half of the year to $ 407 million in the U.S. , according to the Digital Entertainment Group , an industry trade organization .
However , that 's still a tiny percentage of overall consumer spending of $ 9.73 billion on home entertainment in the same time period and it did little to alleviate an overall drop of 13.5 % on disc purchases .

These images , all of Firefox in the Windows OS , reveal that the company is struggling to choose between two primary designs : tabs - on - bottom and tabs - on - top .
Tabs on bottom is the current norm in Firefox , while the tabs - on - top looks almost exactly like the Google Chrome browser .
Here is the tabs - on - bottom version ( click for full - sized versions ) :
And here 's the tabs - on - top design :
In addition , Mozilla summarizes the pros and cons of the two designs very succinctly :
Positives : - Save Vertical Space - Efficiency / Remove Visual Complexity - Right now the tabs have to be connected to something .
So we are adding an extra visual element for them to connect to .
- Shorter Mouse Distance to Page Controls Negatives : - Breaks Consistency / Familiarity - Moving things confuses existing users .
- Title is MIA - With the space removed from the titlebar you only get the truncated version in the tab .
- Longer Mouse Distance to Tabs -
Takes longer to mouse to a tab .
- Lost Space - Sandwiched in between the application icon and the window widgets you lose some space .
While we wo n't go into detail on the debate , we will say this : if Mozilla can offer the ability to choose between the two designs , it should .
Some users need to get to the menu items faster , while others prefer having the tabs in closer proximity .
New Firefox 4.0 Feature : Combo Stop / Refresh / Go Button
Firefox 4.0 incorporates all of the design changes featured in Firefox 3.7 and includes a few new features .
The big one is a Combo Stop / Refresh / Go Button .
Instead of separate buttons for each of these functions , they 're all integrated into one button on the right hand side of the address bar .
It also changes colors based on your actions .
So if you 're typing , it will be a green " Go " button , but if the page is currently loading , a red " Stop " button will take its place .
Not a bad way to save space , if we do say so ourselves .
Here 's a screenshot of the new feature in action :
Remember , this is all proposed , and feedback from the Firefox community shapes the browser into its final form .
And you bet it 's going to get more great features , as it's going to be some time until we can browse the web with this thing .
But be sure to check out our sneak peek of Firefox in 2010 if you want to learn more .
The pension crisis has reached critical mass in West Virginia .
Cities like Huntington are out of cash and begging the state ( taxpayers ) to bail out foolish promises that can not be met .
Please consider Cities Turn to State for Pension Relief .
City officials from around the state say their communities can no longer afford to cover the benefits of retired police officers and firefighters , so they are asking the state Legislature for help .
If nothing changes , cities such as Huntington could have fewer police officers and firefighters on the streets as they are forced to cut back staffs because of increasing pension obligations .
The city ’s last six police and fire department retirees will likely draw $ 1.5 million each in pension benefits over the course of their retirements , even though each person made less than $ 900,000 during his or her career , according to Deputy Mayor Tom Bell said .
“ What happened here is we just ca n’t afford to dedicate that amount of money ” to pensions , Bell said .
Huntington is in the worst shape , but other cities around the state also are struggling to cover their pensions .
State requirements also help drive up the cost of covering pensions .
For example , police and firefighters can retire with full benefits at age 50 , the reasoning being both lines of work often involve physical activities that become more stressful the older people get .
But people now live much longer than they used to , so it is not uncommon for retirees to live more than three decades past their retirements , Bell said .
“ The problem is the state could n’t add enough money to pay for these lucrative pension benefits , ” he said .
“ What we have to do is close that to new hires and adopt a more conservative pension plan . ”
The so - called “ Huntington plan ” would let cities do just that .
It also would give them a 40 - year re-amortization of their existing pension debts , meaning they would pay back the debts at higher rates but have more time to do it .

( NIV ) .
Laminin Shirts are a great way to celebrate Christ who hold all things together .

I just got back from a five - day trip .
A vacation be relaxing , but at the same time , you need to do a little more prep work ahead of time to ensure that things run as smoothly as possible while you are gone .
This is especially important if you are taking an extended vacation of a week or more .
Taking care of your home while you are on vacation
One of the best things you can do is to make a “ to - do ” list of what needs to be done before you leave town .
Think about what is likely to happen while you are gone , and what should be taken care of in your absence .
Your to - do list should include some of the following items :
Put your mail on hold at the post office , or have a trusted friend or relative bring it in the house for you .
It is risky to leave your mailbox stuffed full .
Put your newspapers on hold .
You can either get credit for the days the newspapers are n’t delivered , or you can usually donate them to local schools .
Newspapers piled up in front of your home are a tip - off to would - be thieves that you are gone .
Halt other deliveries .
We have milk delivery from a local dairy .
If you have grocery delivery or some other type of delivery , have it stopped while you are gone .
Have your plants watered .
If you do n’t have an automatic timer for your garden , consider paying one of the neighborhood children to take care of it .
Have a trusted friend or relative care for plants .
( He or she can bring the mail in while being about it . )
Take care of your pets .
If you are n’t taking your pets with you , you will need them cared for .
Outside pets usually just need someone to check on them and feed and water them , and maybe take them for a walk .
Indoor pets need more care .
There are automatic fish feeders that can release food for tank - dwelling animals .
You might also consider boarding your pets if other options are not feasible .
Unplug your appliances .
TVs , computers and even cordless phones ( provided you have an answering service instead of a machine ) can be unplugged while you are gone in order to save money on electricity .
Turn off the air conditioner as well .
Set up automatic bill pay .
If you have bills that will be due while you are gone , either pay them early , or set up automatic bill pay so that they will be taken care of while you are gone .
Many hotels offer online Internet , and if you bring your laptop , you can keep tabs on your finances online .
Notify others of where you will be .
Let those who need to know where you are going , and how long you expect to be gone .
Let those you work for know that you will be leaving , and make sure family knows when you are expected back .
That way , if something happens and you are not back , they have something helpful to tell the police .
Take it with you while you are on vacation
It is also useful to make a to - do list of things that you need to take with you while on vacation .
Make sure that you think about what you will need .
Make your list well ahead of time , so that you are less likely to forget something .
Then , as you pack , check items off the list .
What you need will vary according to your mode of travel and your personal preferences , but here are some general suggestions for what to include in your luggage :
Good atlas / map .
You need to know where you are going .
And , even if you have GPS , it is a good idea to bring a back - up atlas or map .
You never know when you might have a technological malfunction .
Chargers .
Take stock of the gadgets you will be bringing — from DVD players for the kids to your cell phone — and make sure that you have the proper chargers for all of your electronics .
Memory cards for your camera .
Buy an extra memory card or two for your camera so that you have plenty of room for pictures .
Batteries .
Some electronics still require batteries ( my camera , for one ) .
Check to see what kind of batteries your electronics take , and pack some extra .
Entertainment for the kids .
We have a small backpack that our son fills with books and toys when we go on a trip .
This keeps him occupied whether we are in the car or on a plane ( or sitting in the airport ) .
Prescriptions .
Check your prescriptions , and make sure you have what you need .
You may need to get special permission from your doctor to refill a little early in some cases .
This can usually be arranged , but you should plan for it ahead of time .
Hand sanitizer .
Whether in bottle or wipe form , it is always a good idea to have hand sanitizer along .
If you are going to be gone for a long period of time , you can also plan to do laundry along the way .
Many hotels and vacation rentals have laundry facilities that can help you cut down on the amount of clothes that you have to pack .
Just make sure to bring enough quarters .
Also , realize that if you forget something , it ’s not the end of the world .
You can usually find a store somewhere that has what you need .

Lobbyists Now Writing Fake Letters To Congressmen From Blacks And Mexicans , Telling Them Not To Vote For Things

The newly named goat " Brett " now makes his home in Packers country , namely the Eleva , Wis. , farm of Duane and Carlene Schultz .
VIDEO VIDEO
Work in a tire shop and you 'll see your share of lug nuts .
But the guys at Tires Plus in Winona , Minn. , will never forget their encounter last Friday .
It started with a broken serpentine belt and a driver stopping in for a repair .
The woman was told the fix would take an hour and that she should stop back then .
But before she left she had a little something to share .
" By the way , " service writer James Prusi recalls the woman saying , " There 's a goat in my trunk . "
Prusi was n't sure he heard correctly , so he asked the woman to repeat herself .
" She said she was going to butcher the goat . "
Now the guys at Tires Plus are n't ones to meddle in their customer 's business , but then the goat started crying .
" It sounded like a child almost in the trunk , " said Prusi .
He and the other workers decided they just had to open that trunk .
That 's when the story got even weirder .
Under the lid they found the goat 's feet tied together .
He was painted purple and gold .
On each of the goat 's sides was a shaved Brett Favre number four .
Some might find the very notion amusing .
But not service technician Jeff Bronk .
" It 's not funny .
If it was a customer and they got tied up they would n't think it was funny . "
The workers called Winona animal control , which arrived along with three police squad cars .
Officers removed the goat from the trunk and questioned the woman .
In statement police said the goat had been in the trunk about an hour .
The woman said she was driving to Minneapolis .
There was no mention of taking the goat to Friday night 's pre-season Minnesota Vikings game , to be played later that evening .
Workers at the tire shop say the woman was traveling with a man and a child .
She gave her address as St. Paul at the tire shop , though an animal control officer said the woman was from Onalaska , Wis .
Her case will be turned over to the Winona city attorney for possible animal cruelty charges .
Police say the one - year - old goat was scared and lethargic when it was removed from the trunk .
There is however a happy ending .
As of Monday evening , the newly named Brett the goat was making his home in Packers country , namely the Eleva , Wis. farm of Duane and Carlene Schultz .
" He will have a good life here , " said Carlene who agreed to take in the goat at the request of Winona police .
They know a little something about Bretts at the Schultz farm .
Last summer their ill - timed Brett Favre corn maze made international news .
" We think it 's a happy ending for this Brett , " laughs Carlene .
" I do n't know how the ending will be for the other Brett . "

The benefits in children have been questioned Research has cast doubt on the policy of giving antiviral drugs to children for swine flu .
Work in the British Medical Journal shows Tamiflu and Relenza rarely prevent complications in children with seasonal flu , yet carry side effects .
Although they did not test this in the current swine flu pandemic , the authors say these drugs are unlikely to help children who catch the H1N1 virus .
The government has stuck by its policy of offering them to anyone infected .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The Department of Health said a " safety - first approach " of offering antivirals to everyone remained a sensible and responsible way forward , but promised to keep the policy under review .
There were an estimated 30,000 new cases of swine flu in England in the last week , a drop compared with the 110,000 cases the week before .
A decreased incidence has also been seen in Scotland and Wales in the past week .
The total of swine flu - related deaths in England and Scotland stands at 41 .
Antivirals are the mainstay of treatment at the moment until a vaccine becomes available , which is expected in September .
Our research is finding for most children these antiviral drugs are probably not going to have much of an effect
Study author Dr Matthew Thompson
Q&A : Coping with swine flu
The drugs are designed to ensure that symptoms are mild and reduce the chance of an infected person giving the illness to someone else .
The UK has moved beyond the stage of containing swine flu into the " treatment phase " , which means that Tamiflu is only being offered to people who have swine flu and not usually to their contacts .
No effect
While the latest study shows that antivirals can shorten the duration of normal seasonal flu in children by up to a day and a half , it also shows that they have little or no effect on asthma flare - ups , ear infections or the likelihood of children needing antibiotics .
But the drugs can cause unpleasant side effects , such as vomiting with Tamiflu .
ADVICE FOR PARENTS
Most cases of swine flu are relatively mild Children sick with flu should have plenty of rest and fluids Contact the child 's doctor if their condition gets worse or there is cause for concern A GP may prescribe Tamiflu , or patients can call the National Flu Service on 0800 1 513 100
There is also the risk that widespread use of the drugs will mean the virus will develop resistance to them .
For most children aged between 1 and 12 , the risks associated with taking the drugs may well outweigh any benefits , say the researchers .
They say parents with sick children should make sure they get lots of rest and enough fluids and that they should contact their doctor if the child 's condition gets worse .
In most cases , swine flu is a relatively mild disease .
Their work also reveals the effectiveness of using antivirals to contain the spread of flu .
They found that 13 people need to be treated to prevent one additional case , meaning antivirals reduce transmission by 8 % .
BBC Health Correspondent Adam Brimelow
The government 's flu pandemic plan has come under close and continuous scrutiny ever since the UK's first H1N1 swine flu cases were diagnosed three and a half months ago .
One of the biggest concerns has been the aggressive use of anti-viral drugs , drawing on a stockpile built up in advance to treat half the population , with further supplies still coming in .
The government has also lined up around a 130 m vaccines , more than enough for everyone in the UK .
Over the last four years ministers have spent more than £ 500 m on preparations for the pandemic .
So is this outlay proportionate to the risk ?
The total of swine flu related deaths so far across the UK is 41 .
Seasonal flu routinely kills 12,000 people in England and Wales each year , without provoking anything like the same response .
But it is important to remember we are still in the first wave of swine flu .
The situation in the autumn may be much worse .
For now ministers and their advisers are prepared to err on the side of caution even if that means people having Tamiflu who do not need it .
They say they will be guided in their decisions by science .
However , a lot of the evidence on swine flu is still emerging so they will continue to rely on a safety - first approach .
The University of Oxford team , led by Dr Matthew Thompson , carried out a review of four trials on the treatment of seasonal flu in 1,766 children and three trials involving the use of antiviral to limit the spread of seasonal flu in 863 children .
Dr Thompson said : " Our research is finding for most children these antiviral drugs are probably not going to have much of an effect . "
Co-researcher Dr Carl Heneghan , a GP and clinical lecturer at Oxford University , said the current policy of giving Tamiflu for mild illness was an " inappropriate strategy " .
He said : " The downside of the harms outweigh the one - day reduction in symptomatic benefits . "
Flu expert Professor Hugh Pennington said the findings were not surprising and underlined what was already known about Tamiflu .
" Tamiflu has a place but it's not a wonder cure . "
A Department of Health spokesman said : " Whilst there is doubt about how swine flu affects children , we believe a safety - first approach of offering antivirals to everyone remains a sensible and responsible way forward .
" However , we will keep this policy under review as we learn more about the virus and its effects .
" The BMJ research is correct to say that many people with swine flu only get mild symptoms , and they may find bed rest and over - the - counter flu remedies work for them .
" But for those who experience severe symptoms , the best scientific advice tells us that Tamiflu should still be taken as soon as possible - and to suggest otherwise is potentially dangerous .
If people are in any doubt about whether to take Tamiflu , they should contact their GP . "
Liberal Democrat Shadow Health Secretary Norman Lamb called for an urgent review of the policy .
But Professor Steve Field , chairman of the Royal College of GPs , said the current policy was correct .
The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health also supports the Department of Health advice .

A Bright Shining Slogan
The phrase " winning hearts and minds " has , in recent years , become indelibly associated with the challenges of an interventionist U.S. foreign policy .
But the concept has had a long and circuitous life .
It was first associated with democracy in the 19th century , later served as a call to national solidarity during the Great Depression , and finally became a slogan for a policy the U.S. military never quite implemented in Vietnam .
As U.S. President Barack Obama fights two inherited wars and continues the daunting task of reaching out to Muslims , the concept has never been more relevant , even if the words themselves have begun to lose all meaning .
429-347 B.C. Greek philosopher Plato becomes the first to draw a clear distinction between feeling and thinking — between the heart and the mind .
The two were referred to as separate philosophical and physiological creatures until the mid-20th century .
FEBRUARY 13 , 1818 Writing to a Baltimore newspaper editor , U.S. founding father John Adams describes the American Revolution as being " in the minds and hearts of the people , a change in their religious sentiments of their duties and obligations . "
1934 U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt uses the term frequently in his speeches to soothe a body politic battered by economic turmoil : " In these days it means to me a union not only of the states , but a union of the hearts and minds of the people in all the states and their many interests and purposes , devoted with unity to the human welfare of our country . "
JUNE 1952
The phrase gets used for the first time in its modern sense — to refer to counterinsurgency objectives — during the Malayan Emergency , an uprising by local rebel forces to oust British colonial rule .
" The answer [ to defeating the insurgents ] … rests in the hearts and minds of the Malayan people , " says Gen. Sir Gerald Templer .
APRIL 2 , 1963
In the thick of the Cold War , " hearts and minds " creeps into U.S. counterrevolutionary rhetoric .
" Perhaps most significant of all is a change in the hearts and minds of the people — a growing will to develop their countries , " President John F. Kennedy tells Congress .
" We can only help Latin Americans to save themselves . "
MAY 4 , 1965 U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson says that " ultimate victory [ in Vietnam ] will depend upon the hearts and the minds " of the Vietnamese .
But the policy does n’t match the rhetoric , and a brutal , escalating campaign of pacification ensues , further alienating the South Vietnamese population .
1974 The Academy Award - winning Vietnam documentary , Hearts and Minds , helps cement the phrase ’s negative connotations .
SEPTEMBER 14 , 2005 U.S. President George W. Bush justifies the invasion of Iraq by hailing the possibility of a political transformation of the Middle East .
" Across the world , hearts and minds are opening to the message of human liberty as never before , " he tells the U.N. General Assembly .
2006 Scholars begin to describe China ’s foreign policy , particularly in Africa , as designed to win the " hearts and minds " of global elites .
SEPTEMBER 19 , 2006 Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad deploys the term in a defiant speech to the U.N. : " Would it not be easier for global powers to … win hearts and minds through … real promotion of justice , compassion , and peace , than through " continuing to assemble nuclear weapons ?
DECEMBER 15 , 2006 The U.S. Army and Marine Corps release a revised " Counterinsurgency Field Manual , " drawing on historical counterinsurgency lessons as well as recent experience in Iraq .
The manual calls for a minimal use of force .
" Protracted popular war is best countered by winning the ‘ hearts and minds ’ of the populace , " it reads .
2009 U.S. President Barack Obama uses the phrase in his campaign to reset relations with both the Muslim world and Russia .
" [ Abiding by the Geneva Conventions ] … will make us safer and will help in changing hearts and minds in our struggle against extremists , " he says on January 9 .
And in Moscow six months later : " [ By ] mobilizing and organizing and changing people ’s hearts and minds , you then change the political landscape . "
Coal 's well - funded lobbying group today launched a television ad campaign featuring ordinary people talking about the importance of low - cost electricity , a message analysts described as coal 's effort to rebrand itself before the Senate tackles climate legislation .
The campaign from the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity ( ACCCE ) , an alliance of coal and utility companies , features 30 - second unscripted spots with a electric - utility executive , an Ohio small - business owner and a St. Louis , Mo. , energy efficiency consultant .
Two - minute Internet videos offer similar messages on cost , availability and the environmental strides made by coal - fired utilities .
The ads come as ACCCE pushes forcefully to gain support for coal .
The lobbying group just rolled out a so - called citizens army of more than 200,000 volunteers to visit town hall meetings and other functions attended by members of Congress , where they will ask questions about energy policy .
That effort is aimed at influencing senators , particularly those from states that rely on coal for power .
" The fact that companies will pour their billions into these kind of programs suggests that they think they have impact , " said Kenneth Green , resident scholar at American Enterprise Institute , a conservative think tank .
" Clearly , they believe that this does sway public opinion for their product , or they would n't advertize . "
Using real people is an effort to connect to voters and generate positive feelings about coal , Green said .
" This kind of campaign ... is about winning the hearts and minds of people who are fiscally strapped in a recession , " Green said .
The TV campaign also arrives as ACCCE is under fire politically for its ties to a dozen fraudulent letters that were sent to three Democratic House members urging them to vote against their chamber 's climate bill .
Made to look as if they came from advocacy groups based in the lawmakers ' districts , the letters came from a lobbying firm , Bonner & Associates , which was working on behalf of ACCCE .
ACCCE blamed the letters on a Bonner employee who has since been fired .
But congressional furor over the incident remains , and environmental groups are working to keep that anger alive .
The ad campaign that starts today with the launch of Internet videos had been planned for months .
It is launching now because it is finally ready , ACCCE spokesman Joe Lucas said .
The ads will run on cable and network television in Washington , D.C. , and Midwestern states .
Lucas would not reveal the cost of the ads but said they are part of a $ 15 million to $ 20 million media budget this year .
Lucas said the ads are a way of showing the importance of coal to real people , in terms of its connection to low - cost power and jobs .
" These are people who are talking in their own words , " Lucas said .
The ads , he said , " tell the story from the perspective of people who live at the end of the power line . "
In one ad , Fred Shelton , a nonprofit agency worker who helps low - income residents with energy efficiency , talks about the importance of power prices .
" A lot of people have to make decisions on whether to pay their utilities or buy a meal , " Shelton says in the ad .
" If energy costs were to increase , it would be very devastating to them .
We need coal to make it more affordable to the everyday consumer .
Low - cost coal is very important . "
The Sierra Club , a coal opponent , described the ads as inaccurate .
The biggest cause of electricity rate spikes in the country is the building of new coal - fired power plants , said Bruce Nilles , director of the Sierra Club 's Beyond Coal Campaign ..
" We 're out there telling people , if people want lower electric bills , they want to steer well clear of coal , " Nilles said .
Nilles also questioned the trustworthiness of ACCCE , given that it is linked to fraudulent letters sent to House lawmakers .
Lucas of ACCCE said Sierra Club is " cherry picking , " using a fact in a Massachusetts Institute of Technology report that said the cost of building new coal plants is increasing .
The same report said the cost of new generation for other power sources is increasing , as well , he said .
' Values mapping '
ACCCE 's television ads employ a strategy called " values mapping , " said Green with AEI .
A company applies its values to individuals , hoping that viewers will recognize them as their own values .
" You figure out the values of the people who are using your product , " Green said , then use " phrases or concepts that make these values more visible to people , then associate it with your product . "
That helps generate positive feelings about the company , he said .
" They 're awareness builders , " Green added .
" They 're raising the threat of higher electricity prices . "
The ads do not mention the House energy bill or the Senate taking up climate legislation , but Lucas said the timing is partially connected to legislative efforts .
" This is an important time for us to be out there with this message , " Lucas said .
The ads , he added , " will certainly play to the backdrop of the dialogue " about energy .
As there is no Senate climate bill yet , Green said , the ads make sense in that they focus more on the concept of energy prices and availability than on asking people to oppose specific legislation .
Coal received many provisions it sought in the House bill but is pressing for more in the Senate .
Coal interests want a provision in climate legislation that would limit how much businesses must pay for carbon dioxide emissions under a cap - and - trade program .
Coal also wants financial support for research into ways to capture carbon emissions and sequester them underground .
And the industry wants to slow down the pace of the cap , which in the House bill tightens over time .
For its ads , ACCCE used a talent scout who found the people to appear on camera , Lucas said .
In one of the spots , small - business owner Olivia Albright talks about power costs while standing in her Toledo packaging shop .
" Every piece of equipment in my shop runs on electricity .
It needs to be plugged in .
If it 's not , it does n't work , " Albright says in the ad .
" There would be some hard decisions for me to make if the energy costs went up .
I would have to let some of my employees go .
... I need something that 's going to be there , something that 's affordable .
Electricity from coal does that for me . "
Venita McClellon - Allen , an executive at the utility American Electric Power Co. Inc. , speaks in her ad about the availability of coal - fired power .
" Wind is a great option for the future , but it is not the 24/7 resource that we require , " McCellon - Allen says .
" We have to be able to meet our customers ' needs in the middle of the night or the hottest summer day .
Coal will help us do that regardless of what Mother Nature 's doing . "
The ads also talk about coal as cleaner than it has been in the past .
" The coal plants we 're building today are light - years ahead of the ones built 30 years ago .
They 're cleaner , they 're more efficient , and they 're much better for the environment , " McCellon - Allen says .
" Coal is plentiful , dependable , and it's affordable . "
The Sierra Club's Nilles said coal is not a clean option , and environmental groups have attacked coal for describing itself as clean .
Currently , there is no commercial - scale coal plant in operation that removes and sequesters carbon dioxide emissions , which are linked to global warming .
But ACCCE 's Lucas said environmental groups have limited use of the phrase " clean coal " to the elimination of carbon dioxide emissions .
When coal backers talk about clean coal , he said , they are referring to advances over the last 30 years to remove many pollutants .
Where is the Reality Coalition ?
The new ads strike a different tone than those used earlier ad war over the phrase " clean coal . "
Coal supporters last fall ran television ads talking about " clean coal . "
That campaign was part of $ 38 million that coal backers spent on advertising last year .
In response , a coalition of environmental groups joined with Vice President Al Gore 's Alliance for Climate Protection and started the Reality Coalition .
It began airing ads declaring , " There 's no such thing as clean coal . "
Lucas called the climate coalition 's ads " snarky . "
The Reality Coalition did not reveal how much money it spent , saying at the time that its ad purchases were " competitive " with the coal industry 's buys .
The Reality Coalition in the spring moved from California to Washington , D.C. , saying that it sensed the timing was right to be in the nation 's capital .
But the group has since disappeared from public view , not responding to reporter inquiries .
The group 's last Twitter tweet was April 28 .
Several have speculated that the Reality Coalition withdrew at the behest of Democrats who feared the group 's activism and ties to Gore would keep moderates from voting for the House climate bill .
Whatever the reason , the exit leaves no one with a big bankroll to fund ads competing with the new ones from coal .
Nilles of the Sierra Club said environmentalists will continue their awareness efforts but that he expected ACCCE " will spend a lot of money to try to influence public opinion . "

Create Beading Patterns with Inkscape ( free software )
Welcome to the free software Inkscape beading diagram tutorial !
You can download Inkscape for free from inkscape.org .
If you have any difficulty following this tutorial , please post a comment at the bottom of the page on which you are stuck , and I 'll do my best to help !
Final product - our Inkscape beading diagram !
Things to know ...
I have no affiliation with the developers of Inkscape .
I merely stumbled upon their program through a link on another website that specializes in vector designs .
This program is freeware and has no adware associated with it .
We are very fortunate that the authors have generously provided this program to all for their free enjoyment .
Download Inkscape for free from inkscape.org .
To explain the lingo , I will use double arrowheads " > > " to refer to a menu item at the top of the screen , followed by a submenu item within that menu .
( e.g. File >>
Save , or Effects >> Modify Path >>
Add Nodes )
Part I - Setting up Inkscape : Installation and Preferences
1 ) First we must install the program .
Visit inkscape.org and click on " Download Now " in the top right - hand corner of the page .
Simply select a folder on your computer where to save the setup file for the program .
Save the file onto your computer .
The download should take about 2 minutes on high speed , or maybe half an hour on dial - up .
Once downloaded , double - click on the setup file you saved on your computer .
You may wish to exit other open programs , but I doubt it matters much .
Follow the instructions in the setup screen until the program is installed .
The setup program will create shortcuts and will add Inkscape in your start menu programs list .
It will start up the program for you when you are finished installing , if you so desire .
2 ) Once the program screen is open , you 'll find it 's not maximized on your screen .
This would make working with it inefficient , so resize the window .
Simply drag the four corners of the program to the four corners of your screen .
You could also click the maximize button , but you 'll find that everytime you minimize the screen , it will revert back to its original size .
If you drag out the four corners , it wo n't resize again .
In the next few steps , I will teach you how to make this permanent in your Inkscape settings so that Inkscape opens full screen every time you launch the program .
Inkscape Preferences Button
3 ) Now we want to set up the program preferences to match our needs .
Do one of the following :
-- Either go to File >> Inkscape Preferences ...
--
Or click the button that looks like a wrench and screwdriver , which is on the top row of buttons , second from the right
I recommend that you make the following changes to the preferences :
Remember Window Size - Inkscape Preferences
A ) In the left list , click " Windows " : select " remember and use last window 's geometry " under " Saving window geometry ( size and position ) " .
This will cause the window to be the size you last set it to when you resized the window .
In other words , for us , this makes our full screen size permanent until you decide to change it .
It will always remember what your most recently chosen window size .
Default Grid Settings - Inkscape Preferences
B ) In the left list , click " Grids " : select the following options from the Default grid settings for " Rectangular Grid " :
-- Grid units : px ( unchanged )
-- Origin X : 0.00 ( unchanged )
-- Origin Y : 0.00 ( unchanged )
-- Spacing X : 15.00
-- Spacing Y : 15.00
-- Grid line color : click the blue colour box and drag the sliders to select a colour ( I selected light blue as seen in the photo )
-- Major grid line color : click the blue colour box and drag the sliders to select a colour ( I selected black as seen in the photo )
-- Major grid line every : 4
--
Do not select show dots instead of lines
If in doubt , the photo shows you what your settings should look like exactly .
Setting the grid size is very important because we will be making heavy use of the grid to position our beads very easily .
Tool Settings - Use Last Style - Inkscape Preferences
C ) In the left list , click on the [ +] sign beside the word Tools .
Then click the [+] sign beside the word Shapes :
Make sure that for all shapes listed ( Rectangle , 3D box , Ellipse , Star , Spiral ) as well as for all other tools ( Pencil , Pen , Calligraphy , Paint Bucket , Text ) , " Last style used " is selected rather than " This tool 's own style " .
This will ensure that when you use a tool or shape , it will remember what you last set the colours , stroking colours , gradient , etc. for that tool or shape .
This is very important for us because when we type all our numbers on each bead , we want the program to remember the style from one number to the next without having to reset all the text properties again !
Document Properties Button
4 ) We are now going to edit the Document Properties for our document , and then we are going to save the settings we set here as our default template so that we do n't have to change them again .
To open the Document Properties box , do one of the following :
-- Either go to File >>
Document Properties ...
--
Or click the button that looks like a wrench head on a piece of paper , which is on the top row of buttons , on the very right
I recommend that you make the following changes to the document properties : ( Go to page 2 )
Ferdinand von Prondzynski , the president of DCU , has written a few blog posts about ways to cope with the way the government has been slashing the funding for universities ( usually on the quiet ) , but with the recent announcement of the proposed new college loans plan , he ’s written more , and most recently this post discussing the levels of the fees for different courses , which he disagrees with , mainly because the universities have n’t been asked to the policy table from what I can see :
The engagement with the idea to the stage where its details are being debated is sufficiently depressing that I wrote a reply to his post , and I wanted to reproduce it here :
I still find it enormously depressing to see the reintroduction of fees embraced in this manner , especially by university heads , despite their being a suboptimal solution to a blatantly manufactured problem .
My father was the first in his clan to go to college , which he did as a mature student on a scholarship and money earned by my mother working sewing curtains for a furnishings shop .
Once he graduated , my mother then became the first in her clan to go to college , supported by my father ’s now higher income .
And the year she graduated , I became the first child from either of our clans to go to college after finishing the leaving certificate course .
We did not receive a single penny in grant funding for this ; every resource available was pooled to fund that education , along with the initial scholarship which was the end result of five years of work by my father getting his leaving certificate as a mature student by studying in the evenings after a day ’s work .
There were no holidays , no new cars , no fancy clothes , no fancy food , no eating out , no computers , no rented movies , no going to the pub ( on any night ) , not in all that time .
To this day , I ca n’t wrap my head around the concept of a holiday in a foreign country , it ’s simply too alien a concept compared with the necessary austerity I grew up with .
We sacrificed * everything * for the goal of further education , it was our family ’s bet on our collective future .
However , in the third year of my undergraduate course , my younger sister completed her leaving certificate , and had free fees not been introduced in that year , we could not have sent her to college .
There simply were insufficient resources to allow for that .
We were stretched long past breaking point financially .
There were no grants available , no scholarships , no bursaries .
The free fees are why she got to go to college , we had no other options whatsoever .
We all knew this at the time .
The free fees were the one thing I can think of in the past decade that were unquestionably a good policy from a bad government , and they did enormous good for the community and the economy and the country as a whole .
To now see that same bad government turn around and start actively working to subvert free fees , to discard them as being a bad idea , is monstrous , because that absence wo n’t affect me ; it will affect my children , by saddling them with a debt of tens of thousands of euro in return for them undertaking years of study for a job that will see them contribute more to the tax take of the state than would otherwise be contributed .
We are , in effect , financially punishing those who defer gratification and train in the professions which our society requires , unless they choose the morally dubious route of defaulting on their loans and emigrating .
Logically speaking , this proposal creates a situation where the best options pragmatically are those which are morally repugnant , such as deciding to not work and contribute and to live off the dole ; or deciding to study for a professional degree and then emigrate and default on the loan .
The only other option – the one most likely for those of us who actually try to live honestly – is that that extra thirty thousand euro or so of debt * per child * will be loaded onto the account of the parents .
That ’s not even mentioning the kind of stress this will induce in students .
Asking a 17 - year - old to choose the career path they will follow for the rest of their life is idioticly ill - advised to begin with , yet we do it every year .
We see several suicides every year in colleges , often several per course , often when those same teenagers find they made the wrong choice , that they are n’t cut out to be a doctor or an architect despite their parent ’s wishes .
Now , we ’re talking about asking them to take on a debt that will eat 9 % of their pay every year for a decade right at the time of their lives when they are at the bottom of their earning potential , right when every euro counts and when such a loan can be enormously damaging in the long term .
This will add to the stress .
And given our socially backward way of dealing with mental health issues , it ’s a desperately sad prediction , but you can pretty much guarantee a rise in the suicide rate in colleges as a result of this .
And as a solution , this does n’t even net the most money .
Ordinary income tax does this already .
For example , this year , I will pay in tax about three times what these estimates say a year of engineering undergraduate courses cost .
Next year , it will be more , and that will continue ( though not indefinitely ) .
That ’s the nature of a profession ; those in it contribute more to the tax take .
That is why free fees is the appropriate solution .
What we need to do is not raise even more money ; what we need to do is to decide that it is more acceptable to pay colleges what it costs to run the courses from the exchequer funding , as the scheme was supposed to do before the government cut it repeatedly .
We need to put our children ’s education before the expense accounts of our Ministers and Deputies and Senators , before the enormous overspending on poorly chosen projects in Ministerial constituencies .
That , or those of us with the intelligence and transportable skills need to emigrate to a state which does n’t punish our children to teach them that education is a burden .

People can say some pretty stupid things online .
Maybe it ’s the anonymity , maybe it ’s just a spur - of - the - moment thought immortalized forever on a message board .
Some of them are understandable , given circumstances .
OK , your brain farted and spat out that retarded statement , and now you ’re feeling better .
Alright .
But sometimes , the things people say can cause great need for release of frustration .
Some of them can make you want to steal a car and ram it into a shopping mall , or grab the next person to walk past you and shove his face into a tree trunk .
For example , I ’ve heard , more than once , someone who is supposedly into rock music say they hate Nirvana , and that Nirvana sucks .
This is utterly berserk .
Listen up , pinhead .
First of all , the words “ hate ” and “ sucks ” are oversimplified ways to express discontent with something .
People use them when they do n’t know how else to identify or explain what they do n’t like about something .
And do n’t get me wrong , there is much not to like about Nirvana .
( Big hint :
It ’s designed that way . )
But to say Nirvana “ sucks ” and that you “ hate ” them is entirely missing the point , like saying “ man , Casablanca is so damn sappy , ” or “ why does Van Gogh paint so many sunflowers ? ”
Let me explain .
Why people do n’t like Nirvana :
Kurt Cobain ’s voice is so craggy
Kurt Cobain ’s such a junkie
Their music is so basic and “ raw ”
( Or : their music is so candy - ass - pop )
Man , flannel is so “ out ”
Why they ’re wrong :
1. Kurt Cobain is n’t Lady GaGa , and that ’s the idea .
Cobain was a real guy , with real emotions that came through in his music , exposing his audience to actual human feeling .
Since that is the ultimate goal of music ( not “ to help you look cooler ” ) , it ’s a huge part of the appeal .
And since he happened to be the tormented sort , his voice conveyed that , very effectively .
In fact , he used his voice as a way of separating the fans who understood his music from the ones who were just coming to shows because it was cool – and the result was heartfelt songs that sometimes sounded quite ugly .
Some people who claim to be into rock do n’t like that , which is fine .
In that case , you can go back to the cushy drivel you ’re tricked into buying by fake guys who drive Land Rovers and have no reason whatsoever to actually feel the music they make .
Your loss , smart guy .
2. Kurt Cobain was indeed a junkie .
This was n’t good for his health , but the ironic side of it was that his drug habits made his mind go places people do n’t normally go , and his songwriting brought it back for everyone else to see .
Because , as unfortunate as it is , junkies actually tend to write better songs .
Doubt it ?
Go ahead and listen to “ Come Together , ” “ Space Oddity ” and “ Something in the Way . ”
Now go listen to Jet .
Or the Jonas Brothers .
3. Nirvana is indeed simple and raw .
It was the ’90s , and simple and raw was a reaction to pompous and flamboyant ( like Guns ‘ n ’ Roses ) .
And since Nirvana was so raw , basic and new , everybody else did what they do with anything — they copied it and made it prettier .
Hence Pearl Jam , Silverchair , Bush , Filter , and all the way up to the pretty - boy , fake “ grunge ” bands that are around now , like Seether and the screamier parts of Linkin Park .
( Do n’t even get me started on them . )
( … Wait , I ’ve already gone there . )
Those bands took the same idea , made it cuter and more produced , and added stuff like extra testosterone , Abercrombie - Fitch fashion and hip - hop tendencies , so it could become much more popular .
And it did .
So , when you go back and hear the original version of all that pretty noise , on the surface it can be underwhelming — like how Joy Division ’s version of “ Dead Souls ” is n’t quite as hard - ass as Nine Inch Nails ’ , or how Donnie Darko does n’t have quite the same level of drama as its sequel , S. Darko .
( If you have n’t seen the sequel , do n’t bother . )
4. Nirvana preserved pop , despite everything aforementioned .
This is probably the biggest reason they were successful , and probably one of the reasons Cobain hated his success .
He was able to wrap his angst and rough - edged , emotional outbursts in a nice , listenable candy shell that made it extremely popular with his fans .
He probably could have made it even more poppy , if he wanted to .
( I ’ve read that he ’d even talked about adding orchestration to his next album . )
The problem was , it tended to make people assume the band was candy all the way through .
So the people who liked Lithium came to shows and were utterly perturbed by songs like Milk It .
5. Flannel .
People in Seattle probably wore it because it ’s cold there .
And not that it was ever supposed to become the world ’s coolest ‘ 90s skater trend , but for what it ’s worth , it ’s all over the place in vintage stores banking on a full - blown revival .
Hey , you bought into the ‘ 80s revival , right ?
Nice ass - huggers you got there .
Addendum : I recently ran into another reason why some say Nirvana sucks , which is that they put an end to the hairband era .
And the only appropriate response to this would be the same response I received the time I ordered two Irish car bombs at a trendy bar on Melrose : ( hands splayed outward ) “ REALLY ? ” I ’m done here .
Oh yeah , and you 'll want to download my book .
Positives and Negatives
It is an order placed with a broker to buy or sell once the stock reaches a certain price .
A stop loss is designed to limit an investor 's loss on a security position .
Setting a stop loss order for 10 % below the price at which you bought the stock will limit your loss to 10 % .
For example , let 's say you just purchased XYZ at $ 50 per share .
Right after buying the stock you enter a stop loss market order for $ 45 .
This means that if the stock falls below $ 45 per share your shares will then be sold at the prevailing market price .
The advantage of a stop order is you do n't have to monitor on a daily basis how a security is performing .
This is especially handy when you are on vacation or having a full time job that prevents you from watching your security for an extended period of time .
The disadvantage is that the stop price could be activated by a short - term fluctuation in a securities price .
The key is picking a stop - loss percentage that allows a security to fluctuate day - to - day while preventing as much downside risk as possible .
Setting a 5 % stop - loss on a security that has a history of fluctuating 10 % or more is not the best strategy : you will most likely just lose money on the commissions generated from the execution of your stop - loss orders .
There are no hard and fast rules for the level at which stops should be placed .
This totally depends on your individual investing style : an active trader might use 5 % while a long term investor might choose 15 % or more .
Another thing to keep in mind is that once your stop price is reached , your stop order is a market order , the price at which you sell may be much different from the stop price .
This is especially true in a fast - moving market where stock prices can change rapidly .
Not just for Preventing Losses Stop loss orders are traditionally thought of as a way to prevent losses .
( After all , it 's called a " stop loss " for a reason . )
Another use of this tool , though , is to lock - in profits , in which case it is sometimes referred to as a trailing stop .
In all forms of long - term investing and short - term trading , deciding the appropriate time to exit a position is just as important as , if not more important than , determining the best time to enter into your position .
Buying ( or selling , in the case of a short position ) is a relatively less emotional action than selling ( or buying , in the case of a short position ) .
When you enter a position , the potential for realized profits is but a dream and the possibility of losses is only a vaguely considered nightmare .
By contrast , when it comes time to exit the position your profits are staring you directly in the face , but perhaps they are telling you that there is potential for even greater profitability if you were just to ride the tide and exercise a little bit more patience .
In the unthinkable case of paper losses , your heart tells you to hold tight , to wait until your losses reverse and the passage of time brings you into a profitable position once again .
But such emotional responses are hardly the best means by which to make your selling ( or buying ) decisions .
They are purely unscientific , and the presence of emotion brings you as far from a disciplined trading system as can be imagined .
It 's starting to look like it may actually have been a good thing that Pat Buchanan spouted off so nakedly about Sonia Sotmayor this week -- not so much that he did it , but that in doing so , he 's finally provoked a serious response to the meaning of his ongoing presence in our national discourse .
People are finally starting to ask the question I asked back in 2006 :
How much longer , one has to wonder , will our mainstream press continue to pretend that Pat Buchanan has not gone completely around the bend ?
That he is no longer the avuncular conservative from old episodes of Crossfire but a full - fledged extremist trying to resurrect the once - discredited ethos of white supremacism ?
The evidence was more than abundantly clear back then , with the publication of his book State of Emergency , which was a vehicle for essentially a regurgitation of warmed - over eugenics theory from the 1920s .
Buchanan was all over TV as well , spouting nonstop the fear that white people were losing their majority and with it their political power , swept away by a tide of brown people from Latin America .
Alexander Zaitchik 's report for the SPLC hit the nail on the head :
To put it plainly , State of Emergency is a white nationalist tract .
The thesis is that America must retain a white majority to survive as a nation .
It is rooted in a blood - and - soil nationalism more blood than soil .
The echoes of Nazi ideology are clear and chilling .
As Buchanan helpfully explained to John King , who was interviewing him in one of his several CNN appearances : " We gotta get into race and ethnic questions . "
Indeed , Buchanan has a not - inconsiderable role in the history of white nationalism in America in the past 20 years -- particularly the role he has had in mainstreaming supremacist beliefs , many of which are either fallacious or crudely racist .
Leonard Zeskind devotes a sizable chunk of his marvelous history of the movement , Blood and Politics : The History of the White Nationalist Movement from the Margins to the Mainstream , to dealing with Buchanan and his sizable impact .
After all , he 's been at this a long time .
In a columm he wrote back in 1989 defending David Duke and chiding the GOP for overreacting to him , he counseled movement conservatives thus :
" Take a hard look at Duke 's portfolio of winning issues and expropriate those not in conflict with GOP principles , [ such as ] reverse discrimination against white folks . "
( syndicated column , 2/25/89 )
At the time , Duke had just finished running for president on the Populist Party ticket .
His chief platform position in that campaign : stopping immigration before Latin Americans overwhelm the country .
A couple of years later , Buchanan tried to claim that Duke was copying him , but it 's clear from the chronology that it worked the other way around .
The good thing about the attention Buchanan has brought on himself is that it may finally shine a spotlight on the persistent and malignant influence of white nationalism on our national discourse and our body politic .
Looking as we are at pan-racial , multicultural future , our success is going to hinge on our abilities to find ways to break down the old racial barriers that were erected by white supremacists -- whose worldview was dominant in the USA for decades -- a century ago and more .
And as Pat Buchanan has been demonstrating , they will only go kicking and screaming .
A skeptical theme that crops up very frequently is the fact that there is a huge disconnect between popular beliefs and the findings of science .
There is a tendency for people to overestimate their own knowledge even when they have no basis for their confidence ( even skeptics – we all do this ) .
Often this amounts to just making up answers because they feel right and then assuming they are correct .
We all do this – believers and skeptics alike .
This is the default mode of human thinking .
It takes discipline to insert the critical thinking filter – “ is this really true ?
what does the evidence actually say ? ”
The specific topic at hand is attitudes toward so - called complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM ) – how popular is it , and what is the basis for its popularity ?
I have dealt before with the former question .
Here ’s the summary : most surveys that site huge numbers of people using CAM are grossly inflating the numbers by including things such as exercise , prayer , or taking a multivitamin .
I exercise , so by some measures I am a CAM user .
This , of course , reflects the confusion caused by the dubious category of CAM itself – it is a pseudo - category , containing a wide variety of modalities , some mutually exclusive , with very fuzzy boundaries .
It is more meaningful to consider individual claims and practices , and to use somewhat tighter categories ( such as energy - medicine ) .
If we consider the “ hard - core ” CAM practices – like homeopathy , acupuncture , and energy medicine – we find that their use is still in the tiny minority – single digits .
And these numbers are not significantly changing over time .
The popularity of CAM is overblown .
The other question ( actually two questions ) is also interesting – who is using CAM and why ?
As evidenced by my many discussions on the topic and comments left on my blogs ( and others ) , the most common answer is some variation of “ I guess people must be dissatisfied with mainstream medicine . ”
In a blog post for SBM this week , in fact , a commenter noted :
I suspect that the reason many people turn to CAM is because they feel that the medical practice they have experienced is n’t that good .
This is not an unreasonable assumption , but like many reasonable assumptions it turns out to be wrong .
There have been many surveys and a common theme among them is that most people who use CAM do so because it was in line with their philosophy .
The classic study is this one , a 1998 survey published in JAMA .
It concludes :
Along with being more educated and reporting poorer health status , the majority of alternative medicine users appear to be doing so not so much as a result of being dissatisfied with conventional medicine but largely because they find these health care alternatives to be more congruent with their own values , beliefs , and philosophical orientations toward health and life .
People who use CAM have disposable income ( which makes sense as most CAM is paid for out of pocket ) , which itself correlates with older age and more education .
CAM use also correlates with having some chronic medical complaints , which also makes sense and happens to be true .
Surveys also show that the most common CAM modalities ( if you do n’t include prayer and exercise ) are for musculoskeletal complaints – massage , manipulation , yoga , and relaxation .
So if we put this all together the profile of the average CAM user is a middle - aged or older adult with cash on hand who is having the typical aches and pains of that stage of life and is looking for a touchy - feely therapy that fits their overall world view .
Of course , this is just the typical user , and the numbers also include other profiles , but they seem to be in the minority .
The profile we worry about the most are those with a serious life - threatening illness who are drawn to a hard - core CAM modality by desperation or the alure of false hope .
There is now a new survery , this one Flemish , adding another wrinkle to the data on who is using CAM and why .
This survey of Flemish adults was about belief , and not necessarily use .
They asked the typical questions , but also surveyed belief in the paranormal .
The study concludes :
Support of CAM was very prevalent in this Flemish adult population .
CAM beliefs were strongly associated with paranormal beliefs .
They also confirmed an associated with older age , which again is likely explained by disposable income .
Belief in the paranormal and age were the only factors that predicted positive attitudes toward CAM .
There was a positive relationship also with level of education and the social desirability of CAM , but these factors were not strongly enough correlated to be predictive .
I admit that this result is highly satisfying , and fits well with not only previous data but my personal biases .
A world - view that includes belief in magic and the supernatural accords well with many of the claims made within the broad CAM umbrella .
This may also reflect a poor understanding of or respect for science .
While paranormal belief was the strongest correlate of belief in CAM in this survey , this and other data also reflect that attitudes toward CAM is a complex and multifarious cultural and social phenomenon .
It may be dominated by the worried and wonky well , but there are many other types mixed in as well .
Equal Opportunity at JAOO Aarhus 2009
There are not enough women in the IT industry , and almost none of them rise to senior management level .
The women in the IT company Trifork A/S want to change that .
When Trifork A/S for the 13th time welcomes participants to JAOO Aarhus , female software developers , project managers , IT architects etc. get free access to one of the 3 conference days .
A part of the conference programme will be targeted towards those few women who are in the IT industry .
" Women are forgotten by everyone in the IT industry - including ourselves .
Men are able to use each other in networks for jobs and promotions .
We need tolearn something from the men " said Aino Vonge Corry , who has a Ph.D degree in computer science and is on the JAOO Conference Program Committee .
Aino Vonge Corry is one of the initiators of the Women 's Day at the JAOO Conference , an initiative that she , and indeed the whole of Trifork A/S , expects a lot from .
Up to 1,200 IT people will be participating in JAOO Aarhus this October .
The preliminary forecast shows that only 3.7 percent of the participants this year will be women .
Last year the number was 5 percent .
Neither of the two figures are acceptable to Trifork A/S. " This year we are inviting women to JAOO to let them meet some of the charismatic IT women we have as speakers at the JAOO Conference .
We hope this will encourage the industry 's females to want more , to demand more .
We are just as talented as men .
We are just not good enough at making men aware of it .
In the longer term , our initiative will result in a real IT network for all of us women " , says Aino Vonge Corry .
The women 's initiative has full backup from Trifork 's management .
As far as equality is concerned , Trifork A/S is neither worse nor better than others .
" We have no female developers in our company and only one woman has found her way to senior management .
It is unfortunate , because women give a totally different dynamic in a skill like ours " , says Kresten Krab Thorup , technical director of Trifork A/S .
" The idea behind the JAOO Conference is to inspire participants and give them the energy to go out and learn something more about software development .
I think it is a good idea to do something extra to motivate women " .
Rules for Free tickets
Our intention is to let women in for free one single day at JAOO Aarhus , but according to danish law that is to discriminate .
Therefore the rules are as follows : •
Any paying attendee ( regardless of sex ) can bring one person of the opposite sex for free .
• The free tickets are one - day tickets , valid for one of monday , tuesday or wednesday .

In an attempt to clarify an apparent gaffe made a few weeks ago to California media stating that “ marijuana is dangerous and has no medicinal value ” , drug czar Gil Kerlikowske in a new interview with his hometown media in Seattle has only slightly , almost imperceptibly , modified his remarks by now implying that somehow how ‘ smoked ‘ medical cannabis is not a legitimate and effective drug delivery method :
When asked about his comments a few weeks ago Kerlikowske told KOMO news “ I certainly said that legalization is not in the president ’s vocabulary nor is it in mine .
But the other question was in reference to smoked marijuana .
And as we know , the FDA has not determined that smoked marijuana has a value , and this is clearly a medical question that should be answered by the medical community . ”
KOMO also reports :
Kerlikowske ’s stand on legalizing marijuana for everyone is more clear - cut .
The Office of National Drug Control Policy , by law , actively works against legalizing drugs .
Kerlikowske takes on last jab at cannabis by continuing his predecessor ’s proclivity to mislead the media and public by claiming “ You know from the University of Washington , the number one call from young people for treatment here , after alcohol , is marijuana .
So I ’m not seeing the benefit to society with legalization here . ”
Number one , cannabis is not legal in Washington state , or anywhere in the US , 2 ) youth in Washington , and all around the US , after being ensnared by the hundreds of thousands per year by cannabis prohibition laws enforced by the criminal justice system ( or university police ) , are provided with the Hobson ’s Choice of either going to jail or so - called ‘ treatment ’ .
Mr. Kerlikowske should cease employing this rhetorical straw man as he is intelligent enough to know its inaccuracy , but continues to adopt the failed rhetoric of prior hardliner drug czars Gen. Barry McCaffrey and John Walters , who consistently made the same claims during their tenure , and lost credibility every time they continued to propound such obviously misleading propaganda .
Kerlikowske ’s latest unfortunate remarks affirm cannabis law reformers have much work left to do !
Maybe our good drug czar should call actor Patrick Swayze and ask him ‘ if he is benefiting from smoked medical cannabis ? ’
Patrick Swayze , who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer over a year ago , is using medical marijuana to relieve the pain of his last days of chemotherapy .
According to a family insider , Swayze , 56 , has found that smoking marijuana helps with his nausea , inability to sleep , and anxiety .
The insider noted on the actor ’s slight weight gain as well as adding that he ( Swayze ) feels more “ normal than he has in months . ”
Pictures have surfaced of Swayze out with his brother Donnie looking much healthier than he had weeks before .
“ Patrick was rapidly losing weight because he could n’t keep good down .
He was so weak , he needed help getting around , ” the source told the magazine .
“ Marijuana works extremely well for many cancer patients .
It helps fight nausea from chemotherapy treatments and may alleviate anorexia or loss of appetite , ” Dr. Ron Kennedy of Santa Rosa , CA , said of the situation .

What is Atanua ?
The Atanua UI
Atanua is a real - time logic simulator , designed to help in learning of basic boolean logic and electronics .
It uses OpenGL hardware - accelerated rendering and a custom UI designed for a fast workflow and a very low learning curve , letting the students concentrate on learning the subject instead of spending time learning the tool .
See the interactive flash demo !
See the Atanua Google + page !
Discuss on Google + Atanua User community !
The Atanua UI consists of basically three parts :
the component list the work area buttons for some useful functions , like saving and loading
Simple example - SR latch , two implementations
As a simple example , the image on the left shows the implementation of a SR - latch using two NOR gates , as well as a SR - latch logic block , and both are connected to a couple of input buttons ( bound to keyboard keys 1 and 2 ) and output LEDs .
Editing wires
This example can be replicated by simply dragging the needed components from the component list to the work area , and connecting the parts with lines .
The simulation is already running at a steady 1kHz .
To split a wire ( for those 90 ' angles ) , simply drag at the middle of a wire .
If you make mistakes , Control - Z is the undo .
The 4 signal states
You can scroll around the work area by simply dragging it .
You can also zoom in and out using the mouse wheel , or with keypad '+ ' and ' - '.
Escape and right mouse button cancel actions .
Wire colors show the state of the connection .
Gray wire means there 's no signal input .
Red means there 's more than one signal input , or something else is wrong .
Bright green is signal high .
Dark green is signal low .
Another example
This is a slightly more complicated example - 7 - segment driver , counter chip , and test buttons for everything - nothing really special , but enough to show that Atanua can also be used for nontrivial circuits .
Helpful tooltips
Join the Army , where you can edit all that you can edit .
In July , in a sharp break from tradition , the Army began encouraging its personnel  from the privates to the generals  to go online and collaboratively rewrite seven of the field manuals that give instructions on all aspects of Army life .
The program uses the same software behind the online encyclopedia Wikipedia and could potentially lead to hundreds of Army guides being “ wikified . ”
The goal , say the officers behind the effort , is to tap more experience and advice from battle - tested soldiers rather than relying on the specialists within the Army ’s array of colleges and research centers who have traditionally written the manuals .
“ For a couple hundred years , the Army has been writing doctrine in a particular way , and for a couple months , we have been doing it online in this wiki , ” said Col. Charles J. Burnett , the director of the Army ’s Battle Command Knowledge System .
“ The only ones who could write doctrine were the select few .
Now , imagine the challenge in accepting that anybody can go on the wiki and make a change  that is a big challenge , culturally . ”
In recent years , collaborative projects like the Firefox Internet browser or Wikipedia pages have flourished with the growth of the Internet , showing the power of thousands of contributors pulling together .
I hate to be constantly beating a dead browser , but news about Internet Explorer 8 keeps coming up , kind of like a day - old fish taco at Earl 's House of Chowder .
It seems Microsoft will stop at nothing to get people to try IE8 .
First , they published a " get the facts " comparison chart showing how -- surprise ! -- IE8 bests Firefox and Chrome in virtually every way .
( Note : Whenever anyone from Microsoft says " get the facts , " the first thing you should get is your hip boots and waders , because it 's going to pile up deep and fast . )
I 'm still scratching my head over the " Performance " blurb in that chart :
Knowing the top speed of a car does n't tell you how fast you can drive in rush hour .
To actually see the difference in page loads between all three browsers , you need slow - motion video .
This one 's also a tie .
Right .
If anyone out there can explain that one to me , please send me a note .
[ Cringely is n't joking , either -- Microsoft 's IE8 " get the facts " campaign does get it wrong .
|
For the real facts , check out IE8 vs. Firefox 3.5 : The browser wars continue . ]
But that 's not all .
They 're dangling $ 10 K cash prizes to Aussies willing to go spelunking down undah using only their browser .
They 've offered to donate eight ( count 'em , eight ) meals to a food bank for every download of IE8 .
And they 've launched a series of " funny " video ads starring Superman - turned - pitchman Dean Cain .
This is where things get dicey .
As first noted by The Technologizer 's Harry McCracken ( and quickly followed up by virtually everybody else with a blog ) , there 's one ad in particular that 's gotten a fair amount of attention .
It involves an ordinary looking housewife who borrows her husband 's laptop , looks at his browser history , and suddenly starts spewing projectile vomit all over the kitchen in full living technicolor , like Ozzy Osbourne after three days of nothing but beer and bat heads .
The pitch ?
If only he'd been using IE8's InPrivate browsing feature , dear old wifey would never know the dark evil puke - inducing Web sites he'd been visiting .
( What exactly was hubby looking at that so fully engaged the gossamer - thin gag reflex of his loving wife ?
I have one guess , and it's four words long :
Two girls , one cup .
Google that , if you dare .
But do n't blame me if you toss your cookies after . )
After a lot virtual retching across the blogosphere , Microsoft pulled the ad .
( If you must watch it , a copy is still available on YouTube as I write this . )
No matter ; it achieved its purpose .
People are talking about it .
For Microsoft , that qualifies as victory .
The weird part is that this ad , along with the others , is / was part of the Browser for the Better food bank campaign .
So is Microsoft bringing food to America 's hungry , or just food poisoning ?
From these various moves one could easily draw the conclusion that IE8 is for the gullible , the greedy , the charitably inclined , and the easily gagged .
Another obvious conclusion : Microsoft must be pretty damned worried about losing more ground to Firefox , Chrome , and any other browser that wanders down the road -- worried enough to gross out half the Web with an ad even the most adolescent of dot coms would not have dared run .
The question is why ?
If the destination is what matters , why does Microsoft care so deeply what browser people use to get there ?
Maybe this : Unless Bing is the browser 's default search engine , no one will go there after the novelty wears off .
That 's probably enough to make anyone at Microsoft lose their lunch .
What 's up , chuck ?
Who or what turns your stomach ?

I ’m a strong supporter of universal health insurance , and a fan of the Obama administration .
But I ’m appalled by the deal the White House has made with the pharmaceutical industry ’s lobbying arm to buy their support .
Last week , after being reported in the Los Angeles Times , the White House confirmed it has promised Big Pharma that any healthcare legislation will bar the government from using its huge purchasing power to negotiate lower drug prices .
That ’s basically the same deal George W. Bush struck in getting the Medicare drug benefit , and it ’s proven a bonanza for the drug industry .
A continuation will be an even larger bonanza , given all the Boomers who will be enrolling in Medicare over the next decade .
And it will be a gold mine if the deal extends to Medicaid , which will be expanded under most versions of the healthcare bills now emerging from Congress , and to any public option that might be included .
( We do n’t know how far the deal extends beyond Medicare because its details have n’t been made public . )
Let me remind you :
Any bonanza for the drug industry means higher health - care costs for the rest of us , which is one reason why critics of the emerging healthcare plans , including the Congressional Budget Office , are so worried about their failure to adequately stem future healthcare costs .
To be sure , as part of its deal with the White House , Big Pharma apparently has promised to cut future drug costs by $ 80 billion .
But neither the industry nor the White House nor any congressional committee has announced exactly where the $ 80 billion in savings will show up nor how this portion of the deal will be enforced .
In any event , you can bet that the bonanza Big Pharma will reap far exceeds $ 80 billion .
Otherwise , why would it have agreed ?
In return , Big Pharma is n’t just supporting universal health care .
It ’s also spending a lots of money on TV and radio advertising in support .
Sunday ’s New York Times reports that Big Pharma has budgeted $ 150 million for TV ads promoting universal health insurance , starting this August ( that ’s more money than John McCain spent on TV advertising in last year ’s presidential campaign ) , after having already spent a bundle through advocacy groups like Healthy Economies Now and Families USA .
I want universal health insurance .
And having had a front - row seat in 1994 when Big Pharma and the rest of the health - industry complex went to battle against it , I can tell you first hand how big and effective the onslaught can be .
So I appreciate Big Pharma ’s support this time around , and I like it that the industry is doing the reverse of what it did last time , and airing ads to persuade the public of the rightness of the White House ’s effort .
But I also care about democracy , and the deal between Big Pharma and the White House frankly worries me .
It ’s bad enough when industry lobbyists extract concessions from members of Congress , which happens all the time .
But when an industry gets secret concessions out of the White House in return for a promise to lend the industry ’s support to a key piece of legislation , we ’re in big trouble .
That ’s called extortion :
An industry is using its capacity to threaten or prevent legislation as a means of altering that legislation for its own benefit .
And it ’s doing so at the highest reaches of our government , in the office of the President .
When the industry support comes with an industry - sponsored ad campaign in favor of that legislation , the threat to democracy is even greater .
Citizens end up paying for advertisements designed to persuade them that the legislation is in their interest .
In this case , those payments come in the form of drug prices that will be higher than otherwise , stretching years into the future .
I do n’t want to be puritanical about all this .
Politics is a rough game in which means and ends often get mixed and melded .
Perhaps the White House deal with Big Pharma is a necessary step to get anything resembling universal health insurance .
But if that ’s the case , our democracy is in terrible shape .
How soon until big industries and their Washington lobbyists have become so politically powerful that secret WhiteHouse - industry deals like this are prerequisites to any important legislation ?
When will it become standard practice that such deals come with hundreds of millions of dollars of industry - sponsored TV advertising designed to persuade the public that the legislation is in the public ’s interest ?
( Any Democrats and progressives who might be reading this should ask themselves how they ’ll feel when a Republican White House cuts such deals to advance its own legislative priorities . )
We ’re on a precarious road — and wherever it leads , it ’s not toward democracy .

Yesterday WNYC , New York 's public radio station , laid off four staffers and eliminated 11 unfilled positions .
As we speak , it 's begging for donations with its spring pledge drive .
So why does CEO Laura Walker make nearly $ 500,000 a year ?
According to WNYC 's most recent tax returns , Walker , who has been running WNYC for a decade , made $ 486,688 in annual compensation and benefits as of June 2007 .
By way of comparison , that 's $ 222,000 more than the next highest - paid person at the station .
Half a million dollars is n't an absurd amount of money to be paying someone to run a huge major market radio station .
But it 's $ 60,000 more than Kenneth Stern , the CEO and highest - paid employee of National Public Radio — the far larger radio network that supplies WNYC with much of its content — made in 2007 , according to NPR 's most recent tax return .
Stern , who left NPR last year , was responsible for 656 employees making more than $ 50,000 a year .
[ Note :
This has been corrected to reflect the fact that Stern is no longer the CEO of NPR . ]
Walker is responsible for 95 .
She makes twice the salary of the highest - paid staffer at Public Radio International , NPR 's main competitor .
We asked WNYC 's spokeswoman why Walker 's salary is so high , and so out of whack with the rest of the station 's salary structure , at a time when the nonprofit is shedding jobs and staffers .
We also asked her if Walker had taken a pay cut since June 2007 .
She said she needed time to find an answer .
Along with the cuts revealed yesterday , WNYC also announced an across - the - board 5 % salary reduction for senior staffers , which would bring down Walker 's compensation to roughly $ 462,000 .
But given the huge spread between her salary and that of the rest of the senior staff , one would hope that she took a bigger hit .
Just remember where the money is going the next time WNYC begs you to support the important work that they 're doing .
Sri Lanka and India seek to patch up relations
By Wije Dias
4 June 2009
Relations between Sri Lanka and India were strained in the last months of the Sri Lankan military ’s offensive against the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , in which thousands of civilians were killed .
The army ’s final drive coincided with Indian general elections in which politicians , with an eye to Tamil voters in southern India , postured as defenders of the civilians in northern Sri Lanka .
With the election finished and the last pocket of LTTE resistance eliminated , the two governments are seeking to patch up relations .
In a calculated move last week , India supported a Sri Lankan resolution at the UN Human Rights Council ( UNHRC ) that endorsed the Colombo government ’s brutal war and sanctioned its internment of 300,000 Tamil civilians in squalid detention centres .
The resolution , which was adopted , was aimed at countering a move by European powers , backed by the US , for an investigation into human rights violations and war crimes in Sri Lanka .
Sri Lankan Human Rights Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe , who was at the UNHRC special session , later announced that India had agreed to donate $ US300 million to the Sri Lankan government to be used in rehabilitation work .
“ What Western country would do that ? ” he exclaimed .
Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse is scheduled to visit New Delhi this week in his first foreign trip since declaring victory over the LTTE .
Speaking to the media last week , Rajapakse was effusive about closer relations with India .
“ A new age of ties will begin between the two nations .
India my neighbour and best friend , ” he said , adding that he would also like to meet political leaders of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu .
India ’s decision to back the UNHRC resolution did not represent any fundamental shift .
The Congress - led coalition government in New Delhi has quietly supported Rajapakse ’s war throughout the past three years .
India was the first country to ban the LTTE after the assassination of former Congress prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 .
The LTTE ’s declared aim of establishing a separate Tamil state was seen by the Indian elite as a dangerous destabilising factor that only encouraged separatist movements in India itself .
At the same time , the Indian government was constrained by the widespread popular opposition to the Sri Lankan war , particularly in Tamil Nadu .
However , that did not stop New Delhi from helping to train Sri Lankan military personnel , supplying radar equipment with technicians to track the LTTE ’s light aircraft and reportedly providing intelligence to assist in the sinking of the LTTE ’s supply ships — all in the name of “ non-offensive ” aid .
The LTTE ’s resistance rapidly collapsed after the army captured its administrative centre of Killinochchi in early January .
The LTTE fighters , together with more than 250,000 civilians , were driven into a narrow strip of territory on the north east coast .
Despite its claims to the contrary , the Sri Lankan military had no compunction in using heavy artillery and aerial bombardment to pound the enclave , killing civilians and provoking international outrage .
In India , parties and politicians who had been largely silent on the Sri Lankan war suddenly began to compete with each other in the election campaign to posture as ardent defenders of the Sri Lankan Tamils .
In Tamil Nadu , Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi pressed the central government in New Delhi to force the Sri Lankan government to halt its military offensive , but to no avail .
Karunanidhi ’s party , the Dravida Munnettra Kazhagam , is a member of the ruling national coalition .
The Indian government maintained its precarious balancing act on the Sri Lankan war until polling was over on May 13 .
Rajapakse announced victory over the LTTE on May 19 , as Indian election results were flowing in , which guaranteed a majority to the Congress - led coalition .
Two days later , on May 21 , two top Indian officials , Foreign Secretary Shiv Shankar Menon and chief defence advisor N. K. Narayanan , flew to Colombo for closed - door discussions with Rajapakse .
The Indian External Affairs Ministry stated : “ Both sides agreed that , with the end of the military operations in Sri Lanka , the time was opportune to focus attention on issues of relief , rehabilitation , resettlement and reconciliation , including a permanent political settlement in Sri Lanka . ”
In plain language , New Delhi was expressing its readiness to resume business as usual .
The rapid rapprochement exposes the utter hypocrisy of the Indian political establishment , including in Tamil Nadu , which at opportune moments shed crocodile tears in public about the suffering of Sri Lankan Tamils .
A week later India cast its vote in the UNHRC special session in favour of the Sri Lankan resolution sanctioning the government ’s criminal war .
The speed with which both sides moved is also a sign of the strategic and economic interests at stake .
New Delhi has been particularly concerned that rivals Pakistan and China have strengthened their influence in Colombo at India ’s expense .
Unlike India , China and Pakistan were not constrained by domestic political considerations from selling arms to the Sri Lankan military .
China not only provided military assistance , but financial support and diplomatic assistance in blocking discussion of the Sri Lankan war in the UN Security Council .
In return , Beijing was given offshore oil exploration rights and the contract to build and maintain a port at Hambantota in the south of the island , adjacent to China ’s vital trade routes to the Middle East and Africa .
India was deeply concerned at China ’s growing influence in what it regarded as its sphere of influence .
External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee told the Indian parliament last October : “ In our anxiety [ over the Sri Lankan war refugees ] , we should not forget the strategic importance of that island and it is not only their security , it is closely connected with our security ....
Surely we would not like to have the playground of international players at our backyard . ”
Indian corporations are also looking to Sri Lanka for business opportunities .
The state - owned Indian Oil Corporation ( IOC ) announced last week that it intended to expand its operations on the island .
Lanka IOC , which already operates 150 retail outlets , has applied to the government for approval of another 300 over the next five years .
India ’s $ 300 million rehabilitation package is designed to provide more openings for Indian business , particularly to exploit cheap labour in the devastated North and East of the island .
For its part , the Sri Lankan government is looking for all the political and economic support that it can get .
The economy is weighed down with huge debts from high military spending and confronts a pressing balance of payments crisis .
At the same time , its major exports have been hard hit by the global recession .
Sri Lankan corporate leaders are keen to press ahead with long - held plans for closer integration with India ’s still growing economy .
India has long provided vital political support to the Sri Lankan government .
It backed Colombo in 1971 when the Sri Lankan security forces crushed an armed uprising of rural youth in the south of the island , killing an estimated 20,000 .
New Delhi also came to the rescue of Sri Lanka in 1987 , by signing the Indo - Sri Lanka Accord and sending Indian troops to occupy the north of the island and suppress the expanding separatist insurrection .
Speaking in Singapore last week , Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama told the Hindu that India was “ an important partner ” .
He indicated that the Rajapakse government was looking for Indian support in imposing its “ political solution ” to the war on the Tamil minority .
“ India has been always a part of the home - grown process [ in Sri Lanka ] ... New Delhi has respected the local formulation of proposals in Sri Lanka , ” he said .
The discussion of a “ political solution ” exposes the fact that the 26 - year civil war in Sri Lanka was not a “ war on terrorism ” but the outcome of decades of anti-Tamil discrimination by successive Colombo governments .
While prepared to make cosmetic concessions to the Tamil elites , President Rajapakse has no intention of altering the Sinhala supremacist character of the Sri Lankan constitution and state apparatus .
The task of pushing through his “ political solution ” would be easier with India ’s assistance .
Rajapakse , however , has whipped up a climate of Sinhala triumphalism in Colombo in the wake of the army ’s victory over the LTTE .
Throughout the three years of war , he has depended heavily on the support of Sinhala extremist parties , including the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna , Jathika Hela Urumaya and the National Freedom Front .
These parties , not to speak of the Sinhala chauvinists in Rajapakse ’s own party , are vehemently opposed to concessions to the Tamil minority and regard India as an insidious patron of Tamil rights .
The initial overtures between India and Sri Lanka are part of a far broader strategic scramble for influence in Colombo , not only by India and China , but also the US , Japan and the European powers .
Far from the war ending communal conflict on the island , this rivalry is likely to inflame tensions as each of the major powers exploits political divisions to advance their own economic and strategic ambitions .
NATALYA ESTEMIROVA is gone now .
Her executioners forced her into a car in front of her home in Chechnya and sped away with her on Wednesday morning .
She managed to shout that she was being kidnapped , her last known words documenting the beginning of the crimes against her , just as she had documented crimes against uncountable others .
Her killers worked quickly , as if on orders .
They drove to a remote place , shot her and left her near the road , killing her in exactly the manner her friends had long feared would be her fate .
Her purse was nearby .
Her killers did not want it .
This crime was about something else .
Ms. Estemirova was an essential member of a tiny circle of the premier human rights investigators in the entire Caucasus  a woman of immeasurable courage , precision and calm .
She was a researcher for Memorial , the human rights organization , in Grozny , Chechnya ’s capital .
I will step out of character as a reporter and declare it : she was both a trusted source and friend of the last several years , a time when the foreigners still trying to understand Chechnya shrank to an inadequate few .
AIR FORCE ACADEMY , Colo . ( AP ) 
The Air Force Academy says 84 cadets are being kept in isolation after showing symptoms of an undetermined respiratory illness .
Academy spokeswoman Capt . Corinna Jones told The Gazette in Colorado Springs Thursday that most of the cadets are " doolies " , members of the incoming freshman class who began rigorous training on June 25 .
She said the cadets under isolation began developing symptoms like coughing within the past two days .
The academy has contacted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Air Force Surgeon General 's office .

I remember reading H. P. Lovecraft for the first time when I was in The Marine Corp .
I was 21 or 22 and I was on Okinawa living in a squad bay right next to the Ocean .
It kept me up at night and gave me some weird dreams but I still read every Lovecraft book the base library had .
To : doc30
Ah , that brings back memories .
It 's been years since I read Lovecraft , but he was always great fun . # 59 : " I do n't have to outrun him , I just have to outrun you " may work with bears , but the Great Old Ones have much larger stomachs .

Good stuff ...
Lovecraft is one of my favorite authors .
The local libraries have none of his stuff , but that ’s where the wonderful phrases ‘ public domain ’ and ‘ free ebooks ’ come in =)

I got involved in reading HP Lovecraft in high school , but I had to give it up .
I began having nightmares , and it really effected me .
I have n't read anything by him since ( about 28 years ) Mark

It scared me too .
Try drawing some of the creatures , they are so illogical in form it is impossible to stay scared .
The stories DO still scare me , but the terror ends after the last line .
Lovecraft ’s weirdness is more easily comprehended when you put it into the context of the Victorian period , out of which he came : the racism and xenophobia of that time were internalized by him and came out as the Cthulhu Mythos .

Much as George Allen ’s “ macaca ” comment made apparent , in his own words , just what a racist thug and bully Allen really was , the Washington Post reported today about a thesis McDonnell himself wrote in 1989 while a student at Pat Robertson ’s Regent Law School , expressing his extreme and frankly nutty social views , on the role of women in society and attitudes toward homosexuality .
Most frighteningly , McDonnell not only laid out a plan in this thesis for imposing these views on unwitting citizens , but apparently McDonnell has been pursuing this plan through a public career spanning 14 years in Virginia ’s General Assembly and four as its Attorney General .
According to the WaPo :
Robert F. McDonnell submitted a master 's thesis to the evangelical school he was attending in Virginia Beach in 1989 in which he described working women and feminists as " detrimental " to the family .
He said government policy should favor married couples over " cohabitators , homosexuals or fornicators . "
He described as " illogical " a 1972 Supreme Court decision legalizing the use of contraception by unmarried couples .
The 93 - page document , which is publicly available at the Regent University library , culminates with a 15 - point action plan that McDonnell said the Republican Party should follow to protect American families -- a vision that he started to put into action soon after he was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates .
During his 14 years in the General Assembly , McDonnell pursued at least 10 of the policy goals he laid out in that research paper , including abortion restrictions , covenant marriage , school vouchers and tax policies to favor his view of the traditional family .
In 2001 , he voted against a resolution in support of ending wage discrimination between men and women . [ snip ]
He argued for covenant marriage , a legally distinct type of marriage intended to make it more difficult to obtain a divorce .
He advocated character education programs in public schools to teach " traditional Judeo - Christian values " and other principles that he thought many youths were not learning in their homes .
He called for less government encroachment on parental authority , for example , redefining child abuse to " exclude parental spanking . "
He lamented the " purging of religious influence " from public schools .
And he criticized federal tax credits for childcare expenditures because they encouraged women to enter the workforce .
" Further expenditures would be used to subsidize a dynamic new trend of working women and feminists that is ultimately detrimental to the family by entrenching status - quo of nonparental primary nurture of children , " he wrote .
He went on to say feminism is among the " real enemies of the traditional family . "
Even leaving aside the shock and revulsion resulting from the idea that an ostensibly intelligent person could actually believe crap like this in this day and age , the revelation of this thesis , combined with the apparent evidence that McDonnell has been actively seeking to implement these policies over the course of his career , could have a profound effect on the election .
McDonnell has been trying to recast himself , with some success , as a moderate in this election .
Democrats have been pointing out that he is , in fact , an extreme Conservative , citing such facts as McDonnel 's almost total opposition to legalized abortion .
He would outlaw it in all cases except saving the life of the mother , even those involving rape and incest .
As a legislator in the Virginia General Assembly for 14 years , McDonnell introduced some 35 different bills seeking to restrict a woman ’s right to choose and control her own body .
McDonnell also has a long record of hostility toward gay people , including blocking the appointment of a judge in Newport News because she was allegedly gay , and as attorney general pursuing several legal strategies that amounted to justifying discrimination .
So far in the campaign , McDonnell has refused to discuss these issues .
When asked about them , he simply changes the subject .
And given the partisan nature of charges and counter charges , Democrats have made only limited advances in revealing the true Bob McDonnell to Virginia 's voters .
But , of course , like Allen before him , no one could say it better or prove it more conclusively than Bob himself .
Right off the bat , this should have the following consequences favoring Creigh :
I. McDonnell will , somehow , have to explain his BCPs ( Batshit Crazy Positions ) .
Given the nature of some of the views he expressed in this thesis , McDonnell will have to convincingly explain not only how he could hold such offensive opinions , but also what he has been doing apparently implementing this plan .
Good luck .
I expect every attempt to explain will just lead to a slew of new questions .
II .
McDonnell will finally have to answer questions about his record on social issues , which puts him on the horns of a dilemma .
Some Conservatives in the Commonwealth have been upset at McDonnell ’s refusal to discuss and defend his conservative social views so far in the campaign .
As another arch - Conservative and McDonnell supporter , Bob Marshall , put it to the Post , " If you duck something , that tells your opponents that you think your position is a liability , why else would n't you acknowledge it ?
But I 'll tell you , I 've got precinct captains who are annoyed that he 's not answering these questions . ”
Therein lies the core of McDonnell ’s problem and the rationale behind his campaign strategy of cultivating a moderate image .
Virginia is not totally Blue – yet -- but it is as Purple as could be , and McDonnell ’s Neanderthal - like opinions will not play well .
This is the reason McDonnell has studiously avoided talking about social issues – he is seriously out of step .
If he answers questions about social issues truthfully , it will satisfy his base , which is as nuts as he is , but the Virginia moderates McDonnell needs will be turned off .
But if he disavows his Fundamentalist philosophy , he will most certainly tick - off his base and rekindle simmering conflicts with the Virginia Republican Party .
III .
This could help energize Virginia Democrats , and demoralize Republicans .
There has been an enthusiasm gap here in Virginia .
Without going into detail , between general elections and primaries , Democrats in the Old Dominion have been involved in non-stop , hard - nosed campaigning in highly consequential elections for almost three years .
Many are simply exhausted .
Furthermore , some Progressives in the state are not enthusiastic about some of Creigh ’s more moderate policy positions .
Republicans , on the other hand , have unified around McDonnell , and early poll leads , combined with a perception that Creigh ’s campaign has been disorganized , have left Conservatives enthusiastic and confident .
This could be the proverbial game changer .
This news has been flying around the Virginia blogosphere all day .
I have lost count of the number of Retweets .
Progressive websites around the state have been doing further research and analysis , uncovering more damaging revelations ( See this post from Blue Virginia on McDonnell 's mentors for an example ) .
Judging by the early reactions of some Conservative blogs , on the other hand , they seem a little shell - shocked .
For example , a post on one , Bearing Drift , argued in McDonnell ’s defense that Jim Webb wrote some bad stuff about women also , and anyway , criticizing McDonnell ’s thesis is religious bigotry .
That is about as lame as it gets .
Finally , for Virginia ’s low information voters , this kind of story , and the hubbub around it , can bring home on a visceral level that there are serious issues at stake in this election , and that Bob McDonnell is waaaaaaay out of the mainstream .
Bob , in case I forget later , let me thank you now for a gift that I predict will keep on giving for some time to come .
Tedder wrote both Halo for Beyonce and Already Gone for Kelly Clarkson One Republic singer Ryan Tedder has said claims he penned the same song for both Beyonce and Kelly Clarkson are " hurtful and absurd " .
The songwriter was responding after Clarkson claimed her new single Already Gone was built on the same backing track as Beyonce 's Halo .
Tedder said the tracks were " entirely different songs conceptually , melodically and lyrically " .
He added he " would never try to dupe an artist " into recording the same track .
Clarkson criticised Tedder in an interview with Canada 's CBC
News saying she was unaware of the similarities until she heard the songs together , adding the former Destiny 's Child star 's album was released as Clarkson 's was in production .

' Ripped off ' " No - one 's going to be sitting at home , thinking ' Man , Ryan Tedder gave Beyonce and Kelly the same track to write to , ' " she said .
" No , they 're just going to be saying I ripped someone off .
I called Ryan and said , ' I do n't understand .
Why would you do that ? ' "
Clarkson said she " fought and fought " to try to prevent her record company Sony Music from releasing the single out of respect , but it was still being released " without my consent " .
In response , Tedder said in a statement : " Already Gone is one of the best songs I 've written or produced since [ Leona Lewis ' ]

University of Utah scientists developed a new kind of " molecular condom " to protect women from AIDS in Africa and other impoverished areas .
Before sex , women would insert a vaginal gel that turns semisolid in the presence of semen , trapping AIDS virus particles in a microscopic mesh so they can't infect vaginal cells .
" The first step in the complicated process of HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ) infection in a woman is the virus diffusing from semen to vaginal tissue .
We want to stop that first step , " says Patrick Kiser , an associate professor of bioengineering at the University of Utah 's College of Engineering .
" We have created the first vaginal gel designed to prevent movement of the AIDS virus .
This is unique .
There 's nothing like it . "
" We did it to develop technologies that can enable women to protect themselves against HIV without approval of their partner , " he adds .
" This is important – particularly in resource - poor areas of the world like sub-Sahara Africa and south Asia where , in some age groups , as many as 60 percent of women already are infected with HIV .
In these places , women often are not empowered to force their partners to wear a condom . "
A study testing the behavior of the new gel and showing how it traps AIDS - causing HIV particles will be published online later this week in the journal Advanced Functional Materials .
Kiser is the senior author .
" Due to cultural and socioeconomic factors , women often are unable to negotiate the use of protection with their partner , " says Julie Jay , the study 's first author and a University of Utah doctoral candidate in pharmaceutics and pharmaceutical chemistry .
So the researchers developed a vaginal gel that a woman could insert a few hours before sex and " could detect the presence of semen and provide a protective barrier between the vaginal tissue and HIV , " Jay says .
" We wanted to build a gel that would stop HIV from interacting with vaginal tissue . "
Kiser estimates that if all goes well , human tests of the gel would start in three to five years , and the gel would reach the market in several more years .
He and Jay want to incorporate an antiviral drug into the gel so it both blocks HIV movement and prevents the virus from replicating .

A Rocky Road to Microbicides against AIDS
The effort to develop microbicides – intravaginal gels , rings and films – to prevent transmission of the AIDS virus has been halting .
The few that have reached human clinical trials in Africa failed to prevent HIV transmission – either because they carried antiviral drugs that were not long - lived or strong enough , or because patients failed to use them .
Some experimental microbicides increased the risk , possibly by irritating vaginal tissue and attracting immune cells that are targeted by the virus .
In 2006 , Kiser and colleagues published a study on their development of another " molecular condom " to be applied vaginally as a liquid , turn into a gel coating at body temperature , then , in the presence of semen , turn liquid and release an anti-HIV drug .
Unfortunately , few antiviral drugs bind to and attack HIV in semen .
And in Africa , high air temperatures prevent the gel from turning liquid so it could coat the vagina evenly , Kiser says .
The new " molecular condom " gel in the current study works in the opposite way .
Like the old version , it changes in response to changes in pH – acidity or alkalinity – in the vagina caused by the introduction of semen during sex .
But unlike the old gel , which became liquid at the higher ( less acidic ) pH of semen , the new " molecular condom " becomes a semisolid at the pH of semen , forming a mesh of " crosslinked " molecules .
advertisement
The new gel is applied as a gel , and then becomes more solid and impenetrable as changes in pH alter the strength of the bond between the gel's two key components , both of which are polymers , or long , chain - like molecules made of many smaller , repeating units : PBA , or phenylboronic acid , and SHA , or salicylhydroxamic acid .
Slowing and Blocking the AIDS Virus
Kiser 's team first published a study about the invention of the polymers and their behavior in 2007 .
A patent is pending on the invention .
The chemical bonds between the two polymers constantly attach and detach at normal , acidic vaginal pHs of about 4.8 , allowing the gel to flow , Kiser says .
But at a pH of 7.6 – the slightly alkaline condition when semen enters the vagina – the PBA and SHA polymers " crosslink " and stick tightly together , he adds .
Part of the new study characterized the flow of the gel .
" It flows at a vaginal pH , and the flow becomes slower and slower as pH increases , and it begins to act more solid at the pH of semen , " Jay says .
HIV moves slowly within the gel , even when the gel is at lower pHs ( higher acidity ) and still flowing , but the virus is blocked at higher pHs caused by the entry of semen into the vagina .
The crosslinked polymers form a mesh that is smaller than microscopic , and instead is nanoscopic – on the scale of atoms and molecules – with a mesh size of a mere 30 to 50 nanometers – or 30 to 50 billionths of a meter .
( A meter is about 39 inches . )
By comparison , an HIV particle is about 100 nanometers wide , sperm measure about 5 to 10 microns ( 5,000 to 10,000 nanometers ) in cross section , and the width of a human hair is roughly 100 microns ( 100,000 nanometers ) .
Kiser says the gel should block other viruses and sperm , thus could work as a contraceptive and possibly prevent infection by herpes viruses and human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , a major cause of cervical cancer .
The gel also could help prevent AIDS by blocking movement of immune system cells that try to combat infectious agents but instead get hijacked by the AIDS virus .
During the study , coauthors from Northwestern University in Chicago used a sophisticated microscope to track how fast HIV particles marked with fluorescent dye moved when they were caught in the gel , and how the speed varied with changes in pH .
The researchers compared movement of HIV particles with latex particles , which revealed that under somewhat acidic conditions , the HIV particles are slowed down in part because their surfaces react chemically with the polymers .
By adding an anti-AIDS drug such as tenofovir to the gel , " the virus would have two barriers to get through : the polymer barrier and then the drug barrier , " Kiser says .
Unlike an antiviral used with the old gel , tenofovir would not attack HIV directly , but protect immune cells in the vagina from infection .
Kiser says that after sex , the vagina gradually becomes acidic again , and any residual HIV particles would be inactivated both by acidity and an antiviral drug within the remaining gel , which still impedes HIV to some extent at normal vaginal acidity .
Kiser and Jay conducted the study with four other University of Utah researchers : bioengineering undergraduates Kristofer Langheinrich and Melissa Hanson , bioengineering graduate student Todd Johnson , and bioengineering researcher Meredith Clark .
Other coauthors were from the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago : Thomas Hope , Shetha Shukair and Gianguido Cianci .
The study was funded by National Institutes of Health .
Kiser 's research team is continuing the effort to develop microbicides to prevent AIDS thanks to a $ 100,000 grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
Upcoming work includes assessing the HIV - prevention potential of other polymers , testing the safety of the new gel on vaginal cells , and studying how well the new gel blocks the transport of HIV into samples of human vaginal and penile tissue from hysterectomies and circumcisions , respectively .

T H A N K S !
I learned of science fiction and history in a single season .
History I found in the basement of an old brick house I happened to pass each day , on my way to elementary school , in a small town in Virginia .
This house stood vacant , but was in too conspicuous a state of repair to seem haunted , and had never interested me .
One afternoon , though , I noted that workmen had arrived , and that some sort of renovation was being prepared for .
Squeezing in past a sheet of plywood , I explored a series of cold , empty rooms .
One of these ( my heart beat faster ) contained a damp old trunk .
Having worked up the nerve to open it , I found only a few faded lithographs ( as I now imagine they were ) of airplanes .
But these were airplanes unlike any I had seen , and they held my attention in a peculiar way .
They were old , clearly of some other era , but exciting , and somehow frightening as well .
Squatting there , staring at them , I felt as though some enormous wedge of information was being driven into my head .
Various bits and pieces of half - knowledge were coming together , forming some new and utterly unexpected whole .
I already knew , as if by osmosis , that there had been a war , though I did n't know when , or with whom .
I had been raised , so far , by adults who sometimes spoke of " the war " as some previous time or era or world , but I had somehow never associated that with other , more vague ideas of some past and general conflict .
I had read comic books about war , and played with military toys , but had never considered how those might fit into some way the world had actually been .
I had found World War II , in that trunk .
I had discovered history , or it me , and I would never be the same .
Science fiction , then , I found on various wire racks , one of them offering a 15 - cent copy of the Classics Illustrated version of The Time Machine — which must have led me , just as its publishers claimed to have intended it to , to Wells 's text .
When George Pal 's film version was released , in 1960 , I already felt , though secretly , that The Time Machine was mine , part of a personal and growing collection of alternate universes , and that no one else in the theater really got it .
Even more secretly , I had filled a Blue Horse lined notebook with elaborate pencil sketches for my own , actual , working time machine .
It looked , I recall , rather more like the machine in the Classics Illustrated version than the one in George Pal 's film .
The Classics Illustrated time machine resembled a model of the atom , but I had imagined this , for my own purposes , as geared in some achingly complex spheres - within - spheres way that I could never quite envision in operation , but which would somehow allow it to move in three dimensions at once .
That , I imagined , just might do the trick .
I suspected , without admitting it to myself , that time - travel might be a magic on the order of being able to kiss one 's own elbow ( which had seemed , initially , to be quite theoretically possible ) but I was determined not to admit it .
The possibility was too delicious to relinquish .
Although I now think that I had no specific time - travel adventures in mind , no head - scratching paradoxes to be explored .
I do n't remember dreaming of exploring the past of the world around me , or of journeying to its future .
What I wanted was to attain the world of The Time Machine , the Morlocks ' garden .
Wells 's Victorian future nightmare had become a favorite fantasyland , for me .
Because it existed so far up the timeline as to be beyond history , and history , once acknowledged , had quickly become a sort of nightmare , one from which there seemed to be no escape .
History , I was learning , there at the start of the nineteen - sixties , never stops happening .
I had become an involuntary sponge for modern history , after my discoveries of World War II and science fiction .
Much of the science fiction I was reading , American fiction of the nineteen - forties and fifties , had already become history of a sort , requiring an acquired filter for anachronism .
I studied the patent Future History timeline Robert Heinlein appended to each of his novels and noted where it began to digress from history as I was coming to know it .
I filtered indigestible bits of anachronistic gristle out of this older science fiction , reverse - engineering a model of the real past through a growing understanding of what these authors had gotten wrong .
In another trunk , in my own family attic , I had unearthed World War I .
A much more substantial trove , this one : rolled memorial scrolls bearing the names of the hometown dead , and the lightly rusted and altogether astonishing mass of a Colt Model 1911 automatic pistol .
I watched the CBS documentary series Twentieth Century on Sunday nights , moved by the eminently sane Midwestern voice of Walter Cronkite , as he narrated aspects of the unimaginably complex and peculiar historical reality in which I was learning that I lived .
I learned about D - Day , the concentration camps , the atomic bomb , and the Cold War .
With these last two , Cronkite 's restrained narration met my growing and secret terror at where history and science ( or history as science fiction ? ) seemed almost certainly to be taking us .
And now , walking to school , past the house where I had discovered World War II , I passed the Post Office , newly marked with metal signs bearing the black - and - yellow Civil Defense symbol used to indicate fallout shelters .
Sirens were tested regularly , along with something called " the system " , and the dial of my first transistor radio was marked , twice , with that same symbol , indicating the two frequencies set aside for Civil Defense .
Freed by Wells and his literary descendants to roam , in my imagination , up and down the timeline , I had stumbled upon World War III , and the end of civilization .
Wells had discovered the end of civilization long before me .
It must have seemed that it kept coming back throughout his life to oppress him , the vision of cataclysm and systemic collapse , fuelled by some basic immaturity of the species — to bring an end , at least temporarily , to modern history and technological progress .
He must have expected it constantly , through World Wars I and II .
He would have been terribly aware of it looming again , in the years immediately before his death , with the military use of atomic energy an established fact .
In 1905 he had imagined it arriving with the military use of aerial bombs against civilian targets , but then he would see Zeppelins bomb London , and after that the Blitz , and then the advent of the German rocket - bombs .
In The Time Machine , wars are a thing of the immemorial past , something necessarily transcended on the way to some safer , more rational basis for society .
None of which mattered to me as I cringed my way through the heating up of the Cold War , expecting any moment the wailing of the sirens that would call us all into the basement of the Post Office .
The television dramatization of Pat Frank 's Alas , Babylon , a popular novel set in a small Florida town in the immediate aftermath of nuclear war , had sealed my fate .
Something akin to Sartre 's dictum that hell is other people was dawning on me , and part of the cloud of constant secret terror I inhabited was some conviction that my neighbors , confined in what I imagined as the stifling darkness of a Civil Defense fallout shelter , would prove to be my own personal Morlocks .
The appeal of The Time Machine for me , then , become one purely of escape .
I longed for Wells 's ellipsis , the long blur forward , " night follow ( ing ) day like the flapping of a black wing . "
I longed to find myself on the far side of whatever terrible , inevitable history was about to happen .
I saw , with utmost clarity , the World War II howitzers , on the town 's courthouse lawn , dusted with the falling detritus of Chicago , and the sky above glowing with a new and deadly clarity .
I did n't understand that Wells himself had written a more thorough end to humanity , in The Time Machine , than any I imagined descending on America as I knew it .
The perversely enjoyable melancholy that pervades the garden of the Eloi emanates not from the hidden underworld of the Morlocks , nor from their grisly symbiosis with their former masters , but from the exquisite and utterly deliberate job of world - wrecking Wells has performed for us .
Writers before and after Wells have enjoyed the heady pleasures of reducing the great monuments of their day to imaginary ruin , but few have attained the degree of symbolic elegance , nor the convincingly forlorn realism , of the Palace of Green Porcelain .
Here , in what once was Kensington , site of Wells 's scientific education and all of his early hope , everything Victorian civilization valued has long been ended , ruined not by war but by a devolution of the human species — brought about by the failure to recognize the eventual outcome of a disastrous course of affairs .
If Wells rejected socialism as a panacea , he also saw its diametric opposite as an inevitable road to ruin : " Ages ago , thousands of generations ago , man had thrust his brother man out of the ease and sunshine .
And now that brother was coming back — changed ! "
The Palace proves to be the ruin of a museum .
A single humble box of safety matches , preserved in an air - tight terrine , is the treasure the Time Traveler takes with him from that museum of man .
A last working token of technology : light and destruction both , in a palm - sized packet .
Matches , camphor , and a heavy lever broken from a nameless piece of machinery , to serve as club and pry-bar .
He leaves the museum with the tools of his early ancestors : fire and the club .
I had my own ancient tool of destruction , and taught myself , crouching in secret places , to disassemble it , my impossible , scary , secret provision from history .
I lightly oiled the parts and hid them separately , wrapped in rags .
This being Virginia in the early nineteen - sixties , I easily obtained a box of ammunition , alarmingly heavy finger - thick shells with bullets the color of a new copper penny .
I possessed the pistol , it seemed to me , much as the Time Traveler possessed his matches and his makeshift club , though far less purposefully .
He leaves the Palace of Green Porcelain with a plan , and I had no plan , only a global and unexpressed terror of impending nuclear war , and of the end of history , and the need to somehow feel in control of something .
Three years into my discovery of history , it was announced that Soviet ballistic missiles had been deployed in Cuba .
My encounter with history , I absolutely knew , was about to end then , and perhaps my species with it .
In his preface to the 1921 edition of The War in the Air , Wells wrote of World War I ( still able to call it , then , the Great War ) : " The great catastrophe marched upon us in daylight .
But everybody thought that somebody else would stop it before it really arrived .
Behind that great catastrophe march others today . "
In his preface to the 1941 edition , he could only add : " Again I ask the reader to note the warnings I gave in that year , twenty years ago .
Is there anything to add to that preface now ?
Nothing except my epitaph .
That , when the time comes , will manifestly have to be : ' I told you so .
You damned fools . '
( The italics are mine . ) "
The italics are indeed his : the terminally exasperated visionary , the technologically fluent Victorian who has watched the 20th Century arrive , with all of its astonishing baggage of change , and who has come to trust in the minds of the sort of men who ran British Rail .
They are the italics of the perpetually impatient and somehow perpetually unworldly futurist , seeing his model going terminally wrong in the hands of the less clever , the less evolved .
And they are with us today , those italics , though I 've long since learned to run shy of science fiction that employs them .
I suspect that I began to distrust that particular flavor of italics when the world did n't end in October of 1962 .
I can't recall the resolution of the Cuban missile crisis at all .
My anxiety , and the world 's , reached some absolute peak .
And then declined , history moving on , so much of it , and sometimes today the world of my own childhood strikes me as scarcely less remote than the world of Wells 's childhood , so much has changed in the meantime .
I may actually have begun to distrust science fiction , then , or rather to trust it differently , as my initial passion for it began to decline , around that time .
I found Henry Miller , then , and William Burroughs , Jack Kerouac and others , voices of another kind , and the science fiction I continued to read was that which somehow was resonant with those other voices , and where those voices seemed to be leading me .
And it may also have begun to dawn on me , around that same time , that history , though initially discovered in whatever soggy trunk or in whatever caliber , is a species of speculative fiction itself , prone to changing interpretation and further discoveries .
