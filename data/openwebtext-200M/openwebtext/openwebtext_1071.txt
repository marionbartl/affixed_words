Because the Joel Tenenbaum trial has n't been maddening enough , Engadget yesterday had a little item on how the RIAA is claiming that customers ought to just suck it up and accept that DRMed tracks will go poof even if they 've been paid for , since no other products or service providers are expected to " provide consumers with perpetual access to creative works . "
That 's interesting coming from a group that claims that alone of all industries , copyright holders somehow deserve to get paid in perpetuity for their output .
I guess forever looks a lot longer when it includes server - maintenance duties .
If anyone 's got a more enlightened response than " oy " to the Tenenbaum trial 's result , I 'm all ears .
I respect Professor Nesson 's legal acumen , and having fair use taken off the table just hours before the trial was probably not a setback from which any legal team could have recovered , but looking over the past year 's proceedings -- the defense 's push to make its processes open and transparent , the sustained effort to get the trial shown live on the Web , all that -- I wonder if we'd all have have been better off if both Tenenbaum , and Jammie Thomas before him , had simply rolled over .
No , I do not support the RIAA 's extortion racket .

I think the recording industry is a culture - gutting abomination , and that the entire outfit ought to be torched like Rome during a Nero violin recital .
Whatever figure the jury arrives at , the artists Mr. Tenenbaum loves will never see a cent of it ; after over a century of treating most artists like sharecroppers , " the industry " takes the droit de seigneur approach to windfall profit .
Music is so much more than the music industry , and for the sake of music -- the transmission of it , the longevity of the worthwhile stuff -- I hope the industry which treats one of humankind 's most powerful communication devices and repositories of memory like so much chattel withers and dies .
Now that distribution is a non-issue , A&R guys , vice - presidents of promotion , global distribution managers -- to all of the ranks that stand between us and the artists ...
Buh - bye , hope an honest day 's work happens to you someday .
The courtroom , however , is not a venue for accomplishing that goal , and I 've come to the conclusion that Joel Tenenbaum was ill - served by the attempt to make it otherwise .
It 's simply not built to do that .
The record - industry representatives insinuated during testimony that any desirable track was easily available online .
That 's a pantload , but unless Neeson 's team was prepared to prove it untrue , it 's testimony they could n't challenge .
( Had anyone asked , I 'd suggest trying to find the complete catalog of The Connells online as an exercise in how " easily available " stuff is , but hey . )
The courts are n't the place to conduct our battle against the music industry ; they 've got good lawyers while all we consumers have are good ears and good sense .
The legislative branch is perhaps our only remaining hope to fix the legal nightmare that copyright has become .
And yes , I am painfully aware that the US Congress is a clown college when it comes to parsing this stuff .
But we 've written ourselves , legally speaking , into a corner .
Even the most activist of judges is n't going to get us out , no matter how strong the moral appeal .
I am also painfully aware that file sharing is having a cultural effect not unlike Prohibition did back in the day .
Circumvention efforts lead to security holes ; disdain for one set of laws opens up disdain for others , and the public is forced to choose between seeming unethical ( for file - sharing ) and seeming stupid ( for believing what they 're told about file - sharing and handing over its cash ) .
Protip :
No one chooses to look stupid .
Result : Sharing will continue , and thrive , hamstringing potentially better delivery mechanisms ( in the way that bad money invariably drives out good ) and ensuring that journalists will always have stories to write about litigation that ruins some random music fan 's life .
The real leaders in this , ironically , are the world 's unacknowledged legislators -- that is , the poets , or in this cases the lyricists and musicians .
The musicians who choose to avoid the industry and sell directly to fans ; the artists who post tracks for download and set up fair means of ( again ) purchasing directly ; the radio stations that eschew RIAA - beholden music in favor of independent fare ; and most importantly every one of us who decides that there 's better stuff to listen to than whatever 's being shoved down the foie - gras - feeding - tube of Clear Channel / RIAA / music television / People magazine -- these are the forces of nature now .
Years ago I sat in on a panel of teenagers being queried about their downloading habits , and one of the boys said that he used to download but did n't much anymore , because he had everything he wanted and did n't think he 'd need anything else .
I smiled , because even the most backward adult usually finds at least an artist or two to like after 17 .
But I wonder sometimes how that worked out for him -- if he 's still downloading and exploring , or if he let his obvious fear of the power of the music industry undercut what should be a lifelong source of joy .
I hope he's out there taking advantage of good DRM - free services such as Lala , checking out tracks on the music blogs , and maybe directly sponsoring the next recording due out from a favorite artist or two .
Most of all I hope he's not letting a group of vampires calling itself the music industry take away from him enjoyment of music .
That 's what Professor Nesson was trying to explain to that Boston jury -- that the enjoyment of music is , or should be , bigger than this passing " industry " situation .
He did n't succeed .
That does n't mean he was wrong -- just that he was in the wrong place .
Let your geek flag fly .

Here is a conversation I had with an Aussie mate the other day :
Me : “ Do you have a nickel ? ”
Aussie Mate : “ A what ? ”
Me : “ A nickel ” .
Aussie Mate : “ A what ? ”
Me : “ Oh for god ’s sake .
A nickel !
You know – a five - cent piece ! ”
Aussie Mate : “ OH ! A five - cent piece ! ” ( hands over said currency )
Me : “ Why ?
What do you call five - cent pieces here in Australia ? ”
Aussie Mate : ( pause ) .
“ Um…five - cent pieces ” .
Of course .
I have to give Australians credit for their penchant for practicality .
But this in turn , sparked a comparison of our respective Canadian and Australian coins , and what they are called .
I realized , in turn , that we Canadians are a little …. well …loony .
Here is a breakdown of our respective coin denominations and names :
AUSTRALIA
Five - Cent Piece ( not shown here )
Ten -Cent Piece
Twenty - Cent Piece
Fifty - Cent Piece ( not shown here )
One Dollar Coin
Two Dollar Coin
And in the name of practicality , these coins are all named just what they are .
This leaves little to the imagination .
Canadians , on the other hand , like to confuse and befuddle :
CANADA
Penny – one - cent piece ( unlike Australia , we still have the penny )
Nickel – five - cent piece
Dime – ten -cent piece
Quarter – 25 - cent piece
Loonie ( yes , you read it right ) – dollar coin
Toonie ( no really , I ’m serious ) – two dollar coin
I remember when we introduced the dollar coin in Canada many years ago , there was a big deal made of what to name it , the process calling for national input and even votes .
Because of Canada ’s famous loon ( a gorgeous water bird with a captivating call ) , “ Loonie ” seemed to fit .
And due to a combination of our lack of imagination and unique sense of humour , it only made sense to call our ensuing two - dollar coin a Toonie .
Rick Mercer is a Canadian political satirist who did a series called “ Talking To Americans . ”
In it , he approached Americans ( usually in small towns in states that are far away from the Canadian border , and that have little to do with their northern neighbours ) , and tell them outlandish stories about Canada ( like that our parliament buildings are made of ice – because we do live in igloos after all – and that because of global warming our government is melting ) .
And more often than not , his interviewees actually believed the stories .
The one story they DIDN ’T believe ( and how can you blame them ) , is that we call our one - dollar coin a Loonie .
I love Canada .
How can you not ?
I mean , really .
After months of rumors that the Giants were poised to lock up quarterback Eli Manning for the long haul , it finally has happened .
According to Jay Glazer of FOX , Manning and the team are on the verge of agreeing to a six - year extension worth $ 97.5 million .
Glazer reports that the deal includes $ 35 million in guaranteed money .
Factoring in the $ 9.4 million in base salary that Manning already was due to earn in 2009 , the annual average of the seven - year , $ 106.9 million arrangement is $ 15.2 million .
Though Panthers defensive end Julius Peppers will earn more this season under his one - year franchise tender , Manning ’s contract represents the biggest multi-year average that any NFL player has received .
On the surface , Redskins defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth ’s seven - year , $ 100 million deal comes close , but the reality is that it ’s only ( only ? ) a four - year , $ 48 million package .
And the $ 102 million deal given last year to Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger covers eight seasons .
As our own Tom Curran pointed out last month , the Manning deal likely will be the first big - money domino to fall in an ongoing string of record - setting quarterback contracts .
Next up ?
Philip Rivers .
Then Tom Brady .
Then Eli ’s big brother , again .
UPDATE : Albert Breer of SportingNews.com confirms the numbers first reported by Glazer .
It ’s a seven - year , $ 106.9 million deal , with $ 35 million guaranteed .

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , like most mainstream economists , has an irrational fear of deflation — whether it is understood as falling prices or a contracting money supply .
I have coined the term " apoplithorismosphobia " for this psychological malady .
In contrast , average Americans love deflation whether it's at Wal - Mart , in the Cash for Clunkers program , or from the tax credit for first time home buyers .
Austrian economists love most forms of deflation too , and we think it is the ultimate cure for economic crises .
The Cash for Clunkers program has been a great success with the American people ; they are eagerly taking advantage of the opportunity to liberate taxpayer money by trading in their old clunker cars for new , fuel - efficient cars .
Given that the program was only $ 1 billion in scope , it 's remarkable how much positive publicity it has received .
Now that the original money is running out Congress is talking about expanding the program by $ 2 billion .
Who would n't want $ 4,500 in exchange for a $ 500 clunker ?
The Clunkers program is , in effect , price deflation for a big - ticket item in the family budget .
It has encouraged people to look for deals and buy new cars .
It has been a tonic for the hard - hit automobile industry and car dealers across the country .
Of course , there are inefficiencies , as in any government program .
Cash for Clunkers falls prey to Bastiat 's broken - window fallacy ; a few hundred thousand perfectly serviceable vehicles will be destroyed for no good reason .
It also skews expenditures towards cars and away from more valuable purchases .
The tax credit for first - time homeowners is another popular government program that acts like deflation on a large item in the family budget .
A two - income family with up to $ 150,000 in income who has not owned a home for the last three years can earn a tax credit of up to $ 8,000 on the purchase of an $ 80,000 house .
This is a liberation of taxpayer money , using it towards something that has value rather than merely giving it away to the corrupt friends of government .
" The key thing is that the price of producer goods has to fall faster and farther than consumer goods for the correction process to proceed . "
The tax credit for the price of a home is de facto deflation for home buyers .
It helps people who avoided buying overpriced homes with irrational mortgages during the housing bubble and who now want to take advantage of lower prices .
By artificially increasing demand , it also helps troubled homeowners to sell their homes .
Of course there are inefficiencies here as well .
The government program is encouraging home buying now , when prices could still go much lower .
The program is also encouraging people to take on debt , despite that taking on too much debt is at the heart of this economic crisis .
The housing bubble was the result of the Federal Reserve tricking people into housing malinvestments , and now the government is trying to use the tax code to trick them into more malinvestments .
The Cash for Clunkers program and the tax credit for first - time home buyers have been popular programs , with a marginally positive impact on the housing and automobile industries .
Nonetheless , they represent a proverbial drop in the multi-trillion dollar bucket known as stimulus and bailout .
They do not really solve the economic crisis .
However , they do provide a good illustration of how deflation addresses the crisis .
As malinvestments from the bubble are liquidated , the economy begins the correction process .
The value of the malinvestments plummets .
The values of loans backing these investments falls , and the money supply contracts as banks reduce lending .
The price of capital and labor falls , and entrepreneurs discover new profit opportunities to redeploy the capital and labor that had been misdirected by the Federal Reserve 's boom or bubble .
As the price of goods falls , potential consumers become actual buyers .
The key thing is that the price of producer goods has to fall faster and farther than consumer goods for the correction process to proceed .
If money and credit are deflating , the process will be faster .
If the Federal Reserve and other forms of government " stimulus " curtail the deflation of producer goods ( e.g. , by auto and financial bailouts ) , then the process will be slower and more painful .
Since deflation is the cure for the economic crisis , why is Ben Bernanke so afraid of it ?
Is his apoplithorismosphobia really just a psychological ailment ?
Is the collective of mainstream economics just misinformed or stupid ?
I do not know for sure , but when the situation is explained to an intelligent person , they usually suspect it involves some kind of political payoff for the bankers and the politicians .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
A fortnight ago a cow left David Blunkett with a black eye and cracked rib .
Now a vet walking her dogs has been trampled to death by cattle .
Why ?
Cow attacks are rare
With its limpid eyes and slow gait , the cow is generally a placid creature .
But once this gentle giant - typically weighing about 1,000 lb ( 450 kg ) - has a calf to protect , it 's best to steer clear .
Liz Crowsley , a vet , has been trampled to death by a herd of cattle while walking the Pennine Way with her two dogs .
And a fortnight ago , a cow left David Blunkett with a black eye and a cracked rib .
Also on a walking holiday , the former home secretary was accompanied by his guide dog Sadie .
In both cases , the cows are thought to have been trying to drive off the dogs in order to protect their young .
While such attacks are rare , Health and Safety Executive figures show that 18 people - excluding Ms Crowsley - have been killed and 481 injured by cows in the past eight years .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ?
aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines Spring and early summer are when cows feel most vulnerable to interlopers , but they can be spooked into reacting at any time of year , says Sharon Woods of the Ramblers ' Association .
" We hear of one or two incidents each week , but these do n't usually involve serious injuries . "
Farmers and vets on call - outs are also at risk .
Keep calm , carry on If you find yourself in a field of suddenly wary cattle , move away as carefully and quietly as possible , she says .
" Keep dogs close and on a leash - and if the cows charge , let go the leash .
The dog will outrun the cows and it will outrun you . "
Sadie escaped unscathed Because generally it is this four - legged threat the cows are trying to see off .
But the dog's owner may be caught up in the attack if the dog cannot run away and instead tries to hide behind its human .
While Mr Blunkett let go of Sadie and she shot off , he stumbled to the ground and the cow fell over too .
" She hit my side and broke my rib .
Had her full weight of around a tonne hit me , I 'd have been a gonner . "
Those without canine companions should follow similar advice : move away calmly , do not panic and make no sudden noises .
Chances are the cows will leave you alone once they establish that you pose no threat .
The National Farmers ' Union also recommends that walkers avoid crossing fields .
" Cows are quite docile animals , but can get nervous , " says Ms Woods .
And at five feet tall and weighing at least 1,000 pounds ( 450 kg ) , it would n't do to make a cow too nervous .

" Most scientists know that you do science in an incremental way and build on the work that came before you , but Professor Hoffman said it 's okay to start with a crazy idea first and then work back to the present to see how you can get there . "

Enlarge By Jewel Samad , AFP / Getty Images A new USA TODAY / Gallup Poll shows the public 's confidence is waning in President Obama 's ability to straighten out the troubled economy .
OVAL OFFICE APPROVAL OVAL OFFICE APPROVAL
The Gallup organization first started asking Americans how they approved of the job the president was doing in the 1940s .
Click on the image above to see how each president since then has fared in the approval poll , look at some news events that influenced public opinion and compare how approval ratings evolved for each president .
HOW OBAMA IS DOING HOW OBAMA IS DOING Percentage of Americans who approve of the way President Obama is handling : Source : USA TODAY / Gallup Poll of 1,006 adults July 17 - 19 ; margin of error : +/- 4 percentage points .
WASHINGTON  Qualms about President Obama 's stewardship of the economy are growing , a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll finds , as Americans become more pessimistic about when they predict the recession will end .
At six months in office , Obama 's 55 % approval rating puts him 10th among the 12 post - World War II presidents at this point in their tenures .
When he took office , he ranked seventh .
THE OVAL : Obama on health care " His ratings have certainly come back down to Earth in a very short time period , " Republican pollster Whit Ayres says .
White House adviser David Axelrod calls the " turbulence " predictable , given the nation 's economic woes and Obama 's ambitious agenda .
" People fundamentally like this president , and they believe he 's smart and capable and strong and trying to do the right thing , " Axelrod says .
The findings forecast the rough patch that probably is ahead for Obama if unemployment continues to increase , as the administration predicts .
Lower ratings could make it more difficult for him to prevail on his top legislative priority .
The president met with doctors and nurses at the Children 's National Medical Center on Monday as he pushed the House and Senate to pass health - care overhauls before leaving on their August recess .
Obama continues to be highly regarded personally .
Two - thirds see him as a strong and decisive leader and someone who understands the problems they face in their daily lives .
A majority says his administration " is creating a new spirit of idealism . "
However , there is a widening disconnect between Obama 's personal standing and support for the policies he advocates : • By 49 % - 47 % , those surveyed disapprove of how he is handling the economy , a turnaround from his 55 % - 42 % approval in May .
The steepest drop came from conservative and moderate Democrats .
• By 50 % - 44 % , they disapprove of how he is handling health care policy .
• A 59 % majority say his proposals call for too much government spending and 52 % say they call for too much expansion of government power .
•
Expectations of the economy 's turnaround are souring a bit .
In February , the average prediction for a recovery was 4.1 years ; now it 's 5.5 years .
•
The administration 's stimulus package is n't seen as a benefit by most whether viewed in the short term or the long term , in how it will impact the country or individuals .
Only a third think it will help their own family 's finances in the long run .
Obama " might make the policies more popular by being associated with him , " says historian H.W. Brands of the University of Texas - Austin .
" But it 's almost equally possible that it will make him less popular by linking him with those policies . "
The poll of 1,006 adults , taken Friday through Sunday by land line and cellphone , has a margin of error of +/– 4 percentage points .

Hurry though , the sale ends August 10th .
Nearly eight years of war in Afghanistan and six years in Iraq have left 4,000 troops killed in action , more than 34,000 wounded - and only six considered worthy of the nation ’s highest military award for battlefield valor .
For some veterans and members of Congress , that last number simply does n’t add up .
They question how so few Medals of Honor - all awarded posthumously - could be bestowed for two wars of such magnitude and duration .
Pentagon officials say the nature of war has changed .
Laser - guided missiles destroy enemy positions without putting soldiers in harm ’s way .
Insurgents deploy roadside bombs rather than engage in firefights they ’re certain to lose .
Yet , those explanations do n’t tell the whole story , said Rep. Duncan Hunter , California Republican .
Mr. Hunter sponsored legislation that directs the secretary of defense to review current trends in awarding the Medal of Honor to determine what ’s behind the low count .
The bill passed the House .
If Senate negotiators go along , Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates would have to report back by March 31 .
“ It seems like our collective standard for who gets the Medal of Honor has been raised , ” said Mr. Hunter , a first - term member of Congress who served in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ The basis of warfare is you ’ve got to take ground and then you ’ve got to hold it .
That takes people walking into houses , running up hills , killing bad guys and then staying there and rebuffing counterattacks , ” he added .
“ That ’s how warfare has always been no matter how many bombs you drop and how many Predators you have flying around . ”
Military officials said they welcome the opportunity to conduct an in - depth review of the award process .
Still , they dispute Mr. Hunter ’s theory .
“ Nominations go through no more or less scrutiny than in the past , ” Pentagon spokeswoman Eileen Lainez said .
“ The standard for the Medal of Honor is high , as one would expect for our nation ’s most prestigious military decoration . ”
AMVETS , a veteran ’s advocacy group , said it supports Mr. Hunter ’s efforts .
It held a banquet for Medal of Honor recipients in January , and the low number of medals there was a big topic of discussion , said Jay Agg , the group ’s communications director .
“ They have expressed concern about their dwindling numbers and they ’re wondering why there are so few Medals of Honor being awarded for current conflicts , ” Mr. Agg said .
The Medal of Honor has been awarded 3,467 times since the Civil War .
Almost half - 1,522 - were awarded in that conflict alone .
The next highest tally came from World War II - 464 .
In the Vietnam War , 244 were awarded .
To get the Medal of Honor , at least two eyewitnesses have to view a deed so outstanding that it clearly distinguishes gallantry above and beyond the call of duty .
No margin of doubt is allowed .
Nominations make their way through military channels until eventually they ’re approved at the highest levels of the Pentagon and then by the president .
Drew Dix , 64 , of Mimbres , N.M. , received the medal for actions taken during the Tet Offensive in Vietnam when he continually risked his life during a 56 - hour battle to rescue civilians .
He said he did n’t feel comfortable judging the current Medal of Honor process .
“ We ’ve trusted the military to fight this war , ” Mr. Dix said .
“ We ’ve got to trust the military in all aspects of it , including the awarding of medals . ”
Jack Jacobs , 64 , also received the award for actions taken in Vietnam when he returned again and again under intense fire to rescue wounded soldiers .
He said the Pentagon ’s explanation for the low Medal of Honor count is logical , but he would not rule out other factors because of the subjective nature of the award .
“ I ’m not a fan of single factor analysis , ” Mr. Jacobs said .
“ There are lots of reasons why things occur and that is only one of them .
Human attitudes also play a great role . ”
Mr. Jacobs , a military analysis at MSNBC , predicted the war in Afghanistan would involve more of the kind of close combat that leads to Medal of Honors being awarded .

Not satisfied with automated tickets for alleged traffic violations , Scottsdale - based American Traffic Solutions is boldly expanding their big - brother repertoire to go places never gone before : directly to your house .
Known for their unpopular red-light and speed cameras , ATS will be managing a “ litter enforcement program ” in Baton Rouge , Louisiana , according to WBRZ News 2 , the local ABC affiliate :
“ 15 workers are getting training on documenting blight with photographs and in generating warning letters and hearing notices to send to property owners . ”
In other words , “ photo yardwork ” ticketing has arrived and , like always , it ’s all about the money :
Violators face possible fines of $ 117 , plus $ 50 in court costs if they fail to correct the violation within 15 days of receiving a warning letter .
The new system also gives city - parish workers the right to clean up an uncooperative property owner ’s parcel and add the costs to the owner ’s annual tax bill .
Almost a quarter of the population within Baton Rouge city limits live in poverty , according to 2007 census data .
While $ 167 may sound steep for an automatically - generated ticket processed by a greedy , private company which received a large cash infusion from taxpayer - bailed - out Goldman Sachs , we hear that ATS might still be giving away some backpacks .
How generous .
Perhaps they can be boiled and eaten .

Matt Wuerker 2010 : Fight for fickle kids
Hate your cell phone provider ?
Change it .
Advertisement
Husband bothering you ?
Walk out .
Rabbi got you down ?
Switch religions .
Why not ?
These days , it seems like everyone else is throwing off the chains of the past , too .
Thanks to the Internet , proliferating consumer choices and a dramatic shift in American culture , voters and consumers are more impatient — and more fickle — than ever before .
They ’re less beholden to old attachments and more willing to make dramatic changes in lifestyle and preferences — whether that ’s for a cell phone provider , a spouse or even a religious preference .
It ’s a trend that some say fueled the rise of Barack Obama as a political force and one that , if he ’s not exquisitely careful , could undo him just as easily as it sped his dramatic ascent .
An emerging group of political practitioners and social scientists is examining the trend and finding that loyalty — at least the kind of loyalty that once kept consumers bound to products and voters bound to political parties — is rapidly becoming a thing of the past .
That has profound implications for the future :
As old attachments continue to fall away over the coming decades , American culture , politics and business will become ever more tumultuous as leaders and institutions try to stay ahead of an ever - quickening pace of change , chasing an increasingly fickle and mobile population .
Election cycles tend to be driven by hot demographic trends .
Think of George W. Bush ’s victory among soccer moms in 2000 and Rahm Emanuel ’s battle to win NASCAR dads in 2006 .
The 2010 election cycle may well be dominated by a fight for the “ fickle kids . ”
Democratic pollster Peter Hart offers up a raft of statistics to back up the trend — which is spreading beyond the young to every age group .
He says his polling shows that Americans over 65 are more willing to get a divorce today than ever before , even after a near lifetime of being married to the same person .
College students are more willing to transfer to a new school .
And , he said , more than 40 percent of Americans will change their religion at least once in their life — throwing off generations of core beliefs for something new and appealing .
All that , he said , can be deeply unsettling to his business and political clients , particularly because the speed with which consumers change their minds can be breathtaking .
Leaders get paid to build and maintain large followings for consumer brands and political ideas .
But how can you keep customers and voters who no longer want to be kept ?
For leaders ,
Hart said , the new reality is this : “ You can go from top to bottom and bottom to top much more quickly . ”
Just look at the hottest new trend in marriage : the 50 - year itch .
Linda Lea Viken is a 32 - year veteran divorce attorney in Rapid City , S.D.
She said she ’s seeing a dramatic uptick in the number of divorces among senior citizens .
“ I ’m doing divorces of 50 - year marriages , ” she said .
“ You want to say to yourself , ‘ You ’ve made it this far — are you kidding me ? ’ ”
She says the trend is driven by everything from longer life expectancies to the impact of Viagra on the sex lives of seniors .
But she also thinks it ’s a result of older people mimicking attitudes they ’re picking up from younger Americans .
“ We ’re becoming a little bit of a ‘ me first ’ society , ” she said .
“ It ’s becoming difficult to really understand what people want because it ’s what they want right now .
But tomorrow , they might want something else . ”
Stanford University political science professor Morris Fiorina is convinced that both political parties have n’t yet grasped the scale of the change that ’s happening in society .
Republicans , he said , made the mistake of assuming that the divisions they exploited in the 2000 - 2004 elections were much deeper and more durable than they actually were — and were shocked by vote swings in 2006 and 2008 that would have seemed inconceivable in 2004 .
Not to mention , he said , “ the emergence of Obama out of nowhere . ”
“ Obama benefited from the looser ties people have today , but the flip side is that he cannot count on the depth of support that a winning candidate might have had a generation ago , ” Fiorina said .
“ And , of course , if ties are looser , then change can occur faster than if the ties bind more tightly . ”
For Hollywood studios , velocity of public opinion undermines their ability to guarantee a big opening weekend for the next blockbuster .
Today , if a studio does n’t earn back 40 percent of the cost of a movie during its opening weekend , the film will most likely never turn a profit .
That ’s because public opinion forms on blogs , Facebook pages and Twitter feeds within hours of the first showings of the movie .
Potential moviegoers who loved the advertising campaign can be turned off in seconds as they find out their peers did n’t like the first screening .
Movie studios now live or die by that kind of instant buzz , said Pete Snyder , a former Republican political pollster and CEO of the Internet marketing firm New Media Strategies .
“ Gone are the days where millions in television and newspaper ad buys can guarantee a strong showing on opening weekend , ” Snyder said .
Customers ’ opinions are moving so fast , he said , that Internet word of mouth can make or break a movie even before it debuts .
One company that is renowned for its ability to thrive in a high - velocity world full of deeply fickle customers is Apple Inc .
After it introduced the iTunes online music store in 2003 , the Apple iPod music player became a monster hit that redefined the way Americans listened to music , and the company sold tens of millions of units .
Many companies would ride that kind of success for a decade or more .
But Apple launched the iPhone — a product that would chip away at iPod sales — in the summer of 2007 .
To stay ahead of the decision curve , Apple is deliberately destroying one of its iconic products .
As a result , Apple is one of the few companies thriving amid a global economic collapse , reporting a 15 percent increase in quarterly profit in the second quarter of 2009 , at a time when many companies are struggling to simply stay in business .
Sales of the iPhone , the company reported , are up 303 percent .
By contrast , iPod sales are down 11 percent .
The company expects sales of “ traditional MP3 players to decline over time as we cannibalize ourselves with the iPod Touch and the iPhone , ” said Apple chief financial officer Peter Oppenheimer .
Democratic political consultant Joe Trippi first saw the power of the fickle vote in 2004 , when he ran Howard Dean ’s presidential campaign .
Thanks to the Internet and a then - new group of social networking tools , Dean was able to quickly attract a national following as he campaigned for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination .
But as soon as Dean placed a disappointing third place in the Iowa caucuses in January of that year , Trippi said , the Dean followers deserted him almost as quickly as they ’d come .
“ It was like a nanosecond before they were out , ” Trippi said of Dean ’s followers .
“ A lot of people inside the campaign were shocked at how fast people moved by . ”
On the other side of the political spectrum , Tony Perkins , the head of the socially conservative activist group Family Research Council , said he sees an increasing restlessness in his own largely Christian political base , where people are more willing to abandon the loyalties of the past .
“ People who maybe grew up as a Baptist but now they ’re more comfortable in a Pentecostal church , ” Perkins said .
“ People are much less bonded to a denomination . ”
Anecdotally , that restlessness goes beyond the Christian faithful .
“ In our synagogue , we find a large number of Christians who are allowing their children to be brought up Jewish , ” said author Joel Kotkin , who studies social trends .
That would not have happened as recently as a decade ago .
“ Now , people go through phases in their spiritual lives ; [ they ’ll ] switch congregations because the pastor or the rabbi changes . ”
One of the beneficiaries of the willingness to consider new ideas is the Mormon church , which has seen its membership grow nearly 30 percent since 1998 , to more than 13 million today , reported a spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints .
All of this has dramatic implications for Obama , who may find over time that his legions of followers were easier to gather than they are to keep .
“ We see Democrats with quite a large lead in party affiliation , ” said Hart .
“ That used to be good for a generation — now it ’s good for an election cycle . ”
Hart comes to a bleak conclusion : “ Loyalty , ” he said , “ is something that is totally in the past . ”

Public libraries , a royal road to learning for all , are a quiet triumph of British civilisation .
Lesser nations find that borrowers do n't bring books back .
When Mrs Brown joined , libraries were libraries .
Philanthropists knew their value .
Andrew Carnegie , who declared that to die rich would be to die disgraced , built 660 public libraries in Britain .
John Passmore Edwards notched up only 24 , but gave books to dozens more .
In too many libraries now , for all their internet access and chatty surroundings , books are the missing element .
When borrowed , they do more than decorate a room .
I am constantly getting emails from men around the world asking for advice on women .
I thought I would share one of these emails with you because I think it is something you can learn from .
This email was written by a 26 year old man in London .
He totally has his outer game down pat and his actions should be able to get him most women he wants .
Pay attention to the negs he uses , because these are lines you may want to incorporate into your routine .
The one thing he does not have down is how to transition from outer game to a more substantial “ connecting ” with the girl he ’s persuing .
Without this connecting , your outer game will be wasted .
If you cannot transition from being the entertainer to being the man , then you will never truly be successful with women .
Below is his email to the Wing Girls , and my response follows .
Dear Wing Girls ,
It was a singles ’ social boat cruise , and the following are the events that happened with one of the cuties I am really interested in .
Need some opinion how to pick up the momentum .
Thursday Night :
It was a singles ’ social event , and I was moving around groups of women , busting on them and teasing some .
This particular cutie that caught my eye I approached by grabbing her by her arm and telling follow me .
She came along willingly .
Me :
Why were you avoiding me all night ?
Her : I was not , you were busy running around with other girls .
Me : Wait , are you single ?
Her : Yes , of course
Me :
You better be , otherwise I have to kick you off the boat !
Her :
Me : Are you a Good girl or a Nice girl ?
Her : Naughty but nice .
Me : Do you speak English ?
Her : Yes .
Me : Choose one then …good or nice ?
Her : Nice I guess ?
Me .
Do you know the difference ?
Her :
You tell me .
Me : Good Girl goes out , comes home and sleeps , a Nice Girl goes out ,
sleeps and comes home .
Her :
Me : Do you know the difference between a Good Secretary and a Nice Secretary ?
Her : No , go ahead .
Me : Good Secretary will say , “ Good morning , Sir , ” and a Nice Secretary
will say , “ It ’s morning , Sir . ”
Her :
Then we have a chat about where she is staying , her ethnic mix , and places
she has traveled .
She turns out to be Singaporean and British .
Then I say ,
“ I bet you suck at Thumb - wrestling ! ” Her : Bring it on .
Me : I do not play without a wager .
Her :
What is the wager ?
Me : Loser buys dinner .
Her : OK
Me : No Cheating !
Best out of 3 , GO !
We wrestle , and it ’s 1 – 1 .
Last round … I start to tickle her and wrestle / hug her .
It ’s good fun with some tension .
I lose on purpose cuz I tickled her .
I say ok , give me your number and we ’ll set something up .
We part .
The next hour , we exchange glances and I throw a few “ I ’m watching you ” and “ Stay out of trouble ” lines at her , at which she giggles ( most probably from a nice dosage of alcohol consumption . )
Friday : Cool off Saturday : Message her to check if she got home alive and ask for her email address .
She replies ok and gives me her email address .
Sunday Morning : Call and leave a message .
She calls back and we have a chat about setting a date , but we both have commitments .
She mentions briefly to touch base next weekend if we can do something together .
I say , “ Ok , we ’ll see . ” I then ask her what is she up to ?
It ’s almost noon , and why is she lazing like a pig ?
She giggle and says she has plans with some friends to watch Sex and the City .
Me : So which character best describes you ?
Her : I dunno , what do you think ?
Me : I think you are a Samantha in Charlotte disguise .
Her : Noooooo ,
No one likes to be her , its not nice .
Me : Are you judging her ?
You are even more evil .
Her : Nooo hahah etc .
Me : I gotta go , got training , will call and catch up .
I text her later telling her I had to cut her short cuz I was dealing with London traffic .
TOURIST .
Will call at night to catch up and have some stimulating conversations .
End with Charlotte and a wink .
Called her at 22:30 , went to her voice mail , I say , “ Ahh , playing hard to get ?
Cheeky !
Holla back ! ”
Not heard from her since .
Tuesday 11 PM , sent her a funny text : “ It ’s important to find a man who has money , a man who adores you , a man who is great in the sack .
It ’s also important that these 3 men should never meet !
How are you doing ? ”
Did not receive any reply .
Any opinion as to how I can pick my game up again ?
I will share my response a little later , but I wanted to use this email to show you an example of how many men can get carried away with too much outer game .
So carried away that they lose the girl .
Listen , I am the first one to admit I LOVE THE GAME !!
I love the banter , the butterflies , the negging , all of it .
It is fun , but only for a night , maybe two tops .
After that , I need something a little more substantial .
When I met Mystery at David DeAngelo ’s seminar , where we were both speaking , I can honestly say he captivated me .
He was able to pull me away from a crowd of people , talk with me for two hours , and keep me completely focused on him .
I understand how his game works , and it worked on me .
It worked on me because it was fun and exciting and it challenged me .
I did not feel madly in love with him , nor did I think we had a great connection , but I had an urge for him to like me , respect me and want me .
But once we had separated , I did not think of him again .
His magic only worked for a short period of time because I had nothing real to latch onto so that I could feel connected .
I was simply entertained .
I have many clients that have done several PUA programs .
These men have no problems engaging and approaching women , but after that they are helpless .
They do not know how to have real conversations , nor do they listen to women .
Basically they have learned to tap dance for women , and once the dance is over the women leave .
I am a big fan of programs like Mystery ’s because he teaches men to be comfortable in their own skins .
He shows them they can be that guy they have always wanted to be .
They are worthy and deserving of everything that others have .
I would recommend his material to any one of my clients .
But … where his program falls short is that it does not teach men what to do next .
It is hard to keep up banter .
It gets exhausting .
I am going to give you a straight and honest female perspective .
As a man , you have to give women a little more than just a moment of entertainment .
If your goal is to get a woman to sleep with you for an evening , then outer game works great !
Routines , magic tricks , anything that captures your audience and gets them excited will work perfectly .
But if you are looking to be with a woman for a longer period of time you will never succeed without showing a bit more substance .
This is what makes connecting with her possible , and without that , your outer game is useless .
Here is how I responded to the email above .
What I noticed from your email is that you need to STOP playing a game .
Games like this are good in the moment .
They are fun and entertaining and get a girl ’s heart racing , but once this moment or period in time has passed , reality sets in and girls realize what this behavior really means .
It means player , games , and sex with no phone call the next day .
Again , if you want to sleep with women , great tactic , but you need to move fast or the euphoric feeling will disappear .
If your goal is to date and have relationships , then you are totally using the wrong approach .
Not sure what you were trying to accomplish .
The routine you have described will totally get a girl back to your room if you take the right steps to lead her there .
Seeing that you took your time makes me think you were looking for something more .
One other key thing I noticed was the Sex and the City joke .
First , very impressed you knew the characters .
Second , no woman wants to be referred to as a Samantha by a man who is trying to sleep with her .
It makes her feel slutty and used .
It also makes her think that there is only one thing on that man ’s mind , and that makes her feel dirty .
Women want to be in control of their own sexuality and know that they are being respected .
Do not pigeon hole women by telling them who they are .
Let them tell you who they are .
You will get way more out a woman that way .
To save yourself from this comment , it would have been smart to send her better text that had more heart attached to it , more of the “ real ” you .
I think you would have gotten a response .
What I try to teach to all of my clients is that balance is so important .
Outer game is fun and exciting , and most women , especially the great ones , will engage in it .
But every outer game needs to have some substance behind it .
It ’s all about connecting , because once you run out of outer game , you need to make sure you have something left .
Thank you for contacting The Wing Girl Method .
I will show you how important it is to have balance in the way you present yourself to women .
Outer game is fun , exciting and most women , especially the great ones , will engage in it .
But behind every show of outer game needs to be something of substance .
Something a woman can hold onto that makes her feel that there is more to “ this ” male than games , banter and playfulness .

Amazon Apologizes for Their Secret Cutting
Amazon has formally apologized to customers for deleting ebooks from people 's Kindles " This is an apology for the way we previously handled illegally sold copies of 1984 and other novels on Kindle .
Our " solution " to the problem was stupid , thoughtless , and painfully out of line with our principles .
It is wholly self - inflicted , and we deserve the criticism we 've received .
We will use the scar tissue from this painful mistake to help make better decisions going forward , ones that match our mission .
With deep apology to our customers , Jeff BezosFounder & CEOAmazon.com
" It 's an interesting apology , the sort of apology that a " secret cutter " would make .
They will learn from the scar tissue of their self - inflicted wounds and they promise not to do it again .
They deserve the pain and shame , but they are glad they can still feel ALIVE .
They just needed to feel something real .
Anything at all .
God , do n't you understand ?
I do understand .
But I do n't think Amazon is going to stop cutting books and delisting content until they recognize they have a problem and start getting the help they need .
So here is some advice for Amazon from " kidshealth.org , " taken from an article called " How Can I Stop Cutting ? "
" For people who cut , doing something different may be a big change .
Making this change can take time because you are learning new ways of dealing with the things that led you to cut .
The tips you 'll see below can get you started .
But a therapist or counselor can do more to help you heal old hurt and use your strengths to cope with life 's struggles .
" Start by being aware of which situations are likely to trigger your urge to cut .
Make a commitment that this time you will not follow the urge , but will do something else instead .
Some people cut because the emotions that they feel seem way too powerful and painful to handle .
Often , it may be hard for them to recognize these emotions for what they are Ã ¢ÂÂ " like anger , sadness , or other feelings .
Here are some alternatives to cutting that you can try :* draw or scribble designs on paper using a red pen or paint on white paper Ã ¢ÂÂ " if it helps , make the paint drip * write out your hurt , anger , or pain using a pen and paper * draw the pain * compose songs or poetry to express what you 're feeling * listen to music that talks about how you feel " Cutting can be a difficult pattern to break .
But it is possible .
If you want help overcoming a self - injury habit and you 're having trouble finding anything that works for you , talk with a therapist .
Getting professional help to overcome the problem does n't mean that someone is weak or crazy .
Therapists and counselors are trained to help people discover inner strengths that help them heal .
These inner strengths can then be used to cope with life 's problems in a healthy way .
"
DON'T BOTTLE UP THE PAIN , AMAZON !
EXPRESS YOURSELF !
IF IT HELPS , MAKE THE PAINT DRIP !
It 's probably a good thing that Amazon has taken a recent interest in shoes by buying the company Zappos for a billion dollars .
Amazon needs new hobbies .
They need to feel young and pretty again .
One interesting result of this apology is that since Bezos posted the apology using his " real name " Amazon account , we can see what he 's been reviewing Evidently , he really likes these cookies ( five stars ) : " This is an assortment of carefully wrapped cookies .
They claim to ship only hours after the baking is done , and the taste would certainly indicate that that 's true .
I 'm not exactly sure how many different cookie types there are in the box since I ( and my co-workers ) started eating before I started counting .
But somewhere around eight or more different types .
The snickerdoodles were the best I 've ever had .
Ridiculously good cookies .
" And he really hates the movie " The 13th Warrior " ( 1 star : " one star is indeed too many " ) : " Let 's face facts .
This is a terrible , terrible movie .
We have to guess that all involved in this project are hiding .
Really , I 'm generally quite easy on movies , but this endless stream of uninteresting battle scenes with pointless dialogue and no discernable plot is perhaps one of the worst movies ever made .
Sorry if this seems harsh , but I just do n't want anyone to buy it unknowingly .
" So there you go .
Next time you feel the need to de-list all your books about gays and sex , eat some cookies instead .
And the next time you feel the need to delete ebooks from the Kindles of your customers while they sleep , remember how mad Antonio Banderas made you in the movie " The 13th Warrior , " and assume your customers will be just as mad .
We are gonna get through this together , Amazon !
Software giant Microsoft Corporation is apologising for altering a photo on its website to change the race of one of the people shown in the picture .
A photo on the Seattle - based company 's US website shows two men , one Asian and one black , and a white woman seated at a conference room table .
But on the website of Microsoft 's Polish business unit , the black man 's head has been replaced with that of a white man .
The color of his hand remains unchanged .
Spot the difference ... ( top ) the advertisement in the US , and ( bottom ) the altered advertisement in Poland .
The photo editing sparked criticism online .
Some bloggers said Poland 's ethnic homogeneity may have played a role in changing the photo .

Kalamazoo police officer punches teen
KALAMAZOO -- Video of an incident that led to a Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety sergeant 's unpaid suspension last week shows the officer punched a handcuffed 16 - year - old three times after the youth spit in his face .
Sgt. Jeff VanderWiere , 37 , was suspended last week for 10 work days after an Office of Professional Standards investigation into the April incident .
The Kalamazoo Police Supervisors Association has filed a grievance on the suspension .
The video and police documents related to the case and VanderWiere , a 12 - year department veteran , were released by the city Tuesday after the Gazette filed a request under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act .
The images , captured from the mobile - video recording unit inside Officer Travis Ulberg 's patrol cruiser , shows the teen was with two other people when he was approached by VanderWiere and another officer at 1:45 a.m. on April 5 in the 1300 block of Cobb Avenue on the city 's north side .
A report from another officer said the teen appeared to be intoxicated .
The video shows him becoming confrontational and screaming profanities at the two officers who were investigating reports of gunshots being fired in the area .
The teen matched a description given to police when the gunshots were reported , according to the police documents .
The teen was eventually handcuffed , but he and one of the other boys with him attempted to run from officers .
VanderWiere wrestled the teen to the ground .
In the video , the teen can be seen making attempts to get up but is held down by VanderWiere , who places a knee on the youth 's chest near his neck .
VanderWiere held the boy down as another officer stood nearby .
On the video , the teen can be heard screaming and cussing at the officers and , at one point , apparently spits on VanderWiere .
The video shows that VanderWiere promptly hits the teen in the face three times and tells him not to spit in his face again .
" I think I broke my finger punching him , " VanderWiere told Lt. Jay Kowalkowski after the incident , according to footage captured by VanderWiere 's in - car mobile - video recording unit .
" He spit in my face so I punched .
It 's either dislocated or broke . "
Documents show that police later found a box of . 22 - caliber bullets inside the jacket pocket of the youth who was with the 16 - year - old .
The youths were arrested .
The teen who was struck was arrested on charges of minor in possession of alcohol , violating curfew and resisting police .
The other teen was arrested for interference and resisting police .
The teen who was struck was initially taken to the Kalamazoo County Jail and then to the county 's juvenile home after officers discovered he was 16 years old .
Footage of his ride to the county jail shows the teen continued to shout profanities and threats at Ulberg .
Hadley has said the teen was not injured during the incident .
A 24 - page report by Assistant Chief Lynn Wetmore says that when VanderWiere was interviewed by the Office of Professional Standards he said " he was trying to maintain control of ( the teen ) and a field of view regarding his officers . "
According to the report , VanderWiere said the teen spit " directly into his face and the spit went into his eyes . "
" VanderWiere stated that was an assault on his person and he did not want to get spit on again so he delivered three quick jabs to ( the teen 's ) facial area . "
In concluding her report , Wetmore writes that VanderWiere " gave no verbal warning , did not consider the utilization of other techniques " to stop the teen 's spitting and did not request assistance from Ulberg who was standing nearby before striking the teen .
" Although there is no evidence to indicate that there was any intent to cause serious injury to ( the teen ) , it appears the strikes were delivered out of frustration that ( the teen ) was not compliant ... "
Wetmore 's report says VanderWiere violated two sections of the department 's code of conduct that mandate an officer must use " only objectively reasonable force to overcome resistance " and document any injuries to the officer or a suspect with photos .
The report also says that VanderWiere violated a general order that requires officers to have their mobile - video recording body microphone activated at all times when in contact with a citizen .
The video of the incident shows VanderWiere did not have his mobile - video recording activated when he initially responded to the shots - fired call or during the time when he had the teen on the ground and struck him in the face .
Hadley on Tuesday declined to discuss specifics about the incident or VanderWiere 's suspension .
He did say that the fact the teen was handcuffed when the use of force by VanderWiere occurred " changes the dynamics " of the incident .
Hadley has said that VanderWiere , up until last week , had no prior disciplinary record .
" I found that it was not objectively reasonable based on my observation , " Hadley said of the use of force .
" I 'm not going to get into the minute details about what I felt was objectively reasonable ...
We 're moving forward . "

She had graced the cover of Vogue and found success as a model .
But Liskula Cohen ’s latest achievement came in the courtroom .
Horrified by the hateful words of an anonymous blogger , Cohen took Google to court in hopes of forcing the company to reveal the writer ’s identity — and won .
“ Why should anybody let it go ?
If somebody attacks somebody on the street , you ’re not going to let it go … why should I just ignore it ? ” Cohen told “ Good Morning America ” exclusively today .
“ I could n’t find one reason to ignore it . ”
Google initially refused to unmask the unidentified writer , who Cohen , 36 , claimed defamed her by posting words like “ skanky , ” “ ho ” , and “ whoring ” below her photographs .
The IP address turned over by Google revealed that the blogger was an acquaintance of Cohen’s .
Cohen said it was a woman she had n’t seen in about a year , but who was a regular fixture at dinners and parties , but she was not , as Cohen had feared , someone who was close to her .
“ Thank God it was her… she ’s an irrelevant person in my life , ” Cohen said .
“ She ’s just somebody that , whenever I would go out to a restaurant , to a party in New York City … she was just that girl that was always there … ”
There were two photographs posted on the blog that show Cohen and an unidentified man in sexually suggestive positions .
The captions below described her as the “ Skankiest in NYC ” and a “ psychotic , lying , whoring … skank . ”
Anonymity brings out the worst in cowards .
It ’s generally positive that so many in the cyberworld try to maintain utopian practices .

Sick of all the zombies and vampires overrunning your local movie theater ?
Then you 're in luck : Warner Bros. is poised to usher in the era of space pirates , with a science fiction remake of the swashbuckling pulp Captain Blood .
Advertisement
Captain Blood began life as a series of novels by Rafael Sabatini , chronicling the adventures of Dr. Peter Blood , a physician who turns pirate after being wrongly imprisoned .
Since its publication in 1922 , Captain Blood has been adapted five times for the silver screen , most notably in the 1935 film , which starred Errol Flynn in the title role .
Perhaps looking to capitalize on the success of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise , Warner Bros. producer Bill Gerber dug up the studio's Captain Blood license and started taking pitches from directors .
But Gerber did n't anticipate the idea Michael and Peter Spierig had for a Captain Blood reboot : pirates in space .
" At first , I felt like I was in that scene in ' The Player , ' where Buck Henry pitches the sequel to ' The Graduate , ' " said Gerber .
" But when I took a look at their animatic depiction of a pirate battle in space , it had such a distinctive visual look to it that I said , ' Great , I get it . ' "

But , despite the promise of space cannons and starships bearing the Jolly Roger , the plot will hold fairly true to the 1935 movie :
The doctor , Peter Blood , joins up with a French pirate ( played in the original by Basil Rathbone ) , only to clash with the buccaneer when the woman he loves ( Olivia de Havilland ) is captured by the pirate skipper .
Personally , I 'm looking forward to seeing a pirate movie not starring Johnny Depp , and I have high hopes for extraplanetary pirates .
At best , it could do for Caribbean pirates what shows like Cowboy Bebop and Firefly have done for westerns , and at the very least , it will still be fun to watch swashbuckling in space .

Even the bonds to the hydrogen atoms at the pentacene 's periphery can be seen
The detailed chemical structure of a single molecule has been imaged for the first time , say researchers .
The physical shape of single carbon nanotubes has been outlined before , using similar techniques - but the new method even shows up chemical bonds .
Understanding structure on this scale could help in the design of many things on the molecular scale , particularly electronics or even drugs .
The IBM researchers report their findings in the journal Science .
It is the same group that in July reported the feat of measuring the charge on a single atom .
Fine tuning
In both cases , a team from IBM Research Zurich used what is known as an atomic force microscope or AFM .
Their version of the device acts like a tiny tuning fork , with one of the prongs of the fork passing incredibly close to the sample and the other farther away .
When the fork is set vibrating , the prong nearest the sample will experience a minuscule shift in the frequency of its vibration , simply because it is getting close to the molecule .
Comparing the frequencies of the two prongs gives a measure of just how close the nearer prong is , effectively mapping out the molecule 's structure .
The microscope must be kept under high vacuum and exceptionally cold The measurement requires extremes of precision .
In order to avoid the effects of stray gas molecules bounding around , or the general atomic - scale jiggling that room - temperature objects experience , the whole setup has to be kept under high vacuum and at blisteringly cold temperatures .
However , the tip of the AFM 's prong is not well - defined and is n't necessarily sharp on the scale of single atoms .
The effect of this bluntness is to blur the instrument 's images .
The researchers have now hit on the idea of deliberately picking up just one small molecule - made of one atom of carbon and one of oxygen - with the AFM tip , forming the sharpest , most well - defined tip possible .
Their measurement of a pentacene molecule using this carbon monoxide tip shows the bonds between the carbon atoms in five linked rings , and even suggests the bonds to the hydrogen atoms at the molecule 's periphery .
Tip of the iceberg Lead author of the research Leo Gross told BBC News that the group is aiming to combine their ability to measure individual charges with the new technique , characterising molecules at a truly unprecedented level of detail .
That will help in particular in the field of " molecular electronics " , a potential future for electronics in which individual molecules serve as switches and transistors .
Although the approach can trace out the ethereal bonds that connect atoms , it cannot distinguish between atoms of different types .
The team aims to use the new technique in tandem with a similar one known as scanning tunnelling microscopy - in which a tiny voltage is applied across the sample - to determine if the two methods in combination can deduce the nature of each atom in the AFM images .
That would help the entire field of chemistry , in particular the synthetic chemistry used for drug design .
The results are of wide interest to others who study the nano - world with similar instruments .
For them , implementing the same approach is as simple as picking up one of these carbon monoxide molecules with their AFM before taking a measurement .

I 'm happy to see this thing is still in the release plan , but I really have to disagree with the dessign decission to use a GBA cart as storage .
In my opinion , the BEST ( CHEAPER , FASTER , most FLEXIBLE and most DURABLE ) solution would be a hybrid dessign with RAM and a memory card slot ( either SD or CF would be fine ) .
RAM is cheaper , faster and infinitelly more durable than Flash , which has a significative rewritability limit .
If that flash memory is inside the cart , or , like in this case , inside of another different but equally rare and proprietary cart , you have to replace it and that probably wo n't be possible forever .
On the other hand , if that flash memory is in a STANDARD FORM FACTOR , like SD or CF that will be available at retail for a foreseable future , then it 's not a big deal .
You buy another and that 's it .
Also , having RAM in the cart would eliminate all technical problems found in devices that use the a CF or SD card directly , like slowdowns caused by the flashcard 's speed being lower than the original cart 's mask ROM , other slowdowns and compatibility problems caused by the need to use a loader that is copied into RAM and is an straneous element to the game ( designed to be the ONLY thing that controls the console ) .
With such a hybrid RAM + flashcard dessign , you would have a menu loaded at power - on , and you would select a ROM image stored in the flashcard 's filesystem , which would be copied into RAM and run from there , without any other interefering and bug inducing straneous elements .
Additionally , such a setup would enable to have more than one rom withouth having to reflash a cart each time , built in save file management , and many other possible functions .
A simple onboard loading program coupled with an upgradeable system menu in the flash card could bring any kind of possiblilities .
I guess that you have this almost finished by now , but , please , consider this .
EDIT : Additionally , having separated RAM for ROM loading , and the card 's filesystem as a means of storage , could be used not only for the menu to load ROM images from it into RAM , but also for RAM resident programs to have a filesystem reader and access the card .
This would be really great for homebrew development .

CLEVELAND -- Cleveland Browns wide receiver Donte ' Stallworth today received a 30 - day jail sentence after pleading guilty to DUI manslaughter in a Miami courtroom .
Stallworth was charged in the death of Mario Reyes , a pedestrian who was struck and killed by Stallworth 's Bentley on March 14 in Miami Beach .
The Miami Herald reported that Stallworth was immediately taken into custody and that after he gets out he will serve two years of house arrest followed by eight years of probation , according to his plea deal .
He will also lose his driving privleges for life and have to perform 1,000 hours of community service .
Stallworth had faced four to 15 years in prison before the plea agreement .
Stallworth also reached a confidential financial settlement with the Reyes ' family , according to the Herald and the Associated Press .
" I will continue to bear this burden the rest of my life , " Stallworth told Miami - Dade Circuit Judge Dennis Murphy , who imposed the sentence , according to the Herald .
One of Stallworth 's lawyers , David Cornwell , released a statement Tuesday morning indicating Stallworth has every intention of playing football again :
" Donte ' has a debt to repay and awesome responsibilities to fulfill .
We have kept NFLPA Executive Director DeMaurice Smith , Commissioner Goodell , and the Cleveland Browns apprised of developments as they occurred .
Whenever it is appropriate to do so , we are prepared to discuss the circumstances under which Donte ' will resume his career . "
The NFL will most likely also discipline Stallworth under terms of its personal conduct policy once the legal process has played out .
Stallworth , 28 , was driving drunk when he struck and killed Reyes , 59 , at 7:15 a.m. on March 14 .
Miami -Dade police said Stallworth was driving drunk and a toxicology report showed he had a blood - alcohol level of .126 , which is above Florida 's legal limit of .08 .
Miami Beach police said that prior to the crash , Stallworth had been drinking at Liv Nightclub at the Fontainebleau in Miami Beach before leaving to go to a home in Miami , where he arrived about 6:15 a.m .
He was returning to Miami Beach about an hour later when he struck Reyes , who was crossing the MacArthur Causeway , which connects Miami and Miami Beach .
Reyes was trying to catch a bus and was not in the crosswalk .
According to police , Stallworth admitted he had been driving the car and said , " I hit the man lying in the road . "
Stallworth later told police at the Miami Beach police station that he had time to honk his horn and flash his headlights to warn Reyes .
Stallworth has been excused from all Browns off - season workouts and a mandatory minicamp while he focused on his legal problems .
He was signed to a seven - year , $ 35 million contract as a free agent by the Browns before last season , but was injured much of the year and caught just 17 passes for 170 yards and a touchdown .
Stallworth earned a $ 4.5 million roster bonus from the Browns the day before the accident .
People with the disorder are said to have a thin emotional skin and often behave like 2 - year - olds , throwing tantrums when some innocent word , gesture , facial expression or action by others sets off an emotional storm they cannot control .
The attacks can be brutal , pushing away those they care most about .
Then , when the storm subsides , they typically revert to being “ sweet and wonderful , ” as one family member put it .
In an effort to maintain calm , families often struggle to avoid situations that can set off another outburst .
They walk on eggshells , a doomed effort because it is not possible to predict what will prompt an outburst .
Living with a borderline person is like traversing a minefield ; you never know when an explosion will occur .
A Misleading Label
The name of the disorder was coined in the 1930s , in a misleading reference to the border between neurosis and psychosis .
Experts say it has nothing to do with either condition .
Rather , affected individuals seem to be born with a quick and unduly sensitive emotional trigger .
The condition appears to have both genetic and environmental underpinnings .
Brain studies have indicated that the emotional center of the nervous system  the amygdala  may be overly reactive , while the part that reins in emotional reactions may be underactive .
As children , people who will develop the disorder are often “ hyperreactive , hypervigilant and supersensitive , ” Valerie Porr , a therapist in New York , said in an interview .
Typically they receive a host of misdiagnoses and treatments that are inappropriate and ineffective .
Voters want Britain to scrap nuclear weapons altogether rather than replace Trident , according to a new Guardian / ICM poll today .
The result marks a sharp turnaround in public opinion amid growing debate about the cost of a new generation of nuclear weapons and the impact of conventional defence cutbacks on the war in Afghanistan .
For decades nuclear disarmament has been seen as a minority issue , with most voters assumed to favour continued investment in an independent British nuclear weapons system .
But today 's poll shows that 54 % of all voters would prefer to abandon nuclear weapons rather than put money into a new generation of Trident warheads , as the government plans .
Last week 's G8 summit brought suggestions that Britain might include Trident in international disarmament talks .
" What we need is collective action by the nuclear weapons powers to say that we are prepared to reduce our nuclear weapons , " said Gordon Brown .
Today 's figures mark a dramatic turnaround in public opinion since Trident renewal was announced by Brown three years ago .
In July 2006 , 51 % backed renewal , while 39 % opposed it .
Since then support for a new Trident system has fallen by nine points while opposition has grown by 15 points .
Overall , only 42 % of all voters now back renewal , according to the poll .
Until now a majority of voters have always supported a British nuclear system , although one other recent ICM poll showed most people wanting to extend the life of the existing Trident system rather than spend money upgrading it .
In 2006 Gordon Brown reaffirmed Britain 's commitment to Trident , and the government won Commons backing , thanks to Tory support .
A design contract is expected to be signed this September , during the parliamentary recess , and the nuclear weapons were excluded from the defence review announced last week .
The poll shows for the first time that a majority of Labour voters oppose nuclear weapons , as well as most Liberal Democrats .
On balance , 59 % of Labour voters want Britain to scrap nuclear weapons , against 40 % who want to replace them .
In 2006 Trident renewal was backed by a majority of Labour voters .
Even among Conservative voters , 41 % would now rather see unilateral nuclear disarmament than a new generation of weapons .
That may encourage the opposition to defer renewal as part of a package of spending cuts .
Today 's results are one consequence of the growing political battle over public spending , with retired defence chiefs , Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs suggesting that the £ 20bn cost of replacing Trident would be better spent on conventional forces .
The poll also suggests that the Conservatives are outflanking Labour in the debate over spending .
More than two - thirds of voters say they want spending to be cut , double the proportion who believe the government should increase expenditure , as some ministers continue to argue .
Even a majority of Labour voters want to see cutbacks .
As a result the Conservative party has extended its lead over Labour to 14 points .
At 41 % , up two , Tory support is at its highest in an ICM poll since March , before the expenses scandal broke .
Labour , unchanged on 27 % , is stuck on its second - lowest ICM score since June last year .
The Liberal Democrats are on 20 % , up two points , while backing for other parties is 12 % , down three as minor party support from the European elections fades .

Four Jersey City police officers and a Port Authority police officer were shot this morning , two critically , and two suspects killed during an investigation into the case of a man shot on Broadway last month that had been caught on surveillance video , sources told The Jersey Journal .
Officers were watching a stolen vehicle on Reed Street at Bergen Avenue when a man and a woman exited a nearby building and the man opened fire with a shotgun , shattering the passenger window of an unmarked police car , police said .
The officer who was sitting there had just gotten out .
Surveillance video shows man being shot in Jersey City
The couple then ran back to the building but the man turned around and fired at another officer and struck him in the leg , police said .
Police evacuated the building and called in Emergency Services from Jersey City and Port Authority police .
When police entered the building , gunfire erupted from inside the apartment , going through the door , police said .
A Jersey City ESU officer was hit in the chest and neck outside the door , and he is in critical condition , police said .
Another Jersey City officer was shot in the face outside the door , and he is also in critical condition .
He had no signs of life when he arrived at the Jersey City Medical Center , where he was resuscitated and is now in surgery , police said .
" The fact that we can talk about him being in surgery now is a minor miracle , " Dr. Nathaniel Holmes said at a news conference attended by Jersey City Police Director Samuel Jefferson , Police Chief Tom Comey , Mayor Jerramiah Healy , other elected officials and a representative of the Port Authority Police .
During the gunfire that erupted , a Jersey City officer wearing a bulletproof vest was shot in the back , and a Port Authority police officer was shot in the arm .
The suspects were apparently barricaded in the apartment but were shot and killed , although details are still hazy .
The incident began with officers of Jersey City 's major case unit watching a parked car that matched the getaway car captured on video after a 43 - year - old Sleepy Hollow , N.Y. , man was shot at 6:30 a.m. June 18 when he arrived at work at the 30 Minute Oil Change on Broadway .
Comey declined to identify the officers saying all of the families had not yet been notified , and he refused to name the dead suspects .
Check back with Hudson County Now for more developments .

I have been working in a public hospital in Tehran over the last few weeks .
The authorities are covering up the number of dead protesters and their causes of death .
The official statistic is 20 dead – that 's wrong .
In our hospital alone there were 38 riot deaths in the first week .
Most died from gunshot wounds .
A colleague told me that in his hospital there were a further 36 gunshot casualties and 10 deaths .
Four public hospitals admitted wounded protesters during the riots , but it is hard to know the total figures of dead .
Other hospitals were prevented from helping .
Basiji militiamen attacked doormen in one hospital for letting in wounded protesters .
In the hospitals that were allowed to function , the basijis replaced the hospital admissions staff and took the IDs of wounded patients .
Medical staff are under huge pressure to cover up the injuries they treated ; I know one doctor who killed themself .
If the patients died of gunshot wounds the basiji confiscated their bodies and told the families they had been " transferred " for organ donation .
They removed the bullets and returned the bodies with a different postmortem report .
By the second week the basiji were better organised and took the bodies directly from the streets .
There were many dead the hospitals never saw .
As for the injuries , they speak for themselves .
There were multiple points of gunshot impact – proving the authorities were shooting liberally .
Their victims were indiscriminate .
Two pregnant women were shot – one through the spleen , she survived and the other died .
For the latter , the authorities say a photograph of her circulating the internet had been taken in another country , but that 's not correct .
She was wounded , treated and died in Tehran .
They shot her three times .
One bullet penetrated the foetus 's spine .
How can a doctor lie on his medical records after operating on a case like that ?
Many of my friends and my cousin even ( who was wounded ) saw snipers up on the rooftops during the protests .
They said these snipers were targeting people through their rifle lenses .
The injuries we witnessed in hospital testify to this .
One 32 - year - old patient had gunshot impact entering the sub-umbilical region with an exit wound on the thigh , which proves the bullet came from above .
Many protesters also saw foreign basiji ; they were yelling " Arab " as they attacked us .
They were not speaking Persian .
We do not know who these fighters were .
Together with the basiji on the bikes , wearing civilian clothing – these were the violent ones .
Others were young conscript boys , mostly from the provinces , wielding rubber anti-riot batons and Palestinian scarves .
They made jokes as though they did n't really understand what they were doing .
But their leaders were different , they looked you in the eye and they knew you did n't support them .
You felt like a permanent target .
From what I have seen and heard , this medical cover - up has been happening all over the country .
But unofficially , medical staff report dead in Isfahan , in Shiraz , in many places .
Like here , the authorities are making sure the hospitals do n't reveal the numbers .
And they want the people to keep quiet , too .
Even in the south of Tehran , among families of the martyrs from the Iran / Iraq war , the old revolutionaries , people do n't agree with this violence .
In the hospitals they tell us they do n't believe in Ahmadinejad any more but are forced to pretend otherwise because they are employed by the state .
Whoever you are in Iran and whatever you do , it is easy to doubt yourself .
Many of us who witnessed this state aggression , watch Iranian news and listen to the authorities and start to question what we saw .
The bias is so great you begin to feel isolated , question what you witnessed .
At night , the basiji swept the riot zones and cleared away evidence .
They want us to think nothing happened .
They want us to be blind .
Now it seems Michael Jackson 's death has made the world forget Iran .
But the number of disappeared continues to increase here .
First they were taken by the police and basiji during the protests – and now in the house raids that happen night after night .
It is getting harder and harder to protest , no matter how many ways we invent to show our frustration .
Between 10 pm and 10.30 pm some Mousavi supporters still stand on their roofs to yell " Allahu Akbar " ( God is greatest ) .
In 1979 , the revolutionaries did the same and claimed they could see Khomenei on the moon to guide them .
Now we are not so superstitious , but the darkness is overwhelming .
There are fewer voices every night .
The authorities are tracking everybody .
They are confiscating mobile phones for contact details , they are tracing computer IDs of people who used Twitter or Facebook .
I have friends who have been arrested – people who had just come from Europe to work for a couple of weeks and got caught up in the violence .
It is all such a mess .
We have n't heard from most of them .
Prison is a question of luck .
If you get arrested by the basiji and taken to a basiji centre – that 's the worst .
The basiji are not supposed to have centres of their own , they are meant to deliver to the prisons , but they have their own rooms – and that 's the most dangerous place to be .
Then there 's Evin prison .
I have one cousin who was taken there for the last student uprising .
There is a huge empty room where they ask you to identify protesters .
If they sense you are afraid , they force you into confessing anything and identifying anybody .
It 's not so much what you say as the fact they debased you .
Most protesters are moved from prison to prison , so they become untraceable .
Knowing the cover - up in the hospitals , I worry many protesters might be " untraceable " forever .

Doctors are worried that religion is being seen as unhelpful Doctors are demanding that NHS staff be given a right to discuss spiritual issues with patients as well as being allowed to offer to pray for them .
Medics will tell the British Medical Association conference this week that staff should not be disciplined as long as they handle the issue sensitively .
The doctors said recent cases where health workers had got into trouble were making people fearful .
But atheists said it was wrong to mix religion and health care .
The doctors , who are behind the motion being discussed at the Liverpool conference , are unhappy about the guidance that has been issued .
If we say it is ok for doctors and nurses to provide spiritual care and pray for patients it can all too quickly get out of hand and we will have staff preaching on the wards
Terry Sanderson , of the National Secular Society The General Medical Council code suggests that discussing religion can be part of care provided to patients - as long as the individual 's wishes are respected .
But at the start of this year the Department of Health issued guidance warning about proselytising .
It said that discussing religion could be interpreted as an attempt to convert which could be construed as a form of harassment .
It comes as NHS trusts have taken a hard - line in a number of recent cases .
Last year community nurse Caroline Petrie was suspended by North Somerset NHS Trust after offering to pray for a patient , although the 45 - year - old was later allowed to return to work .
And only last week a Gloucestershire nurse said she had left her job at a local hospital after being told she could not wear a crucifix - although the hospital said it was because of health and safety rules , not religion .
Cancer specialist Dr Bernadette Birtwhistle , who works in hospitals across Yorkshire and is a member of the Christian Medical Fellowship , said : " I think it is getting to the point where many of us feel we cannot talk to patients about their spiritual or religious needs or ask them about praying .
" Christianity is being seen as something that is unhelpful . "
And she added : " Freedom of speech is being curtailed too much and I do n't think that is always in the benefit of patients . "
Spiritual needs
However , the Department of Health said it was the responsibility of the NHS Chaplaincy Service to meet the spiritual needs of patients .
A spokeswoman said : " We are committed to the principle of ensuring that patients and staff in the NHS have access to the spiritual care that they want , whatever faith or belief system they follow .
" Although all staff should be sensitive to religious needs and preferences of patients , the delivery of spiritual care should be provided by the hospital chaplaincy service . "
And Terry Sanderson , president of the National Secular Society , agreed it was not the role of doctors and nurses to bring up religion .
" We have to be very careful about how we tread on this issue .
If we say it is ok for doctors and nurses to provide spiritual care and pray for patients it can all too quickly get out of hand and we will have staff preaching on the wards .
" The risk is that it makes patients feel uncomfortable .
They may feel compelled to say ' yes ' thinking their care will suffer .
Really , it is an infringement of their privacy .
" I think we should be very clear that patients should have to ask for this , not offered it . "
But Joyce Robins , co-director of Patient Concern said : " Most complaints from patients are about being on a conveyor belt of care .
They do n't rate with staff as real people .
" Offering to say a prayer is a warm and kind thought .
Most patients will accept it as such .
It is no more offensive than being offered a sleeping pill .
You can say thanks but that sort of thing is n't my cup of tea .
" But if Christian doctors see this as an opportunity to promote their faith to people at a time when they are particularly vulnerable , that is totally unacceptable . "

John Yates , the Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police , said that senior officers were confident that all those people targeted had been made aware of the compromise to their security .
“ It is important to recognise that our enquiries showed that in the vast majority of cases there was insufficient evidence to show that tapping had actually been achieved , ” he said .
There was no evidence that the phone of Mr Prescott had been tapped , he added .
On his 85th birthday , corporate son , Vice President , President , father of our second Great Leader after FDR and before Obama , plane jumper , former CIA Director , and Bonesman George H.W. Bush has become as honest as a babe .
According to a recent bubbly and adoring news article in the Washington Times , " When asked directly whether the CIA lies “ all the time , ” Mr. Bush said it does not .
The CIA does not lie all the time .
So there .
I recently read Russ Baker ’s Family of Secrets , because Lew interviewed Russ Baker and it sounded great .
The book delivers , although I suspect there are a lot of Bush family secrets that remain unexposed .
I am personally curious about any Bush secret recipes on the back burner back in March 1981 .
As history , the Wikipedia version of the Reagan assassination attempt reads like a CIA moonlighter ’s script for a movie of the week .
Baker ’s research led him back to the days of the JFK assassination , where HW , or " Poppy " Bush was not where he said he was , after all these years .
You ’ll have to read the book for a real , and real interesting , lesson in modern American democracy .
During the " wide - ranging " interview Poppy gave to the salivating Washington Times , he had shared this observation :
I think people are alarmed now .
There ’s too much government intervention into everything — putting people on the boards of directors .
Too much .
And too much spending , ” Mr. Bush said .
“ I think people are , you know , understandably concerned about some of the things that are going on now .
Non-interventionist conservatives , libertarians , historians , economists , and thinking people everywhere have been " alarmed " for decades , and most today have realigned portfolios , gotten passports , and planned their bug out locations .
So what " people " are alarmed now , according to Poppy ?
Apparently , Poppy ’s friends and cohorts who are n’t getting picked to lead the interventions .
What people are " understandably concerned ? "
Apparently , Poppy ’s friends and cohorts who are n’t getting invited to sit on the fasci- boards as either the government partner or the corporate partner .

Poppy also does n’t believe the rumors that the GOP is dead .
What the GOP needs , Poppy suggested , is a good dose of his good son , Jeb , who just got back from a " u2018 listening tour ’ with other prominent Republican leaders as part of a new party effort dubbed a u2018 Conversation for a New America . ’ "
I am not making this up .
Poppy ’s good son Jeb believes that listening to good ideas and alternative voices will help the GOP recover power .
Good ideas and alternative voices from everyone except those from the only activated and vibrant remnant of the GOP — Paulians who embrace the idea of a constitutional republic .
Responding to a suggestion by the Times that perhaps the GOP ought to " rediscover " Reagan in order to renew itself as a party , Poppy retorts , " I do n’t know what you mean by ‘ Reagan principles . ’ "
We are two for two in the truth — the CIA does n’t lie all the time , and a top lifelong GOP ’er has no idea what Reagan principles were in 1980 , but instinctively recoils .
This is considered reporting by the Washington Times .
Follow - ups ?
Fuggetaboutit !
More importantly , it is also a textbook example of the fawning corporate media ( Ray McGovern ’s term for American Pravda , Tass and Izvestia ) doing what it does best — setting up the Daily Show for its next fake news blockbuster .
The Washington Times has just launched a radio broadcast called America ’s Morning News .
Featured on yesterday ’s debut was Poppy Bush observing that the results of the Iranian elections last week , with a claim of a landslide victory for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad were " weird " and " it sounded funny when the opponent claimed victory by 60 some percent then the next thing you know he ’s on his back , counted out , and there is " something strange about it . "
Beyond sounding like a 14 - year - old mall rat instead of an American statesman , yes , Poppy , there is a lot strange about it — not least that Washington ’s fave maniac handily won a flawed election , and no one in the FCM seems to be interested in Iranian anger about it , or the extreme brutality of the Iranian state against peaceful demonstrators .
This is stability , DC - style , Poppy ’s own business for many decades .
It ’s good to see Poppy back in the news .
It ’s good that he is in his reflective years , and can speak the truth sometimes , even when it makes him look dotty .
But what is really great about this interview is what it says about Washington ’s news reporting , and the FCM overall .
Its audience has shriveled , its remaining devotees a bled - out choir of codgery , and its apparent competition , in Mine That Bird style , is the dust cloud left by comedic news producers like The Onion and The Colbert Report .
This is very good news for the revolution .

Organisers of the Melbourne International Film Festival have been forced to shut down online ticket sales after Chinese hackers booked out all film sessions on its website .
The attack comes as part of a mounting campaign against the screening of a documentary about exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer .
Hackers broke into the festival 's website soon after the launch of the 2009 program , replacing festival information with the Chinese flag and anti-Kadeer slogans .
Six Chinese language movies have also been pulled out of the festival , leaving organisers with a logistical headache and the fear that Chinese filmmakers will boycott the festival in future .
The festival 's website reads : " Online sales are currently offline due to a denial of service attack of Chinese origin . "
Spokeswoman Asha Holmes said all sessions on the site had posted " sold - out " messages about 9 am AEST today .
She said it was not immediately known whether the rush on tickets was real .
But when the bookings were traced to Chinese websites , it soon became clear they were fake .
" It 's under attack again , " Ms Holmes said .
" People have been unable to book sessions at all . "
Internet technicians have been unable to keep up with the speed of " shopping carts " filling once the sessions have been cleared of the fake bookings , she said .
Film buffs can still buy tickets at the festival 's box office or over the phone .

“ It is appropriate to teach the right of free speech , but it is also incumbent to teach the responsibilities accompanying free speech ; that of accuracy , civility , truth and good taste . ”
— David Barton
If any question remains about the religious and political motivations of certain members of the Texas Board of Education , one need only read the words of their social studies curriculum experts .
Rev. Peter Marshall ( one of their appointed academic experts ) , for example , wants to restore America , according to the Web site of his Massachusetts - based ministry , “ to its Bible - based foundations through preaching , teaching , and writing on America ’s Christian heritage and on Christian discipleship and revival . ”
He also believes that Hurricane Katrina , Watergate , and the Vietnam War are the result of divine wrath .
As part of his curriculum review for the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills process , Marshall issued an assessment of a Grade 5 history section in which students are asked to “ describe the accomplishments of significant colonial leaders such as Anne Hutchinson , William Penn , John Smith , and Roger Williams . ”
Marshall , along with his fellow reviewer David Barton , did not believe that students in the public education system should learn about Hutchinson :
Anne Hutchinson does not belong in the company of these eminent gentlemen .
She was certainly not a significant colonial leader , and did n’t accomplish anything except getting herself exiled from the Massachusetts Bay Colony for making trouble .
( emphasis added )
One of the original Puritans , Hutchinson disagreed with some of the scriptural teachings of the religious leaders and began hosting her own Bible study classes in her home .
For this crime , Hutchinson was placed on trial and banished from her community .
Later , she and her exiled family were killed in a Siwanoy attack .
“ This is a prime example of somebody who believed in religious freedom and was persecuted for that , ” said Rob Boston , a spokesman for Americans United for Separation of Church and State .
Certainly , there can be legitimate debate regarding the amount of prominence Hutchinson should receive in the Texas educational system .
But describing a woman kicked out of her community for wanting to worship
God in her own way as “ making trouble ” reveals much about what Marshall and his supporters really think about the principle of religious freedom .
The irony , of course , is that these are the same men who argue forcefully that educators must do a better job at teaching this nation ’s Christian heritage .
“ This is a guy talking about freedom of religion as part of the history of the United States , ” said Dan Quinn of the Texas Freedom Network .
“ And what happened to Ann Hutchinson is why separation of church and state is so important .
And now they want that example taken out of the standards . ”
“ It ’s a perfect example of censoring ideas you do n’t like and distorting history to feed an agenda . ”
Panel Leaders
Just as a handful of the 15 members of the Texas Board of Education tried to hijack the educational review of the state science curriculum this past year ( attempting to stack the panel of experts with anti-science activists and intelligent design advocates like Stephen Meyer of the Discovery Institute ) , the same board members are now trying to repeat the process with the social studies curriculum .
The outcome of these hearings will be used by publishers to determine what goes into their textbooks .
As the second - largest bulk purchaser of textbooks in the country , Texas determines what students learn not only in Texas , but in many other states , where districts purchase the same versions .
The board members have appointed six experts , and , the choices appear carefully crafted to be fair and balanced to differing views : one side representing a commitment to sound education , and the other side representing an agenda of religious far - right extremism .
In addition to Marshall , who holds a seminary degree from Princeton and has no background in social science , they include :
David Barton , whose company , WallBuilders , helped spawn a cottage industry based on the concepts that “ separation of church and state is a myth ” and that our nation ’s founding fathers wanted America to be a theocracy , governed by Christian principles .
A self - styled historian , Barton only has an undergraduate degree in religious education .
And Daniel Dreisbach , a professor in the School of Public Affairs at American University in Washington DC , who earned a law degree and a doctorate of philosophy in politics .
While unlike Marshall or Barton he does at least boast some credentials , Dreisbach also believes “ separation of church and state is a myth . ”
On the other hand , the three other board members , Jim Kracht , professor of teaching , learning , and culture and also of geography at Texas A&M University ; Jesus Francisco de la Teja , professor and chairman of the history department at Texas State University - San Marcos ; and Lybeth Hodges , professor of history and government at Texas Woman ’s University , all provide the panel with solid mainstream advanced academic credentials and educational experience .
In their expert reviews , Kracht , de la Teja , and Hodges offer reasonable suggestions for curriculum updates ; while the other three offer suggestions that reveal a bizarre political agenda of extremist ideology and biblical exceptionalism .
For instance , Barton ( former vice - chairman of the state GOP , and a Republican National Committee operative ) said that Texas children should no longer be taught about “ democratic ” values but “ republican ” ones .
“ We do n’t pledge allegiance to the flag and the democracy for which it stands , ” he wrote .
“ It ’s a little ‘ R ’ and a little ‘ D , ’ ” Quinn said .
“ But they ’re not fooling anyone . ”
Both Barton and Phillips recommended that César Chavez ( labor organizer and civil rights leader ) and Thurgood Marshall ( the nation ’s first black US Supreme Court justice who , as a young attorney , successfully argued the public school desegregation case of Brown v. Board of Education ) be removed from textbooks because they are n’t worthy role models for students .
Perhaps most concerning , Barton also stresses the teaching of the Declaration of Independence and wants to see the state standards stipulate that the document is synonymous with the Constitution .
It ’s interesting to note that nowhere in the Constitution is there a reference to God ; but in the Declaration of Independence , Thomas Jefferson refers to a creator , as well as “ the laws of nature and of nature ’s God . ”
From this , Barton says we can adduce — and children should therefore be taught — the five following principles : 1 . There is a fixed moral law derived from God and nature ; 2 . There is a Creator ; 3 . The Creator gives to man certain unalienable rights ; 4 . Government exists primarily to protect God -given rights to every individual ; 5 . Below God - given rights and moral law , government is directed by the consent of the governed .
Barton goes on to write that these five points are key to what he calls “ American Exceptionalism ” :
Students must understand that American Exceptionalism is the result of the five distinctive ideas set forth in the first three lines of the Declaration and subsequently secured in the Constitution and Bill of Rights .
Separation ?
There is a confounding literal - mindedness to Christian fundamentalism .
Just as the Bible is the inerrant word of God , there is the oft - quoted remark : “ Nowhere in the First Amendment does it say ‘ Separation of Church and State . ’ ”
But AU ’s Boston believes experts such as Barton , Dreisbach , and Phillips are being less literal - minded and more disingenuous .
“ They use it deliberately because it has superficial appeal to people who just do n’t think things through , ” he said .
“ The polls have never shown great Constitutional literacy in this country , right down to knowing the rights spelled out in the First Amendment . ”
“ So the facts be damned , ” Boston said .
And he added :
They have a purer form of knowledge that transcends facts ; they believe they are on a God - given mission to bring those facts into the public sphere .
There is a power to being told that you belong to a special class of people whose history has been oppressed by a malevolent force .
That this great glorious Christian history is being suppressed by atheists .
Fair and Balanced
At the end of last month , the social studies advisory team began the arduous process of culling through the expert reports — separating the agenda - driven items and the code words from the sound pedagogical - based suggestions .
The appointed reviewers will then write draft curricula based on the recommendations , and present them to the Board of Education .
In August , the board members will begin the first round of hearings to review the proposed changes .
“ I do n’t see at all that we will divide into factions , ” said new board Chairwoman Gail Lowe , seemingly rather disingenuously , in a recent newspaper interview .
Lowe was one of two board members who appointed Barton to the panel of experts .
A Young Earth Creationist like her predecessor , Lowe was recently appointed by Gov. Rick Perry .
She replaced Don McLeroy after the state Senate declined to confirm him following his outrageous behavior during the science standard debacle in which he argued for creationist language .
During an impassioned speech , as he tried to get creationist code words into the science standards , McLeroy said , “ Somebody has to stand up to the experts ! ”
In a previous newspaper interview , McLeroy had warned that social studies would be even more controversial than the science hearings .
Strangely , this kind of extremism seems to have become the “ conservative viewpoint . ”
In many news accounts , including a Fox News piece by Steve Doocy and Tucker Carlson , the panel of experts is described as three conservatives and three liberals .
Doocy , in characterizing the advisory panel , held up his fingers to emphasize the balance , an issue that particularly irks Texas Freedom Network ’s Dan Quinn .
“ This is not a debate between left and right , ” Quinn said .
“ This is a debate between radicalism and the mainstream . ”
“ What they ’ve done is the same thing they did with the science experts , ” Quinn added .
“ They ’ve packed the panel with ideologues whose politics they agree with .
It ’s three ideologues and three mainstream academics .
But they ’ve moved the debate so far to the right that they make it sound like this is a panel of traditional conservative Republicans and Democrats . ”
It ’s a strange notion that a conservative viewpoint is one that no longer supports the idea that we are a country founded on a principle of religious freedom .
It ’s even stranger that members of the media now describe the conservative position as one that argues America is a nation founded on a rigid theocracy in which a woman banished from her community for disagreeing with her religious leaders is guilty of simply “ making trouble . ”
“ All this plays into the idea that if you do n’t like this , ” Quinn said , “ then you ’re a leftist who hates Christians . ”
As Felipe Massa is still being tended to in a Hungarian hospital , the rumors have begun to fly : who will drive his car at the next race ?
An obvious choice has emerged in the sport ’s greatest champion .

Michael Schumacher drove his last race for Ferrari in October 2006 at the Brazilian Grand Prix , a heroic drive for fourth place after an early puncture which capped a remarkable and record - busting career .
His sixteen years in Formula
One saw him win 91 of the 248 races — a full 37 % — he started , with seven world championships , 76 fastest laps , 68 poles and 154 podiums to his name as well .
Felipe Massa , the young Ferrari driver who won at Schumacher ’s last race , was struck in the head by a 1.5 - pound suspension piece during Saturday qualifying at the Hungarian Grand Prix .
His life was saved by his carbon fiber helmet and a Hungarian surgical team at the ÁEK military hospital in Budapest , where he is currently recuperating with possible permanent damage to his left eye .

While the next grand prix in Valencia will take place after an unusual gap of four weeks on August 23 , it is increasingly becoming clear that Massa will not be there to race .
As Ferrari has retained a still very fit Michael Schumacher in an advisory role , the rumors have immediately picked up after Massa ’s accident as to whether the seven - time world champion will return to F1 , however temporarily .
“ The whole thing will be considered by Ferrari .
If they approach Michael , then he will consider it , ” his spokeswoman was quoted by the BBC , only to be somewhat contradicted by his manager Willi Weber in the very same report : “ Michael will not sit in a car in Valencia , this is out of the question .
What would we expect from Schumacher if he stepped into a Formula One car ?
To win .
The expectations from both sides would be too high . ”

Make no mistake : a man of Schumacher ’s stature cannot come back to F1 to drive around in circles in a car which — while picking up speed in recent races — is still off the pace .
For a somewhat imprecise comparison , consider another seven - time champion of similar age , back to the fray after three years off : Lance Armstrong .
He had dominated the Tour de France the way Schumacher and Ferrari had Formula One , yet even in spite of his fearsome physique , he was soundly beaten by younger and hungrier racers to finish third in this year 's Tour .
A result which would be a wonderful achievement for anyone — but not for a seven - time champion , for whom it is a public embarrassment .

Yet do n’t discount Schumacher .
Juan Manuel Fangio , who is second only to him in number of Formula
One world championships won , drove his greatest race to clinch his fifth title on August 4 , 1957 — at the age of 46 .
Schumacher turned 40 this January .

Should Schumacher not drive , the shortlist for Massa ’s temporarily empty seat includes Ferrari reserve driver and this year ’s Le Mans winner Marc Gené , Fernando Alonso — who is widely rumored to sign for Ferrari for 2010 and beyond — and Luca Badoer , Ferrari ’s other reserve driver .

The argument for doing drastic things to prevent global warming has two parts .
The first has to do with climate change , with reasons to think that the earth is getting warmer and that the reason is human action , in particular the production of CO2 .
The second has to do with consequences of climate change for humans .
Most of the criticism I have seen , in comments to this blog and elsewhere , has to do with the first half , with critics arguing that the evidence for global warming , or at least the evidence it is caused by humans and will continue if humans do not mend their ways , is weak .
I don not know enough to be sure that those criticisms are wrong ; pretty clearly climate is a very complicated and not terribly well understood subject .
But my best guess , from watching the debate , is that the first half of the argument is correct , that global climate is warming and that human action is at least an important part of the cause .
What I find unconvincing is the second half of the argument .
More precisely , I find unconvincing the claim that climate change on the scale suggested by the results of the IPCC models would have catastrophic consequences for humans .
Obviously one can imagine climate change large enough and fast enough to be a very serious problem — a rapid end of the current interglacial , for example .
And if , as I believe is the case , climate is not very well understood , one cannot absolutely rule out such changes .
But most of the argument is put in terms not of what might conceivably happen but of what we have good reason to expect to happen , and I think the outer bound of that is provided by the IPCC models .
They suggest a temperature increase of about two degrees centigrade over the next hundred years , resulting in a sea level rise of about a foot and a half .
What I find implausible is the claim that changes on that scale at that speed would be catastrophic — sufficiently so to justify very expensive measures now to prevent them .
Human beings , after all , currently live , work , grow food in a much wider range of climates than that .
Glancing over a U.S. climate map , it looks as though all of the places I have lived are within an hour or two drive of other places with an average temperature at least two degrees centigrade higher .
If people can currently live , work , grow crops over a temperature range of much more than two degrees , it is hard to imagine any reason why most of them could n't continue to do so , about as easily , if average temperature shifted up by that amount — especially if they had a century to adjust to the change .
That observation raises the question with which I titled this post :
Does climate change catastrophe pass the giggle test ?
Is the claim that climate change of that scale would have catastrophic consequences one that any reasonable person could take seriously ?
I can only see two ways of defending such a claim .
The first is some argument to show that present arrangements are , due to divine intervention or some alternative mechanism , optimal , so that any deviation , even a small one , can be expected to make things worse .
The second , and less wildly implausible , is the observation that people have adapted their activities — the sort of houses they live in , the varieties of crops they grow — to current conditions .
Put in economic terms , we have sunk costs in our present way of doing things .
Even if the planet has not been optimized for us , we have optimized our activities for the planet , with the details depending in part on the local climate .
Hence any change in either direction can be expected to be a worsening , making our present way of doing things less well adapted to the new conditions .
That would be a persuasive argument if we were talking about a substantial change occurring over five or ten years .
But we are n't .
We are talking about a not very large change occurring over a century .
In the course of a century , most existing houses will be replaced .
If temperatures are rising , they will be replaced with houses designed for a ( slightly ) warmer climate .
If sea levels are rising , they will be replaced , in low lying coastal areas , with houses a little farther inland .
Over a century , farmers will change at least the varieties they are growing , very possibly the kind of crop , multiple times , in response to the development of new crop varieties , shifting demand , and similar changes .
If temperatures are rising , they will gradually shift to crops adapted to a ( slightly ) warmer climate .
Climate aside , we do not live in a static world — consider the changes that have occurred over the past century .
The shifts we can expect to occur due to technological progress alone , even without allowing for political and demograpic shifts , are much larger than the shifts required to deal with climate change on the scale I am discussing .
My conclusion is that this version of climate catastrophe , at least , does not pass the giggle test .
There may be other versions , based on more pessimistic predictions of climate change , that do .
But the claim that we now have good reason to expect climate change on a scale that will produce not merely problems for some but catastrophe for many is one that no reasonable person should take seriously .

Immigration minister says new system for immigrants seeking a British passport will ' break the link between temporary migration and permanent citizenship '
Immigrants who take part in anti-war demonstrations could jeopardise their chances of getting British citizenship under new government proposals , a Home Office minister said today .
Phil Woolas , the immigration minister , said people would have to " earn " their citizenship under plans being unveiled this morning for a new points system for immigrants seeking a British passport .
The government has already introduced a points system for immigration .
But once immigrants have been working legally in Britain for five years , it is relatively easy for them to qualify for citizenship .
Woolas said today 's proposals , which are being outlined in a consultation paper , are intended to " break the link between temporary migration and permanent citizenship " .
Qualifying for citizenship will become harder , and applicants will be judged by various factors , including their ability to speak English .
At the weekend stories attributed to government sources suggested that immigrants who took part in anti-war demonstrations could jeopardise their chances of qualifying for citizenship .
Asked about this on BBC Radio 4 's Today programme , Woolas said : " We think it 's right to say if we are asking the new citizen , as incidentally other countries around the world do , to have an oath of allegiance to that country , that it 's right to try to define in some objective terms what that means .
And clearly an acceptance of the democratic rule of law and the principle behind that we think is important and we think it 's fair to ask that . "
But , when it was pointed out that demonstrating was not illegal , Woolas suggested that an applicant could also lose points not just for breaking the law – but also for engaging in certain activities that were legal .
Sarah Montague , the presenter , asked : " Are you effectively saying to people who want to have a British passport , ' You can have one , and when you 've got one you can demonstrate as much as you like , but until then do n't ' ? "
Woolas replied : " In essence , yes .
In essence we are saying that the test that applies to the citizen should be broader than the test that applies to the person who wants to be a citizen .
I think that 's a fair point of view , to say that if you want to come to our country and settle , you should show that adherence . "
Woolas claimed that migrants themselves would support this stance .
" Part of the mistake in this debate , in the public comment , is the assumption that the migrant does not accept that point of view .
The vast majority , in my experience , do want to show that they are aspiring to integrate and to support our way of life , " he said .
Keith Best , of the Immigration Advisory Service , told the same programme that this stance was " somewhat bizarre " given that having the right to protest was a key attribute of being British .
" I would be very surprised if the government would say to probationary citizens , ' You need to curtail your freedom of speech as a probationary citizen in order to be able to enjoy it fully once you become a British citizen ' , " Best said .
The eve of the launch was marred when the Home Office was forced to confirm yesterday that a suspected illegal immigrant had smuggled himself into Britain under a coach carrying officials from the UK Border Agency who were returning from working in France .
An inquiry has been launched , but officials say the vehicle 's driver will not be fined because he carried out sufficient checks before setting off through the Channel tunnel .
The suspected illegal immigrant hid in a space next to the fuel tank and fled once the coach reached Britain .
The driver tried to catch him , but was unsuccessful .
A Home Office spokesman said : " An illegal entrant entered Dover by hiding underneath a coach returning from Coquelles , in France .
The coach was contracted by the UK Border Agency .
" A full investigation is being conducted .
This is further evidence of the extreme and dangerous illegal measures that are being taken to enter the UK . "
In an article about the new citizenship plans in yesterday 's News of the World , Alan Johnson , the home secretary , wrote : " Already we require people earn the right to become citizens by paying taxes , speaking English and obeying the law ...
I will go even further , unveiling my new citizenship proposals which will require people earn points for , among other things , their skills , their job and their qualifications .
" Bad behaviour will be penalised , and only those with enough points will earn the right to a British passport .
No longer will there be an automatic link between temporary work and becoming a permanent UK citizen . "
The home secretary predicted a short - term fall in migrant numbers from outside Europe due to the government 's clampdown and because the recession makes Britain a less attractive place to live .
Migrants from outside the EU are already subject to a points - based system , introduced last year , which allows entry into the UK only if they have skills needed by the British economy .
A Home Office spokesperson said : " The points - based system has already proved to be a powerful tool for controlling migration for the benefit of both British people and the economy .
We have already announced our intention to consult on applying these principles to the path to citizenship . "
The Tory immigration spokesman , Damian Green , accused the government of " spin " .
He said : " There never has been an automatic right to British citizenship .
It is simply that this government has let an unprecedented number of people obtain citizenship , issuing someone with a British passport every five minutes .
This is an act of desperation by a government that ... has let immigration run out of control . "
A notorious sleaze merchant could be on the hook for nearly $ 100,000 after opening an unauthorized Subway sandwich shop that doubled as an after - dark strip club .
A federal magistrate has recommended slamming Anthony “ Cousin Vinny ” Agnello with triple damages for serving up deli delights by day and nudes at night , according to a report filed Tuesday .
Magistrate Frank Maas said Agnello — who gained infamy after supplying the stripper for a wild high - school party in 2001 — should pay the fast - food giant ’s corporate parent $ 90,000 , plus another $ 7,900 for its legal fees .
Doctor ’s Associates Inc. , which operates Subway , estimated Agnello took in about $ 23,000 in profits from the eatery last year .
Agnello — who last year told The Post he started slinging sandwiches because “ the money in stripping is n’t as profitable as it used to be ” — did not return calls .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair will be called before an inquiry into the country 's role in the Iraq war , its chairman said during the opening Thursday .
Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair will be called before an inquiry into the Iraq war .
John Chilcot told media he would not " offer a list of witnesses " but that " key decision - makers in the key phases of the Iraq affair " would be called .
" You can work out for yourself who some of them will be , but apart from the former prime minister [ Tony Blair ] -- who it 's obvious we must see -- I do n't want to give a longer list today . "
Blair 's appearance before the inquiry , whenever it happens , will be of huge interest to the British public and media .
Blair 's office said the former prime minister was willing to assist the inquiry .
" As we 've said from the outset , Mr. Blair will of course cooperate fully with whatever format Sir John Chilcot sets out for the Inquiry , " a spokesman said .
Blair 's successor , Gordon Brown , announced the inquiry last month , saying it would look in depth at the lead up to and conduct of the war .
However , he also said it would not appropriate blame or have any mandate to consider civil or criminal charges .
Chilcot said the inquiry would examine the period starting from the summer of 2001 until the launch of the military operation in 2003 , and up to the present day .
Watch Chilcot discuss the inquiry »
He called the scope of the inquiry " considerable , " given that most inquiries of this type would focus on a specific event in a limited period .
" We have been asked to examine a range of decisions and actions over a period of eight years , " he said .
" There are differing views over what happened during that period and why , which we will need to address .
We will also , by the way , need to place that whole period of years in a broader historical context . "
While the committee would not set out to apportion blame or consider issues of civil or criminal liability , it could judge the legality of the conflict , Chilcot said .
He promised that committee members had open minds and would review the evidence objectively to reach their conclusions .
" We are determined to be thorough , rigorous , fair , and frank , " he said .
Brown has promised that the committee will have access to the full range of information , including secret documents .
" The inquiry can ask for any British document to come before it and any British citizen to appear , " Brown said .
" No British document and no British witness will be beyond the scope of the inquiry . "
It 's not clear how long it will take the committee to finish its work , Chilcot said .
At the end , it will publish a report that will be debated in parliament .
After criticism , the government was forced to abandon its original plans to hold the inquiry behind closed doors .
Chilcot said the panel intends to make the proceedings " as open as possible , because we recognize that is one of the ways in which the public can have confidence in the integrity and independence of the inquiry process . "
Some of the hearings may be televised or streamed on the Internet , and the panel will have a Web site on which information will be regularly posted , he said .
The start of the inquiry coincides with the withdrawal of the some of the last British troops from Iraq .
The agreement that allows British troops to stay in the country expires Friday .
The only British troops to remain will be about a dozen helping to train Iraqi police as part of a NATO mission , the defense ministry has said .
Chilcot said the panel members plan to visit Iraq as part of their work , as well as hold discussions with Iraqis outside of the country .
Top officials from both the British and U.S. governments may also be called upon for evidence , he said .
The panel has no power to compel witnesses to testify , but Chilcot said he hopes they can talk to people in the U.S. government .
" The Anglo - American relationship is one of the most central parts of this inquiry , and something that we need to get a very strong understanding of , " he said .
On my evening commute on I - 5 southbound from Everett there is always a right - lane traffic jam at one of the Lynnwood off - ramps .
Close - packed cars must crawl along at 2 mph for a very long time .
Therefore I intentionally changed to the exit lane as I approached that distant jam , and I started letting a REALLY huge empty space open ahead of me .
By the time I hit the jam , there was maybe 1000 ft of empty road ahead .
Sure enough , my big empty space stopped traffic from feeding it from behind , while the front of the jam kept dissolving as usual .
By the time I arrived , the jam was significantly smaller than it had been .
Amazing .
This was n't any little traffic wave , yet one single driver was able to take a huge bite out of the back of it .
Just moving jam around Obviously my actions did more than just reduce the size of the jam .
In order to create the empty space , I was temporarily driving about 10 mph below the speed of the heavy traffic .
I did this for several minutes , and therefore I caused a slight slowdown behind me .
After I arrived at the jam , the jam was smaller .
When all was said and done , part of the dense traffic jam had been removed .
However , it was changed into a mild slowdown , and it was spread backwards upstream over perhaps a mile of traffic .
Traffic behavior was changed .
Rather than driving at 50 mph only to crawl along through a traffic jam for several minutes , everybody was now driving at 40 mph for a few minutes before the jam , but then having a much smaller traffic jam to endure .
The average traffic flow might have improved , but also it might have remained unchanged .
But some of the nasty , frustrating part of the 2 - mph jam was converted into a large " fuzzy " area of reduced speed .
And after I made these changes , drivers as a whole would find it much easier switch lanes to avoid becoming trapped in the jam , since the solid - packed region was much smaller .
If I had done it correctly , I could have erased the whole jam , transforming it into many minutes of slightly - slow driving for everyone behind me .
( If I could have started 30 mi upstream of the jam , maybe I would have only needed to drive 3 mph slower than traffic ... that is , if other drivers did n't simply go around my slow car . )
Another thing that happened : by shrinking the region of solid - packed cars , I made it easier for other cars to merge into the exit lane , so I probably removed part of the backup in the through - lane as well .
By moving the jam backwards , I unplugged the merge zone at that exit .
The jam was mostly caused by drivers trying to merge across lanes to reach the exit .
Drivers already in the exit lane were n't letting anyone in , so the merging cars sat unmoving in one of the thru-lanes , waiting for a space to open , and also forcing everyone behind them to halt .
So , by inserting a large empty space , I was n't only taking a bite out of the jam ahead of me .
I was also easing the jam in other lanes .
At best , moving the jam backwards would entirely remove the bottleneck and halt the growing queue of stopped cars .
With the jam broken up , the clot of cars behind the merge zone becomes a wave which freely moves backwards .
The traffic jam was like downtown city " grid- lock , " and I was breaking up the gridlock and promoting free flow by putting spaces between all the cars .
" Anti-traffic " Here 's a general principle I take from the above .
( I guess it 's obvious in hindsight ! )
ANTITRAFFIC DESTROYS TRAFFIC .
Empty spaces can break up a traffic jam .
While I was slightly slowing down to allow a space to gradually open up before me , I was creating an empty pulse of " antitraffic " ahead of me .
When my antitraffic finally collided with the dense " traffic " of the jam , the two annihilated each other like a positron meeting an electron .
It 's nonlinear soliton physics .
The soliton waves destroy each other , leaving only a slight fuzzy smudge behind .
The fuzzy smudge may behave very differently than the original bottleneck : it can travel backwards and move off into the distance .
My next thought : if I took several friends along on my experiment , we could have repeated the same jam - erasing process .
No , not illegally driving three abreast .
Instead , each of us could have allowed a big blob of anti-traffic to appear , and then those repeated impacts of the incoming antitraffic could have completely erased the traffic jam at the Lynnwood exit .
Traffic at the exit would start flowing freely , and the long backup would drain away .
When traffic is sparse , we cannot keep a really large space open ahead of us , since it 's too easy for every to pass a slightly - slow driver .
But perhaps several separate drivers could bring less - enormous spaces along with them , and any traffic jam would succumb to the barrage of " antitraffic . "
Another lesson I learned : plan ahead .
Plan WAY ahead .
When stuck in traffic jams , I discovered that I cannot affect them by first making my way through the jam and then " peeling out " at the end .
I hoped to make the far end of the jam dissolve faster .
It never worked because I could n't get rid of the slow guy ahead of me .
But as a commuter I 'm encountering the same traffic jams every day .
I know their locations .
I know what to expect ... so if I planned way ahead and brought a big empty space along with me into the jam , I could use that space to manipulate the jam .
I can control the traffic only by applying the brakes .
But once I get myself packed in with everyone else , I can do nothing .
In order to have an effect , I must behave differently BEFORE the jam , not while trapped inside it .
But wo n't other drivers simply go around me and fill my big empty space ?
Hmmmm .
After trying this many times in many places , I find that they usually do n't .
I wonder why ?
( see the FAQ page . )
And here 's a final lesson : a tiny bit of math !
( For some reason this part took me years to figure out . )
A traffic jam is a pattern in the cars , but what * exactly * is a traffic jam ?
It 's not congestion , but congestion is usually required before jams will appar .
A jam is two things : it 's a pattern of slowness which , with the same incoming flow , might exist .. or it might not exist .
Regardless of the number of cars arriving , sometimes the jam just is n't there .
Second : a jam is a traffic pattern where the outflow from the pattern has become constant .
In a jam , the outflow DOESN 'T equal the inflow .
More and less incoming cars does n't affect the outflow rate , instead it will only cause the length of the jam to continuously grow or shrink .
And individual drivers can't affect the outflow rate of cars leaving the far end of the jam ( they ca n't dissolve the jam by " peeling out . " )
And amazingly enough , that 's the key thing that makes a jam * be* a jam .
In normal un - jammed highways , the outflow from a piece of road is affected by the inflow .
If inflow rate gets larger , then outflow rate gets larger too .
But once the non-linear jam - pattern appears , the outflow rate becomes constant , and the jam will grow larger and larger if the inflow rate is a tiny bit bigger than the outflow .
( And of course the jam may shrink to nothing if the inflow is a bit smaller . )
And finally : once the jam has been triggered , the outflow * must * be less than a similar outflow from an un-jammed highway .
( Think : if the outflow from a jam was larger than the outflow from the unjammed highway , then whenever a jam appears , the sudden improvement in outflow would drain out the cars , and the jam would instantly evaporate before it had a chance to really get started . )
Ooops !
Damn !
While doing all of the jam - canceling above , I once caught myself behaving normally and creating a huge traffic wave .
What a hypocrite !
Bad habits die hard .
Traffic was heavy and I was in the left lane .
I had to merge across several lanes in order to get to my exit .
I merged right once , but the next lane was packed solid ( but it was still moving , not jammed . )
Nobody would let me in .
I drove like this for a long while , then started driving fairly slowly in order to drift backwards along the solid lane .
I found a slot and got in , but now I had to merge right once more .
Many minutes had passed , and my exit was coming up .
The right lane was packed solid , NOBODY WAS LETTING ME IN .
I drove slower and slower , and in a panic I finally forced my way into a small gap , making the guy behind me jam on brakes .
After awhile I realized that I had just created a huge traffic wave with my behavior .
Just like any rubbernecker I had suddenly slowed way down for no good reason .
But I had an excuse , I had to get to my exit !
To make matters worse , I had nearly come to a complete stop , and brought two entire lanes of traffic to a near halt too .
I probably left a long - term traffic wave at that spot on the highway .
But it was n't my fault !
Yeah , suuuure .
In stewing about this I realized that EVERYONE has this same problem at that particular spot : an inability to merge in the dense traffic .
Others were probably doing the exact same thing that I did , and this would make the " wave " near that exit worse and worse .
Our inability to change lanes would create a " dynamic bottleneck " which hovers near the exit .
Obviously the simple cure is to give up ; not merge , and miss the exit .
I should never have forced the issue , I should have let my exit go past .
So should all the other merging drivers .
But there is a bigger issue here .
People SHOULD be able to merge .
Why was traffic packed so tightly ?
One obvious reason : to punish the idiots who will jump into any little space .
I had always done the same myself .
I never allow a space to appear ahead of me , or some other driver will immediately swerve into it during their quest to cheat by running down an empty lane to the front of the line .
But this sort of " closed - gap " driving would also prevent any necessary merges at off ramps ( and at on ramps too , of course . )
By eliminating the space ahead of me , I become part of the impenetrable wall which creates the " dynamic bottleneck " and screws up the traffic at highway exits .
The gear teeth cannot mesh , so the whole machine grinds to a halt .
The " zipper " becomes jammed because the " teeth " of the zipper are resentful about new teeth moving into the space ahead of them .
The jammed merging lanes are much the same as gridlock in a city .
Smart city drivers never block intersections , since blocked intersections will freeze all traffic permanently .
But we highway drivers are ignorant .
We close up the gaps when others need to merge .
And our behavior creates needless " highway gridlock " during every single rush hour .
So , if I keep a few carlengths of space open ahead of me , then not only can I use it to help vaporize waves and jams , but I also eliminate one of the major causes of the waves and " highway gridlock . "
I eliminate the " solid wall " of traffic at merge areas , and I let people merge without slowing down and creating traffic waves behind them .
Take a look at this animation on page three of this article .
Ideally a merge - area will act like high speed gear teeth .
A " Zipper Merge . "
But suppose that everyone starts defending themselves against opportunistic drivers by eliminating all gaps in traffic .
In that case the valid merges can not take place either .
A fight develops , and a traffic jam is created .
The jam appears at the merge zone , while a huge region of empty roadway is created downstream .
Sometimes this jam is the fault of people like me who panic while missing their exit and who come to a complete stop .
Sometimes the jam is the fault of the huge blinking yellow Construction Arrow which blocks one entire lane of traffic during road work .
But the traffic jam is ALWAYS the fault of those who refuse to let anyone merge ahead of them .
" Just merge behind me . "
No , that does n't work , since the guy behind you does n't want any merges either .
Everyone in the whole lane is saying " merge behind me ! "
It 's a solid packed wall of hostility .
Poking any small hole in that wall can make a difference .

" Keeping sufficient ( or ideally , the largest possible ) gaps leads to uniform and free ( er ) traffic flow . "
Delusions of Grandeur Seattle suffers from many separate rush - hour traffic jams .
Why should I stop with the jam at the Lynnwood I - 5 exit ?
With enough people ( maybe with cellphone apps and GPS , ) we could intentionally smooth out ALL the traffic jams on all the main Seattle highways !
This is all fantasy at this point .
It 's probably illegal for several people to " conspire " to mess with traffic patterns ( would we be arrested under a drag - racing law ? )
This could be a " flash mob " organized via email .
[ NOTE : YEARS AGO IN TORONTO , TO PROTEST THE LOW SPEED LIMITS , SEVERAL PEOPLE FORMED A ROLLING BARRIER DURING RUSH HOUR .
THEY DROVE AT JUST UNDER THE SPEED LIMIT FOR HOURS , CREATING A HUGE SLOWDOWN .
THEY WERE ARRESTED BUT LATER RELEASED WITHOUT CHARGES . ]
And while it is possible for a single driver to have huge effects on traffic patterns , some things can't be done by a few people .
For example , suppose I want to eat the entire I - 5 and I - 90 traffic jam south of the city .
I would have to go all the way south to Tacoma before driving north .
But if I tried driving slightly slow , a space would never open up ahead of me because that 's sparse traffic down there and nothing stops other drivers from passing me .
In my experiments , I could create my " antitraffic " spaces only because traffic was very heavy , and because only a very few people had the opportunity and the ambition to leave their lane and move into my empty space .
Rolling barriers made of State Troopers OK , so here 's how to dissolve a major interstate traffic jam .
Start many miles upstream from the jam .
Put a row of State Trooper vehicles across the road and have them drive towards the jam .
They drive perhaps at 55 rather than 70 as everyone else had been driving .
Nobody can get by them , and so all the traffic behind the State Troopers is moving at 55 or so .
In front of them a vast open space appears .
After many minutes , the traffic which had been feeding into the city traffic jams simply stops arriving .
There 's little new traffic for many minutes .
The huge jam trickles away .
Just as the last of it is gone , the row of State troopers and the 55 - mph traffic arrives , and the jam has been transformed into miles and miles of slightly slow traffic upstream from the old location of the jam .
[ Hey , since 1998 this has been tried , and found to actually work . ]
The BIG question
But does this increase the throughput of the highway ?
YES !!!
It allows people to merge again !
It actually changes the ' capacity ' of the highway .
It wipes out a ' dynamic bottleneck . '
By removing the close - packed region , the two lanes of traffic at the exits and entrances are able to merge at high speed ... so even though the close - packed region is now a big fuzzy slowdown , the flow of traffic does increase significantly .
On the other hand , the situation is not so simple if lots of extra traffic is entering from numerous on - ramps .
The " rolling barrier " can't affect these extra inputs , and if nearly all of the traffic is from on - ramps , then the " rolling barrier " idea would be worthless .
In that case it can only control the main highway and not all the on -ramps .
Ah , but what about " rubbernecker slowdowns " at accident sites ?
A rolling barrier could let the slowdown evaporate , and change it into a wide region of slightly - slow traffic a few miles upstream from the accident .
Would the slowdown just re-form ?
Would rubberneckers hit the brakes and re-create the " traffic standing wave " ?
I dunno .
Sometimes " rubbernecker slowdowns " persist for hours after the accident has been cleared .
This suggests that the slowdown is self - perpetuating .
Rubberneckers only trigger it , but they do n't keep it going afterwards .
If so , then " erasing " the slowdown might be worthwhile , because once it 's erased , it will only re-form very slowly ( or not at all ) .
If the slowdown normally persists for several hours , yet it only takes half of an hour for the police to erase it , why not erase it ?
True , the slowdown is not truely " gone , " since it has become a wide area of slightly slow traffic .
However , over many months of slowdown - erasure , this could prevent lots of fender - benders and road - rage incidents , and eliminate thousands of man-years of anger and frustration .
Also , the average speed and traffic throughput on the highway MIGHT actually improve if region of stopped traffic could be removed .
" Removing " the jam just spreads it out and does not immediately alter the average speed .
However , improvements in speed might be more than you 'd expect .
After all , things are not " linear " in traffic flow , since those who sit at 0 mph for many minutes in a jam cannot compensate by driving at 120MPH afterwards .
Also , some jams act like " virtual bottlnecks " which create huge backups behind the jam while also creating empty highway downstream .
Removing the jam will remove the bottleneck and increase the flow .
( Note : if this is common , if jams commonly act as bottlenecks , it means that highways do n't have a known capacity .
The highway 's maximum capacity is different whether a jam is present or not . )
Aha , one other point : if State Police , rather than driving slow , instead came to a complete halt for a minute or to , this would force the slowdown to turn into a " stop wave . "
Stop - waves always crawl backwards .
If this was done , the downstream end would start moving backwards .
It would n't be " pinned " to the location of the accident scene .
And that means that the growth of the jam would be entirely halted .
The slowdown would crawl off backwards into the distance : not dispersed , but with having its constant growth entirely disrupted .
Ooooo , does this actually work ?
A ONE - MAN MULTI - LANE ROLLING BARRIER
In driving with huge empty spaces during rush hour , I find that the space ahead of me does n't just instantly fill up .
Other drivers do n't change lanes to fill them .
Weird !
What 's going on ?
First , if I 'm driving with a big empty space , sometimes ( rarely ) the car directly behind me will pass me .
Sometimes it happens twice .
But this removes the lane jumpers from behind me , and forms a row behind me of nonaggressive drivers .
Those drivers are like a plug , since any aggressive drivers many cars back can't even SEE the big empty space ahead of me .
But what about the adjacent lane ?
Wo n't they all fill my empty space ?
Nope .
A few do change lanes , then they rush to the end of the empty space .
This filters out the aggressive drivers from the adjacent lane , leaving sane ones next to my empty space .
They do n't change lanes .
They do n't care that there 's a huge empty space growing and shrinking right beside them .
They form a big plug , and aggressive drivers behind them cannot get to my big empty space .
This " plug effect " seems only to happen when traffic is highly congested .
When traffic is light , I can't maintain any really extreme spaces , since aggressive drivers can easily swerve around to jump into the space .
But when traffic is light , traffic jams are minimal , so there 's not as much need to create an antitraffic bubble and perform some jam - busting .
Have you ever noticed when your highway lane ends , anyone merging earlier than you is a coward , and anyone merging later than you is a cheating lane - zoomer ?
MAKING A REAL DIFFERENCE
During a year of practicing the " wave - smoothing " driving habits , I kept looking for places where I could make a big difference in traffic flow .
Yes , I could always use an empty space to move a piece of the traffic jam to another location .
With a big empty space , I could even spread the cars apart as I moved the slowdown , the same way I did it with the jammed sections in the " traffic wave . "
But the genuine " bottlenecks " seemed all too rare .
Then finally I noticed that there was one common situation where I could do some real good .
If you drive in heavy highway traffic , you 've probably seen a traffic wave develop at a construction site where one lane is blocked for a long distance .
You crawl and crawl at 3 mph until you get to the start of the bottleneck , then you take your turn merging as the two lanes sloooooooowly come together .
Then you race off down the single lane at 60 mph !
No downstream congestion !
The merging lanes formed a terrible bottleneck , but they did not add together and overload the single lane downstream .
The bottleneck was not the downstream lane itself .
Instead , a stalled " traffic wave " develops at the merge - zone , and extends far back into the double lane .
After the wave , in the long single lane , it 's clear sailing .
But why ?
WHY must a bottleneck develop at a merge zone ?
Well , obviously because there 's too many cars on one road .
And because everyone must take turns slowly merging together .
WRONG !
Wrong wrong wrong .
Even during extremely low - traffic and high speed conditions , still everyone must take turns .
Yet everyone merges as a high speed flow , like gear teeth or like a zipper .
A bottleneck never appears .
Traffic jams develop at a merge zone whenever the cars momentarily get so close together that there are no gaps between them .
Without gaps , nobody can merge , and so the traffic suddenly comes to a near halt .
The " gear teeth " jams up , the " machine " halts , and a bottleneck is created .
The pile of pebbles all block each other and can no longer pour through the funnel .
Then traffic on the highway becomes something like a city street intersection , a " four way stop " where people pack together and take turns .
But whenever traffic comes to a near halt , people always pack themselves together .
Huh .
This is screwy .
At the place where the lanes merge together , close - packed cars cause the bottleneck , but ... the bottleneck is the CAUSE of the close - packed cars .
And also , the close - packed cars keep the bottleneck in existence .
And the bottleneck causes the clot , it makes drivers all pack together and start tailgating .
But , but ...
Do traffic jams CAUSE THEMSELVES ?
After thinking about this even more , I realized that the answer must be yes .
It goes like this : No. 1 Traffic is going slow .
Everyone packs together and closes up the gaps .
Fast merging becomes impossible .
The incoming cars will grow a huge long back - up .
Cars must slooooowly take turns merging .
This makes incoming traffic slow down .
Repeat this loop over and over .
This is absolutely fascinating because this self - caused situation has a counterpart : No. 2 Traffic flows along rapidly .
Nobody closes the gaps ( they follow the 2 - second rule ? )
Merging is easy .
Streams of traffic flow together like a zipper .
This allows traffic to go fast .
Go back to the top of this loop and repeat .
At a merge zone , fast traffic causes traffic to remain fast , while slow traffic causes a jam to persist .
Weird !
The difference in flow rate between these two situations is enormous , yet EITHER ONE can arise on the exact same highway under the exact same amount of incoming flow .
In the first one , the speed might be 2 mph , while in the second one it could be 40 mph .
And here 's the important part : because the situations create themselves once they are established , sometimes they can switch from one to the other .
A smooth flow can hit a glitch and turn into a traffic jam .
Or somebody can switch them intentionally .
Suppose the traffic at a merge zone was flowing fast as in Loop Number 2 above .
Suppose I wanted to wreck everything .
I could get in the through - lane and slow way down .
Fight with drivers in the other lane , trying to block them .
Make all the cars pack together behind me .
This would prevent any cars in the other lane from merging into my closely - packed lane .
Cars in the merge - lane would then pile up too .
Then I drive off laughing evilly , because I have just CREATED MASSIVE LONG - TERM TRAFFIC JAM !
The exit might stay jammed for hours .
Or , I could do the opposite .
Suppose everything is jammed up at the merge zone .
Suppose I accumulate a huge space ahead of me and bring it in through the through - lane .
When the huge space gets there , cars in the ending - lane can suddenly change lanes into my space , spread out , and start flowing fast .
Next , I speed up and merge with them .
The cars behind me do the same .
The " zipper - like " flow has begun .
The switch has flipped .
I have just ERASED a long - term bottleneck .
As they say in those old Ranier Beer ads , pretty cool , eh ?

For years , desperate job - hunters have put Mama down as a " former business manager " to boost their chances of landing a job .
But you know times are tough for the unemployed when at least two companies -- CareerExcuse.com and AlibiHQ.com -- are selling fake references .
ABC : While it's hard to verify whether Schmidt's [ of CareerExcuse.com ] service -- which charges customers $ 64 per year after a three - day free trial -- has actually benefited anyone , he's not the only one claiming to help people lie to secure work in a tough economy .
The Web site Alibi HQ also advertises fake job reference services .
A man identifying himself as Mark Stevens , an Alibi HQ spokesman , told ABCNews.com that the company , which also offers fake landlord references and fake doctor 's notes , has been operating for several years .
He said customer interest in employment references skyrocketed over the last year , with calls from people seeking Alibi HQ 's services quadrupling -- a trend Stevens attributed to the increase in job seekers left unemployed by the recession .
Using fake references is hardly a national epidemic .
But apparently they 're used by all sorts of folks : Hassan Nemazee , a wealthy investor and Democratic fundraiser , was just busted for a $ 74 million fraud of Citibank .
As The New York Times noted yesterday , fake references were a central party of his alleged scheme :
Mr. Nemazee also gave Citibank phone numbers and addresses of various financial institutions that would purportedly vouch for his financial strength , but the numbers were controlled by him , the complaint said .
It said that if officials at Citibank tried to confirm the assets ’ existence , “ they would in fact be contacting a telephone number assigned to Nemazee himself , and not any financial institution . ”

Hate cockroaches ?
Best pour yourself a stiff drink .
The widely loathed insects can hold their breath to save water , a new study has found – and the trick could help them to thrive in the face of climate change .

When cockroaches are resting , they periodically stop breathing for as long as 40 minutes , though why they do so has been unclear .
To investigate the mystery , Natalie Schimpf and her colleagues at the University of Queensland in Brisbane , Australia , examined whether speckled cockroaches ( Nauphoeta cinerea ) change their breathing pattern in response to changes in carbon dioxide or oxygen concentration , or humidity .
They conclude that cockroaches close the spiracles through which they breathe primarily to save water .
In dry environments the insects took shorter breaths than in moist conditions .
“ Cockroaches lose water across their respiratory surfaces when they breathe , ” says Schimpf , “ so taking shorter breaths in dry conditions reduces the amount of water they will lose . ”
Theories floored
The study deals a blow to the theory that cockroaches hold their breath to survive underground , where CO 2 levels can be poisonous .
“ They held their breath no longer in high - CO 2 than in low - CO 2 conditions , ” says Schimpf .
Nor did the study support the idea that cockroaches hold their breath to avoid damage to their body tissue from chemical reactions with oxygen .
The same does n’t necessarily apply to other insects , warns John Terblanche at Stellenbosch University in South Africa .
“ Our research suggests that butterfly pupae hold their breath to prevent oxygen damage , rather than to conserve water , ” he says .
The ascent of cockroaches
The nifty breath - holding adaptation has allowed cockroaches to colonise drier habitats , says George McGavin of the University of Oxford , and may allow them to thrive in climate change .
“ Cockroaches have an awesome array of adaptations to life on dry land , ” says McGavin .
“ Living in the humid conditions of a rainforest , where they evolved , might be plain sailing , but cockroaches are adaptable and can cope in a wide range of environmental conditions . ”
Will the sun ever set on the empire of the cockroach ?
Not any time soon , says McGavin .
“ Two hundred and fifty million years of physiological fine tuning has produced a creature that will be around for a long time to come , ” he says .
“ Cockroaches will do well in the face of climate change . ”

Jason Del Rey , Recode :
Amazon on Tuesday is unveiling a new biometric technology called Amazon
One that allows shoppers to pay at stores by placing their palm over a scanning device when they walk in the door or when they check out .
John Gruber :
I ’m happy to hear more details , but on the surface this sounds insane .
Why in the world would anyone voluntarily send their palm print to any company to store in the cloud ?
With something like Face ID and Touch ID , your biometric info is not only stored solely on your own device , it ’s stored on the secure enclave on your own device .
Even the apps running on your own device can’t access it .
And :
This is a terrible idea and the only reason I can think of why Amazon created it is that they wanted their own payment system and felt they had to use some kind of biometrics for identification , privacy implications be damned , because they do n’t have any sort of mobile device platform they could use instead .
I ’m guessing there are a ton of people who will follow along , scan their palms unknowingly , in the same way they respond to a Facebook survey asking them where they met their spouse or what their first pet ’s name was .
At the very least , as John intimated , this feels like Amazon trying to disrupt Apple Pay and the like .
Back to Recode :
The company expects to sell the technology to other retailers , like it began doing earlier this year with its “ Just Walk Out ” technology — the cocktail of cameras , sensors , and computer vision software that powers Amazon Go stores .
Kumar said the Amazon
One pitch to other retailers is straightforward : reduce friction for your customers at checkout , thereby shortening lines and increasing how many shoppers are served along the way .
There ’s the overt business model .
But what ’s not clear is what Amazon will do with this treasure trove of intimate biometric data in the long haul .
BERKELEY , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
Everyone knew the day would come when the fortunes of Microsoft Corp. would reverse .
The company might now be in actual decline .
If it 's true , it brought it on itself by ignoring its core competencies , because it exhibits signs of what can only be described as Corporate Attention Deficit Disorder -- CADD .
Try to remember all the crazy directions Microsoft has gone in over the past few years .
Note the dizzy remarks by Chief Executive Steve Ballmer , who recently insisted that online advertising would soon account for the majority of Microsoft 's income .
This is a software company making these comments .
CEO Steve Ballmer Reuters
This was most recently re-emphasized in Ballmer 's speech at Cannes , France last month and in Moscow the month before .
Let me restate it .
Microsoft is a software company .
It has been distracted too easily by the success of others in essentially unrelated fields .
Here are but a few examples ( and there are dozens more ) :
Years ago in the pre-Internet era , AOL was the talk of the town , so Microsoft had to copy it with MSN .
No money was made ; no strategic advantage was gained .
Netscape was the rage for a while , so Microsoft threw together a browser and got in that business .
The browser was given away for free .
No money was made ; the strategy got the company in trouble with government trustbusters .
During the early days of the Internet , new online publications appeared .
Microsoft decided to become a publisher too , rolling out a slew of online properties including a computer magazine and a women 's magazine .
They were all folded .
Computer books became popular ; Microsoft began Microsoft Press .
After an early splash and success , the company soon lost interest and the division now languishes .
Teddy Ruxpin became a hot toy .
Microsoft rolled out a couple of robotic plush toys , including the creepy Barney the Dinosaur who sang " I love you and you love me . "
The company soon lost interest and dropped the whole thing .
AOL - TV appeared , along with other device - centric TV - delivery mechanisms in the 1990s .
Microsoft created a Microsoft - TV division as well as a device .
It soon lost interest .
Adobe Photoshop became a huge success , so Microsoft hired Alvy Ray Smith to develop photo - editing software .
Smith quit when the company lost interest in the idea .
Yahoo and Google showed that a search engine could be a money maker , so Microsoft copied that idea ; it now has Bing .
Cloud applications are currently trendy , along with notions about software as a service .
Microsoft decides to go into that business .
The Apple rolled out a MP3 player , the iPod .
Microsoft came up with its own MP3 player , the Zune .
The company also says it wants to stream music .
This is a company that began making development tools for programmers , beginning with a programming language .
Does anyone see a pattern here ?
I could go on with home - automation initiatives , phone operating systems , pen computers ( two shots at that market ) , page - layout programs , Web - design tools and on and on -- all shiny objects for a company that does n't want to actually fill a need , but jump from one idea to the next .
“ Now Microsoft wants to open retail stores , all of them next to or near an Apple store . ”
What 's shocking is that the cash cows , specifically the Windows operating system and the Office suite , have managed to finance all these idiotic efforts for so many years .
While Microsoft 's profits and sales were way down this last quarter , it is only a matter of time before losses begin .
Read more about the disappointing earnings .
The cash cows are dying of neglect .
This company cannot keep its eye on the ball because there are too many shiny objects to distract it .
Now comes the latest fiasco : Microsoft wants to open retail stores , all of them next to or near an Apple store .
This strategy is reminiscent of the defunct hamburger chain from the 1970s that was a McDonald 's copycat .
McDonald 's would do all the research , and then the chain would open a location around the corner .
It did no other real advertising or marketing .
( At least Microsoft is trying to advertise with its " buy a cheap laptop " ads on TV .
Too bad the company does n't really sell laptops . )
Maybe Microsoft cannot come to grips with the reason for its success .
After all , Ballmer is not a computer programmer , and has never been too interested in software or computers and seems to want to run a media company .
Ballmer may get his wish by turning Microsoft into one , but I do n't think he 'll like it .

I ’m sure you ’re all familiar with the term BBC ( which stands for Big Black Cock ) , right ?
Well , over here in Cam69.com , there are plenty of BWCs which stand for Big White Cocks !
It ’s a little less enticing and tempting as the latter , but it ’s still quite the package to boast , do n’t you think ?
Come on , do n’t be such a killjoy and try to actually enjoy yourself , they ’re both great things to watch while pleasuring yourself !

There ’s definitely some models that you can butter up and use that flirt game of yours to get into their pants !
The reply and reactions of the models give life to your whole experience .
This is what sets the live cam shows in Cam69.com compared to other pornographic services online .
Be More Specific With Your Models
If you want to look for models more suited to your tastes , then there ’s a way you can filter out the models to find out what ’s best for you .
I ’d say its closer to search filters rather than subcategories .
For example , if you want to browse the Gay Cams category for models from the North American region , then you can set the Location tab to North America , and Cam69.com will automatically filter out the models who are n’t in that region .
Furthermore , you could even select the various age ranges to fit your tastes and fetishes .
Believe me , you ’ll be surprised at how many models are in certain age ranges .
You could filter out the younger models and go for the ones aged between 30 and 30 or even over 41 !
Or maybe you want to see a gay couple getting it on , that ’s completely possible as well , that ’s one of the great things about Cam69.com !

You all know that Bolton and the other wingnuts cried their " outrage " when the news broke that Bill Clinton was in North Korea to save Euna Lee and Laura Ling .
Bolton 's mustache argued that President Bill CLinton 's trip in Pyongyong was a sign of weakness .
Like Think Progress pointed out yesterday maybe Bolton is still angry at North Korea Officials who called him a scum back in 2003 LOL
" Such human scum and bloodsucker is not entitled to take part in the talks , " a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said , according to the North ’s official KCNA news agency .
" We have decided not to consider him as an official of the U.S. administration any longer nor to deal with him . "
So when even North Koreans are laughing at you , it 's only normal to have the SOS , who happened to be in the senate that never confirmed you because you was unfit to be the UN ambassador , laughing at you as well .
What Hillary did and it was priceless .
Anvil are planning to release their 13th album
Canadian rockers
Anvil , who spent years in obscurity before a film about their struggle became a hit , have been chosen as the support act for AC / DC .
The band will be the sole secondary act for the rock giants at two stadium concerts in the US next month .
Their dogged determination to succeed was captured in rockumentary The Story of Anvil , a film festival hit .
The band has played a series of concerts across the US , and will play at the Download Festival this weekend .
Commercial failure
Anvil is due to return to the US after its visit to the UK with performances at the three - day Rocklahoma Festival next month .
The band is due to share the bill with rock acts including Anthrax and Twisted Sister .
AC / DC scored a UK number album with Black Ice in November
The DVD release of the Anvil documentary has been brought forward three months , while their next album - the 13th in their career - is set to come out later in the summer .
The band , who formed in Toronto some 30 years ago , failed to gain commercial success .
But bands including Metallica and Motorhead cite them as an influence , and famous faces including actor Keanu Reeves and Coldplay 's Chris Martin count themselves as fans .
The two concerts supporting AC / DC will take place at the Gillette Stadium in Boston on 28 July and New Jersey 's Giants Stadium three days later .
I guess Vanessa Hudgens was bored when Montreal shooting her new movie , mainly because she never called me to hang out , and everyone know ’s I am a whole lot of fuckin ’ fun , especially when I dirty dance like I was Patrick Swayze , post terminal cancer , not when he was still virile , because these nude / topless / sexy pics of her have hit the internet .
I guess it is possible that this is n’t her , but I like to think that it is , because it makes my life work feel a little more relevant , not to mention if you were dating a faggot like she was , and not realize he ’s gay , like she does n’t , you ’d start pullin ’ all the stops to try to turn the motherfucker on , since being a chick who gets rejected for sex fucks with your self esteem a lot and makes you do things like this .
I am not too sure what the deal is with her nipples , but I blame scientific cross - breeding that went on in her mother ’s womb , sometimes it just does n’t work out and weird shit come out of it .
This is n’t the first time she ’s had pics like this surface , it wo n’t be the last , she ’s moving away from her Disney image and stripping in her next movie , and I guess this is all part of communicating that to the public , because you know behind every leaked celeb picture is a team of lawyers , agents , managers , advisors , PR people , making sure it goes down flawlessly .
This kind of thing does n’t just happen , it is all part of a bigger cause / machine and you are an idiot if you think otherwise .

The four Premier League representatives – Manchester United , Chelsea , Liverpool and Arsenal – had reasonable fortunes in the draw for the group stages of the Champions League , avoiding the most powerful of the second seeds , while Rangers will be happy that they , too , have a decent chance of progressing .
Manchester United , last season 's losing finalists , were drawn against CSKA Moscow , Besiktas and Wolfsburg in Group B. Chelsea were grouped with Porto , Atlético Madrid and the Cypriot champions , Apoel Nicosia in Group D. Liverpool face Lyon , Fiorentina and the Hungarian champions , Debreceni , in Group E. Arsenal tackle AZ Alkmaar , Olympiakos and Standard Liege in Group H. Rangers were drawn against the seeded Sevilla , Stuttgart and the Romanian champions , Unirea Urziceni , Champions League newcomers , in Group G .
Barcelona , as champions , were seeded , along with the four Premier League sides , plus Sevilla , Milan and Bayern Munich .
Barça , in Group F , must face Internazionale , and make long trips to Dynamo Kiev , in Ukraine , and Rubin Kazan , the Russian champions .
Milan will have a first - hand chance to assess how Florentino Pérez 's new galácticos are bedding in at Real Madrid , as well as playing Marseille and FC Zurich in Group C. Bayern Munich were joined by Juventus , Bordeaux and Maccabi Haifa in Group A .
Wolfsburg , the German champions and the strongest of the sides in the fourth tier of seeds , will give United a test .
Atlético Madrid troubled Liverpool last year and will hope to do the same to Chelsea .
Lyon have regularly progressed to the knockout stages and Fiorentina , too , will be difficult opponents for Liverpool .
But having avoided Real , Inter and Juventus from the second seeds , all the Premier League clubs must feel that they have been given every chance to maintain the consistent qualification of recent years , while in landing Sevilla , Rangers were drawn against one of the weaker top seeds .

IF THE opinion polls are to be believed , Barack Obama is now , six months into his presidency , no more popular than George Bush or Richard Nixon were at the same stage in theirs .
His ratings are sagging particularly badly with electorally vital independent voters : two - thirds of them think he wants to spend too much of their money .
Two of the most specific pledges he made to the electorate — to reform health care and to produce a cap - and - trade system to curb greenhouse - gas emissions — are in trouble .
And an impression is being formed in Washington of a presidency that is far too ready to hand over the direction of domestic policy to Congress ; that is drifting either deliberately or lethargically leftwards ; and that is more comfortable with lofty visions than details .
On the campaign trail Mr Obama showed an impressive ability to change gears .
He needs to do so again this summer .
His cause is by no means hopeless .
Just as his initial Messianic polling numbers were misleadingly optimistic , his problems should now be put into context .
Most obviously , nearly 200 days into office , he has avoided making any horrific mistakes , especially in the fraught business of economic policy .
On the hardly insignificant matter of restoring America 's reputation in the world he has delivered a degree of what he promised ( though even there the tough times are still ahead of him , as our next leader makes clear ) .
He has had to cope with the worst recession for half a century .
He has been curiously ill - served by a press short of useful criticism , with liberal America prepared only to debate what sort of water he walks on best , while conservative radio hosts argue over when exactly he became a communist .
And of course , government is darned hard : even when you make the right decision — to close Guantánamo , for instance — it can take years to put into effect .
So Mr Obama 's underperformance is relative and partial ; but it is serious , especially in domestic policy .
And if his schemes at home come to naught , then his credibility abroad will wither .
That is why the next few weeks are crucial .
Taking too much care of Hillarycare
In foreign policy an American president enjoys the most freedom of operation .
At home the man in the Oval Office is mightily constrained by Congress .
It is the artful combination of arm - twisting , compromise , rhetoric and gritty attention to detail that make the difference between an FDR and a Jimmy Carter .
Back in his honeymoon days Mr Obama was constantly compared to Roosevelt .
No longer .
The suspicion is that the president has taken the experience of Bill Clinton too much to heart .
The previous Democratic presidency got off to a rocky start for many reasons , but his failed attempt to impose health - care reform on Congress in 1993 - 94 bulks largest .
Putting Hillary Clinton in charge of an unwieldy , secretive task - force that attempted to present powerful senators with a masterplan backfired .
Congress promptly shot it down — and Mr Clinton lost both the House and the Senate to the Republicans in 1994 .
A president plainly should not ignore Congress .
But Mr Obama has veered to the opposite extreme .
Although he has a White House stuffed full of first - rate policy wonks , he has repeatedly subcontracted the big decisions — the $ 787 billion stimulus bill , cap - and - trade , health reform — to the Democratic leadership in Congress .
At times Mr Obama 's role has seemed limited to deploying his teleprompter - driven oratory to sell whatever Congress proposes to the public , even before it is clear what exactly those proposals amount to .
Nobody voted for President Pelosi
Worse , the plans have usually ended up running away from tough decisions .
With the stimulus bill the flaws were forgivable : there was an urgent need to give the economy a boost .
But the House of Representatives has produced a cap - and - trade bill that is protectionist , riddled with exemptions and which gives away the permits that are supposed to force carbon - emitters to change their ways .
There is a growing danger that this bill will not be passed through the Senate and reconciled with the House version in time for the Copenhagen summit on climate change in December .
With health care , Mr Obama 's preference for vague statements of principle rather than detailed specification has led to a House proposal that loads taxes onto the rich , sets up a state - run insurance scheme that many fear will put private - sector providers out of business and fails to contain , let alone reverse , the escalating costs of treatment while adding an expensive requirement that everyone have health insurance , with large subsidies where needed ( see article ) .
Barely any Republicans could support this proposal as it stands .
Frantic efforts to save the reform effort are under way in the Senate , but it is distinctly odd to note that the president 's signature policy is now being devised for him by a gang of six senators .
Financial regulation is also stuck ( see article ) .
A policy of ramming bills through Congress on a party - line basis might suit Nancy Pelosi , the Democrats ' leftish leader in the House .
But , from Mr Obama 's point of view , it is bad politics in two different ways .
It is shifting the presidency to the left , annoying centrist voters who worry about the swelling government debt .
And it may not even get the bills through .
Conservative Democrats , many of whom represent right - leaning states and districts recently captured from the Republicans ( see article ) , are nervous about backing bills without bipartisan support .
Over 40 of them broke ranks in the House over the climate - change bill .
Now there is the likelihood that health reform , like the climate - change bill , will be deferred until the autumn , when fears about the deficit will have grown and the two expensive bills could combine to spook voters .
What should Mr Obama do ?
He must come down from his cloud and start leading .
The House Democrats could be usefully reminded that their present 78 - seat margin owes everything to the president 's coat - tails ; they are endangering his popularity .
Mr Obama should also court centrist Republicans .
That means getting into the nitty - gritty : Republicans can hardly be expected to save Mr Obama 's presidency unless they get something solid in return .
For instance , one way to pay for bringing the uninsured into the health - care system ( a noble Democratic priority ) is to scrap a distorting tax - deduction that veils the true cost of health insurance , a policy espoused by John McCain last year .
A real “ post - partisan ” president would be trying to bully through this compromise , not talking dreamily about wanting health care for all at no cost to anybody but the rich .
And on the subject of detail , precise talk from the president about how he intends to grapple with government debt would reassure a lot of centrist waverers .
None of this is impossible .
As The Economist went to press , hopes were rising that the Senate finance committee might soon produce a bipartisan version of the health bill .
But then the final version of that bill will have to be reconciled with the much - worse House version .
If the result is another lazy deficit - boosting , hard - decision - avoiding scheme ( like George Bush 's rotten Medicare bill ) , what president would want to be remembered for that ?
Mr Obama remains an inspiring figure .
But he needs to get his hands dirty this summer if he is to rescue a presidency that has started to slip .
Kiminori Itoh of Yokohama National University has prepared a guest weblog for us .
It is titled “ Soot And The Arctic Ice – A Win- Win Policy Based On Chinese Coal Fired Power Plants ” [ UPDATE : see also Mike Smith ’s Guest Weblog on this subject ]
GUEST WEBLOG
As you saw in a recent weblog in Climate Science , China appears to be modifying the global climate through aerosol emission from a large number of coal fired power plants : August 12 , 2009 , New Paper “ Increase In Background Stratospheric Aerosol Observed With Lidar ” By Hofmann Et Al 2009 .
This paper gave me an idea that soot from China may be responsible for the recent reduction of the Arctic ice , which finally leads me to a Win - Win policy on coal fired power plants in China , as you see below .
The target of the paper of Hofmann et al was sulfate aerosol transported into stratosphere .
Thus , its main effect on the global climate is cooling of the troposphere and warming of the stratosphere similar to volcanic eruptions .
In fact , this paper was introduced in Science ( 24 July 2009 , p. 373 ) with the title of “ China ’s Human Volcano . ”
The Chinese aerosol , however , can have another effect on the climate .
That is , a possible influence of soot on the Arctic ice .
It seems to me that Hofmann et al . ’s paper , together with other recent findings , gives evidence for this possibility as follows :
1 ) Hofmann et al ’s paper shows that stratospheric haze became densest in 2007 and declined a little after that .
According to their claim , this is associated with the changes in sulfate emissions from China .
This fact reminds me that the ice extent in the Arctic sea was significantly reduced in the 2007 summer and recovered after that .
Since the amount soot should be proportional to that of sulfate , also the amount soot transported to the Arctic may have a peak in 2007 , and may explain the dramatic reduction of the sea ice extent ; the soot deposited onto the ice surfaces absorbs sun light of Arctic summer , gives heat to the ice , and lets it melt .
This process should be particularly effective during summer of the Arctic when the sun does not set .
2 ) About half of the recent temperature increase in the Arctic region is reportedly due to aerosols ( combination effects of sulfate and soot ) ( D. Shindell and G. Faluvegi , Nature Geosci . 2 , 294-300 ( 2009 ) ) ; this result convinces one that the influence of soot on the Arctic environment does exist .
3 ) There are other recent papers on soot : e. g. , “ Atmospheric brown clouds : Hemispherical and regional variations in long - range transport , absorption , and radiative forcing , ” V. Ramanathan et al. , J. Geophys .
Res. vol .
112 , D22S21 , doi:10.1029/2006JD008124 , 2007 .
From these results , I suspect that the soot from China is responsible for the recent reduction of sea ice in the Arctic summer .
To verify this , detailed chemical analyses , such as carbon allotropes , should be made if the soot can be sampled from the ice ( this may be an interesting project ) .
Thus , I can claim that the influence of the soot is likely large .
Then , according to the spirit of the precautionary principle , the soot from China should be reduced even if the scientific basis is not sufficient .
The precautionary principle should be applied not just to CO2 , but to other primary factors of climate changes .
If this is not possible just because there is no statement on soot in the FCCC ( Framework of Convention of Climate Change ) , we need another convention ( or protocol ) which enables us to treat soot properly .
Otherwise , countermeasures on climate change will be useless .
Now , I want to point out that the reduction of the Chinese soot can become a Win-Win policy for China as well as for other countries .
About 80 % of the Chinese electricity comes from coal fired power plants .
The CO2 emission from China in 2004 was about 2.27 billion metric tons , which was 8.6 % of the world emissions ( 26.3 billion metric tons ) .
But , their efficiency of energy production is still low ( 34.6 % as an average ) , and emissions other than CO2 and aerosol ( i. e. , mainly SOx , NOx and mercury ) bring heavy health problems as well .
In fact , resultant atmospheric pollution causes 300 thousands to 400 thousands of deaths a year .
If countries like Japan , which has advanced technologies of coal fired power plants ( e. g. , energy production efficiency being 41.1 % in Japan ) , can cooperate with China to increase the efficiency of energy production and to decrease all kinds of emissions , this will become a true Win-Win policy .
China can save a lot of human lives and working hours , can reduce the influence of the aerosol on the global climate , and in addition , can reduce CO2 emission .
The other countries also benefit from this policy , including economical ones and a reduction of transboundary pollution .
This Win-Win policy actually will reduce the emission of CO2 .
Just from this aspect , it is much better than the cap - and - trade policy which in fact will increase the CO2 emissions .
Moreover , and importantly , when considering a large capacity of coal reserves , this is a reasonable tactics in near future .
With this kind of Win-Win policies , developing countries like China can agree with developed countries on their energy policies .
There will be no progress in the negotiation between them if the developing countries can participate in the climate policies only through the reduction of CO2 .
We need flexible approaches for complicated issues like the climate changes .

The giant anvil - shaped cloud hovering 75,000ft above Earth is photographed by Space Station astronauts

A giant , anvil - shaped cloud bubbles up towards the Earth 's stratosphere , looming over West Africa .
The amazing formation would be invisible to anyone on the ground and would even be obscure from a regular passenger jet since they can reach up to 75,000ft .
But astronauts captured the astonishing picture from hundreds of miles up as they orbited the globe on the International Space Station .
Anvil clouds are formed mostly from ice and normally form in the upper parts of thunderstorms .
They get their shape from the fact that rising warm air in thunderstorms expands and spreads out as the air bumps up against the bottom of the stratosphere .
Streaks of snow are often seen falling out of the edges of anvils .
This light snow usually evaporates as it falls through the relatively dry air surrounding the upper part of the thunderstorm .

The United States Supreme Court will hear the U.S. government ’s appeal on a lower - court ruling requiring the release of photos showing the abuse of prisoners held in overseas facilities .
The government is appealing a 2008 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which ruled that the government must release the photos to comply with an American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit .
The Obama administration initially agreed to release the photos  and decided not to appeal the court ’s decision  but they reversed their position on May 28 when the government asked the appeals court to recall its order for the photos release since an appeal was to be filed in the Supreme Court .
The Second Circuit Court of Appeals agreed and recalled its order that the photos be released .
" These photos are a crucial part of the historical record , and the appeals court was right to find that they should be released , " said Director of the ACLU National Security Project Jameel Jaffer .
" It ’s disappointing that the Obama administration , which has rightly acknowledged the connection between transparency and accountability , is continuing to argue that these photographs should be suppressed . "
Human rights groups were enthusiastic about Obama ’s commitment in his first week in office to create " an unprecedented level of openness in government " and " establish a system of transparency , public participation , and collaboration . "
But the administration has blocked lawsuits related to its usage of " extraordinary renditions " and warrantless wiretapping on the basis that " state secrets " could be put in danger were the lawsuits to move forward .
While previous lawsuits have been successfully blocked , ACLU attorneys are hopeful that the Supreme Court will agree with the appeals court decision to release the photos .
" The appeals court soundly rejected all of the government ’s arguments for withholding the photos , and it ’s unfortunate that the government has chosen to contest that decision , " said ACLU staff attorney Amrit Singh .
" These photos would provide visual proof that prisoner abuse by U.S. personnel was not aberrational but widespread , reaching far beyond the walls of Abu Ghraib .
As disturbing as the photos may be , it is critical that the American people know the full truth about the abuse that occurred in their name . "
In a July 29 letter to Senators Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) and Lindsay Graham ( R - S.C. ) , Obama outlined that he would work with Congress to pass legislation that would classify photographic or video evidence of U.S. soldiers committing acts of prisoner abuse against detainees in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The administration has suggested that the release of such photos could put in danger the lives of individuals working on military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , but the ACLU and other proponents of releasing the photos have agreed with the court ’s earlier decision that the identity of all individuals pictured in the photos should be obscured .
Congress will look at the proposed legislation when they return from their summer break in September , but Obama may find opposition from within his own party the most difficult obstacle .
" The U.S. should not restrict access to intelligence solely to prevent information that might prove politically embarrassing from becoming public , when it poses no legitimate national security threat .
This is especially the case when the information in question bears on an allegation as deeply troubling as torture , " Representative Bill Delahunt ( D - Mass . ) wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Attorney General Eric Holder .
" I suggest that the U.S. itself should make that information public , or at least remove our objection to its release .
Justice and democratic accountability overwhelmingly support the release of this information . "
Even as the Obama administration works to classify or prevent the release of the torture photos , the Chicago Tribune reported yesterday that Attorney General Eric Holder will appoint a special prosecutor to investigate allegations that the CIA participated in torturing detainees and  in some cases  the torture resulted in death .
The investigation will likely focus on whether lower - level CIA officials overstepped their authority in using interrogation techniques that went beyond the approved set of procedures set forth in Bush administration memos .
( Inter Press Service )
A storm is brewing in Israel over the Israel Defence Forces ' ( IDF ) chief rabbi's opposition to women serving in the armed forces , with politicians and pundits alike calling for his head in the wake of the controversy .
Rabbi Avichai Rontzki's stance is based on his interpretation of Jewish law , which cuts little ice among secular sectors of Israeli society – many of whom express growing concern that the army is falling into the clutches of the national religious camp .
According to Haim Oron , leader of the New Movement - Meretz party :
Rontzki's comments highlight the trend where instead of religious Zionism adopting the values of the IDF and the country , the IDF and country are adopting the values of religious Zionism , in its nationalist and orthodox version .
If this trend continues , the IDF may be transformed from an army of the people to Phalangists carrying religious artefacts .
His fears are not as far - fetched as they may appear to those who still view the IDF as a broadly secular state institution .
During Operation Cast Lead , soldiers were issued with pamphlets from IDF chaplains that attempted to paint the conflict as no less than a holy war being waged on behalf of world Jewry .
A friend of mine who was deployed to the Gaza border showed me one such leaflet , in which troops were told they were " fighting a war for the Jewish people " , rather than on behalf of all Israel 's citizens .
" I thought ' what would a Bedouin soldier make of such statements ? ' , " he said .
" The Bedouin soldier would be there to stop rockets falling [ on his homeland ] , not to fight God 's war . "
The jihadist bent of such propaganda is another sign of the " army 's shift to the right " , he explained .
Statistics bear out his assertion , with 20 % of officers hailing from national religious backgrounds , proportionally much higher than the make - up of the general population .
One senior IDF officer attributes the figures to the attitudes to army service among the national religious community versus those of the more secular populace .
" The national - religious are replacing the kibbutzniks in the ranks of combat and command , " he said .
" They learn at home the importance of sacrifice for the nation and of giving of themselves for the state . "
While most ultra-orthodox Israelis still refuse to send their children to the army , those from the national religious camp have no problem with their offspring serving the state in such a fashion ; in fact , such a display of commitment to the country is endemic to the nationalist element of their communal politics .
At ground level the influx of soldiers adhering to religious laws and principles is not necessarily a bad thing for those against whom the troops are operating , since their strict observance of Jewish law requires them to behave in a more humane fashion than many of their less religious peers often do .
However , on a wider level , the discord between religious and military leaders ' stance towards Israeli policy places observant soldiers in a quandary when it comes to implementation of certain strategies .
A case in point was the Disengagement of 2005 , when many of the religious members of my brigade refused to participate in the evacuation of the settlement of Homesh in which we assisted .
Soldiers from settler backgrounds , as well as those simply ideologically opposed to the move , were treated with kid gloves by commanders anxious to avoid an internal confrontation , rather than dealing with their insubordination in accordance with army guidelines .
By backing down and allowing external factors to disrupt the regular chain of command , a precedent was set that is likely to come back to haunt the IDF if any similar withdrawal from the West Bank is attempted in the coming years .
Settler leaders have been whipping their followers into an ever - growing frenzy ever since the first Disengagement , and their fighting talk acts to dampen the ardour of any politician or military strategist considering such a move , despite believing it to be in the long - term interests of Israeli security .
The divergent paths taken by the state 's leaders and the national religious hierarchy in terms of ceding land raises the very real prospect of a mass mutiny within the ranks of orthodox troops , and must not be overlooked by those with an interest in the stability of the region .
Much is made by the Israeli right of hostile forces having been co-opted into a wider religious war ; with Islamic Jihad , Hamas and al - Qaida militias regularly held up as proof that Israel 's enemies cannot be placated via negotiations or concessions .
Those groups ' religious convictions are , they assert , intractable to the point of no return , and the only way to fight against such intransigence is through the sights of a gun .
However , the same characteristics can , and should , be ascribed to a growing section of the IDF , especially in the wake of statements such as Rontzki's , as well as the military rabbinate 's crusader stance during Cast Lead .
On one level , Rontzki's " chauvinistic and patronising " attitude towards female soldiers can be easily dismissed as the ranting of a man utterly stuck in the past , who refuses to accept that the world has progressed past the patriarchal atmosphere prevalent in biblical times .
But far more worrying is the fact that such backward - thinking fundamentalists should be permitted so much leeway to spread their influence among the country 's soldiers , and afforded such positions of power within the IDF .
Religious dogma has no place in such an institution ; to allow such corrosive and dangerous thinking to pervade as sensitive an arena as Israel 's armed forces is simply a recipe for disaster .
In Dismantling the Temple , William Greider lists
Six reasons why granting the Fed even more power is a terrible idea :
1 . It would reward failure .
Like the largest banks that have been bailed out , the Fed was a co-author of the destruction .
During the past twenty - five years , it failed to protect the country against reckless banking and finance adventures .
It also failed in its most basic function -- moderating the expansion of credit to keep it in balance with economic growth .
The Fed instead allowed , even encouraged , the explosion of debt and inflation of financial assets that have now collapsed .
The central bank was derelict in enforcing regulations and led cheers for dismantling them .
Above all , the Fed did not see this disaster coming , or so it claims .
It certainly did nothing to warn people .
2. Cumulatively , Fed policy was a central force in destabilizing the US economy .
Its extreme swings in monetary policy , combined with utter disregard for timely regulatory enforcement , steadily shifted economic rewards away from the real economy of production , work and wages and toward the financial realm , where profits and incomes were wildly inflated by false valuations .
Abandoning its role as neutral arbitrator , the Fed tilted in favor of capital over labor .
The institution was remolded to conform with the right - wing market doctrine of chairman Alan Greenspan , and it was blinded to reality by his ideology ( see my Nation article " The One - Eyed Chairman , " September 19 , 2005 ) .
3 . The Fed cannot possibly examine " systemic risk " objectively because it helped to create the very structural flaws that led to breakdown .
The Fed served as midwife to Citigroup , the failed conglomerate now on government life support .
Greenspan unilaterally authorized this new financial / banking combine in the 1990s - - even before Congress had repealed the Glass - Steagall Act , which prohibited such mergers .
Now the Fed keeps Citigroup alive with a $ 300 billion loan guarantee .
The central bank , in other words , is deeply invested in protecting the banking behemoths that it promoted , if only to cover its own mistakes .
4 . The Fed can't be trusted to defend the public in its private deal - making with bank executives .
The numerous revelations of collusion have shocked the public , and more scandals are certain if Congress conducts a thorough investigation .
When Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was president of the New York Fed , he supervised the demise of Bear Stearns with a sweet deal for JPMorgan Chase , which took over the failed brokerage -- $ 30 billion to cover any losses .
Geithner was negotiating with Morgan Chase CEO and New York Fed board member Jamie Dimon .
Goldman Sachs CEO
Lloyd Blankfein got similar solicitude when the Fed bailed out insurance giant AIG , a Goldman counterparty : a side - door payout of $ 13 billion .
The new president at the New York Fed , William Dudley , is another Goldman man .
5 . Instead of disowning the notorious policy of " too big to fail , " the Fed will be bound to embrace the doctrine more explicitly as " systemic risk " regulator .
A new superclass of forty or fifty financial giants will emerge as the born - again " money trust " that citizens railed against 100 years ago .
But this time , it will be armed with a permanent line of credit from Washington .
The Fed , having restored and consolidated the battered Wall Street club , will doubtless also shield a few of the largest industrial - financial corporations , like General Electric ( whose CEO also sits on the New York Fed board ) .
Whatever officials may claim , financial - market investors will understand that these mammoth institutions are insured against failure .
Everyone else gets to experience capitalism in the raw .
6 . This road leads to the corporate state -- a fusion of private and public power , a privileged club that dominates everything else from the top down .
This will likely foster even greater concentration of financial power , since any large company left out of the protected class will want to join by growing larger and acquiring the banking elements needed to qualify .
Most enterprises in banking and commerce will compete with the big boys at greater disadvantage , vulnerable to predatory power plays the Fed has implicitly blessed .
Uncertainty Principle Corollary Number Two :
The government / quasi - government body most responsible for creating this mess ( the Fed ) , will attempt a big power grab , purportedly to fix whatever problems it creates .
The bigger the mess it creates , the more power it will attempt to grab .
Over time this leads to dangerously concentrated power into the hands of those who have already proven they do not know what they are doing .
In this emergency , Bernanke essentially used the Fed 's money - creation power in a way that resembles the " greenbacks " Abraham Lincoln printed to fight the Civil War .
Lincoln was faced with rising costs and shrinking revenues ( because the Confederate states had left the Union ) .
The president authorized issuance of a novel national currency -- the " greenback " -- that had no backing in gold reserves and therefore outraged orthodox thinking .
But the greenbacks worked .
The expanded money supply helped pay for war mobilization and kept the economy booming .
In a sense , Lincoln won the war by relying on the " full faith and credit " of the people , much as Bernanke is printing money freely to fight off financial collapse and deflation .
If Congress chooses to take charge of its constitutional duty , it could similarly use greenback currency created by the Federal Reserve as a legitimate channel for financing important public projects -- like sorely needed improvements to the nation 's infrastructure .
Obviously , this has to be done carefully and responsibly , limited to normal expansion of the money supply and used only for projects that truly benefit the entire nation ( lest it lead to inflation ) .
But here is an example of how it would work .
The reform of monetary policy , in other words , has promising possibilities for revitalizing democracy .
Congress is a human institution and therefore fallible .
Mistakes will be made , for sure .
But we might ask ourselves , If Congress were empowered to manage monetary policy , could it do any worse than those experts who brought us to ruin ?
Letting Congress Manage Money Supply Is Pure Insanity

Treating children with inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) usually involves the same steroids - based medication prescribed to adults .
But such treatments can have negative side effects for kids and teens dealing with IBD .
Dr. Raanan Shamir of Tel Aviv University 's Sackler School of Medicine and Schneider Children 's Medical Centre shows that there is another path to treating IBD in children : a nutritional formula that was first developed for astronauts .
This supplement puts 60 - 70 % of children with Crohn 's disease , a common IBD disorder , into remission — a success rate similar to that of traditional steroid - based drugs , but without side effects like malnutrition and growth retardation .
Dr. Shamir recently reported his research in the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition .
Eating Like an Astronaut
Dr. Shamir's research was inspired by the problem of malnutrition and growth retardation in children battling IBD .
Steroids and other biological agents , the most common treatment for IBD , were having an adverse affect on the children 's growth , despite their effectiveness in adult patients .
It was a problem first tackled by NASA :
How could astronauts most efficiently get their daily nutrients ?
The answer was a specially - designed powder that contains all the daily nutrients a person needs .
Aboard spacecrafts , astronauts dine on this nutritional powder mixed with water .
Since then , these powders have become a common item on the pharmacy shelf .

A similar concept works wonders for children suffering from IBD .
" Prepared powder , with liquids , gives you all the nutritional requirements you need for the day , " Dr. Shamir explains .
" We do n't know why these formulas work , and nobody has shown that any one formula is preferable to another .
People have to be committed and eat nothing else during the period of time they are on nutrition therapy , and it is difficult to do — but if they do it , they go into remission . "
To induce remission , children need to be on nutrition therapy for 6 - 8 weeks .
And in order to maintain remission , 25 - 50 % of their caloric intake must be supplied by nutrition therapy , sometimes for years .
This is why children experiencing the treatment need the support of physicians , dieticians , psychologists , and of course their families .
Dr. Shamir's quest to educate the international medical community about the benefits of nutrition therapy has been an uphill battle .
" The acceptance of this is difficult , " he says .
" You have to persuade the family .
Not all physicians know it works , and it's much easier to give someone a prescription than try to work with the child . "
A Replacement for Steroids
" In adults , studies have shown that steroids are more effective in the battle against IBD than nutrition - based therapies .
I think it is easier to get compliance from children , especially when it involves their growth .
For adults , growth is not a concern — they just want to feel better , " explains Dr. Shamir .
Dr. Shamir and his team of researchers have worked to show the international medical community that nutrition was equal to steroids in the treatment of children with IBD .
" We published the most recent meta - analysis to show that nutrition is as good as steroids as a first - line therapy for Crohn 's disease , " he says .
The next step in his research , says Dr. Shamir , is to " define exactly the role of nutrition in inducing remission in these patients , and the role of nutrition in maintaining remission .
The pilot of a small airplane was able to walk away after its crash landing was cushioned by a bunch of portable toilets near Tacoma , Wash .
Gary Mayor of the Federal Aviation Administration says the Cessna 182 crashed shortly after 3 p.m. Friday as it was taking off from Thun Field , an airfield owned by Pierce County southeast of Tacoma .
Sheriff 's spokesman Ed Troyer says the plane was about 150 feet in the air when the engine quit .
He tells The News Tribune that the pilot , the only person on board , tried to turn around to land , but did n't quite make it .
The plane hit a fence , flipped over and landed upside down on top of the portable toilets , which were in a storage yard just northwest of the runway .
Several of the toilets were toppled , but a damage estimate and the pilot 's identity were n't immediately available .
Herschel , the largest far - infrared telescope ever launched into space , has taken its first image !
Whoa .
That 's M51 , better known as the Whirlpool Galaxy , a nearby spiral galaxy ( well , 25 million light years is close on an intergalactic scale ) .
It 's face - on to us , allowing us to see its magnificent spiral arms and all the structure therein .
Herschel is sensitive to far - infrared light , much lower energy than what our eyes can see .
In galaxies , the brightest emitter of that kind of light is dust located near and in between stars , and dust is created by stars when they are born ( and when massive ones die ) .
Star birth happens in the spiral arms of these kinds of galaxies , so when Herschel looked at M51 that 's what it saw : the spiral arms outlined by the warm dust within them .
The brights spots are where dust is being warmed by young , massive stars .
It 's falsely colored blue in the image , meaning it 's the highest energy flavor of IR light Herschel sees ; to our eyes it would still be invisibly far in the infrared .
If you 're used to Hubble images , this one looks a little fuzzy .
That 's because the resolution of a telescope -- that is , how well it can resolve small objects -- depends on the size of the mirror and the wavelength of light it sees .
Optical light , the kind we see , has a far , far smaller wavelength than infrared , so images in optical light have much higher resolution , and look sharper .
But for science , we want to know how much better Herschel does than previous far - infrared telescopes , and that depends on its mirror .
Herschel wins here by a lot : its mirror is 3.5 meters across !
Spitzer , the NASA observatory that has been taking such wonderful IR images of celestial objects , has a mirror less than a meter across , so Herschel 's eye is far sharper .
Compare !
You can see that Herschel 's view of M51 is a lot sharper than Spitzer 's at these long wavelengths .
This means that with Herschel , astronomers will have a better infrared view of the sky than ever before .
[ Update : To be clear , Spitzer was not optimized for wavelengths this far in the IR , so its resolution in that image above is actually not as good as what it could do at shorter IR regions ; for example check out this stunning M51 image taken by Spitzer in the nearer infrared to see what it can do ! ]
And this is just the first image , a test of the telescope 's abilities .
In the coming weeks , months , and years , we 'll be seeing far more from this new eye in the sky , and I am very much looking forward to seeing what it sees .
Tip o' the dew cap to Amanda .

50 % Time
A couple weeks ago , Uncle Bob tweeted :
At the time I was finishing Malcom Gladwell ’s Outliers , a book that digs deep into the stories and counter - cultural explanations of successful people .
Having someone so close to my context tweeting about a topic related to the book I was reading helped me see something I had n’t noticed before .
I ’ve spent years trying to make sense of how a person evolves from a novice programmer to an accomplished software developer .
And up until now I have n’t paid enough attention to the raw number of hours spent deliberately working to improve oneself .
Uncle Bob calls us to work a sustainable pace in our day jobs ( 40 hours ) , so we have time ( 20 hours ) to improve ourselves in the off - hours .
Most people do n’t do that , though .
It ’s not considered normal .
People who spend time doing more of what appears to be their job in the off - hours are seen as obsessed or workaholics .
Maybe we are , there is some grey area there , and I know I ’ve taken it too far before .
One of the ingredients to being an outlier , though , is an opportunity to work hard .
Sure , many outliers have had some good breaks , like being born in the right decade ( American entrepreneurs in the 1830 ’s ) or even the right month ( Canadian junior hockey players in January ) , but that luck only provided them with an opportunity to work hard at something that they wanted to do .
I ’m not calling myself an outlier , but I certainly aspire to be one .
In the little corner of the software development world that I live in , we call our outliers master craftsmen .
My journey toward mastery began in an uncommon way .
I started programming when I was 26 , after I was married , after I had children , and after my wife and I decided she would stay at home with the kids until they were older .
For better or worse , I also suck at personal finance ( ever so slowly getting better at it ) , and that means that I have a fairly constant pressure on me to make sure I ’m increasing my income .
All of those forces provided me with an opportunity / motivation to work hard on an activity I enjoy while limiting my “ day job ” hours to 40 .
Uncle Bob ’s tweet took me back to 2001 when my interest in programming exploded .
Thanks to the constraints that my family provided , I stood my ground on working no more than 40 hours with my employers .
But once the kids and Staci were asleep , I was working on my own projects , reading programming books , and blogging about what I was learning , all with free or very cheap tools and information .
I did n’t sleep much between 2001 - 2007 , and I had never considered condoning that sort of obsession in anyone else .
It was certainly a sacrifice , and took a toll on my health and my marriage .
Looking back on it , though , I realize that this sort of intense effort is what makes a successful apprenticeship .
And so I find myself looking back on 2 years of Obtiva ’s apprenticeship program .
We ’ve had 6 people join us as apprentices , and I ’m seeing some patterns .
I ’ve learned some things that I will look for in future apprentice candidates , such as what they do in their spare time .
Are they already contributing to or reading open source ?
Are they working on side projects ?
Are they already blogging and / or tweeting about what they ’re learning ?
Are they seeking out book recommendations ?
These are the sorts of behaviors that indicate they will likely be successful apprentices .
As their “ boss ” , as an owner of Obtiva , I ’m certainly not going to require anyone to work more than 40 hours .
So I ’ve found myself fooling myself into thinking that if only we could make those 40 hours as positive and learning - friendly as possible , apprenticeships will flourish .
I fooled myself into thinking that if only I had had a “ real ” apprenticeship , I would n’t have had to spend all those sleepless nights striving for mastery .
But nowadays , I ’m getting the feeling that there really is no substitute for those 20 hours devoted to your own self - improvement .
The 40 hours will teach you all sorts of things , but that time is constrained by business concerns , and this is a good thing , it ’s a healthy dose of reality .
The 20 hours are yours though , constrained only by your energy , passion and boundaries .
I worry that by blogging these thoughts our current and future apprentices will feel I ’m implicity requiring them to spend 20 hours per week outside of work on learning activities .
First off , I ca n’t legally do that in the state of Illinois .
But secondly , I do n’t want you to do it if you do n’t want to do it .
I only worked that hard because of the pressures I had on me and because I genuinely enjoyed the process .
I think it would be silly to try to force yourself to do it , you ’d end up burning out .
Really , I ’m talking to two groups of people .
To those who are already spending their spare time on becoming a better developer , I want you to know that your efforts will pay off , but understand that it will take between 5 - 10 years to see the most significant benefits of your efforts .
To those who want to become a great developer but hold themselves back out of fear of failure or hard work , I hope to inspire you to give it a shot .
We work in an exciting field and everything you need to become great is available to you .
I ’ll leave off with my favorite quote from The Mythical Man Month :

Yet Another Reason to Get Breast Implants
Of all the reasons anyone has ever had for getting breast implants , I ’m guessing that no one ever thought of this one .
A body was recently found — a brutal murder in which the killer cut off the fingers of the victim and removed all her teeth in order to make identifying the body more difficult .
One thing he had n’t taken into account was that her breast implants would have serial numbers that would allow her to be positively identified .
History Of Postage Stamps
Before the introduction of postage stamps , mail were delivered and paid for by the receiver .
This led to a variety of problems such as when the receiver was unable or unwilling to pay for the delivery service .
It also allowed misuses of the system such as senders delivering pieces of mail just to annoy the receiver and making them pay for it at the same time ( much like the problems of spam today ) .
The postal system itself was also rocky , with mail often being lost or severely delayed .
Plagued by problems , the postal system clearly needed a reform very badly .
The answer came in 1840 in the form of postage stamps .
Instead of requiring the receiver to pay the postage for mail they may or may not want , the burden is shifted to that of the sender .
If you were living in Britain at the time , you would have had to buy a penny black stamp and affix it to your package using glue ( it 's not self adhesive like today 's stamps are ) , and drop it off at the post office .
This dramatically helped help the postal system reform as people are no longer bombarded by random pieces of mail .
The post office also got more money since people were paying up front , which allowed them to deliver mail more efficiently and on time .
It was n't long before other countries followed suit .
Switzerland issued their own Zurich stamps ( costing 4 and 6 rappan respectively ) only 3 years later in 1943 , and Brazil their Bull 's Eye stamps later that year .
Today , postage stamps are used to prepay for letters and packages throughout the world .
Martin Streek Dead
I 'm not sure how to write this one , so I 'm just going to tell you what I know .
As a long time fan of CFNY / Edge 102 , I was sad to learn recently that Martin Streek had been fired after over 20 years of service .
As of this writing , that entry had 88 comments from others who wanted to wish Martin well .
Soon enough , Martin Streek himself chimed in to say thanks .
Thank to those of you who made comments , both good and bad ... either way , it 's proof that you listened and / or cared about the scene I / we were part of ...
Earlier today , Martin Streek updated his Facebook status message with words that sound so ominous now .
This , it turns out , is Martin 's farewell to the world .
So ... I guess that 's it ... thanks everyone ... I 'm sorry to those I should be sorry to , I love you to those that I love , and I will see you all again soon ( not too soon though ) ...
Let the stories begin .
My entry about Martin Streek leaving CFNY / Edge102 is # 1 when you Google his name , and Steve did just that an hour ago .
I just heard that Martin has passed away ... very sad to hear ....
( I was a cfny staffer back in the 80s and just heard this from Earl J. )
At first , I thought it was a cruel joke .
Martin Streek seemed so vibrant , so full of life .
But after chatting with Steve , and seeing the Facebook status message , I 'm afraid it 's true .
Martin Streek has taken his own life .
A Sub-Saharan Conundrum German Archaeologists Labor to Solve Mystery of the Nok
Some 2,500 years ago , a mysterious culture emerged in Nigeria .
The Nok people left behind bizarre terracotta statues -- and little else .
German archaeologists are now looking for more clues to explain this obscure culture .
After nearly 30 years away from the part , Tom Baker is returning to Doctor Who !
Baker has recorded five audio dramas that will be released by the BBC starting in September at a rate of one a month .
While I ’m sure we ’d all love to see Baker on the new television series , audio is really the more logical choice given Tom ’s age and health .
Tom Baker ’s Doctor will be joined by former Who cast member Richard Franklin reprising his role as Mike Yates .
Here are the descriptions of each CD :
Doctor Who : Hornets ’ Nest – The Stuff of Nightmares
‘ Wanted : retired army Captain for light household duties and fireside companionship .
Must tolerate mild eccentricity and strong scientific advice .
Knowledge of Giant Maggots , Super Intelligent Spiders and Prehistoric Monsters a positive boon . ’
Responding to an advert apparently worded for him alone , Captain Mike Yates ( retired ) is reunited with a ghost from the past .
But why has the Doctor , that mysterious traveller in Time and Space , sent for his former UNIT acquaintance ?
Trapped by a horde of vicious creatures in an apparently innocuous English country cottage , the two old friends are on the brink of an enormous adventure .
As the Doctor relates his recent escapades , it becomes clear to Mike that they – and the Earth at large – are facing an enemy of unimaginable power and horrific intent .
The nightmare is only just beginning …
With Tom Baker as the Doctor , Richard Franklin as Mike Yates , Susan Jameson as Mrs Wibbsey and Daniel Hill as Percy Noggins , The Stuff of Nightmares is the first of five linked stories written by the acclaimed Paul Magrs .
Release Date : September 3 , 2009
Doctor Who : Hornets ’ Nest – The Dead Shoes
What is so special about a pair of ballet shoes on display in Cromer ’s Palace of Curios ?

Release Date : October 8 , 2009
Doctor Who : Hornets ’ Nest – The Circus of Doom
In Blandford , 1832 , ringmaster Antonio exerts a strange influence on the townsfolk .
When the Doctor steps into the ring , he discovers that Antonio has some familiar demons of his own …
The third of five linked stories written by the acclaimed Paul Magrs , The Circus of Doom also features Michael Maloney , Jilly Bond , Susie Riddell and Stephen Thorne .
Release Date : November 5 , 2009
Doctor Who : Hornets ’ Nest – A Sting in the Tale
In a bleak midwinter , an order of nuns protect their Mother Superior from ravaging dogs .

Release Date : December 3 , 2009
Click here to read an interview with Paul Magrs over at Outpost Skaro where he covers writing the scripts and meeting Tom Baker .
Paul Magrs has written several Doctor Who novels and audio dramas , and was a great choice as the author of these stories .
Magrs adventures tend to be large in scope and feature fantastical elements – very Tom Baker - esque stories .
A few online retailers are already taking pre-orders on these CDs .
For those of you here in the United States , I recommend Who North America for all your Doctor Who needs .
I ’m not sure if they are taking pre-orders yet , but they have the best customer service of any online retailer hands - down .
You can visit their site by clicking here .
If you ca n’t find something you are looking for , drop them an e-mail .
They are very accommodating .
Strangely enough , there has n’t been much press around Tom Baker ’s return to Doctor Who .
Given his long - lasting popularity , you ’d think there would have been more news already .
I suppose there will be more publicity as they get closer to the September release date .
On a personal note , I ’m really psyched about this !
I ca n’t believe that after all these years Tom Baker has finally agreed to return to the part .
I ca n’t wait !
In interviews , some E.P.A. officials conceded that they were frustrated by the limitations they face in scrutinizing chemicals like atrazine .
An estimated 33 million Americans have been exposed to atrazine through their taps , according to data from water systems nationwide .
“ The public believes that the E.P.A. has carefully reviewed all the chemicals that are used and has the authority it needs to deal with risks , but that ’s often not the case , ” said Erik D. Olson , director of food and consumer product safety at the Pew Charitable Trusts , and a former lawyer at the E.P.A. and for the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works .
“ The E.P.A. is working with weak laws , basic research at the agency is often seriously underfunded , and in some cases there ’s institutional inertia against change , ” he added .
“ That ’s contributed to a sense that the agency is often slow to react to new science showing risks . ”
Though the hazards posed by atrazine are far from clear , some scientists and health advocates argue that the chemical deserves special scrutiny because it is so widely used .
The European Union , for instance , has banned atrazine as part of a precautionary policy that prohibits pesticides that easily contaminate groundwater .
( European regulators did not evaluate the chemical ’s health risks . )
Atrazine , which is sold under various brand names including AAtrex , is most commonly used on corn in farming states .
But it can also be found on lawns , gardens , parks and golf courses .
Sometimes , the only way to avoid atrazine during summer months , when concentrations tend to rise as cropland is sprayed , is by forgoing tap water and relying on bottled water or using a home filtration system .
E.P.A. officials note that anyone using atrazine must complete a short training course and is warned to wear long - sleeve shirts and pants , as well as chemical - resistant gloves and shoes , when spraying .
The chemical cannot be applied near lakes , reservoirs or other bodies of water .
And local water systems must produce an annual report detailing the highest concentrations of atrazine and other chemicals detected over the previous year .
Some high - ranking E.P.A. officials say there are concerns over atrazine , and that it , among other chemicals , is likely to be closely re-examined by the new E.P.A. administrator , Lisa P. Jackson .
We 're going to blow your minds twice right now , so get ready .
First off , there are magazines and news sources other than Cracked .com out there .
Second , and slightly more surprising , is the fact that a lot of these news sources , ( unlike Cracked ) , do n't hold themselves to a high ethical standard at all , by which we mean , they regularly make shit up .
We know .
Crazy .
So , while you 're recovering from the one - two realization that unethical , non-Cracked affiliated news sources exist , allow us to run down some of the most morally questionable examples .
5 Ben Franklin Really Fucking Hated the British ( and Titan Leeds )
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Of all the great things Ben Franklin was known for -- lightning rods , bifocals , love of French prostitutes -- journalistic integrity is n't on the list .
But what he did have was a gigantic set he loved to show off .
For one thing , Franklin wrote and distributed a supplement to the Boston Independent Chronicle reporting that American Indians were sending the British Royal Court hundreds of American scalps , the implication being that the British troops were using ruthless , child hating Indian - mercenaries to help them win the Revolutionary War .
The news outraged Americans , horrified British citizens and , when word reached the British Royal Court , deeply confused the monarchy , as they had yet to receive any scalps .
Franklin wrote the supplement to garner support from European nations for the U.S. , and it totally worked .
The kicker ?
The last American Revolution battle ended in October of the previous year , which made the supplement unnecessary and balltuitous .
( Balls + gratuitous .
Look it up . )
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Still , that 's not quite as bizarre and dickish as what Franklin did to Titan Leeds .
Publishing under his Richard Saunders pseudonym in his famous Poor Richard 's Almanac , in between weather predictions and crop suggestions , Franklin predicted the death of Leeds , a rival almanac owner .
When the predicted day arrived and Leeds , predictably , was still alive , Franklin decided to report and confirm the death anyway .
Source .
Leeds desperately published his counter - argument ( " No I 'm not . " ) but Franklin , an accomplished black belt in the subtle art of being a dick ( or , " dickjitsu " ) pushed his lie even further and reported that , not only did Leeds die , but he was replaced by an impostor who was shamelessly hijacking the Leeds name to continue publishing almanacs .
When Leeds eventually did die ( five years after Franklin had predicted it ) , you 'd think Franklin would come clean , but that 's because you are , at best , a dickjitsu yellow belt .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Above : A dickjitsu master
Instead , in an act of unequaled dickishness , Franklin came out and congratulated the Leeds impostor for finally owning up to their lie and ending the whole charade ( by dying ) .
To reiterate , a guy 's death is wrongfully reported , that guy tries to correct the mistake , Franklin calls him a shameless fraud and , at his death , congratulates him for dying .
Textbook dickjitsu .

Americans are easily upset when they learn that their elected officials are n’t being honest with them .
Whether that means a bill is rushed through Congress without the chance of being reviewed or some other secretive way of managing the affairs of the nation come to light , people of every political stripe want to know the facts and they want that information presented to them objectively .
As you might guess , objective news is hard to come by particularly when the political climate has been heated up and Americans find themselves divided .
Keeping An Eye On Government
One organization , the Sunlight Foundation , is doing its best to shine the light on our elected officials particularly in instances where a conflict of interest is evident .
Working in cooperation with everyday citizens , bloggers and professional journalists , this non-partisan foundation examines Democrats and Republicans alike , making sure that our elected and appointed officials abide by many of the same rules that they have put into place .
Founded by Ellen S. Miller and Michael Klein , the Sunlight Foundation has been getting a lot of press lately for calling on Congress to post proposed legislation online for at least 72 hours before it is brought up for debate .
That 72 hour window would allow citizens to review the legislation , giving Americans the chance to voice their opinions to their elected officials , if desired .
A bill , H. Res. 554 , is being considered which would require the U.S. House of Representatives to post online all non-emergency legislation 72 hours before debate begins .
Long a supporter of government transparency , the Sunlight Foundation has created a website at ReadTheBill.org in order to advance the cause .
The organization has received broad bi-partisan support for the bill and includes Newt Gingrich , Joe Trippi , the Center for Democracy and Technology , the Electronic Frontier Foundation , the Federation of American Scientists , National Taxpayers Union and US PIRG among its supporters .
A Matter Of Trust
“ We commend Reps . Baird and Culberson for demonstrating such strong support for increasing legislative transparency in the House , ” said Ellen Miller , executive director and co-founder of the Sunlight Foundation .
“ By making the core activity of the House — the consideration of legislation — more transparent , this rules change would strengthen the public ’s trust in the institution , improve legislation and trim wasteful spending .
When legislation is not available for lawmaker or public review , we end up with special amendments like the Stimulus Bill ’s last - minute loophole that allowed AIG executives to receive retroactive bonuses at the American taxpayers ’ expense .
If Congress and citizens alike had 72 hours to read the Stimulus Bill online , someone would have noticed the AIG provision and fixed it before it became law . ”
These days , many people are feeling that the federal government does n’t listen to them , which creates frustration and mistrust .
By helping Americans keep tabs on what is going on in Washington , DC and elsewhere , the Sunlight Foundation empowers people to take action .

After nearly three - quarters of a century Robert Capa ’s “ Falling Soldier ” picture from the Spanish Civil War remains one of the most famous images of combat ever .
It is also one of the most debated , with a long string of critics claiming that the photo , of a soldier seemingly at the moment of death , was faked .
Now , a new book by a Spanish researcher asserts that the picture could not have been made where , when or how Capa ’s admirers and heirs have claimed .
In “ Shadows of Photography , ” José Manuel Susperregui , a communications professor at the Universidad del País Vasco , concludes that Capa ’s picture was taken not at Cerro Muriano , just north of Córdoba , but near another town , about 35 miles away .
Since that location was far from the battle lines when Capa was there , Mr. Susperregui said , it means that “ the ‘ Falling Soldier ’ photo is staged , as are all the others in the series taken on that front . ”
Experts at the International Center of Photography in Manhattan , where Capa ’s archive is stored , said they found some aspects of Mr. Susperregui ’s investigation intriguing or even convincing .
But they continue to believe that the image seen in “ Falling Soldier ” is genuine , and caution against jumping to conclusions .
“ Part of what is difficult about this is that people are saying , ‘ Well if it ’s not here , but there , then , good God , it ’s fabricated , ’ ” Willis E. Hartshorn , the center ’s director , said in an interview .
“ That ’s a leap that I think needs a lot more research and a lot more study . ”
Image Robert Capas " Falling Soldier , " from the Spanish Civil War has drawn both acclaim and questions over its veracity .

Mr. Susperregui said he began his inquiry by examining the background of other photographs from the same sequence as that of the “ Falling Soldier , ” pictures in which a mountain range can be seen in the distance .
He then e-mailed the clearest of those images to librarians and historians in towns around Córdoba , asking if they recognized the landscape , and eventually got a positive response from a community called Espejo .

Advertisement Former US President Bill Clinton has left North Korea with two US reporters whose release he has helped to secure .
His spokesman said they were flying to Los Angeles where the journalists would be reunited with their families .
North Korean leader Kim Jong - il issued a special pardon to the journalists after meeting Mr Clinton on Tuesday .
Laura Ling and Euna Lee had been found guilty of entering illegally in March .
Mr Clinton offered no apology for the reporters ' conduct , a US official said .
The senior US administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , also said the two reporters were in " very good health " and that the North Korean government had agreed in advance that Mr Clinton 's mission would not touch on the question of its nuclear programme .
In pictures : Clinton 's mission Pyongyang dropped out of six - party talks after the UN censured a long - range missile test in April .
The parties include Russia , China , Japan , the US and both Koreas .
An underground nuclear test and further missile tests followed , provoking new UN Security Council sanctions .
Mr Clinton 's unannounced visit to Pyongyang was described as a private mission .
He was the highest - profile American to visit the reclusive Communist state since ex-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in 2000 .
Families ' overjoyed '
After leaving Pyongyang , the plane with Mr Clinton and the two reporters landed at a US military base in northern Japan for refuelling , Japan 's NHK broadcaster said .
The chartered jet later departed for Los Angeles .
On Tuesday , the official North Korean News Agency ( KCNA ) said in a statement that " Kim Jong - il issued an order ... granting a special pardon to the two American journalists who had been sentenced to hard labour " .

The women 's pardon and release was a sign of North Korea 's " humanitarian and peace - loving policy " , it said .
The families of the journalists said they were " overjoyed " by the news .
In a statement posted on a website , they thanked Mr Clinton and also former Vice - President Al Gore for their efforts to get the women released .
President Barack Obama has telephoned the journalists ' families to express relief at their return from North Korea .
Clinton 's role Briefing a small group of reporters in Washington , the US administration official later revealed some details of how Mr Clinton 's mission had been planned .
He said Laura Ling , 32 , and Euna Lee , 36 , told their families during telephone calls from prison that Pyongyang had suggested to them that , if Mr Clinton came as a private envoy to the country , they would be freed .
The official said Washington later concluded that Pyongyang 's offer was valid enough to involve Mr Clinton in trying to secure the reporters ' release .
He added that Mr Clinton later met State Department and White House officials to discuss the plan before flying to Pyongyang .
Washington had made no announcement of Mr Clinton 's trip prior to his arrival on Tuesday .
US JOURNALISTS PARDONED 17 March : Euna Lee , left , and Laura Ling seized by North Korean border guards while reporting for California - based Current TV 8 June : Sentenced to 12 years in jail for " hostile acts " and illegal entry into North Korea 16 June : North Korea says journalists have " admitted and accepted " their guilt 10 July : US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appeals for an amnesty for the two 4 August : Former US President Bill Clinton arrives in Pyongyang and North Korea later announces the journalists will be pardoned
Will visit change Pyongyang ?
Mr Clinton landed in Pyongyang in an unmarked plane and was greeted at the airport by North Korean officials .
KCNA said Mr Clinton met North Korean leader Kim Jong - il , although the White House denied its report that Mr Clinton had conveyed a message from US President Barack Obama .
In all , Mr Clinton and his team met Kim Jong - il and his staff for more than three hours , the US administration official said .
He did not give any further details of the talks .
The two reporters had been found guilty of entering North Korea illegally across the Chinese border in March and were sentenced to 12 years ' hard labour .
They were arrested by North Korean guards while filming a video about refugees for California - based internet broadcaster Current TV .
The White House had pressed for their release , and Mr Clinton 's wife , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , asked last month that they be granted amnesty .
Analysts say that Kim Jong - il is eager to improve relations with Washington as he prepares to name a successor .
President Kim is believed to have suffered a stroke a year ago and also has chronic diabetes and heart disease .
Analysts say his third son is being lined up to succeed him .

Regulators shut 2 more banks
Posted Friday , August 28 , 2009 8:16 pm
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. took over Baltimore - based Bradford Bank , with about $ 452 million in assets and $ 383 million in deposits .
It also seized Mainstreet Bank , based in Forest Lake , Minn. , with assets of $ 459 million and deposits of $ 434 million .
Manufacturers and Traders Trust Co. , based in Buffalo , N.Y. , has agreed to assume the deposits and assets of Bradford Bank .
The nine branches of Bradford Bank will reopen Saturday as offices of M&T .
Central Bank , based in Stillwater , Minn. , is assuming the deposits and assets of Mainstreet Bank , whose eight branches will reopen Saturday as offices of Central Bank .
In addition , the FDIC agreed to share with M&T losses on about $ 338 million of Bradford Bank 's loans and other assets , and struck a similar agreement with Central Bank for around $ 268 million of Mainstreet Bank's .
The failure of Bradford Bank is expected to cost the deposit insurance fund an estimated $ 97 million ; that of Mainstreet Bank about $ 95 million , the FDIC said .
Hundreds more banks are expected to fail in the next few years largely because of souring loans for commercial real estate .
The number of banks on the FDIC 's confidential " problem list " jumped to 416 at the end of June from 305 in the first quarter .
That 's the highest number since June 1994 , during the savings - and - loan crisis .

Last Friday , Guaranty Bank became the second - largest U.S. bank to fail this year after the big Texas lender was shut down and most of its operations sold at a loss of billions of dollars for the government to a major Spanish bank .
The failure , the 10th - largest in U.S. history , is expected to cost the insurance fund an estimated $ 3 billion .
The sale of most of Austin - based Guaranty 's operations to the U.S. division of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA , Spain 's No. 2 bank , market the first time a foreign bank has bought a failed American bank during the current financial crisis .

The insurance fund has been so depleted by the epidemic of collapsing financial institutions that some analysts have warned it could sink into the red by the end of this year .
The fund fell 20 percent to $ 10.4 billion at the end of June , the FDIC reported Thursday .
That 's its lowest point since 1992 , at the height of the S&L crisis .
The agency estimates bank failures will cost the fund around $ 70 billion through 2013 .
U.S. banks overall lost $ 3.7 billion in the second quarter , compared with a profit of $ 7.6 billion in January - March , according to the FDIC .
Surging levels of soured loans at banks dragged down profits in the April - June period .
Article Continues After Advertisement
FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said Thursday there were no immediate plans to borrow money from the government to replenish the insurance fund by tapping the agency 's $ 500 billion credit line with the Treasury .
The FDIC may , however , impose an additional fee on U.S. banks this year to bolster the fund , atop the estimated $ 5.6 billion from a new emergency premium that took effect June 30 .
The FDIC is fully backed by the government , which means depositors ' money is guaranteed up to $ 250,000 per account .
And the agency still has billions in loss reserves - including $ 21.6 billion in cash - apart from the insurance fund .
This week , the FDIC opened the door wider for private investors to buy failed financial institutions .
The FDIC 's board voted Wednesday to reduce the cash that private equity funds must maintain in banks they acquire .
Private equity funds have been criticized as excessive risk - takers .
But with fewer healthy banks willing to buy ailing institutions , the banking crisis has softened the FDIC 's resistance to private buyers .

I would like to thank you for emailing us to point out that Viaduct is not the first TF2 map to feature snow .
More importantly , I would like to thank you for stopping .
Immediately .
In accordance with our corporate policies on plagiarism , Corey Peters the person responsible for Viaduct has been forced to uninstall Hammer under the supervision of our crack security team .
He was then asked to remove his hard drive and bludgeon it to pieces with a stapler , also under the supervision of our crack security team .
Lastly , he was bludgeoned to pieces by our crack security team .
He is currently in surgery having important organs replaced .
I have seen to it that any map - making appendages he possesses ( all of them , to be safe ) are removed , so that an oversight of this grievous magnitude will not occur again .
Dhabih Eng the artist behind the Innovative Snow Effect Never Seen Before in an FPS ( his words ) has been suitably reprimanded , and by this we mean he has been launched into space , where I 'm told there will be plenty of snow for him to steal .
The writers behind the " first Team Fortress map to take place during a snowfall " line on our website have been replaced with new , better writers .
( They 're surprisingly easy to come by . )
I hope this is the last I 'll hear of the matter .
Any further emails regarding this will be forwarded to our crack security team .
You have found this post informative ,

First look at Nokia RX - 51 also known as Nokia N900 Please note -
This article is nothing but our first impressions of the device and some musings about what 's going to happen .
The N900 itself has reached the stage when most of its elements are operable , so we decided we could publish this lowdown .
Just one more remark , had it not been for so many leaks regarding the N900 you would n't have seen this write - up in the first place .
But alas , Nokia have failed to keep their main 2009 announcement in secret , so here we go .
Positioning
If you are not a frequent reader of Mobile - Review.com you might ask how come Nokia decided to put aside its favorite S60 platform and switch to Maemo , which is all another way of saying that they ditched S60 for Linux OS .
As most of you know , until recently Maemo has been used exclusively in pair with Internet Tablets .
The rise of Internet Tablets
Our avid readers probably already know the Maemo 's inner history from the variety of related materials .
But still I will remind you in brief why this decision was made .
Remember , the first info and details on a Meamo - based smartphone were leaked by yours truly and then all of it got available on other sources .
It has become a common knowledge that Nokia had a " secret " weapon under their belt .
But what it is for ?
Let ’s find out together .
At present there are several handset platforms in Nokia ’s arsenal – the S30 for low - end phones , the S40 for mid- and top-range and the S60 for smartphones priced € 200 and higher .
If we take into account also codenames used strictly within the company we will get a few more platforms , but they are of no importance to us , so let ’s deal with names familiar to common users .
Taking into account the growing smartphone market and transformation of ordinary phones into feature - rick monsters most phone makers realize the necessity of having a flexible and open platform , which will help creating true mobile powerhouses .
The S60 used to be such a platform for Nokia up until 2007 .
Back then Microsoft did n’t have the ability to create a mobile version for its OS , or to promote it and expand its market share .
In 2009 it resulted in the following : the company made an unspoken decision to tweak Windows Mobile 7 and then try to migrate to a more " mature " OS .
That is , they decided to ditch the idea of a mobile version , keep Windows CE and promote the next Windows 7.5/8 version ( scheduled for release in 2012 ) for mobile platforms .
Currently the development of Windows Mobile family is either stopped or frozen .
And there is certain logic in there – because of their failure in the past the company wo n’t risk to invest more resources into this OS today .
Besides , the market is going in the same direction .
For example , Apple managed to adapt BSD for their Apple iPhone , plus it 's also utilized in their multimedia players and will debut in an internet tablet some time in 2011 .
The vertical OS paradigm implies that this system may be used not only in touch - sensitive devices , but also in those that do n't have this feature .
Since Samsung did n't have clear - cut favorites in terms of platforms back in 2007 , they opted to invest substantial amounts of money into a whole bunch of operating systems .
At the same time strategy - wise they had no doubts that mobile devices in 2010 would become convergent devices .
For the time being the company does n’t have vertically oriented products , but they will come up with them in the near future , much like Nokia , Apple and Google .
Each is moving towards this market in its own unique way - for instance , Apple started their journey with an OS , a bunch of devices and some help from the developers community .
Over at Google they are working on their Android OS step - by - step in order to flood the market with a wide selection of phones during the second stage of their strategy ( which will take place in 2010 ) and start offering Google - branded laptops during the third stage ( 2012 -2013 ) .
And even though first MID Android - based devices are already available , this market will start blossoming only in 2011 , along with the advent of first laptops .
After this lengthy digression on how things stand today , a natural question comes up : how come the S60 platform has been put aside ?
It seems to be almost the ideal platform for mobile devices , as it was simply design for this purpose .
But that ’s exactly the weak and strong point about the S60 at the same time .
The market will require vertical OS , which can be applied in cell phones , communicators , laptops and MID devices , i.e. various device types with different architectures , performance levels and so on .
And suddenly it becomes apparent that S60 is not up to the task - the only way it can be tailored for the company 's current needs is through a total reconstruction .
Had Nokia had an army of developers , plenty of appsand related services for its S60 , they would have to center everything around S60 .
Thankfully ( or not ! ) there is a modest number of developers , programs and software for the S60 .
In other words , the resources they command are sufficient , but not excessive .
The company is willingly sacrificing them , keeping both S60 and Maemo in the service boat at the same time .
In addition all key SDK will need to have the ability to work with Maemo in future , allowing developers to migrate to this platform and attract new ones .
In fact even Apple developers get an opportunity to create programs for Nokia ’s platform in a quick and easy - to - learn fashion , which is definitely a huge advantage .
The creation of Symbian Foundation took place when Nokia made its final strategic decision .
They market called for vertal solutions and they responded with Maemo .
But why are they going to give their own S60 away ?
It 's simple : they can't afford to support two major platforms at a time , so S60 will be fueled by the resources of other companies united in Symbian Foundation .
Samsung is viewed as the potential driving force for the Foundation , as their motivation to roll out competitive S60 - powered devices seems unqestionable on the surface .
However Samsung have managed to see things through , and are now working on a vertical Linux - based solution of their own , using their proprietary TouchWiz interface to tie up various platforms and prepare themselves for the upcoming Linux - powered devices .
The lastdevice from Samsung that can be called their S60 is the i8910 HD - all other phones will be moved to the mid-tier , where Samsung will mimick Nokia 's strategy and increase their market share through penetration of lower price segments .
In the next 18 months Samsung , Sony Ericsson and other phone makers will sell 40 out of 170 million all smartphones .
And in these circumstances the S60 platform will be driven by only one factor - price .
By autumn of 2010 most phones will become significantly cheaper , as Maemo - based flagship devices will take the center stage , rivaled by Sony Ericsson 's S60 smartphones , making it the only vendor fighting for a piece of the smartphone market with S60 .
The fact of the matter is that they do n't have the resources to develop an own Linux - based solution , although the truth is they are negotiating with some players , in an effort to find a compromise and come up with a vertical OS of their own .
Without much luck , though .
This situation leaves a huge time lag that will work to Nokia 's Maemo smartphones advantage .
In fact , only Nokia and Apple will have similar solutions in 2010 - 2012 that will enable them to beef up their shares in this segment .
While Samsung have almost let their chance slip , through various marketing moves they 'll probably manage to mitigate the negative consequences .
Already today widgets are spreading not only among mobile phones , but also netbooks and this integration of UI will go even further , but it 's still not a scalable vertical OS .
LG , in turn , do n't stand a chance on this field - they have n't fully grasped where the market is headed and the outlines of the industry 's future still appear vague to them .
Sony Ericsson are going through a tough period in their history , having wasted two years of priceless time and the re-organization initiated by the new management will take another year , so they wo n't be able to get back in business until mid 2010 , with first results expected only in 2011 - 2012 , when Google , Nokia and Apple will have the market covered .
For the first time the companies integrate services , software and devices in a vertical line , so technically we can call this market vertical .
That ’s the main distinction from the past , the paradigm is changing these days .
The market lines up in a vertical , various devices get tied together by one single OS and differ only in terms of specs and size .
I hope this sort of " brief " story has shed some light on why Nokia are running with Linux / Maemo as their future OS .
Now let 's talk a bit about the N900 / RX - 51 's positioning ( the latter index was used during the phone 's development , intended for internal use ) .
December 2008 , Barcelona – the company introduced the term “ computer ” and tacked it to the Nokia N97 .
They showed us the concept and the way they will the future of this industry , making the N97 the last S60 flagship in their range .
So what does that mean ?
The N97 will stick around for a year and then its place will be taken by the N900 .
However from the technical standpoint , it does n't differ from the N97 at all , so why bother releasing it in the first place ?
Probably , over at Nokia they are up to something bigger .
Like , they want to show the market their brand new OS .
This family is expected to blossom in 2011 , and for now sporadic announcements will have to do .
At this point in time , though , Nokia wo n't ditch S60 , though , so they 'll keep churning out both S60 - and Maemo - based phones .
And while an ordinary consumer might get a headache because of this variety , those who'll try the RX - 51 or the likes one wo n't have to think twice about which OS to go for ever again .
Now , on to what this review is all about ...
Design
The N900 is housed in the side - slider form - factor , although it does n't boast an N97 - esque opening mechanism .
All in all , the phone 's build quality is on par with that of the Nokia E75 .
The N900's camera is no different from that found in the Nokia N97 , plus it comes equipped with a lens shutter ( so far it has managed to keep the lens clean ) .
The camera interface here is the only feature carried over from S60 .
The microSD slot ( hot - swappable ) is hidden under the rear panel and supports memory cards up to 32 GB .
The handset carries a standard 1320 mAh battery onboard .
However in practice it proves to be more power - hungry than the N97 .
At the same time , they are n't much different in terms of standby times , but do n't forget we got our hands on a proto , not the final version of the phone .
The smartphone is built on ARM Cortex - A8 CPU and carries 32 GB of internal memory onboard , as for the rest specs , we 'll keep them to ourselves untill the announcement date .
There is the microUSB jack ( plus the N900 can recharge over USB ) and TV - out .
I guess that 'll be it - after all , its design is not the N900's key feature .
Maemo
The RX - 51 is run by Fremantle .
I know this name wo n't say anything to most of you , but for simplicity sake , let ’s say this is the next version of Maemo and it differs dramatically from what we saw on the Nokia N810 .
Havea look at the screenshots below - they are way more informative : Impressions I would say what 's going to follow are my personal impressions of the device plus opinios of my family and several people who also had a chance to play around with the N900 .
Compared to S60 , the N900's boot time is much faster , and also take into account the fact that we played around only with its prototype , so we were prepared for occasional reboots during our quality time with it .
This is something Nokia will have to work on , and I hope they 'll fix this issue in the final version of the device .
Other than that , I was more than happy with how the N900 performed .
Due to variety of visual effects , smooth transitions and decent reaction time of the touch screen ( which is a significant improvement over the Nokia N97 ) , the N900 feels more like the Apple iPhone .
At the same time its UI looks nothing like that of the iPhone - it 's just different , but eye - candy nonetheless ( maybe somewhat similar to HTC 's products ) .
Everyone who had a chance to play with it noted that it did n't look like any other Nokia - branded device , yet it was an enjoyable experience overall .
Even the browser is pretty stable , and it supports flash , video and applets .
On top of that there is partial compatibility with older applications , some things work and some do n't .
But in general most apps did start up on the N900 , yet some of them required libraries our device did n't have .
Those who are familiar with Diablo ( Maemo 4.2 ) will feel right at home with the N900 : same on - screen keyboards ( despite the phone having a hardware one ) and it ’s considerably easier to switch input languages than in S60 - powered devices .
All in all , not much has changed , it even sports the same memory setup .
The phone ’s 800x480 pixel resistive screen ( pretty responsive , by the way ) is great for watching videos and the kickstand mounted on the N900 only helps the experience .
Perhaps they ’ll decide to throw in an extra stylus into the box ( since the N900 already comes with one built into its casing ) , much like the one that came with the Nokia N97 .
I ’m frequently asked the question whether it ’s possible to list through the interface in Fremantle ?
Honestly , though , I do n’t quite get it , but all pages containing a significant number of items ( more than one screen can accommodate ) can be listed through .
Copy / pasting text fragments is allowed in all menus .
The phone ’s GPS department seemed well - tuned too – its cold start time did n’t exceed a couple of minutes and the accuracy was comparable to the Nokia N97 .
The N900 also comes will all utilities for tapping into Twitter and Facebook right out of the box .
Its media player can deal with non-converted videos ( although we did run it with additional codecs , which are n’t guaranteed to make it to the final version of the device ) .
I hope over a hundred of the UI screenshots will give you a decent impression of what the N900 is and how it differs from S60 .
More airy I ’d say .
And the last thing I almost forgot to mention – all context menus are made in the form of pop-ups which are easy to dismiss .
All you need to do is press on any area of the screen outside the menu and it ’ll be closed in an instant .
Also I like how the task manager is implemented .
On top of that , you can setup the home screen however you like using various themes and widgets .
I thought it would n't make much sense to go through all features of the phone just yet - I 'm not lazy , I just have to leave some bread for Nokia 's announcement guys !
So , come back after the official release for more - we 'll talk more about all feats and tricks the N900 has got under its hood .
But what I can say for now is that it 's the true mobile powerhouse in every sense of this word , that comes wrapped in a very eye - candy and functional UI at that .
It wo n't become a hit , but at the same time the N900 is a milestone both for Nokia and the industry that wo n't just go unnoticed .
The phone is supposed to hit the shelves late in 2009 and will go for 550 Euro ( the price , however is subject to change ) .

To set any of these , go to terminal and enter in the code for whichever preference you want to set .
Remember , to reset the setting to its default value , just change the " 1 " at the end to a " 0 " ( or vice versa ) .
I do n't know exactly what these do , or they do n't seem to have an effect when I enable them but here you go :
You belong to your father the devil and you willingly carry out your father ’s desires .
He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in truth , because there is no truth in him .
When he tells a lie , he speaks in character , because he is a liar and the father of lies .
~ John 8:44 ( New American Bible )
As one who has written continuously about federal criminal law and prosecutorial abuse , I rarely find myself surprised by anything that the minions of the misnamed U.S. Department of Justice do or say .
The DOJ is populated with people for whom truth has taken a permanent vacation , and I doubt seriously that the situation will change just because there is a new attorney general .
However , a recent article about the overturning of a criminal conviction in federal court has managed to surprise me , if only to be amazed at the sheer hubris by DOJ personnel .
Indeed , at a federal appeals court hearing , a DOJ official openly admitted that she and her colleagues presented a false case — and clearly was proud of it .
Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal writes about the overturning of a conviction of a former CEO :
In a final indignity , after Mr. ( Greg ) Reyes ’s conviction , the government admitted it knew its central contention was false , thanks to numerous , immunized statements from finance department officials .
As Justice official Amber Rosen told the appeals panel in oral argument this past May : “ Defendants are n’t entitled to a perfect trial .
. . . Misstatements happen . ”
" Misstatements happen . "
Rosen knew and pretty much admitted that she and her colleagues knew that they were lying in court , lying to a judge , lying to a jury , lying to the public , lying to everyone .
Nothing will happen to her , and nothing will happen to her fellow prosecutors , who most likely will retry Reyes not because he is guilty of anything , but rather because they can do it , and since they openly admit they are liars , they pretty much have the run of the store .
The case against Reyes involved backdating of stock options , a common business practice that federal prosecutors suddenly decided to criminalize as part of its crusade to create new and draconian " economic crimes . "
The feds were trying to claim that Reyes had misled his colleagues , but the government ’s actions clearly were at odds with itself .
Jenkins writes :
Never mind that this story flew in the face of the publicly known facts or that the government ’s sole witness , a junior finance department official , later recanted , saying she had been bullied by prosecutors .
Hilariously , even as Justice argued in one courtroom that Brocade ’s finance department had been kept “ in the dark ” about backdating , the SEC was simultaneously impaling two former heads of Brocade ’s finance department for aiding , abetting and benefiting from backdating .
So , it has come to this : federal prosecutors now openly admit to appeals judges that they knowingly presented a false case , lied to everyone , and that such lying just " happens . "
I would like to know how people who claim to be against lies have turned into liars themselves .
Unfortunately , I believe I have discovered one piece of this puzzle , and it involves people who openly claim to be Evangelical Christians and at least some of the culprits have held high church office .
I will deal only with three people , but they have been influential .
The first is John Ashcroft , who was the federal government ’s attorney general during George W. Bush ’s first term .
I have covered Ashcroft ’s lies and shenanigans in articles here , here , and dealt with the general culture of DOJ lying here .
( The last article also deals with an incident involving current AG Eric Holder , so the beat goes on . )
Ashcroft was one who wore his Christianity on his sleeve , but made sure that his Christian beliefs never interfered with his lying .
The second person is the former U.S. Attorney for Eastern Virginia , Paul J. McNulty , who also served as the number two person in the DOJ until he resigned after having misled Congress regarding the firing of some U.S. attorneys , a case that still has some traction .
Terrorism and Tyranny : ...
Bovard , James Best Price : $ 3.78 Buy New $ 14.51 ( as of 01:40 EST - Details )
The impeccable libertarian writer James Bovard already has dealt with many of McNulty ’s actions in his book , Terrorism and Tyranny , and Bovard ’s accounts of McNulty ’s “ misstatements ” are worth reading .
As the chief federal prosecutor on terrorism cases , he had his hand in the infamous “ Lackawanna Six ” case , one that Judge Andrew Napolitano condemned as being the product of DOJ lawbreakers .
McNulty also pursued the infamous “ paintball terrorists ” case in which people were railroaded into prison although no supposed “ terrorist plot ” ever was discovered .
One of McNulty ’s most egregious cases involved the prosecution of physician William Hurwitz , a pain medication specialist accused of ( in McNulty ’s words ) being a " major and deadly drug dealer . "
Because McNulty ’s district has lots of government employees and generally produces pro-government juries , gaining a conviction , even in a case fraught with questions , was relatively easy .
Writes Jacob Sullum :
The prosecutors did not dispute that Hurwitz had helped hundreds of patients recover their lives by prescribing the high doses of narcotics they needed to control their chronic pain .
Instead they pointed to the small minority of his patients — 5 to 10 percent , by his attorneys ’ estimate — who were misusing the painkillers he prescribed , selling them on the black market , or both .
The prosecutors did not claim Hurwitz , who faces a possible life sentence , got so much as a dime from illegal drug sales .
Instead they pointed to his income as a physician , which they said was boosted by fees from patients who were faking or exaggerating their pain .
The prosecutors did not allege that Hurwitz had any sort of explicit arrangement with those patients .
Instead they described a “ conspiracy of silence , ” carried out by “ a wink and a nod . ”
The evidence supporting this theory was , not surprisingly , ambiguous at best , leaving plenty of room for reasonable doubt .
Yet the prosecutors got the jury to overlook the obvious weaknesses in their case and convict Hurwitz , in essence , of trusting his patients too much .
Indeed , as Harvey Silverglate writes in his newest book , Three Felonies a Day , the Hurwitz conviction ultimately meant that doctors around the country became fearful of the very medications that alleviate pain , which meant that many Americans would suffer pain needlessly because Paul McNulty wanted a scalp .
Three Felonies a Day : ... Harvey A. Silverglate Best Price : $ 10.99 Buy New $ 32.95 ( as of 04:35 EST - Details )
Apparently , after his indictment , Hurwitz had agreed to turn himself in at the office of the U.S. Marshals .
McNulty had other ideas , having his own storm troopers burst into Hurwitz ’s home , and having him manhandled in front of his wife and children .
This was not done just to humiliate and bully Hurwitz , although it is clear McNulty enjoyed the bullying ; indeed , another reason was so that McNulty could make the false claim at the sentencing hearing that Hurwitz was " uncooperative " upon his arrest .
( This is a common tactic among federal prosecutors , and one more example of the Culture of Lying that now owns that agency . )
The reason that I bring in McNulty is twofold .
First , as both the lead federal prosecutor on " terrorism " issues and as the number two at DOJ , McNulty was in a key position to affect DOJ culture and to insist upon honesty .
The reason I make that point is that , second , McNulty is a ruling elder in a congregation of the Presbyterian Church in America , the same Evangelical denomination to which my family and I belong .
Unfortunately , instead of helping to bring honesty and decency to the DOJ , McNulty chose to further the same Culture of Lying that Bill Moushey exposed more than a decade ago in his award - winning series , " Win at All Costs . "
Instead of integrity , the DOJ under McNulty ’s leadership went into the direction that ultimately resulted in the dishonest and cynical testimony : " Misstatements happen . "
Like Ashcroft , McNulty wears his Christianity on his sleeve , and both were featured positively in the Evangelical magazine , World .
( World even gave Ashcroft its " Daniel of the Year " award in 2001 . )
Another federal prosecutor who openly promotes his Christian beliefs is Matt Martens , an assistant U.S. attorney in Charlotte , North Carolina .
Martens , a deacon and a Baptist lay preacher , was the lead prosecutor against Victoria Sprouse , whose case I have documented here and here .
In this case , Martens knew that one of his " star " witnesses had sworn under oath in a civil case that Sprouse was innocent of any fraud and was unaware of fraud being committed in real estate deals for which she was the closing attorney .
However , Martens had charged the witness with fraud , but offered him a deal of serving only two years in prison if he would testify that Sprouse knew that there was fraud on her part .
The thing to remember is that when the witness swore under oath several years before , he was not under duress nor forced to exchange testimony for a reduced prison sentence .
Thus , when a man completely changes his testimony on a witness stand in order to help a prosecutor fit his own " theory " of what happened , I am going to be very skeptical .
Furthermore , Martens and other prosecutors should be reminded that their job is not to win , but to do justice .
As I documented in the second article on the Sprouse case , Martens lied to a judge in order to ensure that Sprouse ’s original attorney would not be able to stay on her defense team :
It is important to understand , however , that the outcome was fixed long before the trial , and not by any criminal or regulatory violations on behalf of Sprouse .
Martens arranged for the government to forbid Sprouse from selling , disposing , or mortgaging any of her property in order to raise money to pay for her attorney , Pete Anderson .
Because all her assets were forbidden to be sold or mortgaged she did not have any other funds by which to pay , the judge declared her “ indigent ” and then permitted a maximum of $ 25,000 for her legal fees .
The prosecution ’s strategy was obvious .
If Sprouse could be denied adequate counsel , as $ 25 K is not going to buy anything more than an attorney who wants to plead out right away , then a conviction was as good as done .
What happened afterward is most important — and sealed the outcome .
Anderson told the judge at a hearing in which she petitioned to have one of her properties sold so she could raise legal fees that he still wanted to represent Sprouse , given his knowledge of the case .
That is where Martens dropped a bombshell .
Martens told the judge that it would take four - to - six weeks to present the government ’s case .
Anderson argued that since it would take his firm five months to prepare for trial with another month to six weeks in a trial would mean his firm would have to spend six months for a relatively tiny fee , which the firm could not afford .
Thus , he begged off the case and the judge appointed two attorneys who then tried to force Sprouse to plea to a deal that would have given her 20 years .
Sprouse , believing she had not committed any crimes and wanting her Constitutional day in court , refused , and from then on , she and her counsel were at odds .
There are a number of reasons why this development was significant , and why Martens had orchestrated it .
First , and most important , when Martens actually presented the “ evidence ” during the trial , he took less than four days .
One does not boil four - to - six weeks of material into four days ; instead , Martens — an officer of the court and one who is bound to tell the truth while carrying out his duties — had not told the judge the truth .
Unfortunately , like Ashcroft and McNulty before him , Martens is not a man of the truth .
Like Ashcroft and McNulty , Martens believes that the Bible in the inerrant and infallible Word of God .
However , like Ashcroft and McNulty , he does not believe he is bound to the Holy Scriptures , at least when he is trying to railroad innocent people into prison .
And like McNulty , Martens ordered Sprouse arrested at 6 a.m. at her home ( after his storm troopers nearly broke down her front door ) on the day that she already had agreed to turn herself in to the U.S. Marshals at 9 a.m.
Like McNulty , Martens wanted to present a false picture of Sprouse being “ uncooperative ” with the authorities regarding her arrest if and when he secured a conviction .
Evangelicals like Ashcroft and others were quick to condemn Bill Clinton for his escapades and especially his lying .
Indeed , Clinton became well - known for telling untruths and outright whoppers .
Yet , what happened when a Republican government came on the scene , a government which was strongly influenced by those same Evangelicals who claimed to hate Clinton ’s lies ?
The Best of William L. Anderson
By David Harsanyi - August 7 , 2009
If you 're a virtuous and patriotic American , you may find this column either offensive or misleading .
If so , please forward it to White House authorities at the Department of Fishy Activity .
( E - mail the good people at flag ( at ) whitehouse.gov . )
As many of you have heard , the White House now requests that the public tattle on those of us spreading " fishy " " disinformation " regarding Washington 's proposed takeover of your health care .
This step , naturally , is for our own good .
Now , do n't get overly paranoid , you rabble of freaky right - wing zealots .
Judging from the Obama administration 's track record , the program will do absolutely nothing other than add billions to the deficit .
The vital thing to bear in mind , though , is that the nation needs a concerted plan to corral this wacko " mob " of " thugs " who recklessly use the First Amendment to decelerate all this forward progress .
We are talking about a moral imperative here .
As one senator asserted this week , passing government - run health care is the " sacred duty " of Congress .
( Boy , it 's a good thing we banished all that moral preening from Washington . )
When your mission is the same as the Lord 's herself ... well , you can imagine the kind of scandalous characters populating the opposition camp .
It is the type of individual who Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi astutely points out has the tendency to carry " swastikas and symbols like that " to local town hall meetings on health care .
You might be curious to find out what symbols Pelosi believes are " like " swastikas .
Maybe she 's referring to the Gadsden flag .
In any event , it 's true that people who believe in health care choices and free markets are zombies .
For one thing , they are entirely too well - dressed to contemplate serious issues independently -- and thank you , Sen. Barbara Boxer of California , for pointing that out .
A man without Birkenstocks , after all , is a man without a soul .
Organizing and protesting , as any sensible and compassionate citizen already understands , is exclusively the bailiwick of ideologically diverse and freethinking groups , such as unions .
And really , the most galling aspect of this entire spurious uprising is the rumor that protestors are actually organized .
Can you imagine ?
The question now becomes :
How can we , thinking people , stop this horde of well - heeled , Nazi- loving , insurance industry - funded ( and possibly organized ) robots ?
What can we do to destroy our health care ?
Well , as always , the president has crafted a glorious plan forward .
In an e-mail to the nation , Obama begins by telling Americans , " This is the moment our movement was built for . "
" That 's why Organizing for America is putting together thousands of events this month , " the president goes on , his words stirring even in pixel form , " where you can reach out to neighbors , show your support , and make certain your members of Congress know that you 're counting on them to act . "
Who knew ?
" Organizing " for America ?
Movements ?
Sounds familiar .
For you yahoos out there who gleefully will point out the hypocrisy of Democrats grousing about organized grass - roots activism -- whether well - funded or organic -- you just do n't get it .
It is imperative that we start thinking about the world in a counterintuitive way .
In today 's world , the " radicals " are the ones who protest the takeover of a huge swath of the economy by government bureaucrats who have proved they can't even run a program that gives free money away to car buyers properly .
It is radicals who want to preserve the pillars of a system that more than 80 percent of Americans still believe works -- though certainly not perfectly .
In this new world , radicals are the ones who protest adding trillions to our debt and radicals who have the temerity to ask whether legislators have read the bills they sign .
You 've seen them .
Those radicals ranting and raving about silly things , such as the Constitution .
So here is a plan .
Instead of making the case for health care " reform , " let 's launch an offensive against citizens .
Nazis .
Fanatics .
Mobs .
Thugs .
Whatever you call them .
And if you 're really patriotic , you even can report them .
The title words are included in the prayer Jesus taught His disciples .
That prayer confirms that God ’s future Kingdom was a reality .
In that kingdom God ’s perfect will would be done on earth as it is presently in heaven .
The Old Testament has much more to say about the future kingdom than the New Testament .
It would take a separate book to adequately describe the attributes of the future kingdom , but we ’ll list a couple of examples .
“ Now it shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the LORD ’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains … and all nations shall flow to it . ”
Isaiah 2:2
The phrase ‘ latter days ’ refers to the future millennial kingdom .
Jerusalem will be the capital and center of Israel from that time to evermore .
Recall when Ezekiel relayed God ’s words when He entered the millennial temple .
“ Son of man , this is the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet , where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever . ”
Ezekiel 43:7
One wonders why there is so much unrest when President Trump announced that his administration would begin the process to make Jerusalem Israel ’s capital .
“ … Your eyes will see Jerusalem … a tabernacle that will not be taken down … ( for the LORD is our Judge , the LORD is our Lawgiver , the LORD is our King… ) ” Isaiah 33:20 , 22
The above passage settles the question of the separation of church and state .
That premise can be expressed during this Christmas season with the words : Bah !
Humbug !
But the kingdom described in Isaiah is in the future , how about the present ?
“ Now when He ( Jesus ) was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come , He answered …
‘ The kingdom of God does not come with observation … For indeed , the kingdom of God is within you ( in a person ’s heart ) . ’” Luke 17:20 - 21
The kingdom of God presently resides within the hearts of the Disciples of Christ by the presence of the Holy Spirit .
Therefore , the kingdom of God is invisible during the dispensation of the church .
However , the day will come when the invisible will become visible .
Present day believers embrace the invisible by faith , and such faith is a gift of God .
“ Now faith is the substance of things hoped for , the evidence of things not seen … ” Hebrews 11:1
Jesus also spoke of the reality of the future kingdom to His disciples .
“ But you are those who have continued with Me in My trials .
And I bestow upon you a kingdom , just as My father bestowed one upon Me , that you may eat and drink at my table in My kingdom , and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel . ”
Luke 22:28-30
The disciples were excited and confident of the kingdom ; however , they did n’t know the timing so they asked Jesus right before His ascension .
“ … Lord , will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel ? ” Acts 1:6
Jesus told them that the timing was strictly in the hands of the Father and would not be made known to them .
At that time the disciples did n’t understand that there would be a wide gap of time between Jesus ’ departure and His return .
The disciples thought that the future kingdom would be established immediately .
Jesus did , however , explain it to them .
“ … A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return .
So he called ten of his servants , delivered to them ten minas , and said to them , ‘ Do business till I come … ’
And so it was that when he returned having received the kingdom , he then commanded these servants , to whom he had given the money , to be called to him , that he might know how much every man had gained by trading . ”
Luke 19:12 - 13 , 15
Jesus would return to heaven for several thousand years , and while he was gone He gave His servants spiritual assets to put to work .
When
He returned He would judge their stewardship of the assets
He had left with them .
The time
He would be away is the present time gap between Daniel ’s 69th and 79th week .

A crooked Chicago cop goes to prison and a pair of jail guards get stung .
Let 's get to it :
In Chicago , a former Chicago police officer was sentenced June 30 to almost 11 years in prison for robbing drug dealers .
Former officer Richard Doroniuk , 33 , had pleaded guilty to racketeering and bribery and testified against another officer involved in return for prosecutors dropping a civil rights charge that could have left him looking at 30 years in prison .
Doroniuk and his partner went down after they were videotaped in an FBI sting stealing $ 31,000 from self - storage lockers they thought were rented by drug dealers .
In Miami , an Everglades Correctional Facility guard was arrested July 2 in a sting where he thought he was negotiating with an inmate 's family to smuggle a pound of pot , four ounces of cocaine , and two cell phones into the prison .
Correctional Officer Shamel Watson went to collect the contraband in Collier County , but was instead met by a Collier County sheriff 's deputy and arrested .
It 's not clear yet what the charges are , but Watson has been fired and prosecutors are promising to go after him to the fullest extent of the law .
In Amite , Louisiana , a Tangipahoa Parish sheriff 's deputy was arrested Monday in a DEA sting .
Deputy Kevin Whittington , 44 , was allegedly providing drugs to inmates at the parish jail , and was arrested after a DEA snitch gave him 24 grams of crack cocaine and he agreed to take it to an inmate at the jail .
He faces federal charges for intent to distribute crack cocaine , and is looking at up to 40 years in prison and a $ 2 million fine if convicted .
RNC Mail Suggests Republicans Could Be Discriminated Against , Lose Their Health Care

UPDATE : The survey is here .
Kathie Durbin reports on the “ 2009 Future of American Health Survey ” sent out by the Republican National Committee .
It ’s this part of the survey that ’s raising eyebrows :
It has been suggested that the government could use voter registration to determine a person ’s political affiliation , prompting fears that GOP voters might be discriminated against for medical treatment in a Democrat - imposed health care rationing system .
Does this possibility concern you ?
That , obviously , has never been part of any health care proposals .

“ All bystanders are not created equal , ’’ Mullin says .
“ They run the gamut from a sidekick egging the bully on to a good Samaritan who steps in . ’’
Most fall somewhere in the middle :
They feel bad but do n’t know what to do , she says .
They need strategies as well as support from peers and adults .
With the growing understanding that bystanders - both children and adults - are key , more schools are engaging in training programs that emphasize the role they play .
Mullin is also a program director for the Olweus Intervention Model , which has been adopted by more than 3,000 American schools , including about 20 in Massachusetts .
Under that model , created by Norwegian psychologist Dan Olweus , the entire school - teachers , students , secretaries , custodians , cafeteria and playground workers - is trained to recognize and curb bullying .
“ Bringing the bystander in was always the critical piece , and in America that response has been the most lacking , ’’ says Nancy Mullin , executive director of Bullying Prevention Inc. , a Natick consulting firm that helps schools combat the problem .
“ The stress has been on incorrectly pathologizing the bully : that they are social misfits and have low self - esteem , which we know is wrong . ’’
Many bullies , she says , are the popular kids who have followers .
In the wake of the various school shootings of the past decade , the focus of curbing antisocial behavior has been on bullies and their victims .
But a third group has emerged as even more critical : the bystanders .
Now , schools , pediatricians , and others who deal with children are seeking to shift some of the responsibility for stopping an act of bullying to those who witness it .
“ I think it ’s very hard to be a bystander , because when you ’re watching a bully , you ’re not sure how or when to intervene .
I think people are scared to intervene , ’’ says Brigitte , who lives in Dover .
“ All it takes is one voice and maybe someone else will join in to stop it .
I think there ’s power in numbers .
Bullies do n’t like to be put on the spot . ’’
But Brigitte - like every other kid - more often has been a witness to bullying than a victim .
And she believes there ’s no such thing as an innocent bystander :
If you ’re a spectator , you ’re a participant .
Still , she knows that helping out is easier said than done .
Brigitte Berman is 15 years old , nearly 5 - feet - 11 , and a self - described science geek .
“ I ’m in a robotics club , and I really like science , and I ’m kind of tall , ’’ she says .
Because of all of that , she has occasionally been the victim of bullying .
So she recently self - published a novel , “ Dorie Witt ’s Guide to Surviving Bullies . ’’
Told in journal form , each chapter contains tips for victims .
Under the Olweus approach , adult witnesses also take more responsibility .
“ Bullying happens in front of or within earshot of adults most of the time , so they need to be the first responders and they need to be effective , ’’ says Mullin .
The sole responsibility , she says , should n’t be “ dumped on kids . ’’
National studies indicate that one - third of children have either been a bully or a victim , and nearly all have been bystanders .
Marlene Snyder , director of development for the Olweus program in the United States , agrees that the majority can no longer remain silent , given the serious consequences .
“ Bystanders are key .
They need to know it is OK not to join in and that they can reach out to those kids who are being bullied , ’’ Snyder says .
“ They can circle back and say , ‘ Come sit with us .
We ’re sorry that happened .
It is n’t right . ’
It takes a lot of courage . ’’
In a new policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics , Boston pediatrician Robert Sege defines the role doctors should play in bullying prevention .
It is the first time the academy has included a section on bullying , including a recommendation that schools adopt the Olweus prevention model .
Protecting children from injury , including bullying , is a key task of pediatricians , says Sege , who is chief of ambulatory pediatrics at Boston Medical Center .
“ The brilliance of it is that Olweus identified that the key to stopping bullying was activating the bystanders , ’’ says Sege , who is also medical director of the hospital ’s child protection team .
“ The kids make a social contract that they ’re going to protect the more vulnerable ones against bullying . ’’
By doing so , he notes , the bystanders ’ view of the bully changes from “ top of the heap to the bottom .
They see that the bully has a problem managing his or her behavior .
They have reinterpreted the bully ’s behavior as weird . ’’
Sege says pediatricians must be ready to ask key questions of patients at routine checkups , as he does : “ What ’s going on at school ?
Do you feel safe there ?
What happens on the playground ?
Do kids get picked on ? ’’
They should also counsel parents about bullying , and be ready to call the school principal on a patient ’s behalf , he adds .
This month , a Springfield mother testified before a congressional subcommittee in the wake of her son ’s suicide following relentless bullying at school .
Sirdeaner Walker told the panel she supports a bill that would require states that receive grants for safe and drug - free schools to invest in bullying prevention programs .
Last year , Brigitte ’s sister , Margot , was the victim of cyberbullying by girls at her school .
“ Gay ’’ or “ lesbian ’ ’ is the slur du jour : Margot , 13 , and her group of friends were targeted by those who posted on Facebook or AIM .
“ They said rude things and made lesbian comments , ’’ says Margot .
Jane Berman , the girls ’ mother , took action .
She knew the offenders ’ parents and felt comfortable talking to them about it .
The girls apologized ; one even sent a handwritten letter .
Berman thinks talking to the parents or school officials is a good solution .
“ I was taught in my generation just to ignore it , ’’ she says .
“ But that really never worked . ’’
Margot , who will enter the eighth grade in the fall , sees lots of name - calling on the school bus .
“ If we see it going on , we always say , ‘ Stop that .
It ’s not nice , ’ or we say something to the person being bullied , like , ‘ How was your day ? ’ ’’
Still , she says , most kids stand by and watch .
“ They ’re afraid to speak up . ’’
Hasan Jafri , 17 , will soon enter his senior year at the Dexter School in Brookline .
His school takes a zero - tolerance approach to hazing and sexual harassment , and he says there ’s not much bullying .
But when he was younger , he witnessed some taunting .
“ I think the bystanders are important , because in my opinion they really can stop it or they can contribute to it , ’’ says Jafri .
As for Brigitte , she has witnessed the “ mean girl ’’ syndrome , where so - called friends turn on one another , excluding first one , then another girl , while spreading gossip .
“ I think it ’s happened to almost every girl , ’’ she says .
“ You do n’t even know what brings it about . ’’
She believes that out of the group of gossipers , one or two will be uncomfortable about it .
And they ’re obliged to do say something - either to the shunners or the shunned .
“ Just walk away and talk to that other girl , ’’ she says .
“ It ’s difficult because you do n’t want to be shunned , either .
But I feel you ’re obligated .
You ca n’t just watch as people just trash another person . ’’

A temporary price listing for Microsoft 's upcoming Zune HD showed the device at $ 290 for its 32 GB offering , a cost more than $ 100 cheaper than the comparable iPod touch model from Apple .
The prices , listed at Amazon , also show a 16GB model for $ 220 , or $ 79 cheaper than the 16GB iPod touch .
The 32GB iPod touch retails for $ 399 .
The listing was captured by PC World .
The devices remain listed at Amazon , but without any prices .
The Amazon Zune HD prices corroborate with alleged internal information from retailer Best Buy , which , according to Gizmodo , also showed price points of $ 220 and $ 290 .
Microsoft is attempting to position the Zune HD as a direct competitor to the iPod touch , even offering multi- touch capabilities and Web browsing on its 3.3 - inch screen .
The device will also , via a dock , output 720P high - definition video and includes an internal HD radio .
The Amazon page also said the Zune HD will play games .
While the lower price point might seem to position the device as a strong alternative , Apple could change the price of its iPod touch offerings well before Microsoft 's touchscreen competitor launches .
Apple is expected to launch new iPods , perhaps with cameras , at an anticipated event this September .
Each year since the iPod touch was released , Apple has also doubled the media player 's maximum capacity .
If that pattern were to continue , the iPod - maker would offer a new 64GB capacity this fall .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britain agreed to include Lockerbie bomber Abdel Basset al - Megrahi in a prisoner transfer deal with Libya because of “ overwhelming interests ” shortly before an oil deal was sealed with Tripoli , a newspaper reported on Sunday .
The Afriqiyah Airways Airbus A300-600 jet carrying Abdel Basset al - Megrahi takes off from Glasgow airport after he was released from prison , August 20 , 2009 .
REUTERS / David Moir
The Sunday Times said leaked letters from Justice Secretary Jack Straw undermined government denials of a link between the former Libyan agent ’s freedom and British trade interests .
Megrahi , 57 , was released from jail on August 20 after Scottish authorities said his terminal cancer gave compassionate grounds for him to return home to die .
The British government has distanced itself from the decision , made by Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill , which has angered many relatives of the bombing ’s victims and the United States government , which lost 189 citizens .
Megrahi was the only person convicted of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie that killed 270 people .
His rapturous reception in Tripoli has been criticized by the British and U.S. governments .
The Sunday Times said two letters from Straw , dated five months apart , showed he reversed an original plan to exclude Megrahi from a prisoner transfer agreement that was being discussed with Libya .
The paper said the change of heart appeared to be linked to a stalled $ 900 million oil and gas exploration deal with Libya for British oil giant BP that was ratified a few weeks later .
BP has always denied any link between the deal and the prisoner agreement .
Straw wrote to MacAskill in July 2007 to say he favored excluding Megrahi from the prisoner transfer , an arrangement desired by the Scottish administration which has autonomous powers over most criminal matters .
But by December 2007 he told MacAskill his position had changed .
“ The wider negotiations with the Libyans are reaching a critical stage and , in view of the overwhelming interests for the United Kingdom , I have agreed that in this instance the ( prisoner transfer agreement ) should be in the standard form and not mention any individual , ” the Sunday Times quoted Straw as writing .
Straw told BBC radio the alleged link between trade and Megrahi ’s release was an “ absurd confection . ”
“ The suggestion that at any stage there was some kind of backdoor deal done over Mr Megrahi ’s transfer because of trade is simply untrue , ” he said
The negotiations on prisoner transfers were part of a “ normalization process ” with Libya , he said .
London had made clear to Tripoli that Scotland would retain an absolute right to refuse a prisoner transfer , he added ,
Straw said the issue was “ academic ” given that Scotland eventually released Megrahi on compassionate grounds and not under the transfer agreement .
Prosecutors said the gnome was ridiculing Nazism German prosecutors have decided to take no action against an artist who created a garden gnome raising its right arm in a Nazi salute .
They say the gold - painted gnome was mocking the Nazis rather than promoting their return .
However , the prosecutors in Nuremburg , Bavaria , warned against any attempt to copy the idea behind the exhibit .
Nazi symbols and Hitler salutes have been illegal in Germany since the end of World War II .
Artist Ottmar Hoerl , 59 , became embroiled in the row when one of his " Nazi " gnomes was put on display at a Nuremburg art gallery earlier this month .
It is pretty clear garden gnomes do silly things - in 1942 I would have been shot by the Nazis for this
Ottmar Hoerl
But after a preliminary inquiry , city prosecutors have ruled that the 40 cm ( 15 in ) statue was poking fun at Nazism , rather than promoting it and therefore was not illegal .
The prosecutors quoted Mr Hoerl as saying : " It is pretty clear that garden gnomes are silly and that they do silly things .
In 1942 I would have been shot by the Nazis for this . "
Although Nazi salutes and symbols are illegal in Germany , prosecutors said they could be allowed if they were clearly used to counter the fascist ideology .
However , they added that gnomes had a " certain abuse potential " and said no - one should try to emulate Mr Hoerl 's work .
Mr Hoerl has been president of Nuremberg 's Academy of Fine Arts since 2005 .
Before the ruling , he said he did n't know what all the fuss was about .
He has also exhibited golden " Nazi " gnomes in Belgium , Italy and in Aschaffenburg , Germany .
Nuremberg is particularly sensitive about the Nazi era as it was the scene of huge rallies by Hitler and also where the trials of leading Nazis took place after the war .

It might seem a total wonder that a smoker wo n't quit after hearing that puffing away is a leading cause of death , or that an obese person can't shed a few pounds after learning that lethal ailments loom for the overweight .
But scientists have come up with a host of reasons why humans stick to bad habits , and they are zeroing in on what to do about it .
Killing Ourselves
A study by scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) found that avoidable behaviors like cigarette use , poor diet and lack of exercise were the underlying cause of half of the deaths in the United States in the year 2000 .
Deaths cause by : Killing Ourselves
A study by scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) found that avoidable behaviors like cigarette use , poor diet and lack of exercise were the underlying cause of half of the deaths in the United States in the year 2000 .
Deaths cause by :
Tobacco : 435,000
435,000 Inactivity and bad eating : 400,000
400,000 Alcohol consumption : 85,000
SOURCE : March 10 , 2004 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association
Among the reasons :
Innate human defiance .
Need for social acceptance .
Inability to truly understand the nature of risk .
Individualistic view of the world and the ability to rationalize unhealthy habits .
Genetic predisposition to addiction .
You'd think people were on a one - track mission to self - destruct rather than desiring immortality .
" We have found that people are n't changing their behaviors , " said Cindy Jardine of the University of Alberta .
" But it 's not because they have n't gotten the information that these are big risks . "
She added , " We tend to sort of live for now and into the limited future — not the long term . "
Killer knowledge
In a recent study , a group led by Jardine surveyed 1,200 people in Alberta , Canada in 1994 and again in 2005 about what they perceived to be risky behaviors .
Many of the participants ranked lifestyle behaviors , such as smoking , drinking and sun tanning , as more dangerous than ozone depletion and chemical pollution .
In a related study that wrapped up this year , the scientists asked groups of indigenous Canadians why they ranked behaviors dangerous or not .
For instance , when asked about drinking and driving , most participants mentioned that you could hurt yourself or somebody else .
If people know cigarettes can kill them or drinking and driving could be lethal , logic suggests they might quit it .
Yet even with this knowledge , Jardine said , people continue to undertake these lifestyle risks .
Everybody 's doing it
Jardine suggests several reasons for the contrary findings .
For one , when a behavior is socially accepted or even considered desirable people tend to reconcile the fact that it 's bad for them with the idea that " everybody 's doing it , " she said .
" I know this is bad for me but in social circles this makes me more accepted , " Jardine said of the common reasoning .
" It ends up being something people rationalize one way or another .
And it 's often easier to rationalize it in favor of trying to fit into your social group . "
Addiction in Your Genes Addiction in Your Genes
Video News Story
One way of making it okay to smoke like a chimney or eat like a pig is with individual experiences that support your action .
For instance , you could say , " It has n't hurt me yet , " or , " My grandmother smoked all her life and lived to be 90 . "
In 2004 , Jardine found that stress moved past cigarette smoking as the most dangerous habit .
" Most of us wear our stress as a badge of honor these days , " Jardine said .
So rather than thinking about stress as causing physical damage to your body and perhaps hurting family relationships , " people often boast of their stress as a success . "
Risky interpretations
Typically the likelihood of contracting a disease or dying from a substance or activity is reported numerically as a percentage or ratio [ see The Odds of Dying ] .
Ellen Peters of the University of Oregon has found that people who are better at processing numbers look at the same information differently than people not as number - minded , who tend to rely more on fear than actual hard evidence .
Being afraid of cancer could drive their decisions on whether or not to smoke or the importance of treatment for particular cancers .
It comes down to emotions , which Peters suggests act as guiding lights in choices .
That 's one reason she thinks the " truth " campaign by the American Legacy Foundation and other anti-cigarette campaigns have been so effective .
The truth ads show gruesome images such as a bleeding brain or inflamed heart with text stating cigarettes as the cause .
One video ad shows a human - size rat walking up from a subway station and then collapsing on the sidewalk with a sign about how cigarettes contain rat poison .
The Truth Hurts ... and Helps The Truth Hurts ... and Helps
A study by the American Legacy Foundation showed that 22 percent of the overall decline in youth smoking from 2000 to 2002 was attributable to their " truth " campaign .
No bad behavior vaccine
Social and physical environments also play large roles in fueling poor habits .
For example , if you perceive that all of your friends are staying up all night , baking in the sun every day at the beach or taking multiple smoke breaks during work , this will affect whether you also take part in the activities .
Couch potatoes might be glued to the TV by external factors more than a lack of desire to be healthy .
" We tell people they need to become physically active , but in certain neighborhoods if you get out and go for a walk you could be putting yourself in harms way from either traffic that 's not well controlled or other kinds of things like violence in your neighborhood , " said Andrea Gielen of Johns Hopkins University 's Bloomberg School of Public Health .
Coming up with successful pro-health campaigns requires more research and multiple strategies , experts say .
" There 's no single strategy or single bullet .
We 're not going to be able to find a vaccine for healthy behavior , " Gielen said .
" We have to be more creative .
We have to have different kinds of partners and work with many different folks . "
This is the final article in a four part series that tells of the rise and fall of Virtudyne , one of the largest privately - financed ( $ 200 M ) disasters in our industry .
Though all names have been changed to protect the guilty , I 've worked very closely with Rob Graves ( the submitter ) to ensure that this presentation is as close to how it happened as possible .
The third article is Virtudyne : The Savior Cometh
After three years of full - time employment at Virtudyne , Rob Graves finally decided to call it quits .
Most of Rob 's friends and family thought he was insane to leave a cushy job where he was making 30 % more than he could anywhere else in town .
But then again , most of his current and former coworkers thought he was insane for staying so long .
Virtudyne had blown through nearly $ 200,000,000 of investor capital over five years to develop their Microsoft Office Killer .
All they had to show for it was a barely functional product with a small subset of Microsoft Office 's features and a single $ 8.5 M sale .
And technically , they only collected $ 5.8 M on the sale because their customer withdrew the contract .
The sales and marketing department were desperate for ideas .
They literally could n't give their software away ; anyone with even the most basic knowledge of Google could find out how well Virtudyne 's first customer worked out .
No one wanted to be their second .
But just then , it dawned on the sales team .
They needed to find a market where the Internet had not yet reached .
In such a market , their office suite would develop interest and that interest would lead right in to sales .
One of the executives knew exactly how to find and penetrate such a market .
They would use The Digital Donkey .
The CEO was a bit skeptical at first , but eventually realized how great of an idea it was .
It was the perfect plan to sell their product to a market that no one else has ever tapped before .
He signed off on the project .
Virtudyne engineers were tasked with figuring out a way to attach a satellite dish , laptops , and solar cells to a donkey .
This Digital Donkey would then take Virtudyne 's software along with a satellite internet connection to disenfranchised villagers living in the rural parts of India .
The villagers would then be able to surf the ' net and use Virtudyne 's software suite to create documents and communicate with " God knows who . "
Everything would go through Virtudyne 's server and they would eventually start billing the local governments for usage .
I think it goes without saying that , like virtually every idea coming from Virtudyne 's management team , the Digital Donkey was a miserable failure .
Virtudyne 's offices are still open to this day , but no one 's sure for how long .
They 've slightly improved their product over the years and tried to sell it under many different names to many different people .
But still , nothing seems to work .
Rob keeps in touch with a programmer at Virtudyne and confirmed that , as of two or three months ago to this day , there has yet to be a second sale .
UPDATE : Reading through the comments , a lot of you seemed to have a hard time buying this .
Perhaps you do n't realize how ubiquitous donkeys / mules / camels / etc are in everyday tasks and transportation in the third world .
Also consider that the idea of a " Digital Donkey " is not originally Virtudyne's .
Take a look at this successful experiment from the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions :
" The mobile units are Donkey Drawn Electro - Communication Library Carts .
Besides functioning as a mobile library with a collection of books and other printed works , it works as a centre for electric and electronic communication : radio , telephone , fax , e-mail , Internet . "

( with pictures , thanks to Antitorgo for finding )
Obviously the illustration above is hyperbolized for fun .
The unbelievable part is not the digital donkey .
What 's so hard to believe ( well , for anyone other than Virtudyne ) is that some one would try to profit from this market .

Kudos to the Times for a story that , for once , emphasizes the remarkable unity of vision health reformers are showing , rather than the squabbles that are an inevitable part of passing major legislation .
The essence is really quite simple : regulation of insurers , so that they ca n’t cherry - pick only the healthy , and subsidies , so that all Americans can afford insurance .
Everything else is about making that core work .
Individual mandates are a way to prevent gaming of the system by people who do n’t sign up until they ’re sick ; employer mandates a way to hold down the on - budget costs by preventing a rush by employers to drop insurance ; the public option a way to create effective competition and hold costs down further .
But what it means for the individual will be that insurers can’t reject you , and if your income is relatively low , the government will help pay your premiums .
That ’s it .
Any commentator who whines that he just does n’t understand it is basically saying that he does n’t want to understand it .

It has been widely reported that on September 11 , 2001 , four passenger aircraft were hijacked , and three of them subsequently hit their intended targets in New York and Washington .
Less well known is that , during the two hours over which the 9/11 attacks occurred , air traffic controllers and military personnel had to devote significant time to a fifth plane that was incorrectly reported as hijacked .
This aircraft was , in the words of one military official , " the first red herring of the day . " [ 1 ]
The aircraft was Delta Air Lines Flight 1989 , a Boeing 767 that had taken off from Boston .
From around 9:30 a.m. , it was repeatedly suspected of having been hijacked .
Even though subsequent events had indicated the aircraft was fine , a police SWAT team and FBI agents were sent out to it after it made an emergency landing in Cleveland , Ohio , and it was not until about two hours after the plane landed that all its passengers had been allowed off .
While a person might dismiss the suspicions about Delta 1989 as understandable mistakes in the chaos and confusion of the attacks , there is another possible explanation for what happened .
We know that the U.S. military and other government agencies were running various training exercises on September 11 .
At least one military exercise was scheduled to include the scenario of a plane being hijacked .
In light of this , the possibility arises that Delta 1989 was playing the part of a hijacked aircraft in a training exercise , and this led to all the mistaken reports about it .
Certainly , the number and nature of suspicious incidents around Delta 1989 make this possibility seem worthy of serious consideration .
While much remains speculative , if this explanation is correct , it would have serious implications .
It would mean that , at the time the attacks took place , a " live - fly " exercise was being conducted , which involved a real aircraft pretending to be hijacked .
It would imply that this exercise was not promptly canceled , but instead continued throughout the entire duration of the attacks .
And it would raise a sinister possibility : that the role of Delta 1989 -- and the exercise it participated in -- was to somehow help rogue individuals within the U.S. military and government to successfully perpetrate the 9/11 attacks .
TWO CATEGORIES OF EVIDENCE
There are two specific categories of evidence indicating that Delta 1989 was a mock hijacked aircraft in an exercise .
Firstly , there were incidents where the plane and its pilots behaved unusually , such as failing to respond to radio communications .
It was as if they were playing the part of a plane under siege , in order to test the ability of Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) and military personnel on the ground to recognize and respond to a hijacking .
Secondly , there were incidents where some government personnel and members of the military alerted others that Delta 1989 had been hijacked , or was in danger of being hijacked , apparently with little justification for doing so .
It is at least possible that these individuals were ' injecting ' false information into the system , for the sake of the exercise , in order to create a realistic impression that Delta 1989 had been hijacked , when in reality it was fine .
I will describe this evidence later on , and then conclude by examining a military exercise that was held in mid-2002 , which makes clear what kind of role Delta 1989 might have played in an exercise on September 11 .
DELTA 1989 RESEMBLED FLIGHTS 11 AND 175
One thing that is notable about Delta 1989 is how much it resembled American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 -- the first planes to be hijacked , which crashed into the World Trade Center .
Like these aircraft , Delta 1989 was a Boeing 767 , heavy with fuel , and making a transcontinental flight across America .
Also like these two flights , it had taken off from Boston 's Logan Airport , at around the same time as they had done . [ 2 ]
And according to numerous accounts , it had the same destination as Flights 11 and 175 , of Los Angeles , California . [ 3 ]
( However , a few accounts have said its destination was Las Vegas . [ 4 ] )
Some accounts have claimed that Delta 1989 's similarity to Flights 11 and 175 contributed to it mistakenly being suspected as hijacked .
But if Delta 1989 was involved in a training exercise , this would mean that an exercise was scheduled for 9/11 in which the mock hijacked aircraft had almost identical characteristics as two of the aircraft targeted in the real - world attacks .
This would be an extraordinary " coincidence , " to say the least , if not highly suspicious .
Not only did Delta 1989 resemble the first two hijacked planes , it also happened to be just 25 miles behind the fourth hijacked plane -- United Airlines Flight 93 -- at the time this aircraft was apparently taken over by hijackers .
This caused air traffic controllers at the FAA 's Cleveland Center to initially conclude that Delta 1989 , not United 93 , had been hijacked .
When , at 9:28 , controller John Werth heard screaming over the radio , he was unsure which aircraft , out of seven or eight in the airspace he was monitoring , it had come from .
When the Cleveland Center controllers then heard a voice with a heavy accent over the radio , saying " Ladies and gentlemen :
Here the captain .
...
We have a bomb on board , " they thought it had come from Delta 1989 .
They concluded that the Delta flight had been hijacked and started notifying their chain of command of this .
It was only after Flight 93 was subsequently observed flying erratically and its pilots failed to respond to radio communications that Werth concluded this flight , and not Delta 1989 , had been hijacked . [ 5 ]
WAS DELTA 1989 PLAYING A HIJACKED AIRCRAFT IN AN EXERCISE ?
It has been well established that the U.S. military and other government agencies were conducting training exercises at the time the 9/11 attacks occurred , and some of the exercise scenarios had uncanny similarities to the actual attacks . [ 6 ]
One exercise , which was being conducted by the North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) , was scheduled to include a simulated aircraft hijacking .
As Vanity Fair described , this exercise " was designed to run a range of scenarios , including a ' traditional ' simulated hijack in which politically motivated perpetrators commandeer an aircraft , land on a Cuba - like island , and seek asylum . " [ 7 ]
When NORAD 's Northeast Air Defense Sector ( NEADS ) in Rome , New York , was notified of the first real - world hijacking at 8:38 a.m. , its mission crew commander , Major Kevin Nasypany , thought this was part of the exercise , which he'd helped to design .
He said out loud , " The hijack 's not supposed to be for another hour . " [ 8 ]
NEADS was in fact alerted to the suspected hijacking of Delta 1989 almost exactly one hour later , at 9:39 a.m . [ 9 ]
This was therefore around the time it was due to be notified of the simulated hijacking in the exercise , and supports the contention that Delta 1989 was playing the targeted aircraft in that exercise .
Delta 1989 made an emergency landing at Cleveland Hopkins Airport shortly after 10:15 a.m . [ 10 ]
Cleveland was one of six major Ohio cities that for several years had been part of a federal program to help defend against domestic terrorism . [ 11 ]
A possibility therefore worth considering is that the decision to land Delta 1989 in Cleveland was made before 9/11 , so that personnel on the ground there would be able to respond to a simulated hijacking , as part of a training exercise for this federal program .
DELTA 1989 INDICATED THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIJACKED
As previously mentioned , there are two categories of evidence that suggest Delta 1989 was playing a hijacked aircraft in an exercise .
The first category involves incidents where the plane and its pilots behaved suspiciously .
These incidents are summarized below .
i ) Just after 9:39 a.m. , when a radio transmission was heard coming from the hijacked Flight 93 in which a hijacker said , " There is a bomb on board , " Cleveland Center controller John Werth started handing off the flights he was dealing with to other controllers so he could devote his attention to Flight 93 .
But , according to author Lynn Spencer , the crew of Delta 1989 missed the hand - off to their new frequency .
The new sector controller dealing with Delta 1989 called out to the plane several times but received no response from its pilots .
According to Spencer , Delta 1989 " was out of radio contact for several minutes , " and this news soon reached an FAA teleconference . [ 12 ]
ii ) Cleveland Center controllers again became suspicious when , at 9:44 a.m. , the pilot of Delta 1989 , Captain Paul Werner , called and requested a change of course so he could land in Cleveland .
As USA Today noted , " the captain 's request comes before he can know that the FAA wants every flight down . " [ 13 ]
( The FAA Command Center instructed air traffic control centers to tell all aircraft to land at the nearest airport a minute later , at 9:45 . [ 14 ] ) USA Today continued : " On this day , the fact that the pilot requests to be rerouted before he is ordered to land seems suspicious .
Why the urgency ? "
The reason was reportedly that Delta Air Lines had been alerted to the concerns about Flight 1989 's safety and had been closely monitoring the aircraft .
It had then sent the pilots an instruction to " Land immediately in Cleveland . "
But even though Cleveland Center was in charge of Delta 1989 , for some reason it was not informed of this . [ 15 ]
Its air traffic controllers then noticed Delta 1989 making a 30 - degree turn back toward its new destination of the Cleveland airport .
Spencer described , " An abrupt change of course for a transcontinental [ Boeing ] 767 out of Boston raises further suspicion . " [ 16 ]
iii )
As Delta 1989 descended toward Cleveland , controllers at the Cleveland Center became suspicious again because pilot Paul Werner failed to reply to a message .
According to USA Today , the reason was simply that Werner was " busy . "
But the controllers grew " alarmed .
Why did n't he respond ?
Have both jets -- the United [ Flight 93 ] and the Delta flights -- been hijacked ? " [ 17 ]
iv ) A notable example of Delta 1989 behaving unusually -- perhaps because it was playing a hijacked plane in an exercise -- occurred while it was under the control of the Cleveland Terminal Radar Approach Control ( TRACON ) .
TRACONs are FAA facilities that guide aircraft approaching or departing an airport .
The Cleveland TRACON was in contact with Delta 1989 as it descended from 9,000 feet down to 3,000 feet . [ 18 ]
According to a detailed chronology produced shortly after 9/11 by the Cleveland Airport air traffic control tower , " One anomaly that perpetuated concern " at the TRACON was that Paul Werner " never used the ' heavy ' designator in his communications . " [ 19 ]
The term " heavy " notifies controllers that they need to provide extra space behind very large aircraft , which are above a certain weight , because these aircraft generate significant wake turbulence . [ 20 ]
The TRACON controllers used this important term in their communications with Delta 1989 , but " the pilot did not respond with it . "
Although this may seem a minor technicality , it is of much significance .
The control tower 's chronology stated : " The use of ' heavy ' in the terminal environment is of the highest importance .
Increased separation standards are required , and misapplication of separation standards can be disastrous .
For pilots , not referring to a heavy aircraft as ' heavy ' is tantamount to calling a doctor ' Mister . ' "
Therefore , Werner 's failure to use the term " kept everyone alert and skeptical of the security " of Delta 1989 . [ 21 ]
Could the reason Werner failed to use the ' heavy ' designator be that he was acting the part of a pilot who was surreptitiously trying to alert controllers that something was wrong on his flight , as part of an exercise ?
v ) A curious final incident occurred after Delta 1989 landed at Cleveland Hopkins Airport .
The plane was directed to park at a remote area , and its pilots were told not to allow passengers off .
Eventually , the Cleveland Police SWAT ( special weapons and tactics ) team and a team of FBI agents went out to the aircraft . [ 22 ]
Members of the SWAT team , who 'd taken up a position just behind the aircraft , saw Paul Werner with blood running down his face as he leaned out of the window to give them the " all clear " signal .
The explanation Spencer has given for his bleeding face is that Werner accidentally knocked his head and cut it when he returned to his seat , after going to the cabin to speak to the plane 's passengers .
While this may be correct , in light of the evidence described above , might Werner 's bloodied face alternatively have been simulated -- using fake blood -- because he was acting the part of the pilot of a plane under siege ?
Perhaps this was supposed to convey the impression that he had been assaulted by one of the exercise 's mock hijackers . [ 23 ]
If Delta 1989 was taking part in a training exercise , the evidence above raises an important question :
How aware were the pilots that real - world attacks had occurred in New York and Washington ?
Reportedly , at around 9:15 a.m. , they heard over the radio that two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center .
According to USA Today , Werner figured these planes " must be small ones - - not passenger jets like the Boeing 767 he commands . "
The pilots also heard the hijacker transmissions , apparently coming from Flight 93 , between 9:28 and 9:39 a.m . [ 24 ]
But did they think these hijacker communications and the news of the attacks in New York were real , or did they believe they were part of an exercise ?
The question remains uninvestigated and , therefore , unanswered .
MILITARY AND OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WRONGLY REPORTED DELTA 1989 AS HIJACKED
The second category of evidence that Delta 1989 was playing a hijacked aircraft in an exercise is a series of incidents where personnel within the military and other government agencies reported that the flight had been hijacked , or was in danger of being hijacked , apparently without having much evidence that this was the case .
Again , individually these incidents could be dismissed as understandable results of the morning 's confusion , or as concerns elicited by the unprecedented and shocking events taking place .
But the number of incorrect reports suggests the possibility that false information was being deliberately ' injected ' into the system for an exercise , to create a realistic impression that Delta 1989 was a hijacked aircraft .
The incidents are summarized below .
i ) The first three notable incidents occurred before anyone claimed Delta 1989 had been hijacked .
Shortly after 9:03 a.m. , when the second plane hit the World Trade Center , FBI agents called the FAA 's Cleveland Center and warned its controllers to keep an eye on Delta 1989 .
According to USA Today , the FBI suspected " that terrorists plan to hijack [ Delta 1989 ] next . "
Apparently they had seen no indications that the flight was in danger , but were concerned because of its similarities to the first two hijacked aircraft , such as it having taken off from Boston at around the same time as them . [ 25 ]
ii )
Then , at 9:19 a.m. , the FAA 's New England regional office called the FAA 's Command Center in Herndon , Virginia , and asked it to tell the Cleveland Center to contact Delta 1989 and advise its pilots to use extra cockpit security .
It is unclear why the New England regional office made this request .
In response to it , as the 9/11 Commission described , the Command Center " ordered controllers to send a cockpit warning to Delta 1989 because , like American 11 and United 175 , it was a transcontinental flight departing Boston 's Logan Airport . " [ 26 ]
The FAA 's Boston Center had previously asked the Command Center to contact all FAA centers , with the instruction to tell airborne aircraft to increase their cockpit security .
What is curious is that the Command Center 's instruction to the Cleveland Center regarding Delta 1989 was apparently an exception : the 9/11 Commission has said it found " no evidence to suggest that the Command Center acted on [ the Boston Center 's ] request . " [ 27 ]
iii )
The third incident from before Delta 1989 was suspected as hijacked occurred at 9:27 a.m. Colonel Alan Scott , the former vice commander of the Continental United States NORAD Region , told the 9/11 Commission that , at this time , the FAA 's Boston Center reported to NEADS " a fifth aircraft missing , Delta Flight ' 89 . " [ 28 ]
Boston Center 's report to NEADS was odd for two reasons .
Firstly , Delta 1989 " never turned off its transponder , " according to the 9/11 Commission , so it was never missing and should have been clearly visible on radar at all times . [ 29 ]
Secondly , at 9:27 , Delta 1989 was being handled by the FAA 's Cleveland Center , not the Boston Center . [ 30 ]
So why did the Boston Center contact NEADS about a flight that was not under its command ?
iv ) Boston Center called NEADS again at 9:39 a.m. regarding Delta 1989 .
Colin Scoggins , the center 's military liaison , reported that the flight was a possible hijack . [ 31 ]
Again , the question applies as to why the Boston Center made this call , since Delta 1989 was still under the control of the FAA 's Cleveland Center . [ 32 ]
And it appears that Scoggins had no evidence that the flight had been targeted .
According to the 9/11 Commission , Boston Center simply " guessed that Delta 1989 might also be hijacked , " apparently because -- like Flights 11 and 175 -- it was a transcontinental 767 that had departed Boston 's Logan Airport . [ 33 ]
v) At 9:45 a.m. , one of the ID technicians at NEADS called the FAA 's Cleveland Center and incorrectly said that Delta 1989 was " a confirmed hijack . "
This prompted a supervisor there to go " running back and forth " around the center , informing the controllers and managers of the news . [ 34 ]
The supervisor , Kim Wernica , spoke to John Werth , the controller who had been handling Delta 1989 .
She told him , " It 's the Delta , it 's the Delta ! "
She said a military liaison on the phone had confirmed that the Delta jet had been hijacked .
However , due to its pilots ' normal responses to his instructions , Werth had already concluded that Delta 1989 had not been hijacked .
He told Wernica he was pretty sure that Flight 93 , not Delta 1989 , had been hijacked , and when she returned a few moments later , he said Delta 1989 was " fine , at least for now . "
But after Wernica consulted again on the phone , she came back and said to Werth , " They said it 's a confirmed hijack and a bomb threat . "
Convinced that Delta 1989 was being confused with United 93 , Werth responded , " Tell them they 're full of it ! " [ 35 ]
MILITARY , FAA , POLICE , AND FBI RESPONDED TO HIJACK REPORTS
Although they turned out to be incorrect , the reports that Delta 1989 had been hijacked were taken seriously at the time and acted upon .
NEADS commanders ordered their troops to call Air National Guard bases in the vicinity of the Delta aircraft , to see if any of them could launch fighter jets . [ 36 ]
According to the 9/11 Commission , NEADS ordered jets from Ohio and Michigan to intercept Delta 1989 . [ 37 ]
When Delta 1989 was coming in to land , Cleveland Hopkins Airport was evacuated .
As Spencer wrote , this was because the flight was " confirmed hijacked , " and air traffic controllers " believe it contains a bomb intended to detonate when the aircraft crashes into the terminal . " [ 38 ]
Furthermore , for the first time in his administration , Mayor Michael
White ordered the evacuation of all federal and city buildings in Cleveland ; a parking ban was issued downtown ; and owners of large commercial high - rises in Cleveland were asked to evacuate their buildings . [ 39 ]
After it landed , Delta 1989 had to park at a remote area of Cleveland Airport , far away from the terminal .
Its passengers were only allowed off after a police SWAT team came out , and FBI agents then carefully took the passengers off the plane in small groups . [ 40 ]
Bomb - sniffing dogs were subsequently taken onboard and the aircraft was searched , but no explosives were found . [ 41 ]
EXERCISE MAY HAVE CONTINUED DESPITE REAL-WORLD ATTACKS
If , as the evidence above indicates , Delta 1989 was part of a military exercise based around a fictitious aircraft hijacking , this raises serious questions about the events of 9/11 and the emergency response to the attacks .
The evidence casts doubt on the claim that a NORAD exercise that morning was canceled after Flight 175 hit the South Tower of the WTC at 9:03 a.m.
According to Airman , the official magazine of the U.S. Air Force , " Shortly after the second airliner smashed into [ the ] World Trade Center ... the exercise ceased . " [ 42 ]
Larry Arnold , the commanding general of the Continental United States NORAD Region , said that after Flight 175 hit the South Tower , " I thought it might be prudent to pull out of the exercise , which we did . " [ 43 ]
But if Delta 1989 was participating in it , then the evidence indicates that this exercise continued for much longer .
For example , NEADS received the incorrect report that Delta 1989 was a possible hijacking at 9:39 a.m. , and called the FAA 's Cleveland Center to report the aircraft as a " confirmed hijack " at 9:45 a.m .
These two communications could have been part of the exercise , intended to ' inject ' a realistic impression of a hijacking into the system .
And it appears that Delta 1989 may still have been playing a hijacked aircraft while it came in to land ( with the pilot failing to use the ' heavy ' designator ) , and continued doing so after it landed at around 10:18 a.m. ( when the pilot appeared out of the plane 's window , apparently with blood running down his face ) .
This would mean the exercise continued throughout the entire duration of the real - world attacks , ending only after the fourth aircraft to be targeted -- Flight 93 - - supposedly crashed in Pennsylvania at 10:03 a.m . [ 44 ]
If this was indeed the case , why was the simulated hijacking allowed to continue for so long ?
And who was responsible for this ?
A LIVE -FLY EXERCISE IN 2002
We can better understand the role Delta 1989 might have played on September 11 by examining a later NORAD training exercise .
" Amalgam Virgo 02 " was a " live - fly " exercise conducted in June 2002 , although NORAD was planning it as early as July 2001 . [ 45 ]
This exercise involved two real aircraft being " hijacked , " with actors playing the terrorists .
One aircraft , a Delta Air Lines 757 , was bound from Utah to Alaska and was taken over by FBI agents acting as hijackers .
The other was a Navy C - 9 bound from Washington State to Vancouver , Canada , with members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police playing the hijackers .
On both planes , military personnel acted as civilian passengers , but the 757 had actual Delta Air Lines pilots at the controls .
According to a NORAD spokesman , " both aircraft ... were to receive instructions once in - air , detailing the hijacking scenario affecting them and the roles they were to play . "
NORAD launched fighter jets in response to the simulated hijackings .
CNN reported before the exercise : " We do n't know exactly how these [ simulated ] hijackings will play out .
Neither do the pilots .
Even their bases from which the U.S. and military -- the U.S. - Canadian jets will be scrambled , do n't know they are . "
After NORAD ran through a number of scenarios , the mock hijacked planes landed and law enforcement officers on the ground ran through scenarios around dealing with the hijackers .
About 1,500 people participated in Amalgam Virgo 02 , including employees of NORAD , the FAA , the FBI , the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) , and Delta Air Lines .
The NORAD spokesman said the exercise was " very intense , very realistic . " [ 46 ]
Could Delta 1989 have been taking part in a similar exercise on September 11 ?
Were some of its passengers played by military personnel or other government employees ?
Only a thorough new investigation of the 9/11 attacks can answer these and the many other crucial questions that remain , around Delta Air Lines Flight 1989 and its possible involvement in a training exercise on September 11 .

According to the most recent CDC data , America is fatter than ever .
And , according to the CDC and the media and the Trust for America ’s Health , things are only getting worse :
And , as I reported in a previous post , by 2048 , researchers have projected that ALL Americans will be overweight or obese .
Wow !
This obesity epidemic sounds pretty dire .
So , what are we going to do ?
Do we go it alone as individuals or do we come together as a community and try to whip our collective selves into shape ?
In previous posts , I have discussed how some progressive public officials have used public funds to equip public parks with outdoor fitness equipment .
And on a personal level , I have also begun discussing my plans for no -cost / low - cost public fitness classes with various levels of government up here in Canada … … frustrating , mind - numbing discussions full of political B.S. , but what can you do , they ’re politicians .
But what about the big boys ?
The guys with the connections and the money and the influence .
What do those guys think we should do about America ’s ( the world ’s ) Obesity Epidemic ?
In their annual report ( F as in Fat ) , the Trust for America ’s Health has :
A series of recommendations to make preventing and reducing obesity a central objective of health reform , and It also calls for a National Strategy to Combat Obesity .
.
1. The Recommendations for Preventing / Reducing Obesity
Alright , sounds great … if you believe in publicly funded health care
2. National Strategy to Combat Obesity
pdf version
Once again , sounds great to all of those people who voted for Pres.
Obama .
.
So , why do I feel apprehensive about this national strategy to combat obesity ?
Does America really need a national strategy to combat obesity ?
Does the USDA need expanded powers over national nutrition standards ?
Does Medicare require additional funding for obesity - related coverage ?
At present , the USDA heavily subsidizes the very foods that have driven the rise in obesity .
Instead of giving them more power , perhaps they could be encouraged to shift their funding away from corn , wheat , rice , soy & sugar and towards fruits , vegetables and animal proteins that provide a better nutrient to calorie ratio .
Instead of classifying obesity as a disease and increasing medicare funding to include more obesity drug prescriptions and surgeries , perhaps the government could shift some money away from obesity treatment and towards obesity prevention .
Those are the types of big government initiatives that I could get behind .
.
Thus endeth the rant .

A new law passed by the Arizona Legislature that makes homeowners liable for tens of thousands of dollars on homes lost to foreclosure is now the focus of an intense repeal battle .
An amendment to the state 's foreclosure laws , passed in the recent legislative session , was designed to protect small community banks from people buying speculative new homes they can't sell for a profit .
But the impact of the change is much larger .
It makes some homeowners in foreclosure liable for the difference between their mortgage and what their lender can recoup from reselling the house .
In the current housing market , the difference is generally more than $ 100,000 on the typical Valley foreclosure .
Real - estate lobbyists and attorneys for homeowners are working to have the law repealed before the Legislature adjourns after completing its work on the budget .
Banks are pushing hard to keep the amendment in place .
If the new rules stand , they go into effect Sept. 30 .
The new law would affect any Arizona homeowner in foreclosure who has not lived in the home for six straight months .
This might include landlords , second - home owners and investors who bought homes hoping for quick resales and big profits .
Once the home is sold in foreclosure , the homeowner would have to pay back the remaining value of the loan , minus the proceeds from the foreclosure sale .
Currently , Arizona homeowners , including investors , who lose a house to foreclosure take a big hit on their credit scores but are n't usually required to pay back lenders .
The new law is n't retroactive , but those facing foreclosure now could be affected if the lender does n't foreclose and take back the home until after Sept. 30 .
Under the new law , lenders will be able to garnish wages and go after other assets to recover the money .
In metropolitan Phoenix , where home values have dropped 45 percent and foreclosures are at record highs , that amounts to millions of dollars .
" This wo n't just impact investors .
This law will hurt retirees who live in Arizona less than half of the year , or people from the Valley who own second homes up north , " said Tom Farley , chief executive of the Arizona Realtors Association .
" Arizona is No. 2 for foreclosures now .
If this law is n't changed , the state could lead the nation for bankruptcies next year . "
Opponents of the new law say it will force homeowners to file for bankruptcy to protect their assets from lenders .
They also believe it will encourage more lenders to foreclose instead of trying to work out loan - modification deals with borrowers .
Some housing market watchers say the change could also deter investment in the state 's housing market , which would be a blow to the economy .
State Sen. Steve Pierce , R - Prescott , backed the legislation , SB 1271 .
He said in June testimony that the changes to the anti-deficiency statute are to help community banks that lend to investors hiding behind the current laws .
Pierce described scenarios in which investors had speculative homes built but could n't sell them and then camped out in them for a few days to claim them as primary residences so they would n't be liable for the lender 's losses .
Under current Arizona foreclosure law , a homeowner does n't have to live in a home for a certain amount of time to claim it as a primary residence .
In most cases , if homeowners can prove they receive mail at a residence , it 's enough proof of their residency .
Who is protected
The amendment was made to the state 's anti-deficiency law , passed in the mid-1980s , which kept lenders from recovering anything more than the home on a typical residential foreclosure .
About two dozen states have anti-deficiency laws .
Some small speculators have been using the anti-deficiency law to protect their other assets .
Under the new law , a homeowner must live in a house for six consecutive months to establish residency and to be covered by the anti-deficiency law .
Homeowners who lose a home to foreclosure , and who fail to meet the six - month residency requirement , will be liable for the difference between the foreclosure sale price and the original loan .
For example , if a lender forecloses on a home with a $ 400,000 mortgage balance and can only resell the home for $ 200,000 , then the borrower still will owe the lender $ 200,000 .
Opponents argue that while the new law may have been aimed at people having speculative homes built in small communities , it will have many unintended victims .
Among them : people who bought second or retirement homes in Arizona and are struggling now because of the recession .
Most of those people will fall behind on second - home mortgages before losing their primary residence .
But if they owe too much on their second homes , lenders could go after their primary homes and all other assets to recoup the loss .
" There wo n't be a lot of sympathy for the big investors , but the problem becomes legally working out who is an investor , " said Jay Butler , director of Realty Studies at Arizona State University .
Butler said he was at a meeting last week with real - estate agents who were " shocked " the legislation passed .
" Lenders that should n't have made the loans to investors in the first place , " Butler said , " are trying to cover up their own mistakes with this new law . "
Investors at risk
Many blame investors for the Valley 's housing boom that led to the current crash .
During 2005 , investors were behind almost 40 percent of all of metro Phoenix 's home sales .
Foreclosures started to climb in 2007 when investors could n't sell the houses for a profit and let them go into foreclosure .
" There are investors and speculators taking advantage of the ( anti- deficiency ) statutes , " said Tanya Wheeless , president of the Arizona Bankers Association .
" When investors were making lots of money flipping houses , they never called up their lender and offered to split the profits .
Now , investors are losing money and trying to hide from their responsibility of the losses . "
Opponents say the new law wo n't affect the sophisticated investors who buy homes through limited liability partnerships that protect their personal assets .
Farley of the Arizona Realtors Association admits the broader impact of the legislation was a surprise .
" If you have a second home in Flagstaff , " he said , " and fall behind on payments because your spouse has lost their job , lenders can foreclose and garnish your wages and put liens on your bank accounts and your primary home .
" What about parents who buy homes for their children to live in while going to college ?
If something happens to them in this tough economy , they could lose both their homes .
And really , how many second - home owners can show they have lived in their vacation home six months straight ? "
Last - minute lobbying
Real - estate lobbyists are working overtime to have the law killed before the Sept. 30 deadline .
A new bill must be written that repeals or reverses SB 1271 .
However , the Legislature is in a special session , and Gov. Jan Brewer would have to amend the purpose of the special budget session to hear the new legislation .
She has amended the session once so far to include renewable - energy credits .
The Realtors Association asked Brewer last week to amend the current session and is looking for a legislator to back a bill to kill the changes to the anti-deficiency law .
If that plan does n't work , the new rules could not be changed until next year 's session .
Wheeless said she 's surprised so many groups are shocked by the new rules , because SB 1271 went through full hearings .
" The legislation was fully vetted and out in the open for those who opposed it to weigh in , " she said .
" Our intent is to protect homeowners who live in their residences . "
Arizona attorneys are already receiving calls from lenders that want to know about the new law .
" I got a call from an out - of - state lender that is considering holding off on a foreclosure until after September 30 , " said Phoenix real - estate attorney Marc McCain .
" The lender thinks this investor has the income to pay the mortgage but is walking away from a home because he can't sell it and just does n't want to keep paying for it . "
The new law could also lead to costly lawsuits .
" If the legislation is n't repealed , it will probably end up being hashed out in the courts between lenders and borrowers , " Butler said .
" The typical homeowner probably does n't have the money to fight a big lender , particularly if they are already facing foreclosure . "
Buddhism — some Buddhism , anyway — is a practice of contemplation and inquiry that does n't depend on belief in God or a soul or anything supernatural .
Therefore , the theory goes , it can't be a religion .
Sam Harris expressed this view of Buddhism in his essay " Killing the Buddha " ( Shambhala Sun , March 2006 ) .
Harris admires Buddhism , calling it " the richest source of contemplative wisdom that any civilization has produced . "
But he thinks it would be even better if it could be pried away from Buddhists .
" The wisdom of the Buddha is currently trapped within the religion of Buddhism , " Harris laments .
" Worse still , the continued identification of Buddhists with Buddhism lends tacit support to the religious differences in our world .
...
Given the degree to which religion still inspires human conflict , and impedes genuine inquiry , I believe that merely being a self - described ' Buddhist ' is to be complicit in the world 's violence and ignorance to an unacceptable degree . "
The phrase " Killing the Buddha " comes from a Zen saying , " If you meet the Buddha on the road , kill him . "
Harris interprets this as a warning against turning the Buddha into a " religious fetish " and thereby missing the essence of his teachings .
But this is Harris 's interpretation of the phrase .
In Zen , " killing the Buddha " means to extinguish ideas and concepts about the Buddha in order to realize the True Buddha .
Harris is not killing the Buddha ; he is merely replacing a religious idea of the Buddha with a non-religious one more to his liking .
Head Boxes
In many ways , the " religion versus philosophy " argument is an artificial one .
The neat separation between religion and philosophy we insist on today did n't exist in western civilization until the 18th century or so , and there never was such a separation in eastern civilization .
To insist that Buddhism must be one thing and not the other amounts to forcing an ancient product into modern packaging .
In Buddhism , this sort of conceptual packaging is considered to be a barrier to enlightenment .
Without realizing it we use prefabricated concepts about ourselves and the world around us to organize and interpret what we learn and experience .
One of the functions of Buddhist practice is to sweep away all the artificial filing cabinets in our heads so that we see the world as - it -is .
In the same way , arguing about whether Buddhism is a philosophy or a religion is n't an argument about Buddhism .
It 's an argument about our biases regarding philosophy and religion .
Buddhism is what it is .
Dogma Versus Mysticism
The Buddhism - as - philosophy argument leans heavily on the fact that Buddhism is less dogmatic than most other religions .
This argument , however , ignores mysticism .
Mysticism is hard to define , but very basically it is the direct and intimate experience of ultimate reality , or the Absolute , or God .
The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy has a more detailed explanation of mysticism .
Buddhism is deeply mystical , and mysticism belongs to religion more than philosophy .
Through meditation , Siddhartha Gautama intimately experienced
Thusness beyond subject and object , self and other , life and death .
The enlightenment experience is the sine qua non of Buddhism .
Transcendence
What is religion ?
Those who argue that Buddhism is not a religion tend to define religion as a belief system , which is a western notion .
Religious historian Karen Armstrong defines religion as a search for transcendence , going beyond the self .
It 's said that the only way to understand Buddhism is to practice it .
Through practice , one perceives its transformative power .
A Buddhism that remains in the realm of concepts and ideas is not Buddhism .
The robes , ritual and other trappings of religion are not a corruption of Buddhism , as some imagine , but expressions of it .
There 's a Zen story in which a professor visited a Japanese master to inquire about Zen .
The master served tea .
When the visitor 's cup was full , the master kept pouring .
Tea spilled out of the cup and over the table .
" The cup is full ! " said the professor .
" No more will go in ! "
" Like this cup , " said the master , " You are full of your own opinions and speculations .
How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup ? "
If you want to understand Buddhism , empty your cup .
Does anyone remember when Town Hall forums were civil affairs that gave citizens a chance to speak freely to their elected representatives in a civil conversation ?
Yeah , that would have been last week .
In the days since , Republicans and their astroturf gangs of protesters have transformed town halls into outlets for their prearranged shoutfests ginned up by Fox talkers .
The old town - hall forum may never be the same .
And the country is the worse for it .
Check out the ugliness yesterday in Tampa Bay .
It certainly fits the blueprint for action laid out early on in this effort : Disrupt , distract , and destroy any chance for an actual civil and informed conversation .
In other words , demolish the entire purpose of a town - hall forum .
As Paul Krugman puts it :
Some commentators have tried to play down the mob aspect of these scenes , likening the campaign against health reform to the campaign against Social Security privatization back in 2005 .
But there ’s no comparison .
I ’ve gone through many news reports from 2005 , and while anti-privatization activists were sometimes raucous and rude , I ca n’t find any examples of congressmen shouted down , congressmen hanged in effigy , congressmen surrounded and followed by taunting crowds .
And I can’t find any counterpart to the death threats at least one congressman has received .
... [ T ]he driving force behind the town hall mobs is probably the same cultural and racial anxiety that ’s behind the “ birther ” movement , which denies Mr. Obama ’s citizenship .
Senator Dick Durbin has suggested that the birthers and the health care protesters are one and the same ; we do n’t know how many of the protesters are birthers , but it would n’t be surprising if it ’s a substantial fraction .
And cynical political operators are exploiting that anxiety to further the economic interests of their backers .
No one has a problem with right - wingers marching in protest of the health - care plans .
That 's certainly their right .
And no one minds that they choose to participate in these forums .
But town halls were never designed to be vehicles for protest .
They have always been about enabling real democratic discourse in a civil setting .
When someone 's entire purpose in coming out to a town - hall forum is to chant and shout and protest and disrupt , they are n't just expressing their opinions -- they are actively shutting down democracy .
And that , folks , is a classically fascist thing to do .
Hey !
There is a followup post here !
Google , the King of Search .
Gmail , the darling of geeks everywhere for mail .
Links : Gmail ; Yahoo ; Cyrus - IMAP ; Squirrel Mail
I am my family ’s IT Director for our house ( in her day job my wife has been an IT Director , so it is occasionally an ironic situation ) .
Long ago , I used a Cyrus - IMAP server in my server closet to provide email for both of us ; it worked really well .
I still have pages of notes on how to compile and set it up under Debian ; it was a bear , but once set up it worked for years without a problem .
Via SSH , we could both get to our mail from work ; you could even throw a tunnel to Squirrel Mail for web - mail access .
Life was good .
Then came the seductive invite to Gmail ; I forget how I got it , but that early invite made my geek palms sweat .
Soon I was reveling in threaded conversations , archiving with abandon .
That was a while ago ; at this point I have been using Gmail / Google Calendar for a long time , having ditched the in - house IMAP server after moving my wife ’s email to Gmail .
My iPhone is fairly happy with Gmail as well .
But there ’s this little problem , why may drive me away from Gmail entirely :
Gmail ’s search functionality sucks rocks .
Seriously .
Why is Gmail ’s search so primitive ?
Is n’t search one of Google ’s core competencies ?
I understand that email search != web search , but come on , it really stinks .
To illustrate :
I had previously bought some Zaggs ’ Z.buds for my iPhone .
When they died , I needed to the email receipt for my purchase in order to get them replaced .
No problem .
Open up Gmail , search for “ Zags ” .
Nothing .
( Should n’t be any ; I spelled it wrong ) “ zbuds ” .
Nothing . “ zag ” .
Nothing .
“ headset ” ( reaching now ! ) .
Nothing .
I give up .
I go to my Yahoo !
Mail Account , which gets a copy of all my email .
Total disorganized mess of thousands of un-tagged , un - foldered messages .
Search for “ zag ” .
Bang , it finds the the substring in Zagg .
How helpful .
Back to Gmail , search for “ zagg ” , boom , Gmail finds it .
Curious , I troll around the web looking for information on how to substring search in Gmail .
Surely it is just a matter of learning an incantation in the search box , right ?
Nope .
No matter how hard I tried , I could n’t find a way search for anything less granular than words .
Apparently , Gmail indexes on words alone .
Fail .
People ’s names for me are a disaster ; I consistently remember bits of people ’s names and can’t find their emails without scrolling through lists of emails .
Labels ?
They are nice , but they are not really a search tool , unless you are going to tag each email with ten labels and manage hundreds of labels .
No more useful than folders for searching .
This has gone from a minor niggle to a regular hassle for me ; I just do n’t remember things in word - level detail anymore .
Fragments , that is what sticks in my brain .
Gmail ’s lack of substring searching is really beginning to look like a big hole to me .
Ca n’t they add an albeit slower version of search which supports wild - carding ?
Something you only get via an advanced options dialog or some such ?
Maybe it is n’t allowed for filters ; I do n’t know what the server load issues might be .
But for interactive use — that would be great .
Right now , search is lame .
And as I get more emails in there , it becomes more and more of an issue .
Every time I want to use my hazy recollection to find a half - remembered email from three years ago , it becomes a bigger issue .
I shudder to think what will happen in ten years .
So that Yahoo !
Mail Premium account for $ 20 a year is looking better now .
Google is the king of search , yet Gmail search sucks .
Who ’d a thunk it ?

1. Overview
The Multichord musical instrument is an acoustic stringed instrument with a single string , constructed from wood , a hard drive , 20 - lb monofilament , and assorted electronic components .
It was the culmination of a project to build an acoustic instrument capable of playing multiple notes without fretting or manual , time - consuming retuning .
The Multichord achieves this by attaching a hard drive read / write head assembly between the resonant string and a tensioning spring to adjust the tension of the instrument 's string .
Careful adjustment was made to the tension of both the string and the spring with the hard drive head in a neutral , unpowered position to ensure a bipolar application of voltage within the safety ratings of the hard drive 's coil could cause the string to cover a full musical octave .
In the end , the Multichord was tuned to a C - major scale ( no flats or sharps ) running from A at 220 Hz through ( but not including ) A at 440Hz .

The Multichord project took about a month to complete , although in total in only cost about twenty to thirty hours of work .
The base of the Multichord was a previous project called the Monochord , a purely - acoustic instrument with a single tensioned string and pencil markings for fretting to play an entire octave .
However , I was displeased with the fretting process ; a finger on the string would severely dampen the sound fom the open string , and even a piece of metal used to fret changed the timbre significantly .
Therefore , I wanted to create an instrument that could electronically change the note that would be produced without changing the timbre of the instrument .
Based on my knowledge of stringed instruments , I knew that changing the length of the resonant string or adjusting its tension both cause a change in the fundamental frequency produced when the string is plucked .
Therefore , I disassembled a computer hard drive and mounted it on the end of the instrument in place of one anchor , leaving the other end as an adjustable tuning peg .
Because the steel string used in the original Monochord seemed far too hard for the hard drive to pull , it was replaced with a 20 - lb monofilament thread , and a spring was attached to the hard drive head to counter the pull of the string .
With the hard drive securely screwed onto the now - Multichord body , and the spring and string attached , it was time to begin tuning the instrument .
A primary goal of the project was to be able to cover at least one octave , which was initially difficult with the limited length change and tension change that the har drive 's read / write head is able to achieve .
Extensive experimentation was done wherein the unpowered frequency of the string was checked with a spectrum analyzer , then the coil was powered with + 12V and the frequency measured , then the process repeated with - 12V .
To cover a full octave , the frequency with - 12V had to be at most half the frequency in Hertz at +12 V , as each octave doubles the frequencies of the previous octave .
Eventually a combination of initial string and spring tensions and resonant lengths was found that allowed notes from about 220 Hz up to slightly under 440 Hz .
Because of later power losses that were found , the maximum voltage range turned out to be ± 13.0V .
Once the base frequency range was found , it was necessary to tune the instrument .
Handily , the unpowered string was very close to 330 Hz , the note E , so it was adjusted to this note .
Then , the voltage was slowly adjusted between 0 and +13.0V for F and G , and between 0 and - 13.0 V for D , C , B , and A .
The proper voltage values found are tabulated below .
Note Frequency ( Hz ) Applied Voltage ( V ) Resistance ( Ω ) Nominal Current ( A ) A 220 - 13.0V 0Ω 1.18A B 247 - 10.5V 2.6Ω 0.77A C 262 - 8.3V 6.3Ω 0.48A D 294 - 4.6V 20.0Ω 0.15A E 330 0.0V [ inf ] Ω 0.0A F 349 2.8V 40.0Ω 0.05A G 392 9.1V 4.7Ω 0.58A
As shown in the table , applied voltages to the coil varied from - 13.0 V through +9.1V in practice ; +13.0V was insufficient to reach the A in the next octave , so this was omitted .
As the coil was measured at 11.0 Ω on its own , R c = 11.0Ω , and the supply voltage V cc was set at 13.0 V .
From
Ohm 's law , the total current flowing through the coil for any given resistance R=R c +R r , where R r is a secondary 20 W power resistor with the values given in the table above , is V cc =IR=I ( R c +R r ) .
This would be impossible to solve if we knew nothing else , since there are two unknowns ( I and R r ) , but we know one other fact .
We want to adjust the voltage drop over the coil V c to each of the values in the table above , and we know its resistance is R c = 11.0Ω , so it follows ( I being constant in a series loop ) that V c = 11.0 I and that I=V c / 11 .
Therefore , plugging this into the first equation , 13 = ( V c /11 ) ( 11+R r ) .
Simplification yields R r =143 / V c - 11 .
A chart of values for this equation from V c =0 through V c = 13.0 was plotted in Matlab , and is shown below :
With all the resistor values picked , the next step was to construct the required resistances out of power resistors ( 20 W ) .
Normal 1/4W resistors could not be used because power dissipation approaches a maximum of 15.3W for an A note .
The only resistors available were 0.33Ω , 0.47Ω , 2.0Ω , 8.0Ω , and a single 10.0Ω .
The diagram below shows the resistor ladder networks generated for these values to produce each of the required resistance values :
Construction was then begun .
The resistor networks were constructed and soldered , each was double - sided foam taped to a mounting board , and a header was added connected to each resistor .
Next the button panel was soldered , with thick wires for as low resistance as possible .
Finally , everything was mounted and the instrument was tested .
To my great surprise , no adjustments were necessary .
The final schematic for the Multichord is shown below :

I think many people out there underestimate the power of well used Photoshop brushes .
A good designer can use Photoshop brushes in a variety of ways to accomplish a plethora of results .
If you thought the Photoshop brushes were just for those new to Photoshop or just to add a touch of grunge to a design , you are sadly mistaken .
For some good examples on how Photoshop brushes can be used , check out these tutorials :
To really show off just how well Photoshop brushes could be used in web design , I have selected 18 amazingly designed websites that feature a good use of Photoshop brushes or elements that also come in the form of Photoshop brushes .
In addition to showcases such designs , I have also linked to Photoshop brushes similar to the ones used in the designs or that are similar to the elements in the design .

Interpol has issued an international wanted notice for the head of a Pakistan - based Islamic charity over the 2008 Mumbai ( Bombay ) attacks .
The wanted man is Hafiz Saeed who heads Jamaat - ud - Dawa , accused of being a front for the Lashkar - e - Taiba militant group blamed by India for the attacks .
He denies involvement .
Gunmen killed more than 160 people in the attacks .
Earlier this month , Pakistan 's Supreme Court adjourned a hearing seeking Mr Saeed 's re-arrest .
A lawyer acting for Hafiz Saeed said the prosecution was not prepared for the case .
He was released in June by a Lahore court which found insufficient evidence for his continued detention .
Interpol has also issued a similar red notice against Pakistan - based Zaki Ur Rehman Lakhvi , who India says is one of the masterminds of the Mumbai attacks .
The Interpol notices followed the decision of a court in Mumbai to issue non-bailable arrest warrants against the two men for their alleged role in the Mumbai attacks .
Many Interpol member countries view a red notice as a legal basis for arrest or detention of a suspect , but they are not required to do so .
When I was in fourth grade , my class took a field trip to the American Tobacco plant in nearby Durham , North Carolina .
There we witnessed the making of cigarettes and were given free packs to take home to our parents .
I tell people this and they ask me how old I am , thinking , I guess , that I went to the world ’s first elementary school , one where we wrote on cave walls and hunted our lunch with clubs .
Then I mention the smoking lounge at my high school .
It was outdoors , but , still , you ’d never find anything like that now , not even if the school was in a prison .
I recall seeing ashtrays in movie theatres and grocery stores , but they did n’t make me want to smoke .
In fact , it was just the opposite .
Once , I drove an embroidery needle into my mother ’s carton of Winstons , over and over , as if it were a voodoo doll .
She then beat me for twenty seconds , at which point she ran out of breath and stood there panting , “ That ’s . . . not . . . funny . ”
A few years later , we were sitting around the breakfast table and she invited me to take a puff .
I did .
Then I ran to the kitchen and drained a carton of orange juice , drinking so furiously that half of it ran down my chin and onto my shirt .
How could she , or anyone , really , make a habit of something so fundamentally unpleasant ?
When my sister Lisa started smoking , I forbade her to enter my bedroom with a lit cigarette .
She could talk to me , but only from the other side of the threshold , and she had to avert her head when she exhaled .
I did the same when my sister Gretchen started .
It was n’t the smoke but the smell of it that bothered me .
In later years , I did n’t care so much , but at the time I found it depressing : the scent of neglect .
It was n’t so noticeable in the rest of the house , but then again the rest of the house was neglected .
My room was clean and orderly , and if I ’d had my way it would have smelled like an album jacket the moment you remove the plastic .
That is to say , it would have smelled like anticipation .
When I started smoking myself , I realized that a lit cigarette acted as a kind of beacon , drawing in any freeloader who happened to see or smell it .
It was like standing on a street corner and jiggling a palmful of quarters .
“ Spare change ? ” someone might ask .
And what could you say ?
The first time I was hit on , I was twenty years old and had been smoking for all of two days .
This was in Vancouver , British Columbia .
My best friend , Ronnie , and I had spent the previous month picking apples in Oregon , and this trip to Canada was our way of rewarding ourselves .
We stayed that week in a cheap residence hotel , and I remember being enchanted by the Murphy bed , which was something I had heard about but never seen in person .
During the time we were there , my greatest pleasure came in folding it away and then looking at the empty spot where it had been .
Pull it out , fold it away , pull it out , fold it away .
Over and over until my arm got tired .
It was in a little store a block from our hotel that I bought my first pack of cigarettes .
The ones I ’d smoked earlier had been Ronnie ’s — Pall Malls , I think — and though they tasted no better or worse than I thought they would , I felt that in the name of individuality I should find my own brand , something separate .
Something me .
Carltons , Kents , Alpines : it was like choosing a religion , for were n’t Vantage people fundamentally different from those who ’d taken to Larks or Newports ?
What I did n’t realize was that you could convert , that you were allowed to .
The Kent person could , with very little effort , become a Vantage person , though it was harder to go from menthol to regular , or from regular - sized to ultra-long .
All rules had their exceptions , but the way I came to see things they generally went like this : Kools and Newports were for black people and lower - class whites .
Camels were for procrastinators , those who wrote bad poetry , and those who put off writing bad poetry .
Merits were for sex addicts , Salems for alcoholics , and Mores for people who considered themselves to be outrageous but really were n’t .
One should never lend money to a Marlboro - menthol smoker , though you could usually count on a regular - Marlboro person to pay you back .
The eventual subclasses of milds , lights , and ultra - lights not only threw a wrench in the works but made it nearly impossible for anyone to keep your brand straight .
All that , however , came later , along with warning labels and American Spirits .
The cigarettes I bought that day in Vancouver were Viceroys .
I ’d often noticed them in the shirt pockets of gas -station attendants and , no doubt , thought that they ’d make me appear masculine , or at least as masculine as one could look in a beret and a pair of gabardine pants that buttoned at the ankle .
Throw in Ronnie ’s white silk scarf and I needed all the Viceroy I could get , especially in the neighborhood where this residence hotel was .
It was odd .
I ’d always heard how clean Canada was , how peaceful , but perhaps people had been talking about a different part , the middle , maybe , or those rocky islands off the eastern coast .
Here it was just one creepy drunk after another .
The ones who were passed out I did n’t mind so much , but those on their way to passing out — those who could still totter and flail their arms — made me fear for my life .
Take this guy who approached me after I left the store , this guy with a long black braid .
It was n’t the gentle , ropy kind you ’d have if you played the flute but something more akin to a bullwhip : a prison braid , I told myself .
A month earlier , I might have simply cowered , but now I put a cigarette in my mouth — the way you might if you were about to be executed .
This man was going to rob me , then lash me with his braid and set me on fire — but no .
“ Give me one of those , ” he said , and he pointed to the pack I was holding .
I handed him a Viceroy , and when he thanked me I smiled and thanked him back .
It was , I later thought , as if I ’d been carrying a bouquet and he ’d asked me for a single daisy .
He loved flowers , I loved flowers , and was n’t it beautiful that our mutual appreciation could transcend our various differences , and somehow bring us together ?
I must have thought , too , that had the situation been reversed he would have been happy to give me a cigarette , though my theory was never tested .
I may have been a Boy Scout for only two years , but the motto stuck with me forever : “ Be Prepared . ”
This does not mean “ Be Prepared to Ask People for Shit ” ; it means “ Think Ahead and Plan Accordingly , Especially in Regard to Your Vices . ”
Given my reputation as a strident non-smoker , it was funny how quickly I took to cigarettes .
It was as if my life were a play , and the prop mistress had finally showed up .
Suddenly there were packs to unwrap , matches to strike , ashtrays to fill and then empty .
My hands were at one with their labor , the way a cook ’s might be , or a knitter’s .
“ Well , that ’s a hell of a reason to poison yourself , ” my father said .
My mother , however , looked at the bright side .
“ Now I ’ll know what to put in your Christmas stocking ! ”
She put them in my Easter basket as well , entire cartons .
Today , it might seem trashy to see a young man accepting a light from his mom , but a cigarette was n’t always a statement .
Back when I started , you could still smoke at work , even if you worked in a hospital where kids with no legs were hooked up to machines .
If a character smoked on a TV show , it did not necessarily mean that he was weak or evil .
It was like seeing someone who wore a striped tie or parted his hair on the left — a detail , but not a telling one .
I did n’t much notice my fellow - smokers until the mid-eighties , when we began to be cordoned off .
Now there were separate sections in waiting rooms and restaurants , and I ’d often look around and evaluate what I ’d come to think of as “ my team . ”
At first , they seemed normal enough — regular people , but with cigarettes in their hands .
Then the campaign began in earnest , and it seemed that if there were ten adults on my side of the room at least one of them was smoking through a hole in his throat .
“ Still think it ’s so cool ? ” the other side said .
But coolness , for most of us , had nothing to do with it .
It ’s popular to believe that every smoker was brainwashed , sucked in by product placement and subliminal print ads .
This argument comes in handy when you want to assign blame , but it discounts the fact that smoking is often wonderful .
For people like me , people who twitched and jerked and cried out in tiny voices , cigarettes were a godsend .
Not only that ; they tasted good , especially the first one in the morning and the seven or eight that came immediately after it .
By late afternoon , after a pack or so , I ’d generally feel a heaviness in my lungs , especially in the nineteen - eighties , when I worked with hazardous chemicals .
I should have worn a respirator , but it interfered with my smoking .
SURFING the web and making free internet phone calls on your Wi-Fi laptop , listening to your iPod on the way home , it often seems that , technologically speaking , we are enjoying a golden age .
Human inventiveness is so finely honed , and the globalised technology industries so productive , that there appears to be an invention to cater for every modern whim .
But according to a new analysis , this view could n’t be more wrong : far from being in technological nirvana , we are fast approaching a new dark age .
That , at least , is the conclusion of Jonathan Huebner , a physicist working at the Pentagon ’s Naval Air Warfare Center in China Lake , California .
He says the rate of technological innovation reached a peak a century ago and has been declining ever since .
And like the lookout on the Titanic who spotted the fateful iceberg , Huebner sees the end of innovation looming dead ahead .
His study will be published in Technological Forecasting and Social Change .
It ’s an unfashionable view .
Most futurologists say technology is developing at exponential rates .
Moore ’s law , for example , foresaw chip densities ( for which read speed and memory capacity ) doubling every 18 months .
And the chip makers have lived up to its predictions .
Building on this , the less well - known Kurzweil ’s law says that these faster , smarter chips are leading to even faster growth in the power of computers .
Developments in genome sequencing and nanoscale machinery are racing ahead too , and internet connectivity and telecommunications bandwith are growing even faster than computer power , catalysing still further waves of innovation .
But Huebner is confident of his facts .
He has long been struck by the fact that promised advances were not appearing as quickly as predicted .
“ I wondered if there was a reason for this , ” he says .
“ Perhaps there is a limit to what technology can achieve . ”

In an effort to find out , he plotted major innovations and scientific advances over time compared to world population , using the 7200 key innovations listed in a recently published book , The History of Science and Technology ( Houghton Mifflin , 2004 ) .
The results surprised him .
Rather than growing exponentially , or even keeping pace with population growth , they peaked in 1873 and have been declining ever since ( see Graphs ) .
Next , he examined the number of patents granted in the US from 1790 to the present .
When he plotted the number of US patents granted per decade divided by the country ’s population , he found the graph peaked in 1915 .
The period between 1873 and 1915 was certainly an innovative one .
For instance , it included the major patent - producing years of America ’s greatest inventor , Thomas Edison ( 1847-1931 ) .
Edison patented more than 1000 inventions , including the incandescent bulb , electricity generation and distribution grids , movie cameras and the phonograph .
Medieval future
Huebner draws some stark lessons from his analysis .
The global rate of innovation today , which is running at seven “ important technological developments ” per billion people per year , matches the rate in 1600 .
Despite far higher standards of education and massive R&D funding “ it is more difficult now for people to develop new technology ” , Huebner says .
Extrapolating Huebner ’s global innovation curve just two decades into the future , the innovation rate plummets to medieval levels .
“ We are approaching the ‘ dark ages point ’ , when the rate of innovation is the same as it was during the Dark Ages , ” Huebner says .
“ We ’ll reach that in 2024 . ”
But today ’s much larger population means that the number of innovations per year will still be far higher than in medieval times .
“ I ’m certainly not predicting that the dark ages will reoccur in 2024 , if at all , ” he says .
Nevertheless , the point at which an extrapolation of his global innovation curve hits zero suggests we have already made 85 per cent of the technologies that are economically feasible .
But why does he think this has happened ?
He likens the way technologies develop to a tree .
“ You have the trunk and major branches , covering major fields like transportation or the generation of energy , ” he says .
“ Right now we are filling out the minor branches and twigs and leaves .
The major question is , are there any major branches left to discover ?
My feeling is we ’ve discovered most of the major branches on the tree of technology . ”
But artificial intelligence expert Ray Kurzweil – who formulated the aforementioned law – thinks Huebner has got it all wrong .
“ He uses an arbitrary list of about 7000 events that have no basis as a measure of innovation .
If one uses arbitrary measures , the results will not be meaningful . ”
Eric Drexler , who dreamed up some of the key ideas underlying nanotechnology , agrees .
“ A more direct and detailed way to quantify technology history is to track various capabilities , such as speed of transport , data - channel bandwidth , cost of computation , ” he says .
“ Some have followed exponential trends , some have not . ”
Drexler says nanotechnology alone will smash the barriers Huebner foresees , never mind other branches of technology .
It ’s only a matter of time , he says , before nanoengineers will surpass what cells do , making possible atom - by - atom desktop manufacturing .
“ Although this result will require many years of research and development , no physical or economic obstacle blocks its achievement , ” he says .
“ The resulting advances seem well above the curve that Dr Huebner projects . ”
 Rather than growing exponentially , or keeping pace with population growth , innovation peaked in 1873 and has been declining ever since 
At the Acceleration Studies Foundation , a non-profit think tank in San Pedro , California , John Smart examines why technological change is progressing so fast .
Looking at the growth of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence , Smart agrees with Kurzweil that we are rocketing toward a technological “ singularity ” – a point sometime between 2040 and 2080 where change is so blindingly fast that we just ca n’t predict where it will go .
Smart also accepts Huebner ’s findings , but with a reservation .
Innovation may seem to be slowing even as its real pace accelerates , he says , because it ’s slipping from human hands and so fading from human view .
More and more , he says , progress takes place “ under the hood ” in the form of abstract computing processes .
Huebner ’s analysis misses this entirely .
Take a modern car .
“ Think of the amount of computation – design , supply chain and process automation – that went into building it , ” Smart says .
“ Computations have become so incremental and abstract that we no longer see them as innovations .
People are heading for a comfortable cocoon where the machines are doing the work and the innovating , ” he says .
“ But we ’re not measuring that very well . ”
Huebner disagrees .
“ It does n’t matter if it is humans or machines that are the source of innovation .
If it is n’t noticeable to the people who chronicle technological history then it is probably a minor event . ”
A middle path between Huebner ’s warning of an imminent end to tech progress , and Kurzweil and Smart ’s equally imminent encounter with a silicon singularity , has been staked out by Ted Modis , a Swiss physicist and futurologist .
Modis agrees with Huebner that an exponential rate of change cannot be sustained and his findings , like Huebner ’s , suggest that technological change will not increase forever .
But rather than expecting innovation to plummet , Modis foresees a long , slow decline that mirrors technology ’s climb .
At the peak
“ I see the world being presently at the peak of its rate of change and that there is ahead of us as much change as there is behind us , ” Modis says .
“ I do n’t subscribe to the continually exponential rate of growth , nor to an imminent drying up of innovation . ”
So who is right ?
The high - tech gurus who predict exponentially increasing change up to and through a blinding event horizon ?
Huebner , who foresees a looming collision with technology ’s limits ?
Or Modis , who expects a long , slow decline ?
The impasse has parallels with cosmology during much of the 20th century , when theorists debated endlessly whether the universe would keep expanding , creep toward a steady state , or collapse .
It took new and better measurements to break the log jam , leading to the surprising discovery that the rate of expansion is actually accelerating .
Perhaps it is significant that all the mutually exclusive techno - projections focus on exponential technological growth .
Innovation theorist Ilkka Tuomi at the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies in Seville , Spain , says : “ Exponential growth is very uncommon in the real world .
It usually ends when it starts to matter . ”
And it looks like it is starting to matter .
Against my better judgement I went out to see the new “ Halloween 2 ” .
Granted , I did n’t think the first one was any good , and no I have n’t enjoyed any film by Rob Zombie at this point ( even though my iPod is filled with his music ) … but I thought “ just maybe ” .
Perhaps it would n’t be as bad as I feared it would be .
After all …
G.I . Joe did n’t end up being half as bad as I thought it would be … maybe there would be something redeemable about Halloween 2 .
It ’s possible right ?
Let me make this perfectly clear and put it in the most direct way I can .
To call “ Halloween 2 ” I giant shitfest would be far too kind .
I ’ve never seen a “ horror ” movie so bland , so predictable , so boring and so ridiculous in my life .
This is the worst film I ’ve seen since “ Catwoman ” and now ranks as the 4th worst film I ’ve ever had to sit through in my life ( Just behind Battlefield Earth , Catwoman and The Highlander II ) .
THE GENERAL IDEA
It sucks so bad I do n’t want to bother .
THE GOOD
You ’re kidding right ?
Good ?!?!
There was absolutely nothing redeemable about this nuclear cluster fuck of a movie .
THE BAD
I honestly do n’t know where to start .
The fact of the matter is everything about this movie sucks on an epic scale and to point out any individual “ bad ” aspects seems redundant .
I ’m not a film critic , so I ’m not sure I ’m obligated to be forced to think about this movie any more than I already have .
I love Weird Al passionately … but dude … when his 2 minute cameo is the best thing about you ’re movie , you ’re in trouble .
Worst …. acting … ever .
I ’m sorry … was I , at any point , supposed to be scared ?
Did they write this movie on a napkin the morning production started ?
I mean … if Zombie was going for : “ Let ’s make a movie that is totally predictable … lacks any scares or suspense … sacrifices all thoughts of common sense … have the lead girl squeal and scream all her dialog and put in the most ass raping nonsensical ending ” … then yeah , mission accomplished .
I do n’t want to talk about this movie anymore .
I do n’t want to think about this movie any more .
I will never mention this movie again .
I could have spent my Saturday afternoon napping … it would have been far more productive .
I do n’t know you Rob Zombie .
We ’ve only met briefly and you seem like nice enough of a guy and you make some kick ass music … but right now I hate you a little bit .
OVERALL
As far as a “ score ” goes … well …
I ’ve never done this before , but it must be done .
Overall I give “ Halloween 2 ” a - 2 out of 10 .
Yes … a - 2 . Damn I ’m SOOO mad right now that my Saturday afternoon was so utterly wasted .
Fuck this movie .

UK Music CEO , Feargal Sharkey , commented :
" Ironically , for me , perhaps the biggest change is context .
Over the past twelve months , the licensed digital music market has diversified enormously – epitomised by competition in the download market and the traction being gained by streaming services .
Meanwhile , the prospect of commercial partnerships with ISPs lies tantalisingly on the horizon .
And , of course , the UK ’s artists and creative community continue to break new ground : innovating , experimenting and engaging with fans in all manner of new exciting and ways .
Clearly , the shape of our entire business will continue to evolve .
However , we will achieve nothing if we do not work with music fans , and young music fans in particular .
They are hugely demanding in their needs , but collectively we must rise to that challenge .
We ignore engagement at our peril .
That message is loud and clear . "

• Music remains the most valued form of entertainment .
• 87 % said that copying between devices is important to them .
• 86 % of respondents have copied a CD for a friend ; 75 % have sent music by email , Bluetooth , Skype or MSN ; 57 % have copied a friend 's entire music collection ; 39 % have downloaded music from an online storage site ; and 38 % have ripped a TV , radio or internet stream .

WASHINGTON ( CNNMoney.com ) -- President Obama is expected to nominate Ben Bernanke to a second term as head of the Federal Reserve , a senior administration official told CNN Monday night .
The source asked not to be identified because the announcement had not yet been made .
Obama is expected to make the announcement on Tuesday morning at Martha 's Vineyard , Mass . , where he is vacationing .
Bernanke , a Republican who has played a central role in the government 's extraordinary response to the recession and 2008 banking panic , will have to be confirmed by the Senate .
The question of Bernanke 's reappointment has been the focus of much speculation .
Recently many economists and insiders had said they believed that he would more than likely keep his job .
Bernanke 's term ends on Jan. 31 .
Fed chairmen serve four - year terms .
Earlier this summer , Obama praised the Fed chairman and came to his defense .
The Fed is charged with examining bank soundness , as well as checking the cost and availability of money and credit in the economy .
Given the more than $ 1 trillion the Fed has printed to get the credit markets moving , there 's a renewed focus on watching for signs of inflation .
Over the past three decades , the country has had only three Fed chairmen .
New presidents have tended to keep
Fed chiefs in place regardless of political party to maintain continuity in monetary policy and confidence in the markets .
Paul Volcker was appointed by President Carter in 1979 and retained by President Reagan .
Alan Greenspan , a 1987 Reagan appointee , served under four presidents including President Clinton .
Bernanke , 55 , was appointed to the top job in 2006 by President George W. Bush , after serving as Bush 's chair of the Council of Economic Advisers .
An expert on the Great Depression , Bernanke previously chaired the economics department at Princeton University .
He also did a three - year stint on the Fed 's board of governors ending in 2005 .
The rumors that Bernanke was headed for the chopping block started last November .
In a nationally - televised press conference , Obama announced the members of his economic team , touting their experience and accomplishments .
But he did n't mention Bernanke 's name -- a big omission , some said at the time .
But the assumption that Obama would not keep Bernanke had changed in recent months .
In a speech last week at an annual symposium in Jackson Hole , Wyo. , Bernanke said that the U.S. economy is about to start growing again , although he cautioned it will be a slow recovery with continued high unemployment in the near term .
He spent much of the speech reviewing the economic crisis that unfolded last September in the wake of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and near collapse of insurer AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) .
Bernanke defended the actions of the Fed , Treasury Department and Congress , as well as major governments around the world , in their response to the crisis .
He said those actions likely prevented the financial panic from plunging the world into a far more serious economic downturn , possibly even a depression .
Bernanke has bumped heads with some in the Senate in the past several months , and his confirmation hearing could get tense .
Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , said in a statement that he supported Bernanke 's nomination as the " right choice , " but he noted that he has had " serious differences " with the Fed under Bernanke 's tenure .
" Chairman Bernanke was too slow to act during the early stages of the foreclosure crisis , but he ultimately demonstrated effective leadership and his reappointment sends the right signal to the markets , " Dodd said in a statement .
Dodd said he expected that lawmakers would raise " many serious questions " about the Fed 's role and authority .
WASHINGTON , Aug 27 ( Reuters ) - U.S. State Department staff have recommended that the ouster of Honduran President Manuel Zelaya be declared a " military coup , " a U.S. official said on Thursday , a step that could cut off as much as $ 150 million in U.S. funding to the impoverished Central American nation .
The official , who spoke on condition he not be named , said State Department staff had made such a recommendation to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who has yet to make a decision on the matter although one was likely soon .
Washington has already suspended about $ 18 million aid to Honduras following the June 28 coup and this would be formally cut if the determination is made because of a U.S. law barring aid " to the government of any country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by military coup or decree . "
The official said that $ 215 million in grant funding from the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation to Honduras would also have to end should Clinton make the determination that a military coup took place .
About $ 76 million of that money has already been disbursed and a second U.S. official said this implied that the remaining roughly $ 139 million could not be given to Honduras should the determination be made .
Diplomats said that the United States had held off making the formal determination to give diplomacy a chance to yield a negotiated compromise that might allow for Zelaya 's return to power .
Such efforts , however , appear to have failed for now and so the United States is taking steps -- including its decision on Tuesday to cease issuing some visas at its embassy in Tegucigalpa -- to raise pressure on the de facto government .
" The recommendation of the building is for her to sign it , " said the first U.S. official said of the ' military coup " determination , saying this was a response to the de facto government 's refusal to accept a compromise that would allow Zelaya to return to power ahead of November elections .
( Editing by Jackie Frank )
Former Vice President Dick Cheney on Sunday called the Justice Department ’s decision to investigate whether CIA interrogators abused terrorism suspects after the Sept. 11 attacks “ an outrageous political act ” that “ offends the hell out of me . ”
“ It ’s clearly a political move ; I mean , there ’s no other rationale for why they ’re doing this , ” Mr. Cheney said on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
He said the investigation “ will do great damage , long term , to our capacity to be able to have people take on difficult jobs , make difficult decisions , without having to worry about what the next administration is going to say . ”

• White House : Cheney wrong on interrogations policy
Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. last week appointed John Durham as a special counsel to reconsider pursuing criminal charges against CIA employees who interrogated some of al Qaeda ’s hardest core members .
The Justice Department previously had declined to prosecute under President George W. Bush .
The attorney general made the decision over the opposition of CIA Director Leon E. Panetta and despite the often stated wishes of President Obama to “ look forward ” and not become entangled in a debate over the past practices of the war on terror .
In comments echoed by two Republican senators , Mr. Cheney said that reopening the case is unnecessary because the Justice Department already had reviewed the inspector general ’s report five years ago .
He added that it could sets an “ outrageous [ legal ] precedent . ”
“ The approach of the Obama administration should be to come to those people who were involved in [ interrogation ] policy and say , ‘ How did you do it ?
What were the keys to keeping this country safe over that period of time ? ’ ” Mr. Cheney said .
“ Instead , they ’re out there now threatening to disbar the lawyers who gave us the legal opinions . ”
The White House did not return a request for comment .
The Justice Department , when asked for comment , referred to Mr. Holder ’s statement last week announcing the inquiries .
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch , a Republican member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , said that while there was a “ real question whether [ CIA interrogators ] went outside of the bounds they were given at the time , ” he agreed that the issue already has received sufficient scrutiny .
“ I really question whether the attorney general is doing what is right , ” the Utah lawmaker said on ABC ’s “ This Week . ”
“ What they ’re doing is crippling the CIA where they ’re going to be unwilling to really take the risks that have to be taken during really crucial times . ”
Sen .
John McCain , Arizona Republican and an outspoken opponent of prisoner torture , agreed that the investigation was a mistake .
“ I believe the president was right when he said we should look forward , not back , ” Mr. McCain said on CBS ’ “ Face the Nation . ” “ I worry about the morale and effectiveness of the CIA .
I worry about this thing getting out of control . ”
Mr. McCain added , however , that he believes that the purported torture by the CIA was wrong because it violated the Geneva Conventions and was used as a recruiting tool by al Qaeda .
Sen .
Dianne Feinstein , the Senate intelligence committee chairman who said she was “ horrified ” with revelations that CIA operators may have abused prisons during interrogations , nonetheless criticized Mr. Holder for calling for an investigation before her panel could finish its own investigation of the matter .
“ The timing is not very good , ” the California Democrat said on “ Face the Nation . ”
“ We are not going to be deterred from completing this study .
And candidly , I wish that the attorney general had waited . ”
But other Democrats quickly came to the administration ’s defense .
“ This is not a political process - this is a legal process , ” said Sen.
Maria Cantwell , Washington Democrat , said on CNN ’s “ State of the Union . ”
“ If we want to be effective in the war on terrorism , we have to communicate to everyone that we are going to follow the law . ”
Sen . John Kerry , Massachusetts Democrat , speaking on “ This Week , ” dismissed Mr. Cheney ’s comments because he “ has shown through the years , frankly , a disrespect for the Constitution , for sharing of information with Congress , respect for the law . ”
Mr. Kerry said that Mr. Obama has been extremely careful in ensuring that national security has n’t been compromised and that the president is “ very sensitive about the CIA ’s prerogatives and needs . ”
The senator added that “ a little bit of a tension ” exists between the White House and the Justice Department on how they see the law .

* I ’ve stopped counting , so that number is made up .
[ digg- reddit - me ]
We ’ve all heard this claim – that Obama ’s health care reform – specifically the public option – is really a stealth attempt to socialize America and have the government take over a significant portion of our economy .
This claim is n’t true .
However , unlike the fearmongering that is the invocation of “ death panels , ” there is a bit more substance to this accusation .
But like so much of this debate , it has little to do with the bills currently under consideration which have rather weak public options .
What this claim is based on are the hopes of progressives that the public option could prove to the country how great and effective government health care is and thus lead to a single - payer , Medicare For All type system .
According to Mark Schmitt of The American Prospect , the public option was latched onto by progressives early on as a potential “ stealth ” tool to gradually move America into a Medicare - for - all type system – as they assumed that given the choice , most citizens would prefer government - run health care .
As Ezra Klein summarized Schmitt ’s piece :
The reason the idea managed to catch the liberal establishment ’s imagination was that it was sold as a way of achieving single - payer , or something close to it , within the current constraints of the political system .
Those on the right wing saw the fervor that accompanied discussions of the public option and soon identified it as a potential target .
But the public option was n’t designed to work as a stealth tool .
Its main designer and earliest promoter , Jacob Hacker saw his policy “ as an alternative to single payer ” and “ as a competitive alternative to private insurance ” – in other words , as a way to maintain some of the advantages of the system a large number of Americans currently have while offering a different model of competition to keep insurance companies honest .
The initial design of the public option – which remains intact today – would create a self - sustaining , non-profit agency that competes with private plans on a Health Insurance Exchange .
Perhaps the best explanation of why this would work comes from Michael F. Cannon of the Cato Institute who – while trying to attack the possibility of a public option – made this observation :
Any payment system creates perverse incentives … which is why we need competition between different payment systems to temper the excesses of each .
So if Kaiser Permanente is skimping on care , which is the perverse incentive its payment system creates , there are fee - for - service insurers on a level playing field that can lure patients away from Kaiser .
That tempers the rate at which Kaiser succumbs to those perverse incentives …
This understanding of how markets work – and how a competing payment system could improve health care for all – is exactly the reason so many people were in favor of a choice between a public option and private ones before the current fear - mongering campaign .
Hacker ’s policy is what President Obama has decided he wants in a public option , as he explained Time ‘s Karen Tumulty :
It should n’t be something that ’s simply a taxpayer - subsidized system that was n’t accountable , but rather had to be self - sustaining through premiums and that had to compete with private insurers .
Tumulty later described Obama ’s position on the public option :
Obama has never presented the public option as anything other than a means to an end — one that he would be perfectly willing to achieve through other avenues if necessary .
His goal is twofold : to provide a low - cost alternative to the private system that already exists and to assure competition in a health - care market where it is generally lacking .
Further demonstrating that the goal of Obama ’s health care reform is not to stealthily push America into a Medicare For All program , he has signalled he would be willing to accept a co-op in place of the public option .
However , while Republicans had promoted the idea of co-ops as an alternative to the public option , they now are quickly moving away from this position .
Ezra Klein explains :
This is a dynamic we saw in 1994 .
A compromise is offered , and after great anguish and infighting , Democrats grudgingly move toward it .
Then the compromise is yanked away .
The famous example of this is Bob Dole voting against two bills that had the name “ Dole ” in the title .
Someone here is acting in bad faith and has a secret agenda .
It does n’t seem to be the Democrats .
Conclusion :
The public option could become a stealth path to single - payer .
Just like Medicare could .
Or Medicaid .
Or S - Chip .
Or any other legislation that has ever dealt with the serious problems in our market for health insurance .
But what we ’re seeing now is n’t a stealth option – as much as both progressives and right wingers may want to pretend it is .
If our nation is moving towards a single - payer Medicare - for - all - system , this legislation is n’t what will get us there .
That fight will come later .
And for what it ’s worth : the public option is n’t the most important part of health care reform .
The Health Insurance Exchange ( on which the co-op or public option would sit along with private companies ) is more important – as are the various reforms of the health insurance industry .

Stocks Rally After Jobs Report Announces First Drop in Unemployment Rate This Year Jobs report announces first drop in unemployment rate this year .
Aug. 7 , 2009  --
Stocks once again rallied today as investors were pleased with a much better - than - expected jobs report .
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 113 points to close at 9,370 , closing off another straight up week on Wall Street .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 , the broadest index of the nation 's corporate economy , rose 1.3 percent to close at 1,010 , a 10 - month high .
The Nasdaq rose 1.37 percent today to close at 2,000 .
With the pop Friday , the S&P 500 index is up 14.9 percent in only four weeks and 49.4 percent from a 12 - year low in early March .
The American economy has shed 6.7 million jobs since the start of the recession , but workers got a bit of good news this morning : the unemployment rate dipped for the first time in more than a year .
It now stands at 9.4 percent , down from 9.5 percent .
The U.S. Department of Labor reported this morning that employers still cut payrolls in July , but the total job losses were far lower than expected : 247,000 .
" The worst may be behind us , " President Barack Obama said outside the White House today .
The slowing rate of job losses is leaving economists to believe that the economy is well on its way to recovery .
From May to July job losses averaged 331,000 a month , down significantly from the 645,000 a month lost from November to April .
" Today , we 're pointed in the right direction , " Obama said .
Despite the better - than - expected jobs report , Obama added that there is still a " steep mountain to climb " towards economic recovery .
" We have a lot further to go , " he said .
" As far as I 'm concerned , we will not have a true recovery until we stop losing jobs . "
Nonetheless , with 14.5 million of Americans still contending with unemployment , the heartache continues .
For Clint White of Port Orange , Fla. , losing his job as a pilot with a flight instruction company meant living a more frugal lifestyle .
Laid off twice in the past 12 months , most recently in February , White has turned to clipping coupons , eating at home and even cancelling the wedding ceremony that he and his wife never had to help make ends meet .
And , soon , the couple may also have to turn to food stamps .
" We 've had to cut back on everything , " said White , 40 .
" I went from making a six - figure income to zero literally overnight . "
White 's wife , a biologist by training , found a part - time job working at a local deli .
The childless couple has been living off of savings to supplement his unemployment benefits .
But those savings are quickly dwindling and the couple will soon cash out their 401 ( k ) to help pay for the mortgage , he said .
White may soon join the more than 34 million people already receiving food stamps .
Since the recession hit in December 2007 , that number has been growing .
In May , a record 34.4 million people were enrolled in the food stamp program , signifying a six consecutive month increase , according to the most recent available statistics .
Overall , the country experienced a 2 percent increase in the program 's enrollment from April to May -- approximately one in nine Americans now receive food stamps .
The number of people receiving food stamps jumped the most in White 's home state of Florida , with a 4.2 percent increase from April to May .
But , for some struggling households , getting food stamps is n't an option .
Many families make too much to be eligible for the program but , in reality , some of them are barely getting by .
Difficult Job Search and Government Financial Assistance
When Brian and Theresa Quick of Virginia Beach , Va. , went to the local social services office recently to apply for the program , they were told that with her $ 1,500 monthly income from a part - time job as a bookkeeper and his unemployment check , they made too much .
" I can tell you right now that the people coming in and out of there in the four hours I 've been there , they drive better cars than me but they can buy food with food stamps , " said Brian Quick , who was laid off from his job as a warehouse manager in November .
Social services , instead , directed them to a local church , where they received a free bag of groceries .
Aside from that , the family has not qualified for other government assistance , meaning further sacrifices for the couple and their two young daughters .
" They kind of understand , " Quick , 50 , who now works part - time as a security officer , said of his children , who are 5 and 6 .
" They say that if we need money , we can take it out of their piggy banks . "
The family 's car was almost repossessed and Theresa Quick , 43 , has twice pawned her wedding ring -- the second time , the couple could n't come up with the money to get it back .
The Quicks are far from alone .
Financial setbacks have also had tangible effects on Joy O'Campo 's day - to - day life .
O'Campo , 34 , worked in human resources for 10 years before she was laid off from her last job in March 2008 .
Although she has found a job as a benefits administration analyst at a temporary agency , which offers no benefits or vacation days , her home state of California says her income 's too high to qualify for food stamps , state sponsored health care and other assistance programs .
" Where 's the help for people stuck in the middle ? " said O'Campo , who took a $ 20,000 pay cut and moved to a less expensive apartment .
" I 'm not a homeowner but I 'm not so poor that I qualify for existing government help . "
O'Campo , who lives in Irvine , Calif. , and has a master 's degree in public administration , is even considering filing for bankruptcy because she is unable to pay back the credit card debt she accrued while unemployed .
" Being out of work for nine months , I used my credit cards quite a lot , " she said .
" Who can live on unemployment in Orange County ? "
Unemployed High in Debt and Cut Spending
Hard times have limited O'Campo to a $ 40 to $ 45 weekly grocery budget that is half of what she was used to spend .
She said she 's lucky to have generous friends who paid for her medical insurance for nine months , but O'Campo has since dropped out of the federal COBRA program that gives some employees the ability to continue health insurance coverage after leaving employment .
Gas costs keep her from going out with friends and volunteering with the Big Brothers - Big Sisters program .
The hardest part for her was cutting back on martial arts training , which she said kept her emotionally and physically healthy .
She said she 's looking " everywhere , everyday " for a steady job .
" I 've done a lot of recruiting being in HR , I know that people look at my skill set and education and they know I 'm going to expect a lot of money , a permanent job and benefits , but once the economy turns around , I 'd want to find something better , " she said .
" That is my goal and that 's what I would be thinking , too , if I saw my resume .
It 's like a Catch - 22 . "
There are , however , signs that the economy may be in recovery :
The stock market has been climbing since March 's market lows , the gross domestic product decreased at only a 1 percent pace in the second quarter and home sales rose for the fifth straight month in June .
But for families still reeling from the setbacks of job loss , the country 's longest recession since the Great Depression has had long - term effects .
White , the out - of - work pilot who has been actively networking and searching for a job in aviation or sales , said he stays positive but also grounded in reality .
" The recession does n't end for us until we 're working , " he said .

Ministry halts controversial electrotherapy program for Internet addicts
( chinadaily.com.cn )
Updated : 2009-07-14 14:05
The Ministry of Health has ordered a halt to a controversial electroshock treatment intended to help treat Internet addiction in teenagers , the Beijing News reported on Tuesday .
The Ministry said the therapy , which was administered by a clinic in Linyi , Shandong province , has not been proven to be safe .
Kong Lingzhong , editor of a domestic Internet addiction - themed portal told the Beijing News that there was still fierce debate over whether electroshock therapy was appropriate for young internet addicts .
“ We have no clue whether this freaky treatment has side - effects , ” Kong said .
Yang Shuyun from the clinic in Shandong told the media yesterday afternoon that they stopped giving the treatment as soon as they received the Health Ministry ’s notification .
Bowing to the pressure though , she also emphasized that the program led by Dr. Yang Yongxin was not exclusively about electrotherapy , and said it had important medical and psychological elements too .
The China Daily reported last month that more than 3,000 young people were tricked or forced into in to the four - month long course .
To enroll their children , parents or guardians had to sign a contract acknowledging that they would be given electric shocks of up to 200 milliamperes .
The treatment cost 6,000 yuan ( $ 878 ) per month .
Patients were considered “ cured ” or “ reborn ” once they admitted to their addiction .
According to the Guangdong - based Information Times , shocks were given if patients broke any of the center ’s 86 rules , which included prohibitions on eating chocolate , locking the bathroom door , taking pills before a meal , and sitting in Dr. Yang 's chair without permission .
Details of the treatment first became public when former patients wrote about their experiences online .
In addition to the electric shocks , they claimed that they were not allowed to talk about anything other than overcoming their Internet addiction , ordered to kneel in front of their parents to show obedience , and forced to confess to “ wrongdoing . ”
Internet addiction is a growing problem in China , which now has nearly 300 million Internet users , including many adolescents who spend several hours each day playing computer games .
I ’m a little late to the party on this but Fox News ’ Shepard Smith speaks some remarkable truth to power in this segment :
Some excerpts via Steve Benen :
“ I read a lot of email around here , ” Smith said .
“ And the email to me has become more and more frightening .
It ’s not a new thing ; it ’s been happening over the past few months .
It ’s been happening , you know , to some degree , since the election process went along . ”
He added , “ There are people now , who are way out there on a limb .
And I think they ’re just out there on a limb with the email they send us .
Because I read it , and they are out there .
I mean , out there in a scary place ….
I could read a hundred of them like this ….
I mean from today .
People who are so amped up and so angry for reasons that are absolutely wrong , ridiculous , preposterous . ”
Here ’s how Steve reacted :
Life is a sliding scale of good , bad , and a whole lot of grey in between .
If you think you ’re in the bad , just take a look around and you may just realize things are n’t as bad as they can be .
One such example is found within the disturbing world of eating disorders .
Sure , anorexia and bulimia are terrible sicknesses , but at least you do n’t have one of these …
Geophagy
Pregnant women the world over are prone to strange food cravings at all hours of the day .
If you ’re a father , then you were probably the one that had to go on a 3 A.M. Expedition for dill pickles and Little Debbie snack cakes .
It may have seemed like a bit of a chore , but you did it with a smile because you knew it was just a part of the magical miracle that is child birth .
You also sport a smile because at least your significant other is n’t asking you to scrounge her up a bowl of dirt to snack on .
In some parts of Africa and rural portions of the United States , pregnant women have been known to chow down on some clay to alleviate the nausea associated with pregnancy .
Of course , one can argue that this strange practice is only limited to pregnant women , but one would be dead wrong .
If you ever visit Haiti , just go ahead and avoid anything and everything related to cookies and pancakes as they maybe what is called a bon bon de terres , or bon bon of the earth .
Sure , it may still have some sugar , some shortening , and a pinch of salt to bring out all of the flavors … but one of those flavors is also dirt .
These cookies have been linked to many health problems such as being dead , a major health problem for those that like being alive .
Urophagia
Have you ever hit the toilet to expel some fluids and thought , “ What a damn waste ?!
There are kids in foreign countries that would kill for such hydration ! ”
If you are one of these people , first of all , ew ; secondly , you ’re not alone … sadly .
Urophagia is , simply put , the consumption of urine .
Sure , there are some that do it to get their sexual rocks off , but there are others that do it just because , you know , it ’s tasty .
There are some slight misconceptions about the act , though .
Yes , urine can be sterile , but only if there are no infections in the …uh …source .
Also , the first bit of expelled urine may carry with it some non-infection related urethral bacteria , but , leave it to those crafty pee drinkers out there to find a way around that problem .
Rather than enjoy every last drop , they ’ll enjoy the mid-stream .
In other words , they let the faucet run for a few seconds before they fill the cup .
Mid -stream is also a phrase you may hear when you take a urine test as the bacteria may contaminate the sample .
Hyalophagia
Some people are not scatological in their eating habits .
There are others that are handed a glass of freshly squeezed urine , only to inconspicuously dump it in to a nearby plant when no other party - goer is looking so they can chew on the glass … because this is a party filled with totally normal people .
Glass eating is a common sideshow attraction that one must be properly trained to do .
There is a very particular way to chew and swallow the glass as to prevent your insides from spilling out ; along with a very particular eating regimen one must follow designed to move the glass out of the system .
We could n’t find any of these glass eating tips and tricks online , which is probably a good thing in the long run .
Of course , this is an extremely dangerous thing to attempt , so you probably should n’t try it unless you were raised by circus folk .
If that ’s the case , then be sure to wash it down with some fire and knives .
If you want to see a professional Hyalophgia - ist in action , just watch this video of Todd Robbins .
He is a trained glass eater that will shock and amaze you ( mostly with lame vaudevillian jokes ) .

Trichophagia
Guys are a sucker for a girl doing cute things .
All guys have seen that one girl that playfully chews on her hair as she listens in on every word you stumble over because you ca n’t believe she ’s actually talking to you .
When you go home you write about how one day , one day soon , the ultra-cute hair chewer will be yours .
You will be married .
But , if you do marry her , you ’d better hope you have some truly awesome medical insurance because that cute little nervous tick she had , the hair chewing one ?
The one that suckered you in ?
Yeah , well that ’s a 10 pound hairball in her stomach now .
Congratulations !
You married in to Trichophagia !
You won at life !
The extraordinarily gross picture above is an actual 10 pound hairball that was surgically removed from an 18 - year - old Trichophagia patient ( Trichophagiac ? ) in 2007 .
The girl had a nasty habit of chewing on her hair much in the same way you might chew on your finger nails .
It was just a little habit that she never really thought much of .
Then , she had a swollen abdomen , she was vomiting and she lost 40 pounds over the course of about 5 months .
A couple of scans later , the doctors decided to go in there and check out what was wrong .
What they found was the picture above .
Well , they did n’t find the picture inside of her , they found what ’s in the picture , and then they took a picture of it … which is the one above .
Sometimes the dream girl can have some nightmarish qualities .

Autosarcophagy
Have you ever eaten human flesh ?
Well , then you ’re a cannibal ; but you know that already .
Do you eat your own flesh and / or drink your own blood ?
Then autosarcophagy is what you ’re in to .
See ?
There ’s a fancy science name for all of your twisted deeds .
If people eating themselves was n’t weird enough , here ’s an added sprinkling of creepiness about Autosarcophagy that just might hit home :
You may already be a member of the club .
Something as simple as chewing on your finger nails or chewing on the skin around your finger is a classified form of Autosarcophagy .
There are others , of course , that take it to an extreme and do n’t eat themselves as a nervous habit .
A good example of such a person can be found in Serbia .
A group of Serbian factory workers went on a 19 - day hunger strike in protest of their managements ’ refusal to pay them .
The workers had not received a hard earned check in literal years .
Cut to , a year later , the same factory workers conducted yet another protest for the very same reason ; they had yet to receive a single check … still .
So , they must have figured that if the hunger strike thing did n’t work out as well as they wanted it to , then perhaps they will take it in the opposite ( read : Totally insane ) direction .
One of the workers , a man named Zoran Bulatovic , had this to say :
" We , the workers , have nothing to eat .
We had to seek some sort of alternative food and I gave them an example . ”
What was Zoran ’s example ?
He sawed his pinky finger off and ate it .
" It hurt like hell , " he went on to say .
Sometimes an eating disorder can make you kind of badass .
Mostly crazy , but still , a little badass .

Coprophagia
Poop .
Someone with Coprophagia is someone that eats poop .
There really is n’t a smooth way to transition in to that .
Again , there ’s a fancy science -y name for everything , even for people that eat poop on a nearly professional level .
There are not too many folks on earth that would be able to have “ Eating Poop ” on the Likes and Dislikes sections of their eHarmony profiles .
Most of the non-porn related cases that have been documented by science people usually involve depression , schizophrenia , and dementia .
Of course , there are many dangers to eating poop for sustenance , but we ’re not going to tell you what they are because , well , it ’s poop .
You should n’t need to know the specific dangers of eating poop , you should just know that it is poop .
If that fact alone is n’t enough to sway you then nothing will .
Analog and Digital TV ( DVB-T ) Signal Generation
News
What is it ?
DVB -T emitters are usually very expensive professional devices .
Now with a standard PC you can broadcast real DVB- T channels !
Examples to transmit PAL or SECAM analog signals directly to your TV are also presented .
What do you need ?
A good knowledge of X Window and Linux and basic knowledge in electronics .
A DVB- T set - top box able to receive VHF signals with a bandwidth of 8 MHz ( unfortunately most decoders sold in UK only receive UHF signals ) .
You can use French DVB - T receivers which accept VHF and UHF RF signals .
A PC with a recent VGA card able to display in resolutions up to 4096x2048 with 8 bit per pixel with a pixel clock of exactly 76.5 MHz .
ATI Radeon 9200SE are reported to work ( their PLL can generate every frequency which is a multiple of 2.25 MHz up to 400 MHz ) .
Other VGA cards may work too .
If your card cannot generate a 76.5 MHz pixel clock , I can provide alternate images to do some testing .
A cable connecting the VGA output to the set - top box RF input .
It is possible to use antennas , but since the transmit power is very low , it is better to begin with a cable connection .
15 pin VGA connector 9.5 mm RF

Launch an X server using this configuration ( we assume the display :0 is your already running X11 display ) : X :1 - ac - screen ScreenDAC
Your monitor will of course not be able to display anything because the timings are far from correct VESA timings .
Unless you are using a very old monitor , there is no chance you can destroy it ...
Wait a few seconds and switch back to the starting X11 display ( in most Linux distributions Ctrl - F7 does it ) .
Then look at the X11 log file to see if everything was OK ( usually in / var / log / XFree86.1.log or /var/log/Xorg.1.log ) .
Your monitor will of course not be able to display anything because the timings are far from correct VESA timings .
Unless you are using a very old monitor , there is no chance you can destroy it ...
Download the following gray level image : dvbt.pgm.gz and decompress it .
Display it on the :1 X11 display : display - display :1 - window root dvbt.pgm
Switch to the :1 display ( usually with Ctrl - F8 or Ctrl - F9 , your monitor will blank ) and connect the set - top box RF input to the VGA output using the cable you made .
Configure your DVB - T set - top box to do a manual scan on channel 5 ( 178.75 MHz central frequency ) .
After a few seconds , it should find a valid DVB- T signal ( parameters : QAM 16 , fft=2 K , guard=1/32 , conv=2/3 ) .
Two new channels should appear : Lena Picture and Balears Picture .
Each one should display a nice still picture .
You can also try the PAL ( pal.pgm.gz ) or SECAM ( secam.pgm.gz ) analog signals .
You need to connect the VGA cable directly to your TV RF input and to use the dac1 X11 mode instead of dac2 ( edit the X11 configuration file ) : ... SubSection " Display " Depth 8 Modes " dac1 " EndSubSection ...
Then by tuning your TV on the VHF channel 5 ( 176.00 MHz image frequency ) you should see a black and white Lena picture .
How does it work ?
As we did not want to generate a 176 MHz signal directly , we use the fact that the VGA DACs generate a lot of harmonics .
The real generated DVB-T signal has a central frequency of 25.71 MHz .
Then the second harmonic has a frequency of 25.71+2*76.5 = 178.71
MHz which is almost exactly the central frequency of the VHF TV channel 5 .
The DVB-T signal is generated with a DVB-T and DVB - H modulator I wrote from scratch .
This is the most complicated step because the DVB- T modulation is quite complicated ( COFDM modulation ) .
A custom polyphase filter is used to interpolate the baseband COFDM complex signal .
Then it is translated to the 25.71 MHz frequency .
I used a patched version of FFmpeg to generate a custom DVB Transport Stream containing two DVB services .
Each one contains a still MPEG picture .
One of the still picture is the very nice Lena .
For PAL and SECAM , I also wrote a simple TV black and white PAL encoder .
Adding color would be possible , but I am not motivated enough to do it :-)

The most foolish description of youth is that it is rebellious .
The young do wear T - shirts that say Rebel or Che or Bitch .
But the truth is that the youth , especially in this country , is a fellowship of cowards .
It lives in fear .
Fear of life , fear of an illusory future .
The perpetual trauma of the forward castes is inextricably woven into this fear .
And what Arjun Singh 's successful reservation campaign has denied them is the right to a secured but ordinary life , a life that comes with scoring 98 percent in the board exams , a life that goes like this : Engineer - MBA - anonymous .
You can argue that this route is better than sociology - salesman - anonymous .
But that will be to focus unduly on the ordinary among the cowards .
The real tragedy concerns the extraordinary cowards .
Great writers , painters , musicians and athletes who are lost forever to what are moronically called , ' the professional courses ' .
Instead of pursuing their talents they are , right now , in dark gloomy tutorials preparing for entrance exams , fatally infected by objective type questions .
The angle between tangents drawn from the point ( 1,4 ) to the parabola y ^2=4 x is ?
The angst of the types who score over 95 percent also fills me , and several lakhs like me , with wicked joy .
I was the 75 percent type .
It was not pleasurable to be so in Madras of the eighties .
I grew up in Kodambakkam where Telugu film directors , who wore white shoes , kept their beautiful mistresses ; and Anglo Indian girls in skirts , who did not have hair on their legs , and all of whom I now remember only as Maria , walked to Fatima Church .
But a large part of my formative years were spent in a Brahmin housing society called Rajaram Colony where fathers were all clerks and mothers were housewives .
Rare working women had the same aura as divorcees .
I was special because I was a Christian , and the transitory relatives of my neighbours , when they learnt my religion , would speak to me in English .
Many of my friends were periodically thrashed with belts by their fathers when the miasmic green report cards came home .
Once , I heard the cries of a boy who had scored just ninety percent in a maths monthly test .
Another form of punishment was heating a stainless steel serving spoon and inflicting minor burns .
It was called , ' soodu ' .
My parents never hit me for my marks though my report cards were inspiring .
My mother beat me up occasionally for political reasons ��� every time her mother - in - law came visiting .
Apparently , according to a rustic Malayalee way of life , thrashing the kids was a hint to the in - law that it was time to leave .
Those days , the legends of Rajaram Colony were our seniors who had entered the IITs , or as a consequence , had gone to America to study further .
Their names were taken with reverence .
When they visited home , they left a trail of whispers .
And when they deigned to play cricket with us , we observed closely how they bowled and how they batted .
Because they knew everything .
It was already decided in every household , except mine , that the boys will go to IIT , a certainty just like their sisters will do BSc Nutrition .
And so my friends began their furtive preparation when they were not yet thirteen .
They began to score higher and higher at school .
And they began to look at me as an unfortunate freak , not only because they thought they were brighter but also because I said I wanted to become a journalist .
They scored better than me in English too .
( Once in an English test , when asked the opposite gender of ram , almost every one in my class , astonishingly , knew the answer was ewe .
I wrote , ' Sita ' ) .
I did always claim a higher creative status and often entertained the backbenchers , who were chiefly sons of illiterate parents , by calling my Brahmins friends , " curd - rice muggers " .
In the school I had slowly gained a reputation as a poet and some sort of a stand - up comedian .
But as I approached the 12th standard , I was not the hero anymore of the juniors .
That honour drifted to a brilliant boy , the first ranker who once used to play the tabla and did not touch the instrument anymore because he was preparing for IIT 's Joint Entrance Exam .
( A few years later , I would meet him on the campus of IIT Chennai .
He would tell me that he will not go to America .
" Because , you see , with transcendental meditation , you can sit here in Madras and visit any country in the world " .
He was serious .
Now , he is a banker in San Francisco ) .
Meanwhile , in the Rajaram Colony , I observed that older Brahmin boys who had , somehow , fared poorly in the 12th standard and had to suffer the humiliation of pursuing BSc walked in the perpetual mist of guilt and embarrassment .
They took to smoking and drinking , and ' sighting ' ��� the disreputable art of looking at girls .
They stared at a future in Eureka Forbes .
I eventually moved out of the Colony to another such fiendish place but kept in touch with my childhood friends .
The distance between us , however , grew .
They did not really want to see me .
I was a distraction in their preparation " for life " .
There was nothing they could talk to me about , nothing they could share , like their latest JEE sample test scores or the traits of the teachers at Brilliant Tutorials .
On my part , I began to find them unhappy and bleak .
Once , they were fresh and eager .
Like me , they wanted to play cricket for India .
Some were interested in music , some even attempted novels .
Now , they were zombies in the trance of a whole material world that was just one entrance exam away .
Eventually , almost all of them scored in the high nineties in the 12th standard exams .
One made it to the IIT .
The others prepared to go to second rung engineering colleges in humid melancholic towns .
But they still thought they were more victorious than me because I had got 75 % , a misfortune that their parents could not believe would visit someone who had two hands and one head .
Worse , I told them that I was going to do a BA in English Literature .
At that time , people did not think you were gay because you wanted to do literature .
But they still did not understand why a male would do such a thing .
They asked me if I was alright , if I could reconsider , if some maternal ornaments could be sold for the good cause of capitation fee .
Some days , I think of those boys from another time .
They are mostly bankers in America now and , I imagine , partly responsible for the subprime crisis .
They are in the glow of the life that they had so dearly sought .
But somehow I feel that their sisters , who eventually pursued what they wanted to , have more interesting lives .
Also , occasionally I hear that some IITian or the other is returning to the art that he had originally loved .
And is making up for the time he has lost because he could crack the toughest questions in the world but could not answer in time the class teacher 's annual question , " What do you want to become in life ? "

Why Maury Island Matters Inside the Fight over a Vulnerable Part of Puget Sound
Puget Sound is kind of fucked .
Among its many problems : Fish in Hood Canal are n't getting the oxygen they need , invasive sea squirts ( tube - shaped invertebrates ) are crowding out important shell fisheries , and a food chain messed up by pollution and shoreline development means animals are struggling to eat .
Which is why a light - sensitive plant called eelgrass is so important .
Eelgrass is one of the few plants in Puget Sound with a life span long enough to really settle in and act as a sustainable source of shade , shelter , and nutrients for low - on - the - food - chain sea creatures .
Then when it dies , it feeds bugs and crabs .
Eelgrass is like nonstop life support , and protecting existing beds of it is crucial .
A lot of it grows in Puget Sound 's shallow northern bays , and the rest is scattered in nearshore zones just below steep bluffs like the Maury Island Aquatic Reserve , one of just four areas in Puget Sound specifically designated for protection because of the high number of endangered species that live and eat in the area .
In 1998 , local mining company Glacier Northwest ( a subsidiary of Japanese giant Taiheiyo Cement ) first applied to turn a dilapidated dock into a high - tech dock directly below its gravel mine on Maury Island , setting off a 10 - year run of environmental - impact studies by government agencies , permit applications and mitigation plans by Glacier , and lawsuits from local environmentalists .
Meanwhile , between 1998 and 2008 , local environmental groups and the Washington State Department of Natural Resources ( DNR ) were learning more and more about the types of environmental parameters that sustain eelgrass habitat .
The proposed Glacier dock — shaped like a T and designed to transfer gravel to boats in a large conveyor tube — would significantly alter the sensitive nearshore habitat with construction noise , interrupted sediment drifting patterns along the beach , and ground contamination from the unloading process .
But most importantly , the shade cast by the physical structure of the dock and conveyor tube would surely kill off the eelgrass .
Doing so would be in violation of the Endangered Species Act ( ESA ) because of the way it would hurt chinook salmon , orcas , and other species that develop and feed in those eelgrass beds .
But a study done by the Army Corps of Engineers and completed in the summer of 2008 gave the project its final permit in the face of disagreement from environmental interests , and Glacier got permission to build the dock anyway .
The permission came on December 2 , 2008 , when outgoing public lands commissioner Doug Sutherland — clearly stung after a narrow loss to Democrat Peter Goldmark in last year 's election — granted Glacier , who had contributed $ 50,000 toward his reelection bid , a 30 - year lease to work in the protected Maury Island reserve in one of his final moves before leaving office .
( " I looked at the data we asked for , I looked at the information that was provided , and it appeared to me there was no scientific reason not to proceed , " Sutherland told the Seattle Post - Intelligencer .
As for the $ 50,000 , he said , " I know nothing about the independent expenditure ...
That was not part of my campaign . " )
So a number of environmental groups led by a Maury Island operation called Preserve Our Islands submitted a lawsuit in federal court seeking to halt construction on the dock .
They had the support of the Goldmark administration , which doubted the legitimacy of Sutherland 's decision to grant the lease ( which Glacier only pays $ 1,500 a year for ) because they said that new science provided compelling reasons to doubt the Army Corps of Engineers permit .
To their great relief , U.S. District Court Judge Ricardo Martinez ruled on August 13 in favor of the salmon and the orcas , saying the Corps ' permit was no longer valid .
Without valid environmental permits , leases in aquatic reserves lose their standing .
" The ESA is a really blunt tool when it comes to protecting salmon and orcas , " Mike Sato , communications director for fellow plaintiff People for Puget Sound , told The Stranger .
" But it is a tool that can stop some really bad stuff from happening .
And in this case , I think it did . "
But it is n't a done deal .
There is still a chance that two major federal agencies ( the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Corps ) will find it worthwhile to reevaluate their permits based on the latest information .
However , given the stress that our current economic situation has placed on many government agencies ' discretionary spending , that is somewhat unlikely .
Even if they do reevaluate the permit , the Corps could find that the project is too harmful to the chinook and the orcas .
That would once again spell doom for the Glacier dock .
Bridget Moran , deputy supervisor for aquatics and agency resources with the DNR , describes this instance of halting the construction as a way to help mitigate against the " death by a thousand cuts " ailment that is slowly killing Puget Sound one habitat at a time .
" Each one does n't seem like it has a big impact , " she said of the Maury Island issue .
" This ruling tells us to look more broadly at the bigger pictures . "
Puget Sound is still fucked — but a little less so today than it was a week ago .
" We did n't move forward on protecting Puget Sound , " Sato said .
" But we sure did n't make it worse . "
Over a decade since Dr Andrew Wakefield raised unfounded fears about the safety of the MMR vaccination , it emerges that many British parents are still denying their children the combined jab against measles , mumps and rubella .
A suspicion evidently remains that , as Wakefield baselessly informed a generation of terrified parents , the jab may somehow be an " environmental trigger " for autism .
Although subsequent studies have repeatedly confirmed that there is no more evidence for such a connection than there is , say , between toad contact and warts , agonised , emoticon - strewn discussions about the jab are a regular theme on mummy websites that did not exist in 1998 , when Wakefield struck .
Today , an absence of corroboration for Wakefield 's study only leaves room for other doubts and rumours .
Some mothers maintain that a " cocktail " of agents is too much for " a little body " to cope with or reassure one another that measles is not all that big a deal .
Defiant mummies , whom one pictures at the helm of their 4x4s , trailing clouds of particulates and rubella , declare that they do n't care what anyone thinks about their lifestyle choice .
It 's not their fault if their unvaccinated children should chance to infect babies , pregnant women or anyone with a weakened immune system .
For those with consciences , there are always doubts to be shared about " big pharma " , even when its approach to measles coincides with that of the World Health Organisation .
Understandably , this resistance has exhausted the patience of Sir Sandy Macara , former chairman of the BMA .
" Our attempts to persuade people have failed , " he said last week , explaining why he has submitted a proposal for mandatary vaccination for debate at the forthcoming BMA conference .
" The suggestion , " he says , " is that we ought to consider making a link which would make it compulsory for children to be immunised if they are to receive the benefit of a free education from the state . "
While many taxpayers might wonder where Sir Sandy got the idea that state education costs them nothing , his proposal certainly has its attractions .
If parental avoidance of the jab continues , some people will be left permanently disabled .
Last year , a boy of 17 died of measles in Yorkshire .
More than 260 people have now been affected in a series of recent outbreaks in Wales , where immunisation has dipped beneath 95 % , the level required for herd immunity .
The disease is spreading when it should , like diphtheria and polio , have been purged from these shores .
Still , given the current fashion for persuasion , à la Thaler and Sunstein 's Nudge , you wonder about Macara 's marked preference for stick over carrot .
Would n't his officious approach merely increase resistance among parents who already suspect that doctors are motivated , at best , by cold pragmatism , at worst , by a desire to bump up their salaries with zillions of jab bounties ?
Moreover , if we are going to start finger - wagging , it is worth remembering that this scare originated not among hysterical parents , but among Macara 's former colleagues , in the medical school attached to the NHS 's Royal Free Hospital in north London .
In February 1998 , it was not some ignorant , tabloid rag that featured Wakefield 's now utterly discredited study , but that respected medical journal , the Lancet .
Looking back , as one of thousands of parents whose introduction to Dr Wakefield coincided , almost exactly , with the MMR call - up , I wonder if it was so idiotic , in the circumstances , to have kept postponing the moment of vaccination .
Considering that the Lancet paper also came with the endorsement of a Royal Free press release .
Wakefield 's paper found , according to the Royal Free : " ... that in a number of cases the onset of behavioural symptoms was associated with MMR vaccination . "
I do n't recall the " attempts to persuade people " , as Macara calls them , being very strenuous .
Doctors just said you'd be stupid not to ignore other stupid doctors .
In 2001 , with several big MMR studies yet to deliver reassurance , the public was sufficiently unpersuaded to want to know whether the Blairs had vaccinated their youngest son .
This information was doughtily withheld until Mrs Blair revealed in her recent autobiography that she did give Leo the MMR jab : " ... not least because it 's irresponsible not to . "
Why did n't she and the prime minister say so at the time , since it 's also irresponsible not to spare children suffering ?
It was more important to spite the Daily Mail
" I was adamant , " she explains , " that I would not give the press chapter and verse .
They had no right and it would set a bad precedent . "
You can understand it , ca n't you ?
Tell people stuff like that and , next thing you know , they 're asking you about your contraceptive equipment .
Not until many non-vaccinations later , in 2004 , did the Lancet admit that the Wakefield paper was " fatally flawed " .
At the same time , 10 of its doctor authors carefully retracted its " interpretation " of a possible link between autism and MMR .
This followed Sunday Times journalist Brian Deer 's demolition of Wakefield 's methodology and his shocking discovery that the doctor had not disclosed two glaring conflicts of interest .
Before recommending single vaccines to parents on the back of the Lancet paper , Wakefield had patented a single measles vaccine .
The GMC has yet to conclude its investigation into his alleged misconduct .
If Wakefield 's story is too lengthy to stand alone as an MMR persuader , there must be other ways , short of compulsion , of increasing MMR uptake .
What , given that neither science nor guilt trips will do the trick , would convince doubting mothers that they are MMR kinds of people ?
Boden vouchers ?
A chance to see Jude Law in Hamlet ?
Or maybe single vaccines , if it kept them happy ?
Since many parents see vaccination as a form of self - expression as opposed to an instrument for protecting public health , perhaps reassurance should be offered in their own language .
It 's too late to argue that customer caprice has no place in the NHS .
Not when patients experiencing childbirth , say , or low back pain , find themselves offered a range of consumer choices instead of a standard , rational minimum .
Maybe that 's another reason so many parents are outraged by a system of mandatory child vaccination that , with reasonable opt - out clauses , maintains herd immunity everywhere from the US to Jamaica .
It would probably work here if Barack Obama went on mumsnet .
Failing that , I can only suggest that vaccine - dodgers have their principles fully tested , but in a really non-authoritarian way .
If the government invited schools to decide their own vaccine policies , this would show exemplary commitment to localism .
Given that vaccinators predominate , even in Islington , most schools would probably support the MMR as a condition of enrolment , leaving dodgers to send their children to schools tolerant of the unjabbed , where their diverse immune systems can be challenged in a truly diseased environment .
Admittedly , these MMR - free academies may be unfair on the children .
But so , when they could have been eradicated , are measles epidemics .

The more I learn about the unhinged Christianist nutjob who gunned down Dr. George Tiller , the more frightened I become :
The suspect in the fatal shooting of late - term abortion doctor George Tiller in Kansas was an occasional contributor to a Des Moines - based newsletter that believes that killing abortion providers is justifiable homicide .
Des Moines resident and anti-abortion activist Dave Leach publishes the newsletter , called “ Prayer & Action News , ” which describes itself as “ a trumpet call for the Armies of God to assemble . ”
In an interview with The Washington Post , Leach said not only has he published the writings of alleged gunman Scott Roeder in the past , but he recently visited him in Kansas on his way back from speaking with Rachelle “ Shelley ” Shannon in prison .
Shannon was convicted in 1993 of shooting Tiller outside his clinic .
She later confessed to setting fires at abortion clinics in Oregon , California , Idaho and Nevada .
In an interview with the Iowa Independent , Leach said calling “ killing a killer a crime is too simplistic . ” [… ]
“ So while I am waiting for more dialogue , I must say that so far , the Bible discussion I have seen overwhelmingly supports anyone willing to sacrifice everything in order to physically stop an abortionist from killing thousands of babies , ” he said .

( Note : There is a serious problem with the testimony of Sibel Edmonds .
See the second update below .
I may have to apologize to my readers for my previous positive treatment of Edmonds . )
( Or do I ? See update 3 )
Also , a current female ... member of Congress who has been blackmailed by the Turkish Government ... called a ' hooking exercise ' ... she 's apparently bi-sexual and they bugged her apartment , she 's married with children , and they set up a relationship with another female who went in and had sexual relationships with her .
And they had all the episodes bugged within this current Representatives home and they blackmailed her .
...
She would n't give her name , but her photograph [ is the one with the question mark on it in the " Sibel Edmonds Rogue Gallery " ] .
The context of the discussion was that this particular Representative was amenable to passage of the Armenian Genocide Resolution .
And then based on this ' hooking ' operation , changed her position .
She was reluctant to put this person 's name on record .
Jane Harman
Community activist and civic leader Azniv Goenjian recently traveled to Washington , DC with the Armenian National Committee of America – Western Region ( ANCA - WR ) to confront her Congresswoman , Jane Harman ( D - CA - 36 ) , for secretly opposing the Armenian Genocide Resolution , H. Res. 106 , while publicly presenting herself as a supporter of this human right legislation .
really
According to a report in The Jerusalem Post , intelligence cooperation between the Mossad and the Turkish security service , MIT , " was enshrined in a 12 - clause agreement that was signed during a 1993 visit to Israel by then - Turkish foreign minister Hikmat Chetin " .
Soon after , according to the London - based newsletter Foreign Report , a large Mossad operation was established in Turkey , with Mossad agents based in both Istanbul and Ankara .
That 's
Update :
Update 2 :
After reviewing our coverage , Edmonds clarifies that she did not discuss the specific voting record of the Congresswoman in question discussed above , because she did n't , and still does n't , know her record on that particular issue .
As Krikorian 's quote above may have been inadvertently misleading on that point , she wanted to correct that record .
- BF
Update 3 :
Ah , this is delicious !
You want a sex scandal ?
We got one !
BradBlog is live - blogging the Sibel Edmonds deposition , which we described two posts below .
Here 's the bit that everyone will be talking about :
So who is the mystery congresswoman , and why is Sibel Edmonds being coy about the name ?
I 'll presume that we 're not talking about Jean Schmidt -- a refusal to name her would have been ridiculous , given the circumstances .
There are at present 74 female House members .
If you want a list , go here I think we have a likely suspect , my friends :
Ties right in with what Sibel said , does it not ?
This sort of thing has happened to Jane before .
Remember her similar involvement with the AIPAC scandal Remember this ?
( Also here . )
If Jane Harman has a skeletonized closet , then her strange role in the AIPAC matter suddenly takes on a new dimension .
It 's especially interesting if we posit that Turkey and Israel were trading intelligence .
And that 's agood bet .
See here and here the part which even Sibel is leaving out .
( Also see my previous post here . ) Sibel Edmonds has fingered Harman before .
See here , and do some reading between the lines .
There is a serious problem with Sibel Edmond 's testimony , at least insofar as it has come down to us .
( We do not yet have the actual transcript . )
The issue is one of chronology .
Sibel Edmonds was an FBI translator for a brief period -- December 2001 to March 2002 .
The Armenian Genocide Resolution was introduced in 2007 .
Although her name may sound like " sibyl , " I do n't think that Edmonds was getting dispatches from the future during her FBI tenure .
And yet she said in court that the blackmail occurred in " the context " of the Armenian Genocide Resolution !
Now , it is true that we know about her testimony primarily from David Krikorian , who was offering his precis of her words in court .
But I simply cannot see any situation in which he would have brought up the Armenian Genocide Resolution unless Sibel had done so first .
After the testimony , a " clarification " was issued : This statement hardly resolves anything .
1 . The Armenian Genocide Resolution has never come to a vote .
All talk of voting records is therefore meaningless .
2 . Nothing in this clarification addresses the serious chronological problem .
I will withhold final judgment until I see the transcript of Edmonds ' actual words .
Frankly , though , I am starting to feel angry at myself at for publishing so many pro-Edmonds pieces in the past .
There were earlier House Resolutions on Armenian genocide , both from the year 2000 : HR 155 and HR 596 .
Both of these were shot down well over a year before Edmonds joined the FBI .
Arguably , her translation work may have covered older business .
So far , though , I have yet to find any dramatic turnarounds on those resolutions involving female Democratic representatives still serving in Congress who are also currently married and who have children .
The U.S. government 's ' cash - for - clunkers ' rebate program aimed at promoting fuel - efficient vehicles generated nearly 700,000 new car sales , with Japan 's Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203 .TO ) topping the list of the new purchases , Kyodo News reported Thursday citing the Transportation Department .
Toyota accounted for 19.4 % of 690,114 rebate applications worth $ 2.88 billion dealers submitted to the department by the deadline of Tuesday night , surpassing 17.6 % logged by General Motors Co. ( GM ) , now under reconstruction .
GM was followed by 14.4 % for Ford Motor Co. F , +0.90 % , 13.0 % for Honda Motor Co. ( 7267.TO ) and 8.7 % for Nissan Motor Co. ( 7201.TO ) .
Chrysler LLC came seventh with a 6.6 % share .
By car model , Japanese vehicles occupied the top three .
The Toyota Corolla was the most popular model purchased under the program , followed by the Honda Civic and the Toyota Camry .
The fourth largest - selling car was Ford Focus FWD , the department said .
Four other Japanese models were among the top 10 - the Nissan Versa , placing sixth , the Toyota Prius , seventh , the Honda Accord , eighth , and the Honda Fit , ninth .
The incentive program was introduced in late July under the $ 3 billion budget provided by Congress .
It gives $ 3,500 to $ 4,500 to people who trade in an old car for a new one with higher fuel economy .
The subsidy was designed to prop up the nation 's faltering car market by encouraging makers to make more fuel - efficient vehicles .
The government closed the program just one month after the introduction , as the budget ran out under a flood of applications .
" American consumers and workers were the clear winners thanks to the cash for clunkers program , " Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement .
" Manufacturing plants have added shifts and recalled workers .
Moribund showrooms were brought back to life and consumers bought fuel efficient cars that will save them money and improve the environment . "
According to a preliminary estimate by the White House Council of Economic Advisers , the incentive program will boost economic growth in the third quarter of 2009 by 0.3 - 0.4 percentage points at an annual rate thanks to increased auto sales in July and August .
The program will also create or save 42,000 jobs in the second half of 2009 , the estimate said .
Ford and GM recently announced production increases for both the third and fourth quarters as a result of the demand generated by the program .
Honda also said it will be increasing production at its U.S. plants in East Liberty and Marysville , Ohio and in Lincoln , Alabama .

A swirl of cinnamon sugar running through a soft and fluffy white bread makes for a delicious Cinnamon Swirl Bread .
It has a billowy loaf shape and a lovely golden brown crust .
It 's delicious buttered .
And it makes really good toast .
A few notes on technique and ingredients .
To make a flavorful white bread I like to add a pre-ferment .
That is , a starter , which is really just a small amount of bread dough that is made the night before and then stored in the refrigerator overnight so it has time to develop flavor .
Next day , you just add it in with all the other ingredients when you make the bread dough .
As far as ingredients go , we are using mostly bread flour and a small amount of all purpose flour ( plain flour ) .
For the yeast , I like to use either SAF Red or SAF Gold instant yeast #ad .
This type of yeast gives a good rise and it does n't need to be proofed .
However , if you want to substitute active dry yeast for instant yeast you need to increase the amount of yeast by about 20 % .
You also need to activate the yeast in lukewarm water .
To do this for the starter , simply heat the water to lukewarm , stir in the yeast , and let it stand about 5 - 10 minutes or until frothy .
For the bread dough , remove about 1/4 cup ( 60 grams ) water from the total amount called for in the recipe and heat it to lukewarm .
Stir in the yeast .
Let stand about 5 - 10 minutes or until the mixture becomes frothy .
Dried milk powder is used in this recipe as it enhances the color of the crust , adds flavor , and helps to keep the bread moist .
For the salt , I like to use kosher salt .
There is also some butter in this dough , and I like to use unsalted butter .
And lastly we need water .
I like to use ice cold filtered water .
The temperature of the water is very important when making bread as it determines the temperature of the final dough , which affects the rate ( time ) of fermentation ( proofing ) .
The reason we use cold water is that the dough warms up during the long kneading period .

Stay safe and let 's get baking !!

Crashed on an oil covered off ramp
A little more than half way through the turn of the off ramp my bike suddenly slipped out from under me at approximately 50 miles per hour and i slid body first into a Ford Torus , hit the right rear side of the car .
had it been a truck , even a small one , I would have been run over without a doubt .
In fear of being run over by another car , since its a dark off ramp , I jumped up and grabbed my bike and went onto the inside shoulder of the off ramp .
I checked myself over quickly , I was fine .
Then I ran over to the other car to make sure that everybody was ok , which they were thank god !
and to check the damage to there vehicle :
Dented right rear passenger door
Dented right rear quater panel
deep scratches in front passenger door
Robert said " fuck man I almost crashed ! what the hell happened " .
I turn and look at the off ramp and I see HUGE dark spots on the ground as a car goes by .
as traffic clears , Robert and I grab a few broken off parts to clear the road .
Robert grabs what he though was part of my bike and realizes its A ZIP LOCK BAG FULL OF OIL !
Upon looking at the mess of the off ramp we find 5 more one gallon zip lock bags all covered in oil !!!
someone threw them all over the off ramp !
I was in shock that someone would do such a thing .
The CHP was called right away and It took them ONE hour to get to us .
where as Caltrans was on the scene in just 20 minutes to clean up this huge mess !
when the CHP finally arrived , he was not helpful in one bit , taking 5 minutes just to get out of his car .
Im not sure what to do in this situation , I only have liability insurance .
do you guys think I can make a claim with Caltrans ?

Dirty secrets ON ALLEGED MASSACRE IN AFGHANISTAN
The Bush administration did not seem to want to know what happened to thousands of Taliban prisoners who surrendered to the forces of Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum , an Afghan warlord , after the U.S. - led invasion of 2001 .
For years , reports of the massacre of hundreds , perhaps thousands , of prisoners under Dostum 's custody were not pursued .
Survivors and witnesses have described prisoners suffocating and being shot to death while stuffed in metal shipping containers without food or water .
Those alleged atrocities are an American concern .
Dostum was on the payroll of the CIA , his militia worked closely with U.S. Special Forces in 2001 - and he recently was reinstated as military chief of staff to President Hamid Karzai .
Finally , over the weekend , President Obama told CNN that he directed his national security team to look into the deaths of those prisoners .
The president did not rule out the possibility of an investigation into whether war crimes were committed .
If these allegations are true , then Dostum should be brought to justice , not returned to a position of power in Kabul .

2009 NHL AWARDS ARCHIVE ›
In a season where rookies excelled , culling the field for the Calder Trophy to three finalists was tough business .
But when the votes from the Professional Hockey Writers ' Association were counted Columbus Blue Jackets goalie Steve Mason Anaheim Ducks forward Bobby Ryan and Chicago Blackhawks forward Kris Versteeg emerged .
The 2009 NHL Awards will be broadcast live from the Pearl Concert Theater inside the Palms Hotel Las Vegas on June 18 on VERSUS in the United States and CBC in Canada .
Tickets to the NHL Awards in Las Vegas and the exclusive NHL After - Party are available at ticketmaster.com / nhlawards
In addition to being Calder finalists , another common bond among the trio is they want to make a difference for their clubs .
Based on their play during the regular season , they did just that .
All three played important roles in helping their teams make the Stanley Cup Playoffs .
It 's doubtful that the Ducks or Blue Jackets would have made the playoffs without their rookie stars , while Versteeg was the key to the Blackhawks ' sharp start this season .
Versteeg and Ryan have another thing in common , they both believe their team is better off with the puck on their stick .
Both are excellent skaters and puckhandlers who like to carry the puck into shooting situations and fire away .
Both have had to learn to rely more on their teammates and that has been part of their growth this season .
Mason , Ryan and Versteeg each overcame earlier disappointments to prove their merits in the NHL .
Ryan and Mason started the season in the minors .
Mason was buried four years ago by a Junior B coach , but switched teams and continued his progression .
An impatient Ryan returned two more seasons to juniors after being drafted second overall in 2005 , while Versteeg was traded from his drafting club for -- the ultimate putdown -- a career minor leaguer .--
To put it in historical context , Mason 's rookie season rivaled or exceeded those of Calder winners Martin Brodeur Terry Sawchuk and Frankie Brimsek .
His 10 shutouts led the NHL , the first rookie leader since Esposito had 15 in 1970 .
Mason ranked second with a 2.29 save percentage , eighth with 3,664 minutes , ninth with 33 wins , 10th with 61 games and 11th with a .916 save percentage .
He led all rookie goalies in every category except save percentage , finishing second to the .917 posted by Nashville 's Pekka Rinne , whose fine season included seven shutouts .
"
It 's a huge honor , " Mason said .
" You look at some of the players who have won it in previous seasons , like Patrick Kane last year .
It was nice to see him have that success in his rookie season and it has translated into more success this year .
So , past winners have gone on to some pretty special careers .
" Being nominated is very nice and it will be a great honor to go to Las Vegas and be around that scenery for a couple of days .
Obviously , it would be nice to bring home some hardware .
" Mason started the season with the AHL Syracuse Crunch after knee surgery last April .
He was called up after six games and won his first three starts .
Mason was 9 - 5 - 1 after stopping 48 shots , his season high , in a Dec. 17 win over the San Jose Sharks .
His season best four - game winning streak from Dec. 27 - Jan. 2 included three shutouts .
Mason got better as the season went along .
He had a 2.72 GAA after five games , but had it down to a season - low 1.66 on Jan .
2 . While it rose to 2.29 at season 's end , his save percentage remained the same since Feb. 21 , suggesting he was consistent and playing a little better than his teammates .
Mason won three games against the defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings after the NHL All - Star Game , including a 46 - save effort March 7 in an 8 - 2 victory at Joe Louis Arena that his coach considers the most important in franchise history .--
For three years , the Ducks and Ryan endured the tease :
Who was drafted second behind Sidney Crosby in the 2005 Entry Draft and where is he now ?
Ryan followed the normal progression of two more junior seasons and a year in the AHL .
Now , he 's the first West Coast player to lead the NHL rookie scoring race since Luc Robitaille in 1986 - 87 .
Ryan led all NHL rookies with 31 goals and 57 points , and he spotted the field 18 games .
Ryan had to start the season in the AHL because the Ducks could n't fit him into their salary cap .
After producing 5 goals and 10 points in 23 games with the Ducks a year ago , Ryan underwent an intensive summer conditioning program , dropping his body fat from 19 to 7 percent and shedding 20 pounds to 207 .
He also eliminated the high - risk elements of his game to become a reliable two - way player .
Ryan is a powerful 6 - foot - 2 winger and he plays a skilled game .
He had an impressive 17.8 shooting percentage from 174 shots .
Ryan led the Ducks with a plus - 13 rating and 12 power - play goals , 17th in the NHL .
He was 27th in goals and second on the Ducks behind Corey Perry 's 32 goals .
Coach Randy Carlyle moved Ryan around the lineup , mostly second - and third - line shifts in the beginning , as well as left and right wing , before giving him increased responsibilities .
Ryan wound up playing left wing on the first line with Perry and Ryan Getzlaf The Ducks were 12th in the Western Conference with 10 games to go but got strong performances from the top line down the stretch .
Getzlaf had 14 points , Perry 13 , and Ryan had 11 , including seven goals .--
For a rising team trying to market a new identity , Versteeg was a Godsend .
Of course , his 22 goals and 31 assists , fourth in team scoring was Important , but Versteeg brought an alternately witty and off - the - wall sense of humor into the dressing room .
Check the Web for some of his teammate - teasing videos , the teammates ' responses , and his dressing - room rap session .
There 's no question there was tension in Chicago at the start of the season – the Hawks fired coach Denis Savard after only four games -- but Versteeg 's early timely scoring and wit helped alleviate the pressure .
He had 7 goals and 20 points in the first 20 games .
His scoring slowed during the second half , but he finished with three points in the final four games .
Versteeg is on the smallish side at 5 - foot - 10 and 180 pounds .
He 's had success playing the wing with center Dave Bolland and Patrick Sharp Versteeg uses short , choppy strides and unpredictable changes of direction to make room for his outstanding puckhandling ability .
He can carry the puck through traffic and resembles a basketball point guard in his ability to penetrate from the perimeter to the net .
He learned to use his teammates to greater benefit during the course of the season .
Versteeg led NHL rookies with 31 assists and was eighth on the Blackhawks .
His 22 goals and plus - 15 rating ranked fourth among NHL rookies .
Versteeg led the Blackhawks and tied for fourth in the NHL with four shorthanded goals .
Ryan and Versteeg tied for second among NHL rookies with three game - winning goals .
The Obama administration 's plan to end production of the F - 22 Raptor has received plenty of press coverage , but the Pentagon budget itself , even though it 's again on the rise , hardly rates a bit of notice .
In fact , amid the plethora of issues large and small -- from health care reform to Gates - gate , from energy policy to the culpability of Michael Jackson 's doctor -- that make up the American debate in the media , in Washington , and possibly even in the country , what Chalmers Johnson has called " our empire of bases " goes essentially unmentioned .
Not that we do n't build them profligately .
At one point , we had 106 of them -- mega to micro -- in Iraq alone ; right now , we have at least 50 forward operating bases and command outposts in Afghanistan to go with a few giant bases ( and the Pentagon is evidently now considering the possibility of creating a single , privatized , mercenary force to defend them , according to the Washington Post ) .
This is all staggering expensive .
In an era when the need for funds at home is self - evident , on purely practical grounds -- and there are obviously others -- the maintenance of our global imperial stance , not to speak of the wars , conflicts , and dangers that go with it , should be at the forefront of national discussion .
Instead , it has largely been left to oppositional websites to keep this crucial issue alive .
Our military empire , and the vast national security state and bureaucracy that go with it , have been perhaps the central focus of TomDispatch since it launched in late 2002 .
This site has concentrated on our military bases , the Pentagon 's blue - sky thinking about future weaponry , air war as the American way of war , the defense budget , and the out - of - control nature of the Pentagon , among many other related issues .
Nick Turse , associate editor at this site and an expert on the Pentagon , has even put its properties on " the auction block . "
Since Chalmers Johnson first wrote of that empire of bases at this site back in 2004 , no one has more cogently analyzed the dangers of militarism , military Keynesianism , and a Pentagon budget spun out of control .
His trilogy of books on the subject , Blowback , The Sorrows of Empire , and Nemesis are already classics , and assumedly on the shelves of all TomDispatch readers .
Today , he turns to the issue which should be , but is n't , central to our moment : dismantling the empire .
Think of this as the American health care reform program that no one is discussing .
Tom
However ambitious President Barack Obama 's domestic plans , one unacknowledged issue has the potential to destroy any reform efforts he might launch .
Think of it as the 800 - pound gorilla in the American living room : our longstanding reliance on imperialism and militarism in our relations with other countries and the vast , potentially ruinous global empire of bases that goes with it .
The failure to begin to deal with our bloated military establishment and the profligate use of it in missions for which it is hopelessly inappropriate will , sooner rather than later , condemn the United States to a devastating trio of consequences : imperial overstretch , perpetual war , and insolvency , leading to a likely collapse similar to that of the former Soviet Union .
According to the 2008 official Pentagon inventory of our military bases around the world , our empire consists of 865 facilities in more than 40 countries and overseas U.S. territories .
We deploy over 190,000 troops in 46 countries and territories .
In just one such country , Japan , at the end of March 2008 , we still had 99,295 people connected to U.S. military forces living and working there -- 49,364 members of our armed services , 45,753 dependent family members , and 4,178 civilian employees .
Some 13,975 of these were crowded into the small island of Okinawa , the largest concentration of foreign troops anywhere in Japan .
These massive concentrations of American military power outside the United States are not needed for our defense .
They are , if anything , a prime contributor to our numerous conflicts with other countries .
They are also unimaginably expensive .
According to Anita Dancs , an analyst for the website Foreign Policy in Focus , the United States spends approximately $ 250 billion each year maintaining its global military presence .
The sole purpose of this is to give us hegemony -- that is , control or dominance -- over as many nations on the planet as possible .
We are like the British at the end of World War II : desperately trying to shore up an empire that we never needed and can no longer afford , using methods that often resemble those of failed empires of the past -- including the Axis powers of World War II and the former Soviet Union .
There is an important lesson for us in the British decision , starting in 1945 , to liquidate their empire relatively voluntarily , rather than being forced to do so by defeat in war , as were Japan and Germany , or by debilitating colonial conflicts , as were the French and Dutch .
We should follow the British example .
( Alas , they are currently backsliding and following our example by assisting us in the war in Afghanistan . )
Here are three basic reasons why we must liquidate our empire or else watch it liquidate us .
1. We Can No Longer Afford Our Postwar Expansionism
Shortly after his election as president , Barack Obama , in a speech announcing several members of his new cabinet , stated as fact that " [ w ] e have to maintain the strongest military on the planet . "
A few weeks later , on March 12 , 2009 , in a speech at the National Defense University in Washington DC , the president again insisted , " Now make no mistake , this nation will maintain our military dominance .
We will have the strongest armed forces in the history of the world . "
And in a commencement address to the cadets of the U.S. Naval Academy on May 22nd , Obama stressed that " [ w ] e will maintain America 's military dominance and keep you the finest fighting force the world has ever seen . "
What he failed to note is that the United States no longer has the capability to remain a global hegemon , and to pretend otherwise is to invite disaster .
According to a growing consensus of economists and political scientists around the world , it is impossible for the United States to continue in that role while emerging into full view as a crippled economic power .
No such configuration has ever persisted in the history of imperialism .
The University of Chicago 's Robert Pape , author of the important study Dying to Win : The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism ( Random House , 2005 ) , typically writes :
" America is in unprecedented decline .
The self - inflicted wounds of the Iraq war , growing government debt , increasingly negative current - account balances and other internal economic weaknesses have cost the United States real power in today 's world of rapidly spreading knowledge and technology .
If present trends continue , we will look back on the Bush years as the death knell of American hegemony . "
There is something absurd , even Kafkaesque , about our military empire .
Jay Barr , a bankruptcy attorney , makes this point using an insightful analogy :
" Whether liquidating or reorganizing , a debtor who desires bankruptcy protection must provide a list of expenses , which , if considered reasonable , are offset against income to show that only limited funds are available to repay the bankrupted creditors .
Now imagine a person filing for bankruptcy claiming that he could not repay his debts because he had the astronomical expense of maintaining at least 737 facilities overseas that provide exactly zero return on the significant investment required to sustain them
He could not qualify for liquidation without turning over many of his assets for the benefit of creditors , including the valuable foreign real estate on which he placed his bases . "
In other words , the United States is not seriously contemplating its own bankruptcy .
It is instead ignoring the meaning of its precipitate economic decline and flirting with insolvency .
Nick Turse , author of The Complex : How the Military Invades our Everyday Lives ( Metropolitan Books , 2008 ) , calculates that we could clear $ 2.6 billion if we would sell our base assets at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean and earn another $ 2.2 billion if we did the same with Guantánamo Bay in Cuba .
These are only two of our over 800 overblown military enclaves .
Our unwillingness to retrench , no less liquidate , represents a striking historical failure of the imagination .
In his first official visit to China since becoming Treasury Secretary , Timothy Geithner assured an audience of students at Beijing University , " Chinese assets [ invested in the United States ] are very safe . "
According to press reports , the students responded with loud laughter .
Well they might .
In May 2009 , the Office of Management and Budget predicted that in 2010 the United States will be burdened with a budget deficit of at least $ 1.75 trillion .
This includes neither a projected $ 640 billion budget for the Pentagon , nor the costs of waging two remarkably expensive wars .
The sum is so immense that it will take several generations for American citizens to repay the costs of George W. Bush 's imperial adventures -- if they ever can or will .
It represents about 13 % of our current gross domestic product ( that is , the value of everything we produce ) .
It is worth noting that the target demanded of European nations wanting to join the Euro Zone is a deficit no greater than 3 % of GDP .
Thus far , President Obama has announced measly cuts of only $ 8.8 billion in wasteful and worthless weapons spending , including his cancellation of the F - 22 fighter aircraft .
The actual Pentagon budget for next year will , in fact , be larger , not smaller , than the bloated final budget of the Bush era .
Far bolder cuts in our military expenditures will obviously be required in the very near future if we intend to maintain any semblance of fiscal integrity .
2. We Are Going to Lose the War in Afghanistan and It Will Help Bankrupt Us
One of our major strategic blunders in Afghanistan was not to have recognized that both Great Britain and the Soviet Union attempted to pacify Afghanistan using the same military methods as ours and failed disastrously .
We seem to have learned nothing from Afghanistan 's modern history -- to the extent that we even know what it is .
Between 1849 and 1947 , Britain sent almost annual expeditions against the Pashtun tribes and sub-tribes living in what was then called the North - West Frontier Territories -- the area along either side of the artificial border between Afghanistan and Pakistan called the Durand Line .
This frontier was created in 1893 by Britain 's foreign secretary for India , Sir Mortimer Durand .
Neither Britain nor Pakistan has ever managed to establish effective control over the area .
As the eminent historian Louis Dupree put it in his book Afghanistan ( Oxford University Press , 2002 , p. 425 ) : " Pashtun tribes , almost genetically expert at guerrilla warfare after resisting centuries of all comers and fighting among themselves when no comers were available , plagued attempts to extend the Pax Britannica into their mountain homeland . "
An estimated 41 million Pashtuns live in an undemarcated area along the Durand Line and profess no loyalties to the central governments of either Pakistan or Afghanistan .
The region known today as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) of Pakistan is administered directly by Islamabad , which -- just as British imperial officials did -- has divided the territory into seven agencies , each with its own " political agent " who wields much the same powers as his colonial - era predecessor .
Then as now , the part of FATA known as Waziristan and the home of Pashtun tribesmen offered the fiercest resistance .
According to Paul Fitzgerald and Elizabeth Gould , experienced Afghan hands and coauthors of Invisible History : Afghanistan 's Untold Story ( City Lights , 2009 , p. 317 ) :
" If Washington 's bureaucrats do n't remember the history of the region , the Afghans do .
The British used air power to bomb these same Pashtun villages after World War I and were condemned for it .
When the Soviets used MiGs and the dreaded Mi-24 Hind helicopter gunships to do it during the 1980s , they were called criminals .
For America to use its overwhelming firepower in the same reckless and indiscriminate manner defies the world 's sense of justice and morality while turning the Afghan people and the Islamic world even further against the United States . "
In 1932 , in a series of Guernica - like atrocities , the British used poison gas in Waziristan .
The disarmament convention of the same year sought a ban against the aerial bombardment of civilians , but Lloyd George , who had been British prime minister during World War I , gloated : " We insisted on reserving the right to bomb niggers " ( Fitzgerald and Gould , p. 65 ) .
His view prevailed .
The U.S. continues to act similarly , but with the new excuse that our killing of noncombatants is a result of " collateral damage , " or human error .
Using pilotless drones guided with only minimal accuracy from computers at military bases in the Arizona and Nevada deserts among other places , we have killed hundreds , perhaps thousands , of unarmed bystanders in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
The Pakistani and Afghan governments have repeatedly warned that we are alienating precisely the people we claim to be saving for democracy .
When in May 2009 , General Stanley McChrystal was appointed as the commander in Afghanistan , he ordered new limits on air attacks , including those carried out by the CIA , except when needed to protect allied troops .
Unfortunately , as if to illustrate the incompetence of our chain of command , only two days after this order , on June 23 , 2009 , the United States carried out a drone attack against a funeral procession that killed at least 80 people , the single deadliest U.S. attack on Pakistani soil so far .
There was virtually no reporting of these developments by the mainstream American press or on the network television news .
( At the time , the media were almost totally preoccupied by the sexual adventures of the governor of South Carolina and the death of pop star Michael Jackson . )
Our military operations in both Pakistan and Afghanistan have long been plagued by inadequate and inaccurate intelligence about both countries , ideological preconceptions about which parties we should support and which ones we should oppose , and myopic understandings of what we could possibly hope to achieve .
Fitzgerald and Gould , for example , charge that , contrary to our own intelligence service 's focus on Afghanistan , " Pakistan has always been the problem . "
They add :
" Pakistan 's army and its Inter - Services Intelligence branch ... from 1973 on , has played the key role in funding and directing first the mujahideen [ anti-Soviet fighters during the 1980s ] and then the Taliban .
It is Pakistan 's army that controls its nuclear weapons , constrains the development of democratic institutions , trains Taliban fighters in suicide attacks and orders them to fight American and NATO soldiers protecting the Afghan government . " ( p. 322-324 )
The Pakistani army and its intelligence arm are staffed , in part , by devout Muslims who fostered the Taliban in Afghanistan to meet the needs of their own agenda , though not necessarily to advance an Islamic jihad .
Their purposes have always included : keeping Afghanistan free of Russian or Indian influence , providing a training and recruiting ground for mujahideen guerrillas to be used in places like Kashmir ( fought over by both Pakistan and India ) , containing Islamic radicalism in Afghanistan ( and so keeping it out of Pakistan ) , and extorting huge amounts of money from Saudi Arabia , the Persian Gulf emirates , and the United States to pay and train " freedom fighters " throughout the Islamic world .
Pakistan 's consistent policy has been to support the clandestine policies of the Inter - Services Intelligence and thwart the influence of its major enemy and competitor , India .
Colonel Douglas MacGregor , U.S. Army ( retired ) , an adviser to the Center for Defense Information in Washington , summarizes our hopeless project in South Asia this way : " Nothing we do will compel 125 million Muslims in Pakistan to make common cause with a United States in league with the two states that are unambiguously anti-Muslim : Israel and India . "
Obama 's mid-2009 " surge " of troops into southern Afghanistan and particularly into Helmand Province , a Taliban stronghold , is fast becoming darkly reminiscent of General William Westmoreland 's continuous requests in Vietnam for more troops and his promises that if we would ratchet up the violence just a little more and tolerate a few more casualties , we would certainly break the will of the Vietnamese insurgents .
This was a total misreading of the nature of the conflict in Vietnam , just as it is in Afghanistan today .
Twenty years after the forces of the Red Army withdrew from Afghanistan in disgrace , the last Russian general to command them , Gen. Boris Gromov , issued his own prediction : Disaster , he insisted , will come to the thousands of new forces Obama is sending there , just as it did to the Soviet Union 's , which lost some 15,000 soldiers in its own Afghan war .
We should recognize that we are wasting time , lives , and resources in an area where we have never understood the political dynamics and continue to make the wrong choices .
3. We Need to End the Secret Shame of Our Empire of Bases
In March , New York Times op - ed columnist Bob Herbert noted , " Rape and other forms of sexual assault against women is the great shame of the U.S. armed forces , and there is no evidence that this ghastly problem , kept out of sight as much as possible , is diminishing . "
He continued :
" New data released by the Pentagon showed an almost 9 percent increase in the number of sexual assaults -- 2,923 -- and a 25 percent increase in such assaults reported by women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan [ over the past year ] .
Try to imagine how bizarre it is that women in American uniforms who are enduring all the stresses related to serving in a combat zone have to also worry about defending themselves against rapists wearing the same uniform and lining up in formation right beside them . "
The problem is exacerbated by having our troops garrisoned in overseas bases located cheek - by - jowl next to civilian populations and often preying on them like foreign conquerors .
For example , sexual violence against women and girls by American GIs has been out of control in Okinawa , Japan 's poorest prefecture , ever since it was permanently occupied by our soldiers , Marines , and airmen some 64 years ago .
That island was the scene of the largest anti-American demonstrations since the end of World War II after the 1995 kidnapping , rape , and attempted murder of a 12 - year - old schoolgirl by two Marines and a sailor .
The problem of rape has been ubiquitous around all of our bases on every continent and has probably contributed as much to our being loathed abroad as the policies of the Bush administration or our economic exploitation of poverty - stricken countries whose raw materials we covet .
The military itself has done next to nothing to protect its own female soldiers or to defend the rights of innocent bystanders forced to live next to our often racially biased and predatory troops .
" The military 's record of prosecuting rapists is not just lousy , it 's atrocious , " writes Herbert .
In territories occupied by American military forces , the high command and the State Department make strenuous efforts to enact so - called " Status of Forces Agreements " ( SOFAs ) that will prevent host governments from gaining jurisdiction over our troops who commit crimes overseas .
The SOFAs also make it easier for our military to spirit culprits out of a country before they can be apprehended by local authorities .
This issue was well illustrated by the case of an Australian teacher , a long - time resident of Japan , who in April 2002 was raped by a sailor from the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk , then based at the big naval base at Yokosuka .
She identified her assailant and reported him to both Japanese and U.S. authorities .
Instead of his being arrested and effectively prosecuted , the victim herself was harassed and humiliated by the local Japanese police .
Meanwhile , the U.S. discharged the suspect from the Navy but allowed him to escape Japanese law by returning him to the U.S. , where he lives today .
In the course of trying to obtain justice , the Australian teacher discovered that almost fifty years earlier , in October 1953 , the Japanese and American governments signed a secret " understanding " as part of their SOFA in which Japan agreed to waive its jurisdiction if the crime was not of " national importance to Japan . "
The U.S. argued strenuously for this codicil because it feared that otherwise it would face the likelihood of some 350 servicemen per year being sent to Japanese jails for sex crimes .
Since that time the U.S. has negotiated similar wording in SOFAs with Canada , Ireland , Italy , and Denmark .
According to the Handbook of the Law of Visiting Forces ( 2001 ) , the Japanese practice has become the norm for SOFAs throughout the world , with predictable results .
In Japan , of 3,184 U.S. military personnel who committed crimes between 2001 and 2008 , 83 % were not prosecuted .
In Iraq , we have just signed a SOFA that bears a strong resemblance to the first postwar one we had with Japan : namely , military personnel and military contractors accused of off - duty crimes will remain in U.S. custody while Iraqis investigate .
This is , of course , a perfect opportunity to spirit the culprits out of the country before they can be charged .
Within the military itself , the journalist Dahr Jamail , author of Beyond the Green Zone : Dispatches from an Unembedded Journalist in Occupied Iraq ( Haymarket Books , 2007 ) , speaks of the " culture of unpunished sexual assaults " and the " shockingly low numbers of courts martial " for rapes and other forms of sexual attacks .
Helen Benedict , author of The Lonely Soldier : The Private War of Women Serving in Iraq ( Beacon Press , 2009 ) , quotes this figure in a 2009 Pentagon report on military sexual assaults : 90 % of the rapes in the military are never reported at all and , when they are , the consequences for the perpetrator are negligible .
It is fair to say that the U.S. military has created a worldwide sexual playground for its personnel and protected them to a large extent from the consequences of their behavior .
As a result a group of female veterans in 2006 created the Service Women 's Action Network ( SWAN ) .
Its agenda is to spread the word that " no woman should join the military . " **
I believe a better solution would be to radically reduce the size of our standing army , and bring the troops home from countries where they do not understand their environments and have been taught to think of the inhabitants as inferior to themselves .
10 Steps Toward Liquidating the Empire
Dismantling the American empire would , of course , involve many steps .
Here are ten key places to begin :
1 . We need to put a halt to the serious environmental damage done by our bases planet - wide .
We also need to stop writing SOFAs that exempt us from any responsibility for cleaning up after ourselves .
2. Liquidating the empire will end the burden of carrying our empire of bases and so of the " opportunity costs " that go with them -- the things we might otherwise do with our talents and resources but can't or wo n't .
3 . As we already know ( but often forget ) , imperialism breeds the use of torture .
In the 1960s and 1970s we helped overthrow the elected governments in Brazil and Chile and underwrote regimes of torture that prefigured our own treatment of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan .
( See , for instance , A.J. Langguth , Hidden Terrors [ Pantheon , 1979 ] , on how the U.S. spread torture methods to Brazil and Uruguay . )
Dismantling the empire would potentially mean a real end to the modern American record of using torture abroad .
4 . We need to cut the ever - lengthening train of camp followers , dependents , civilian employees of the Department of Defense , and hucksters -- along with their expensive medical facilities , housing requirements , swimming pools , clubs , golf courses , and so forth -- that follow our military enclaves around the world .
5 . We need to discredit the myth promoted by the military - industrial complex that our military establishment is valuable to us in terms of jobs , scientific research , and defense .
These alleged advantages have long been discredited by serious economic research .
Ending empire would make this happen .
6 . As a self - respecting democratic nation , we need to stop being the world 's largest exporter of arms and munitions and quit educating Third World militaries in the techniques of torture , military coups , and service as proxies for our imperialism .
A prime candidate for immediate closure is the so - called School of the Americas , the U.S. Army 's infamous military academy at Fort Benning , Georgia , for Latin American military officers .
( See Chalmers Johnson , The Sorrows of Empire [ Metropolitan Books , 2004 ] , pp. 136-40 . )
7 . Given the growing constraints on the federal budget , we should abolish the Reserve Officers ' Training Corps and other long - standing programs that promote militarism in our schools .
8 . We need to restore discipline and accountability in our armed forces by radically scaling back our reliance on civilian contractors , private military companies , and agents working for the military outside the chain of command and the Uniform Code of Military Justice .
( See Jeremy Scahill , Blackwater : The Rise of the World 's Most Powerful Mercenary Army [ Nation Books , 2007 ] ) .
Ending empire would make this possible .
9 . We need to reduce , not increase , the size of our standing army and deal much more effectively with the wounds our soldiers receive and combat stress they undergo .
10 .
To repeat the main message of this essay , we must give up our inappropriate reliance on military force as the chief means of attempting to achieve foreign policy objectives .
Unfortunately , few empires of the past voluntarily gave up their dominions in order to remain independent , self - governing polities .
The two most important recent examples are the British and Soviet empires .
If we do not learn from their examples , our decline and fall is foreordained .

[ TomDispatch Correction :
The quote in this passage -- " Its agenda is to spread the word that ' no woman should join the military . ' " -- is accurate , but it accurately reflects the views of one person who helped found the Service Women 's Action Network ( SWAN ) , not the views of the organization itself .
SWAN in no way discourages women from joining the military .
As its website explains its mission : " SWAN is a non-partisan , non-profit organization that works to improve the welfare of current U.S. servicewomen and to assist all women veterans ...
SWAN offers personal support and guidance from fellow women veterans , provides legal and counseling services from military law experts and caseworkers , recommends sound policy reform to government officials , and educates the public about servicewomen's issues through various media outlets . " ]

The government insisted freedom of information would not be ' a research arm for the media ' .
So just how useful is it for news ?
When it comes to MPs ' expenses , how much do we owe to the Freedom of Information Act and how much to a CD of data leaked by an insider ?
We would never have found out about MPs ' practice of " flipping " addresses without the Telegraph 's story , certainly .
But there are some details – claims for mole clearance , lightbulb replacement and porn videos among them – that stem from FoI requests made in 2005 .
Journalists at the The Sunday Times ( Heather Brooke and Jon Ungoed - Thomas ) and Sunday Telegraph ( Ben Leapman ) requested information about the expenses of 14 MPs , including Tony Blair and Margaret Beckett .
Three years and a high court victory later , in May 2008 , Michael Martin , the Speaker of the House , was forced to issue the – albeit rather uninteresting – details .
It was another 10 months before Jacqui Smith 's domestic arrangements and Tony McNulty 's two London homes were revealed , and the public started taking notice .
In the meantime , however , parliament had amended the Freedom of Information Act to prevent MPs ' addresses from being revealed .
And without the Telegraph obtaining the un-redacted expenses accounts from an insider , we might never have found out , for instance , that the Luton MP Margaret Moran 's second home is in Southampton , 100 miles away from her constituency .
Or about MPs ' penchant for " flipping " properties .
What these discoveries show is that even if FoI has not been proven as a tool of journalism , its power should not be underestimated .
While " the government did not introduce freedom of information in order to do something ' for journalism ' " , according to Lord Falconer , thanks to the initial efforts of Brooke , Leapman and Ungoed - Thomas , those expenses accounts would have been published – minus redactions – by parliament in July .
Lord Falconer is no longer in office and his former Department for Constitutional Affairs no longer exists , but his statement that FoI was introduced " for the public .
The job of the government is not to provide page leads for the papers , but information for the citizen " still holds good as an expression of the government 's attitude to the act which it introduced .
And yet FoI has yielded important stories .
But while one journalist described FoI to me as " the best thing that has happened in my 20 years in journalism " , another investigative reporter complained that the law is continually being undermined by the government that brought it in : " The act has so many exemptions that the authorities can always find a reason not to release something . "
I started my investigation at the Reuters Institute at Oxford to find out how the act could assist me in my journalism on BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight .
Journalists who are prepared to fight for their story through the whole FoI process are a special breed .
Even when official information is disclosed promptly , you have to work to a three - month schedule .
Going to the information commissioner , if you get turned down , will mean an extra six months before you can make your case .
If officialdom wo n't heed the commissioner , then the gestation period will exceed two years .
Many journalists might ruefully agree that Lord Falconer got it right when he went on to comment that FoI " will never be considered to be a research arm for the media " .
Not everyone sees it that way .
The most prolific user of the Freedom of Information Act in Britain is Matthew Davis , who has created a news agency , Datanews , entirely based on FoI researches .
But he too has lost out through delaying tactics in government .
His request for a breakdown in the time allocated by Des Browne to his respective duties at the Ministry of Defence and the Scottish Office was accommodated only after the " part - time " defence secretary had left the cabinet .
Are these delays really evidence of news management ?
One example clinches the argument .
In 2005 , a Liberal Democrat peer , Lord Avebury , asked for details of the frequency of telephone calls between Tony Blair and Rupert Murdoch in the run-up to the Iraq war .
After more than two years ' delay and an initial refusal to accept the ruling of the information commissioner , the Cabinet Office published the information the day after Blair stepped down as prime minister .
" We decided it was in the public interest " was all officials would offer by way of explanation .
But if FoI requests are becoming too long - winded , or not cost - effective for journalists , there are many others only too willing to help them with free research .
The purveyors of " FoI for free " are pressure groups , campaign organisations and political parties .
For them , the slog of digging for information , often from large collections of authorities , such as hospitals and health trusts , is well rewarded if the media picks up a story and runs with it .
Matthew Elliott , the chief executive of the Taxpayers '
Alliance , has made newsgathering through FoI an integral part of his campaign methods .
" What we 've tried to do since 2004 is understand how the media works , so we 've tried to give news stories to journalists on a plate , " he says .
" We use the Freedom of Information Act and a team of researchers to get fresh figures from government and local councils , which we package up into brief , media - friendly research papers , complete with eye - catching headline figures to give reporters a ready - made top line . "
Regardless of the motivation of those providing the raw material for stories , researches can be objectively assessed : if FoI reveals that the numbers of mixed - sex wards are above government targets , then the integrity of the information stands alone , whatever the affiliations of the researcher .
For all the front - page stories on MPs ' expenses , the case for journalism by FoI is still to be made .
Cost pressures and time pressures in newsrooms suggest FoI fishing expeditions are likely to reduce .
But there is every evidence that the campaigners will take up where journalists leave off .
Freedom of information will continue to be a well - exploited right but it would be ironic if it also became predominantly , to paraphrase Lord Falconer , " a research arm for political opponents and pressure groups " .

Title : Deriving a DSL from One ExampleAbstract : Given an appropriate domain specific language ( DSL ) , it is possible to describe the relationship between Haskell data types and many generic functions , typically type class instances .
While describing the relationship is possible , it is not always an easy task .
There is an alternative -- simply give one example output for a carefully chosen input , and have the relationship derived .
When deriving a relationship from only one example , it is important that the derived relationship is the intended one .
We identify general restrictions on the DSL , and on the provided example , to ensure a level of predictability .
We then apply these restrictions in practice , to derive the relationship between Haskell data types and generic functions .
We have used our scheme in the Derive tool , where over 60 % of type classes are derived from a single example .

This is what Agent Smith , the menacing face of the machine overlords in the film The Matrix , has to say about humanity as he interrogates Morpheus , one of its putative saviours : " Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment .
But you humans do not .
" You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area . "
Smith then tells Morpheus there 's another organism that follows the same pattern .
" A virus , " he spits .
" Human beings are a disease , a cancer of this planet . "
Harsh .
While humans have certainly left wonderful legacies on the planet , there 's no question our needs and desires have also been harmful .
Our remedies involve changing such behaviours as driving gas - guzzlers or using harmful chemicals .
But tucked away at the end of Alan Weisman 's The World Without Us is his call to think again about changing something far more fundamental : our numbers .
The world 's population is expanding by the size of Toronto every eight days .
So Weisman humbly suggests we " limit every human female on Earth capable of bearing children to one . "
" I 'm not trying to be sensationalistic or controversial , " he says in an interview .
" I 'm trying to get us to think very hard about what the whole situation is .
" If we do n't control ourselves , nature will do it for us .
Every species that eats itself out of house and home experiences a population crash . "
The startling conclusion reintroduces a controversial concept to a public discourse from which it has been lost for more than a decade .
According to Nigel Roulet , director of the McGill School of Environment and a contributing author to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , the idea was pushed out of mind by the West 's declining birthrates and the admonishments of various religions and world governments .
People who study the environment , however , have never forgotten about it .
" I think most people that think seriously about the environment and work on issues with the environment would argue that one of the most critical factors driving environmental degradation is overpopulation , " Roulet says .
Arguing to reduce population creates a " visceral reaction " in people , Roulet reasons , " because it requires a reflection on ourselves . "
So instead , " We think of carbon - dioxide emissions as the problem of climate change , but really it 's the number of people whose lifestyles require the level of energy consumption and production that is 95 per cent based on fossil fuels . "
Overpopulation , Roulet argues , can't be separated from the notion of lifestyle .
" Even if population growth was zero , do we have the resources to sustain the 6.5 billion ?
I do n't think we do with everyone having the same social well - being as we have now . "

Welcome to Weird - Wild - WTF ?!?
For when you are tired of the rest of the blogging world !
From Robert O. Freedman
In his June 2009 Bar - Ilan University speech , Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu asserted that Palestinian recognition of Israel as a “ Jewish state ” was one of Israel ’s requirements for agreeing to the establishment of a Palestinian state .
Both Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat , immediately rejected the requirement .
However , if there is to be a long - lasting peace between Israel and a Palestinian state , Palestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish state is a necessity .
Palestinians have three official objections to Israel being recognized as a Jewish state , as well as a fourth objection about which they do not speak openly , but which lies at the heart of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
The three official objections are as follows :
It is not the task of the Palestinians to determine the nature of the Israeli state , but that of the Israelis .
Palestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish state would jeopardize the position of the Israeli Arabs , who form 20 percent of the Israeli population .
Israel did not demand recognition as a “ Jewish state ” in its peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan .
The fourth Palestinian objection — which they do not assert openly lest it destroy the chances for a peace treaty with Israel — is that many Palestinians simply do not accept the legitimacy of Jewish nationalism ( Zionism ) .
For the Palestinians , and for many other Arabs as well , a Jew is defined by religion , not nationality or ethnicity , and given the position of Jews as dhimmis , or second - class religious subjects in Muslim history , the Palestinians feel that Jews have no right to be rulers , let alone rule over what they consider Muslim territory .
These attitudes , partially latent during the heyday of the Oslo peace process ( 1993 - 2000 ) , were reinforced by the Al - Aqsa Intifada , which transformed what had been a conflict between two peoples over the same piece of territory into a religious war between Muslims and Jews , and which greatly strengthened Hamas in the process .
Indeed both Hamas and non-Hamas religious leaders stressed that the Palestinians were fighting the Jews , just as Muhammad had fought the Jews who they allied with his enemies as he sought to unite the Arabian Peninsula under the banner of Islam .
What the Palestinians — and other Arabs — fail to understand is that Zionism arose as a national movement among Jews in Europe in the 19th century .
Very much influenced by the national unification movements of Germany and Italy ( as were the Arab nationalists of the time ) , as well as by the increasingly precarious position of the Jews in Eastern Europe who were beset by pogroms in Czarist Russia , Zionist thinkers such as Hess , Lilienblum and Herzl asserted that just as the French had France , the Germans had Germany and the Italians had Italy , the Jews deserved a state of their own where they could lead a “ normal , national life , ” and the ancient Jewish homeland of Israel , then occupied by the Ottoman Empire , was chosen as the site of the future Jewish state .
To be sure , the land which the Zionists wanted was already populated by Arabs ; however , the Arabs who lived there at the end of the 19th century had not yet developed a national identity ( that was come during the British mandate of 1922 - 48 ) , and at the time primary saw themselves as Muslims or Christians , or as “ Southern Syrians ” or as Ottoman subjects .
This being the case , one can respond to the Palestinian reasons for not recognizing Israel as a “ Jewish state ” in the following manner :
16.4 % , by Richard Florida :
That ’s the overall rate of unemployment , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics ’ newly released U - 6 measure which includes “ marginally attached workers ” as well as those who work part - time for economic reasons .
That ’s quite a bit higher than the widely reported 9.4 percent figure ...
Race :
The unemployment rate for whites was 8.6 percent compared to 12.7 percent for Hispanics , 14.9 percent for blacks , and 16.8 percent for black men .
Gender : Men continue to experience higher rates of unemployment than women , with the gap widening to three full percentage points - 10.5 percent vs. 7.5 percent ( for those over 16 years of age ) - due to the concentration of men in manufacturing jobs .
Human Capital / Education : Unemployment is even more uneven by education or human capital level .
The unemployment rate for college graduates is 4.8 percent , half that for high school ( only ) graduates ( 10 percent ) , and one - third of the 15.5 percent rate facing those without a high school diploma .
Class :
And there remain huge differences in unemployment by occupation .
The highest rates of unemployment remain concentrated in working class occupations .
For production , transportation , and moving occupations overall , the rate is 13.7 percent , up from 6.3 percent last year .
For production workers it ’s 15.6 percent ; movers and transportation workers , 11.8 percent ; and construction and extraction jobs , 19.7 percent .
For service occupations , the unemployment rate is nearly 10 ( 9.4 ) percent .
Unemployment is significantly lower for the creative class .
For management and business occupations - including hard - fit financial jobs - overall the unemployment rate is 4.6 percent , up from 2.7 percent last year ; and for professional and technical occupations it is 4.2 percent , up from 2.5 percent a year ago .
I suppose the financial innovation that led to the crisis can be termed " creative , " but the social utility of the products that were created is doubtful .
People outside of the financial sector are paying a high cost for that creativity , and that inequity is one reason to support social insurance and other programs that dampen the effects of the financial meltdown .
In that regard , here 's Brad DeLong :
Fiscal Policy in the Second Half of 2009 : A DRAFT of a letter I might send next week :
Dear President Obama --
At the end of 2008 , when your incoming administration was preparing your recession - fighting strategy , your forecasts were that the recession would bottom out in August of 2009 , with a peak unemployment rate of 7.9 % .
The unemployment rate in May was already 9.4 % .
10 % unemployment this year is a nearly foregone conclusion .
11 % unemployment - - a recession twice as deep as the one your incoming administration was forecasting at the end of 2008 - - is not unlikely .
An 11 % unemployment rate would carry along with it an underemployment rate --a U - 6 - - that would kiss 20 % .
Even had the fiscal expansion plans of your administration not been cut back by roughly a quarter in their employment - generating effectiveness by the Congress , fiscal stimulus plans that appeared to be adequate and appropriate at the turn of the year now appear to be inadequate .
Compounding the problem of inadequate fiscal expansion at the federal level is the problem of inappropriate and substantial fiscal contraction at the state level .
Last fall Nobel Prize - winning Princeton economist Paul Krugman feared " fifty Herbert Hoovers " -- fifty states each trying to balance its budget year - by - year and each one delivering a substantial drag on employment and income in its and its neighbors ' economies .
I therefore believe :
That it is past time for you to seek from the Congress for authority to guarantee the debt of states that , in response to the current recession , ( a ) seek to conduct their own state - level fiscal expansions , and ( b ) devise plans and strategies for the long - term repayment of the debt the federal government guarantees that the Secretary of the Treasury certifies as prudent and sustainable .
That it is time for you to seek from the Congress an amended Budget Resolution : to include in this year 's forthcoming Reconciliation process an additional $ 500 billion of federal aid to states , distributed per capita and conditioned on their maintaining effort at the provision of public services -- on their not repeating the mistake of Herbert Hoover of cutting government employment and spending in a downturn .
Sincerely yours ,
J. Bradford DeLong
A couple of weeks ago I brought my Gametrekking project to completion with the release of a downloadable collection of all the travel - inspired sketches I ’ve created to date .
I thought I ’d go ahead and copy my retrospective blog post over here .
What about my writing ?
Will I start reviewing games again , now that the Gametrekking project is over ?
I ’m thinking about it .
Meanwhile , here ’s my retrospective :
—
Today I am releasing the Gametrekking Omnibus , a downloadable collection of all of my Gametrekking creations to date .
It is my tenth release of the Gametrekking project , and it will also be my final " official " release .
The omnibus includes an interface that lets you browse through all of my creations by country , some built - in slideshows to provide context , links to my written reflections , and new fullscreen versions of all my games and notgames .
To download the Gametrekking Omnibus For Windows :
Download and run the native exe installer .
Note that you need to be connected to the internet during installation , and it may take a while if you do not already have Adobe Air installed .
To download the Gametrekking Omnibus For Mac OS :
Download and install Adobe Air from http://get.adobe.com/air.
Download and run the Gametrekking Omnibus air file .
This is going to be the final official release of the Gametrekking project , because it ’s been two years since the project launched , I ’ve clearly finished " the journey proper , " and a downloadable collection of the work I ’ve managed to produce so far seems like as good a place to wrap things up as any .
I say this is the " official " end of Gametrekking , because I see the project continuing on indefinitely in some sense …
It seems certain that I will keep traveling into the future in some capacity or another , and that I will continue to experiment with interactive sketches and notgames about the things that impact me .
But still , I think the Kickstarter project deserves some kind of closure , and that ’s what I ’ve tried to create with this downloadable collection .
When I launched this project two years ago on Kickstarter I did n’t know if I was going to be able to successfully fund it , but was soon amazed by the support and generosity of the family members , friends , internet acquaintances , and complete strangers who pledged their support , and made this thing a reality .
Once the project was funded , I still did n’t know if it was going to be a success or not — or even how to judge it as such .
All I had was a backpack , a half - formed itinerary of shoestring travel through a few countries in Asia , and a vague plan to make interactive sketches about the things that impacted me along the way — to try and use experimental computer games as a kind of " travel writing , " whatever that would mean .
The journey turned out to be incredibly challenging — but also incredibly rewarding .
I struggled to fulfill my naïve promise of making computer games from the road while attempting to balance the day - to - day requirements of independent travel ( where I seldom knew where I would be spending the night from one day to the next , much less whether I would have access to the internet ) , but the experiences I had along the way , and the people I met , more than made up for the difficulties .
Hitching a ride with some fishermen on Taiwan ’s east coast ; seeing the Killing Fields of Cambodia with my own eyes ; discussing the merits of Facebook with a college student in the Mekong Delta … these are experiences that I would not trade for anything .
Hitchhiking on Taiwan ’s East Coast .
But still I am left with the question , as the project draws to a close , of whether Gametrekking was a " success . "
On a personal level I can look back and see that my life has been irreversibly enriched by my travels and my coding ; I tried to capture some of the ways in my travel writing .
Which is fine and well , but I do n’t want to conflate the project with the journey ( however hard it is to separate the two in my mind ) : the journey was personal , but the project was funded , and of a corporate nature .
The question is complicated by the fact that I never defined what " success " for Gametrekking would look like , as such .
Partly this was , perhaps , an oversight , but partly it was the nature of the beast : the entire venture has always existed as a kind of " leap of faith , " both for myself , and for my backers — a project of possibility , of seeing what would come of a crazy , uncertain idea .
Does one consider success quantitatively , or qualitatively ?
When I think in terms of quantity , I cannot help but be disappointed : I wish I had a hundred creations to show for my efforts , rather than ten small offerings .
I think of all the failed prototypes , and consider mounting them for display , to create a bigger catalog : I wanted to make something for every country that I traveled through , after all , and if I published my failed experiments , I could get there , and then some .
But I cannot do it , because I cannot see this thing as an attempt to make a flash game for every country in Asia , like some kind of bizarre interactive Lonely Planet collection .
Rather , the games have always been about expressing something personal , for me , even though they are merely sketches and doodles .
And so I struggle more than I should with each one , and throw too many prototypes away , and come back too often empty - handed .
An early prototype for " The Great Moped Balancing Act " , one of many creations I never published .
Still , I can try and point to other numbers in an attempt at vindication : I can say that my Gametrekking creations , while few , have together been played nearly half a million times , that they have appeared on the front page of Newgrounds , been featured in Wired and EGMi , been used for psychology research …
But such claims ring hollow .
If the goal of Gametrekking were big numbers , then making sketchy notgames about the kindness of strangers , or visiting your grandmother ’s tomb , becomes a laughable waste of time .
Slightly more to the point , perhaps , is the " why " behind the figures : the fact that Newgrounds creator Tom Fulp found two of my sketches interesting enough to feature on his front page despite the fact that they are light - years away from the fare his audience is typically expecting , to expose them to something different .
Or the fact that the folks at Extra Credits considered my small notgame " Loneliness " worthy of spearheading two episodes of their show , as a glimpse of something interactive creations should strive for .
Or the fact that Patrick Klepek wrote up " The Killer " for Giant Bomb , because he found it a breath of fresh air in a world of " power fantasy " video games .
This kind of qualitative assessment is a measure of success that I am vaguely interested in .
But we ’re largely still in the land of vainglory .
I enjoy a little spotlight as much as the next person , but I hope it ’s not why I do what I do , and as such , I ’m not willing to accept it as a measure of success .
What ’s left ?
Just the regular people who play my games , and the notes I get from them .
A lot of these are negative .
A lot of them tell me to go do something hateful to myself , because I ’ve wasted somebody ’s time .
But every once in a while I get a message like this one regarding " Freedom Bridge " :
I just registered on this forum to tell you that this was one of the most intense interactive experiences I ’ve ever had .
I went on and watched some short documentaries about Korea afterwards in order to process the tension it had left me with .
Or this one in response to " The Killer " :
I have seldom experienced such raw emotion from a video game .
I have traveled to a few of the places featured in your games and learnt a small proportion of their history in the process .
however , after playing each game I had to research more and more and more .
Thank you for making such simplistic and emotionally provoking games !
Or this one , about " Grandmother " :
Unforgettable .
Simple and stunning .
Kinda reminds you not to forget about the one ’s you ’ve lost .
Or this one , posted on the Newgrounds page for " The Heart Attack " :
Something I ’d like to say … Jordan , your ‘ notgames ’ have done something .
They hack and slash at the curtains we put up to shield ourselves from the ugly truth .
That in reality , evil is decided by the individual .
Among other messages .
This , and your other games have a simple brutality , depressing and dark .
But it ’s also deeply informative and touching .
They ’ve given true insight on the human range of emotions , I ’d say .
I know that these short notgames you create bring out the best in my character .
Make me sad , make me happy and many times , severely upset .
I know I ’ve learned from you , as many others could say they have .
So please , keep on trekking .
I want to learn more .
Or this one , about " Loneliness " :
Thank you for that gaming experience …
I had to get an account JUST so I can thank you for it … somewhere when the dots were slowing down , I said to myself , " I do n’t want to go near them …
I do n’t want them to leave too " and I honestly Cried .
I have never had to set the metaphysical controller down , and take in that level of emotion .
I then realized that the game was called " Loneliness " , and I started to reach back into my own memories of not being able to fit in at school , and then I realized that I needed to try ONE least time .
The same thing happened in Life , and I am currently married to the only Girl that would n’t reject me , in the end of all that loneliness .
I , again , thank you for that wonderful experience .
Thank you …
SO MUCH for this moment of self - reflection .
Or this one on , " Status Quo ’s " Newgrounds page :
Taiwan …
That is my home …!!
Thank you for making such a project about our precious little island .
I really appreciate it .^^
Or this one , in response to " The Kindness of Strangers " :
Wonderful story , it ’s almost surreal .
Being born and raised in the more impoverish parts of the states , the only thing I ’ve ever known from people is deception , greed , and hatred .
I do n’t post these here for a whoop - dee - doo congratulations , or a pat on the back .
I post them to share with you honestly why I consider the Gametrekking project to have been a success .
I post them for those of you who backed my project , and wanted it to come to something .
Ultimately , regardless of how many games I make , I have to ask myself why I ’m making them ; if there ’s not a good reason , I do n’t care if I ’ve made ten or a hundred .
I find the numbers , whether of games , or of plays , to be abstract and meaningless in and of themselves .
Likewise , the front - page mentions and five minutes of fame quickly fade .
It ’s comments like the ones above that keep me going .
At the end of the day I do n’t care about the ratio of negative comments to positive ones : only that the positive ones exist .
In my mind , if my Gametrekking creations got one person to look up the conflict between North and South Korea , got one person to remember their grandmother , got one person to believe that Taiwan ’s a real place , or got one person to reflect on the nature of isolation , then the project was a success .
So I have to consider it a success .
I ca n’t force my definition on anyone else , but I do hope that my backers will agree with me .
It ’s been a wonderful journey , and I thank you all from the bottom of my heart .

25 years of PowerPoint BACK {current} of {total} NEXT
If you have worked in an office in the Western world in the past 25 years , you will probably have sat through a PowerPoint presentation .
But there 's a problem .
They 're often boring , writes presentation expert Max Atkinson .
In the past 25 years , I 've asked hundreds of people how many PowerPoint presentations they 've seen that came across as really inspiring and enthusiastic .
Most struggle to come up with a single example , and the most optimistic answer I 've heard was " two " .
So what are the main problems ?
SCREENS ARE MAGNETS FOR EVERYONE'S EYES
Beware of anyone who says that they 're " just going to talk to some slides " - because that 's exactly what they 'll do - without realising that they 're spending most of their time with their backs to the audience .
Even Barack Obama needs an autocue on occasion
Yet eye contact plays such a fundamental part in holding an audience 's attention that even as brilliant a speaker as Barack Obama depends on an autocue to simulate it .
So remember that the more slides you have and the more there is on each slide , the more distracting it will it be for the audience - whereas the fewer and simpler the slides are , the easier it will be to keep them listening .
READING AND LISTENING DISTRACTS AUDIENCES
If there 's nothing but text on the screen , people will try to read and listen at the same time - and wo n't succeed in doing either very well .
If the print is too small to read , they 'll get irritated at being expected to do the impossible .
Nor does it help when speakers say " as you can see " , or the equally annoying " you probably wo n't be able to read this " .
SLIDES SHOULDN'T JUST BE NOTES
Few speakers are willing to open their mouths until they have their first slide safely in place .
But all too often the slides are verbal crutches for the speaker , not visual aids for the audience .
Some presentations prove somewhat less than gripping Projecting one slide after another might make it look as though you 've prepared the presentation .
But if you have n't planned exactly what you 're going to say , you 'll have to ad lib and , if you start rambling , the audience will switch off .
To avoid this requires careful planning .
Do this before thinking about slides and you wo n't need as many of them - and the ones that you do decide to use are more likely to help to clarify things for the audience , rather than just remind you of what to say next .
INFORMATION OVERLOAD
You think bullet points make information more digestible ?
Think again .
A dozen slides with five bullet points on each assumes that people are mentally capable of taking in a list of 60 points .
If it 's a 30 - minute presentation , that 's a rate of two - per- minute .
This looks a fairly interesting visual aid This highlights the biggest problem with slide - based presentations , which is that speakers mistakenly think that they can get far more information across than is actually possible in a presentation .
At the heart of this is a widespread failure to appreciate that speaking and listening are fundamentally different from writing and reading .
In fact , the invention of writing was arguably the most important landmark in the history of information technology .
Before writing , the amount of information that could be passed on to others was severely limited by what could be communicated in purely oral form ( ie not much ) .
But the ability to write meant that vast amounts of knowledge could be communicated at previously unimagined levels of detail .
The trouble is that PowerPoint makes it so easy to put detailed written and numerical information on slides that it leads presenters into the mistaken belief that all the detail will be successfully transmitted through the air into the brains of the audience .
THE BULLET POINT PROBLEM A Microsoft executive recently said that one of the best PowerPoint presentations he'd ever heard had no slides with bullet points on them .
This did n't surprise me at all , because we 've known for years that audiences do n't much like wordy slides and do n't find them as helpful as pictorial visual aids .
What does surprise me is that so many of the program 's standard templates invite users to produce lists of bullet points , when the program 's main benefits lie in the creation of images .
If more presenters took advantage of that , inspiring PowerPoint presentations might become the norm , rather than the exception .
Max Atkinson is the author of Speech - making & Presentation Made Easy .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I 've made and sat through tons of Powerpoint presentations and I have to admit that even my own can be pretty boring .
To be honest I 've only really used it as a way to illustrate a point or make an audience laugh ( or get there attention halfway through in some other way ) .
This was a trick I learned when I sat in on a presentation by a Microsoft employee back in 1996 , who started his presentation with " It 's Tuesday morning and I 'm hungover , how about you ? " because we'd all been taken on a jolly the night before !
That was the best presentation , the worst was a civil servant who talked us through 30 odd slides of pie charts .
Ouch .
Matt Saunders , Bristol I give school talks ( pupils aged 11 - 18 ) on behalf of various campaign groups and use PPT as the basis of the talk - but I certainly do n't use it in the standard " corporate " way .
To start with , I NEVER use bullet points .
And most of the slides will have just a single image covering the screen , or a sequence of images whilst I 'm talking , or just a few words , and also embedded video clips .
This all helps to really break it up - words , images , video , and I * never * look at the screen ( I 'm supposed to already know what 's on there ! ) , my focus is always on the audience ( it could be a single class or an entire year group ) ...
I get really positive feedback about the presentations because they are definitely not standard PPT .
Make it rich visually and break it up so it's not the same old text thing over and over , and most importantly - know your subject and talk to your audience , do n't read slides .
Richard J Deboo , London
Thank goodness for this article !
I conduct English ' trainings ' ( as they are amusingly called in German ) at SAP , among my other activities .
For years now , I have been trying to persuade people that presentations are not the easy way out when one attempts to inform people about something .
The onus is on the presenter to do the work , not on the PowerPoint slides .
Also , I have told them again and again that ' less is more ' .
' Do n't pack your slides full of text , or complex illustrations ' is another maxim .
Perhaps this article will finally make clear to people that presenting is a much different art than writing an essay .
Many thanks !
D. Fear , Heidelberg , Germany I 'm a student at one of the most " prestigious " technology institutes in my country , and yet , in my 3 years of study , I 've never come across an interesting Powerpoint presentation .
All of my professors , with only one rare exception , try to cram as much text as possible into as few slides as possible .
And most of my colleagues consider that as the norm while preparing slideshows of their own .
Sad .
Ashwin , Chennai , India People use Powerpoint often for the wrong reasons where a quick simple explanation would suffice , it is draw out into death by slide show .
Some do it purely as a way of validating their own importance .
If an organisation is downsizing people grab there Powerpoint slides like a life raft of self worth .
Emma , Talke , Staffs
The main problem with Powerpoint is that it makes the guys in the office think they are suddenly great typists / presenters / orators .
99 % of the time there is no secretarial editing of the content and they all think that what they have to say is absolutely riveting .
It is n't .
Give the boys toys and they will play .
Janey , Yorks UK I read this while avoiding to do a Powerpoint presentation .....

The real problem is that there are just too many presentations in all aspects of life today .
Most of us sit through presentations at work just because it is somebody 's " turn " to talk .
Then what can be said in 2 minutes takes a 15 - minute presentation - not to mention the time consumed in preparing it in the first place .
Have we lost the ability simply to say - your piece , without making a visual representation of it ?
School pupils often use Power Point in projects where the articulate spoken word would be a valued communication skill .
Speech conveys passion that a visual slide presentation could not .
Would Martin Luther King have declared " I have a dream " as effectively in the context of a Power Point illustration ?
Ian Wilkinson , Hitchin I agree in huge part .
But is it really true that creative , uncommon , full of technical tips presentation does n't help listeners with understanding topic and keeping listening ?
Rafa ? , Warsaw , Poland
And now I 'm seeing these hybrid documents that are effectively reports , but in Powerpoint format .
You get these a lot from business consultants .
In reality , they 're too lazy to write a proper report so they stuff a load of text onto an existing presentation as a substitute .
These things do n't work as either presentations or reports .
Dave , Brighton , England Very interesting this critical assessment .
I would encourage the academic community , so eager to use this software every time they have to convey their papers , to read this insightful note .
Andres , Pavia , Italy Problem is , starting in school , and heading through college , and university , doing a talk has always meant 99 % of people reading nervously from a script .
With that kind of education background on presentation skills is it surprising that most presentations are millions of slides from which the presenter reads .
People need to be taught to present with no slides and no notes , perhaps limit them to three diagrams .
Teach the core skills .

Am I the only one to have counted all the words on slide 8 and found it to be a perfectly average slide ?

Thanks for this thought - provoking article .
Powerpoints have infected teaching too , and I 've seen kids eyes glaze over as a result with my early efforts and attempts to bring my lessons into the 21st century .
As suggested in the article , I 'm pleased to say I now use them primarily to show visual images as part of my media and film teaching and agree that the simpler the better .
I tend to reserve the bullet pointed ones for a quick intro to topics which they can print off as handouts to use as revision notes .
There are some truly terrible ones doing the rounds though - the kids are less than complimentary about them , especially when they 've sat through one in every lesson that day ...
Why should kids find Powerpoints any less boring and difficult to take in than staff ?
Elspeth , Helston I could n't agree less .
Max should come and see one of my presentations .
I speak regularly on fin de siecle Viennese art and music , and often have 60 - 90 slides to illustrate my talk , including paintings , music , references , designs and , by the way , text .
It depends how creative one wants to be .
There are some great tools in PowerPoint that enable me to provide a visually interesting talk , usually for 45 - 60 minutes , which almost becomes cinematic or performance in its essence .
Certainly I have never been accused of being boring , nor informational - quite the opposite , in fact .
PowerPoint can be a challenge , but with colour , movement and sound - few fall asleep .
Raymond Coffer , Institute of Germanic and Romance Studies , University of London
The biggest problem I find is the number of people who do Powerpoint karaoke - where they essentially read out the bullet points on the screen .
Thoroughly unhelpful and very boring .
Kirsten , Wandsworth , London
Twenty years ago I gave maybe three seminars a day on computing topics using transparencies .
Several of us noticed that we got the most engagement when we drew pictures as we went along ( despite our drafting skills ) .
Stephen Maudsley , Bristol UK I am not defending rubbish PowerPoints , but reading and listening is easily possible - I am partially deaf and depend on written components of presentations to follow - it is much worse trying to struggle to listen to decipher speech .
TV subtitling is vital for following films and rather than detract from the picture , they help and are easily taken in automatically .
Good summary handouts help but I agree that too many PowerPoint presentations and presenters are rubbish - particularly those with the speaker turning round to read the screen , having impossibly small print and too much on any one screen at once - and no pictures .... etc .
M , Bristol Your point regarding bullet points is plain wrong .
You are assuming that each item in the list is a distinct and separate point .
A good presentation with a half a dozen slides of points should portray half a dozen actual points , the five or so items on each slide should be there as reinforcement or examples .
For instance a single slide may be able considerations taken when planning a project , the main point of the slide is to reaffirm that this action took place and point to a few examples of what was considered , not to go into detail about each consideration .
One slide , one point .
Ieuan , Port Talbot
Any presentation software should only be used as a tool and not relied upon too heavily in presentation situations .
Effective delivery is down to planning , suitable communication techniques and practice .
Do n't produce your presentation in PowerPoint first .
Plan the structure and detail then summarise points on slides , using suitable images and graphics to explain and reinforce your points and use the White - out / Blank - out functions to take attention away from the slides when required .
Frank MacCarthy , London I recently got sent a 80 slide presentation - I looked through the first couple in detail and then skimmed the rest .
It described a proposal for a large piece of work worth £ 26 m .
The author asked me what I thought of it a couple of days later so I had to lie and say it was great .
I spoke to a number of other people about it and all said they 'd either skimmed it or not bothered reading it .
Now the project is going ahead based on the presentation that nobody has read .
Adrian , Telford
The worst Powerpoint presentation I ever sat through was in my second year at University .
It was about the theory of Fascism and lasted two hours without a break .
Plus , it had over 70 slides .
Each slide was packed with information and it was impossible to keep up .
I have never been so bored or learnt less .
Thankfully , the lecturer posted the notes on the university site , so we could actually read them !
Nicola , Manchester
The art of oration is fast becoming a lost art .
The best " presentations " are when someone stands up and talks to you , without the use of aids at all .
Did Winston Churchill or Lloyd George use slides ( I do n't think so ) .
To be able to stand up , command an audience , get your point across and to be memorable and entertaining are things that you rarely see today .
Powerpoint should be illegal - ban it immediately !
Paul Brandwood , Taunton , UK Watch any of Dave Gorman 's presentations to see it done properly .
John Paradise , Devizes , Wiltshire Great article - but you did n't mention clip - art cliches .
If I see one more " detective bending over looking at something with a comedy - size magnifying glass " or " 6 people round a boardroom table having a meeting " , I 'm going to go nuts .

Pictured : Horrific moment wild horse is hit by rally car and catapulted 30ft into the air
This is the horrifying moment a wild horse collided with a rally car , causing the animal to be catapulted nearly 30 feet into the air .
Video of the crash , which happened during the Argentine Rally in South America , yesterday , reveals driver Federico Villagra slamming his Mitsubishi Evo straight into the horse .
The animal , which had wandered onto the dirt track , was seriously injured and had to be put down .
Horror :
The horse was sent flying after it collided with a rally car in Argentina yesterday
Two other horses narrowly avoided striking the car .
Despite the crash , Villagra not only escaped injury , but the incident only cost him 30 seconds of time during the race , according to the Los Andes newspaper in Argentina .
Villagra said : ‘ I was surprised that some horses crossed .
It hit the windscreen and flew over the car . ’

Depression Then , Depression Now
On April 2nd , 2009 , the leaders of the so - called G20 ended their summit in London , UK , with the commitment to inject another $ 1.1 trillion to the veins of the ailing world economy .
About 2/3 of this amount , more than $ 750 billion goes to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) .
This amount will be added to its previous $ 250 billion resources .
Notorious IMF along with its twin usurer the World Bank ( WB ) are the main tools of exporting finance - capital ( industrial capital + monetary industrial capital ) globally .
Stringent conditions attached to the IMF and the WB loans are the leading cause of the current economic meltdown .
These loans have stripped even apparently the most powerful countries of their political independence .
Borrowing countries were exposed to the greedy eyes of the giant international monetary associations .
The IMF and WB ’s insistence on deregulations , free trade agreements and privatization of a country ’s assets and resources made that country defenseless against the neo-liberal policies of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) .
Domestic privatization of a country ’s assets and resources made that country an easy prey for the take - over of the big money , the finance - capital .
Thus selling of domestic private businesses to the giant internationals became much easier , due to the clauses of free trade agreements .
These trades did not need any governmental intervention .
Powerlessness of the domestic legislative bodies due to the deregulations made these deals feasible .
Everything from factories , communication services , housing projects , hospitals , schools , and media , to the lands , waters , and mines were put on auction and sold to the international private sector .
The result was the disappearance of the native industries , agricultures , social services , and even the burgeoning democracies were sacrificed .
To render a free hand to the greedy private sector and under the pretext of fighting budget deficits and saving money , most of the competitive public institutions , hospitals , nursing - homes , schools … were closed by the puppet governments .
Workers and working peoples were laid - off and their workload burdens were put on the shoulders of those who kept their low - paid jobs .
To summarize , the over - all result of the IMF , WB and WTO ’s Neo-liberal policies bankrupted countries , caused rampant unemployment , impoverished peoples and mush - roomed shanty towns .
The exportation of jobs to low - wage countries , the merger of companies and the automation of industries resulted in massive unemployment in the metropoles .
Bankrupted countries cannot pay back their loans , so are jobless people who cannot spend , as they cannot buy and most importantly they cannot pay off their loans and mortgages .
Meanwhile , the greedy finance - capital resorted mostly on the more profitable and convenient business of usury .
Money as a commodity reproduced itself by different exotic names like derivatives , hedge funds , mutual funds and so on .
Central banks printed money to cope with the increasing demand of the money market industry .
Printed money as factitious capital surpassed the amount of real capital .
It is estimated that the amount of these speculative and factitious capital reached to more than $ 500 trillion globally .
Here the question is that if you own this amount of capital , are you able to buy the same amount of goods and services , considering the current real prices ?
The answer is no , because the entire world ’s output is only about $ 66 trillion ( WB , revised 24 April , 2009 ) , thus the remainder or the $ 434 trillion is nothing more than paper printed and electronic created money .
You can burn them up or delete them by a touch of a button , and nothing will happen in the real economy .
Nevertheless this huge amount of capital was not idle and forced its way to the global market by every possible mean : from overt forces , to covert intrigues , through installing puppet regimes or through bribery .
According to the World Bank Institute ( WBI ) ( April 08 , 2004 ) , “ each year more than $ 1 trillion is paid in bribes … these bribes are made worldwide in both rich and developing countries ” .
Bribes are paid to the rulers , influence peddlers and their cronies , for the purpose of creating factitious markets .
And of course by inciting conflicts , tensions and wars to satisfy the ferocious appetite of the Finance - Military Complex .
Bribes have fertilized parasitic security and vigilant paramilitary forces as tools of oppression and subjugation against the pillaged nations .
To stabilize itself as real capital , factitious money found its way through the $ 1 trillion business of producing and trafficking of drugs .
To secure its sphere of influence , this dirty capital laundered itself forcibly and corrupted the systems from the top to the bottom .
As economist William K. Black said , the financial downfall of the US in the wake of Bush years is due to “ the most elite institutions in America engaging in or facilitating fraud ” ( April 3 , 2009 , PBS ’ Bill Moyers Journal ) .
Here is the time to mention that financial downfall is engendered in the flaws of capitalism itself .
For instance , we have witnessed different durations of economic recessions since the Great Depression of 1930s , but many economists comparing the Great Depression of 1930s and this Great Recession believe that , “ this is a depression –sized event . ” ( Voxeu.org . April 6 , 2009 ) .
The current recession officially started since the fall of 2007 with the sliding of the US stock market , and the main culprits were the big monetary associations and first of all the IMF , as explained above .
Yet the IMF is assigned to turn the world economy around and prevent swift fall of this intractable recession into a great depression as the world faced , back then in 1930s .
The Great Depression of 1930s also started with the crash of Wall Street in the fall of 1929 .
The injection of money into the system by the US government temporarily helped the market recover into the April of 1930 .
Then the economy continued it ’s down falling in spite of many positive factors which we lack now in the current situation .
Then in1930s :
In the 1930s , there was nearly an absence of derivatives and powerful hedge funds , the main tools of making money by money and creating a bubble economy .
The existence of bank regulations , depositors ’ protection and governments ’ will to spend in the infrastructure , which took place in response to the Great Depression , as part of President F.D. Roosevelt ’s ( 1933 - 45 ) the New Deal .
The existence of powerful workers unions , which not only pressured the US government to empower the public sector , but also organized the jobless and demanded the government to employ these people in the public sector .
The existence of fewer giant banks , with smaller shares of total market .
Then the famous slogan was : “ What is good for General Motors is good for America . ”
A relatively tame global scene , for the plunderers and exploiters .
Latin America , Africa and most parts of Asia were considered colonies , neo-colonies or backyards of the imperialist and colonialist powers .
Vast countries like India and Indonesia were colonies of the UK and the Netherlands respectively .
Manchuria ( 1931 ) and eastern China ( 1937 ) were occupied by the militarist Japan , and the rest of that country was entangled in a nationalist war , civil war and Revolution .
The Soviet Union was still struggling to cope with the impacts of WWI , the imperialists ’ interventions after the October Revolution , civil wars and post Revolution conflicts .
In the east , both China and Soviet Union were not considered as economic competitors at all .
In the west , in the most Depression stricken continent , many European nations misguided by the capitalists ’ propaganda embraced fascist and authoritarian nationalist regimes .
Miserable European nations blamed each other for their misfortune and as John Reed once wrote about WWI ( 1914 - 1918 ) , “ Nations are ready to fly at each other ’s throat like dogs . ”
They gave the imperialists a blank check to fight for redistributing the world ’s lands and resources at their expenses .
Consequently WWII started in 1937 , and the whole Europe was nearly destroyed , more than 70 million people were killed and millions were disabled during the eight years of war globally .
Parts of Asia and Africa were ruined too .
Untouched directly by the war , U.S. president F.D. Roosevelt ’s New Deal , eased the economic hardship in America , but failed to recover it completely .
Some of the job seekers were sent to the battlefields ; thousands of them were killed or maimed .
The US government commandeered automakers and other industries to make tanks , jeeps , guns and war - planes .
As a result , the unemployed found jobs in the profitable war industry .
With the end of WWII in 1945 , rebuilding of Western Europe started under the Marshall Plan ( 1948 ) .
Cheap European labor , nearly free raw materials extracted from Latin America , Africa and Asia made that rebuilding possible .
Economic recovery heralded the rise of the U.S. as the spearheading imperialist power on the global scene .
Now in 2009 :
Banks alone control $ 200.4 trillion of derivatives , ( Martin D. Weiss , Ph.D. , March 30 , 2009 ) .
According to the 2008 , fourth quarter report by the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) , “ America ’s top five commercial banks control 96 % of the industry ’s total derivatives , while the top 25 control 99.78 % .
In other words , for every $ 100 of derivatives , the mega banks have $ 99.78 … while the rest of the nation ’s 7000 - plus banking institutions control a meager 22 cents . ”
Thanks to the Neo-liberal deregulation policies of the last 25 years , there are no bank regulations .
Unlike F.D. Roosevelt ’s New Deal which preferred and empowered industries over banks , now the reverse is happening .
Central banks and treasuries continue their policy of creating money to bailout ( subsidize ) the failing banks in expense of future generations of tax - payers hard work .
This policy inflates the bubble economy even more forcefully .
That is what was endorsed by the “ G20 ” leaders .
Printing new money to pay the old debts is a Ponzi scheme much bigger than Bernard Madoff ’s swindle .
The absence of influential workers unions .
Unions are now quantitatively and qualitatively weak and submissive .
They become weaker and weaker by the anti-union trends and anti-union regulations both by the public and private sector .
The leading industry in the US is the financial industry , at about 24 % of GDP , or $ 3.36 trillion real capital .
While manufacturing industry is 12 % or $ 1.18 trillion .
Now the slogan has changed to , “ what is good for Wall Street is good for America . ”
On the global scene , more than 2/3 of Latin Americans have chosen an independent and a socialist way of growth .
They are no longer an easy prey for the imperialist and colonialist pillagers .
China has become a world economic power and has signed bilateral economic agreements with the majority of the Latin American , African and Asian countries .
Unlike unilateral , greedy and exploitative pacts of the imperialist powers , China has agreed to import oil and raw materials from these countries and provide them with factories , roads , schools , hospitals , etc , etc. Russia is a main energy exporter , rich and a competitor against imperialism in the global scene .
Russia like China has signed relatively fair economic pacts with many countries around the world .
These agreements mean that when a niche is filled for good in the global theatre , the unfit will die out .
However we are not living in isolated economic islands .
“ Because the world is now so much interconnected and because the banking system is now so big , we face a synchronized downturn in almost all countries …
What we face now could , in fact , be worse than the Great Depression . ” ( Quote from Simon Johnson , ex-chief economist of the IMF , April 04 , 2009 , The Atlantic ) .
Twelve days later , our notorious IMF with so much money in its hands warned that , “ The current global recession is likely to be unusually long and severe , and the recovery sluggish . ” ( BBC News , April 16 , 2009 ) .
Hence the IMF is asking again for more money to deal with this unusually long and severe recession .
As AFP reported on April 26 , 2009 , “ The IMF and WB , have warned that the global economic crisis is turning into a ‘ human calamity ’ and called on members to speed up the pledged aid and give even more to help the most vulnerable . ”
In an unusually Long and Severe Recession , say Depression , the system will not recover with creating factitious money again and again , to be lent to the failing countries , banks , companies and individuals to pay their old debts .
The IMF assignment only postpones the demise of the system .
As we saw , the remaining option to salvage the crumbling capitalism is war .
And , because the economy is so much bigger than what it was in the pre-WWII era , this war must be much bigger .
Except that now the world is saturated with atomic bombs .
Being scientific and believing in the power and ability of the people , another world is possible ; Socialism is already in progress in parts of Latin America .

At the front of the dignitaries gathered to watch Lieutenant Colonel Rupert Thorneloe 's coffin make its slow procession out of the Guards Chapel today , a petite figure in black stood tensely , her hands clenched by her sides .

As the hearse carrying her husband 's body to its final resting place moved away , Sally Thorneloe let out a single gasping sob and closed her eyes , a fleeting break in her perfect composure .
It was a heart - rending reminder that while the death of the most senior officer to be killed in combat since the Falklands has led to national reflection , it was a family tragedy no different from any of the other 183 British losses in Afghanistan .
But this time the tributes from royalty , ministers and generals were personal ones .
Yesterday the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall , former Defence Secretary Des Browne and head of the army General Sir Richard Dannatt were among those at the chapel in Wellington Barracks , London , to bid farewell to a man described as " an inspirational leader " , the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards , who was killed alongside Trooper Joshua Hammond when the Viking they were travelling in was hit by an explosion near Lashkar Gah .
Paying tribute to the 39 - year - old father - of - two during yesterday 's service , Colonel Sandy Malcolm said : " Missing from today are his soldiers , currently in the midst of a fierce and important operation .
Six , including Rupert , have made the ultimate sacrifice and others have been wounded .
It is late afternoon in Afghanistan , the sun will soon set and Welsh Guardsmen will stand to across the Helmand valley .
They will know we too are gathered in this chapel and he will soon be laid to rest . "

Several Youtube videos were posted of this interview , and one of them has generated 72,807 hits in one day .
That video , and Michael Sheuer 's statement can be found here .
Jon Stewart flat out destroyed Beck and Sheuer for this , and I would hope you do the same , Keith .
A big tip of the hat to SuperBowlXX for teaching me how to embed Comedy Central video
Quote Jon Stewart
" Is there any way you can YELL LOUD ENOUGH at your TV for the people inside to hear you , because I tried real hard last night . "
You heard it here folks , Jon Stewart just gave his full endorsement for YELLING LOUDER !
Of course , yelling does n't accomplish anything .
Action does .
If you want to contact Fox News , Glenn Beck , or the DHS or FCC , contact information is provided below .
Of course , this is the video and quote that I take issue with .
At :24 seconds into this video Scheuer : " The only chance we have as a country right now is for Osama bin Laden to deploy and detonate a major weapon in the United States .
Because it 's going to take a grassroots , bottom up pressure , because these politicians prize their office , prize the praise of the media and the Europeans .
It 's an absurd situation , again .
Only Osama can execute an attack that will force Americans to demand a government protect them effectively , consistently and with as much violence as necessary . "
This statement does not only deserve a Worst Person in the World , it deserves a full Special Comment and an in - depth report on who said this , who allowed it to be said and why it is such a despicable thing to even think .
The memo that is being formed is so simple even a climate change denier can figure it out .
Obama is making us less safe
When a terrorist attack happens Republicans will say " Told you so "
And while that train of thought in and of itself is despicable it does n't hold a candle to the idea proposed by Mr. Sheuer , which seems to be .
Obama is MORE DANGEROUS than Osama bin Laden
If OBL attacks Americans will stop supporting President Obama and the Democrats , and once Republicans are re-elected to power because of the fear of the public , we can go back to hunting Osama GOP style for the obvious good of all .
After 6 months of proposing every Conspiracy Theory possible about President Barack Obama in order to quell his popularity , from The B girl , to paling around with terrorists , to the birth certificate nonsense , to socialism , fascism , racism , reverse - racism and whatever new lie that Fox News can invent on the spot with help from the GOP and claim as actual news , one would wonder why a certain small percentage of the population would rather go protest how Democracy works on the 4th of July rather than celebrate their independance , but that is neither here nor there .
The purpose Fox News has is to hold a four year long swiftboat campaign to sink the Democratic party , and it does n't matter what they must say or do in order to achieve this .
Of course , Glenn beck has already had the opportunity to stand up and condemn this terrible statement since he was sitting right next to the person who said it , but that would require an adult brain which Glenn Beck obviously lacks .
If Glenn Beck was the great patriot and defender of liberty that he claims to be he would have leapt out of his chair and said something in defense of the thousands of American lives that would be lost in another massive attack by Osama bin Laden .
Micheal Sheuer , after saying that America needed a massive attack in order to be saved , issued a lame half apology on washingtonindependant.com where no one will probably see it , and Fox News did n't even do that .
Rather , they just moved along to their next crime against journalism in their effort to create a more violent , partisan and uneducated world .
Glenn Beck , of course , did not object to this statement when it was spoken or on his program the next day .
Instead , Glenn gave us all that glazed eye big smile that shows he does n't know what is really going on , but he is certain of what he would like to think it is .
I do not know if Glenn is aware of what was said in his presence or how truly disgusting a statement it was , but that does not matter , because the person who made that statement shares Glenn 's sick view that the world is coming to an end , and as long as you agree with the Conservatives in principle they do n't care what you do or say , as long as it makes Conservatives look right .
As Michael Sheuer went about mentally sacrificing thousands of innocent Americans so that we might be safer from the perceived evil here in America ( re : the RW view of President Obama and the Democratic Party ) , Glenn Beck just sat there like a bobblehead doll who has obviously let the important facts go over his head while Michael Sheuer basically hoped out loud for the deaths of American citizens so that a more violent , security orientated America could be imposed upon our nation .
I will allow others to interpret for themselves what meaning Mr. Sheuer was trying to convey when he called for " a government ( that ) protect (s ) them effectively , consistently and with as much violence as necessary . "
This horrible statement made on Fox News airwaves should not be allowed to disappear into the fog of the 24 hour news cycle .
Fox News and the Republican party should be taken to task on this , and we should demand that they disavow this terrible and traitorous statement .
Just imagine the roar from the Conservative media if a Democrat or Liberal has said
" I hope Osama bin Laden attacks America so President Obama can reap the public support that President Bush enjoyed after 9/11 "
It Does Count If You Are A Republican .
Whether the Republicans want to live in reality or not is not my problem .
Once they start wishing out loud for terrorist attacks to stop the Democratically President of America it becomes everyone 's problem .
To Glenn Beck , who loves our founding fathers so without clearly understanding why , I submit this quote from Benjamin Franklin .
" Those who sacrifice freedom for safety deserve neither . "
And to Michael Sheuer , you 're apology is pathetic .
Why do n't you go back on Glenn Beck 's show and really apologize ?
Hopefully , the rest of the media , as well as the rest of the nation which you would so gladly sacrifice will have called you to task before then .

This week the latest news in the Digital Britain debate caused a wave of protests as it was revealed the government is considering disconnecting Internet users on allegations of copyright infringement .
Torrent Freak caught up with a British independent film company to gauge their response to the news .
Monaghan Media is an independent film company from Manchester , England .
They produce films , shorts and other media .
They also assist others in the industry by developing ideas and offering production advice and are currently providing graphics for our very own TorrentFreak TV .
James Monaghan from the company has recently taken part in the BERR consultation on file - sharing so has been watching this week ’s developments closely .
The government has set a deadline for responses to its plans ( which include disconnecting alleged file - sharers from the Internet ) of 29th September and , like many others , James has responded to the new statement by sending his thoughts in to the consultation .
His feelings will resonate with many Torrent Freak readers .
Here they are in full ;
Monaghan Media Response To Latest BERR Statement
There are an estimated 7 million file - sharers ( your figures ) in the UK , and you want to reduce that number by 70 % .
70 % is 4.9 million .
A fair trial is fundamental to democracy .
To fairly prosecute 4.9 million citizens is an optimistic suggestion when currently Her Majesty ’s Court System holds 200,000 criminal cases per year .
This would suggest it is going to take 25 years to reduce file - sharing by 70 % .
This is only dealing with the 70 % of today ’s file - sharing with no regard to the expected increase of file - sharing .
Research suggests that the number of file - sharers increases every day , 63 % of people aged 14 - 24 now admit file - sharing , with 83 % of those file - sharing every day .
To prosecute 4.9 million people you will also need evidence .
No evidence exists .
Anywhere .
The ‘ evidence ’ championed by the failing sector of the media industry – the physical distribution sector – has been proven time and time again to be incredibly flawed .
I refer here to the elderly couple who the copyright industry began legal proceedings against for downloading hardcore gay nazi pornographic film ‘ Army Fuckers ’ ( 1 ) among others .
I also refer to the law firm Davenport - Lyons , who sent out 15,000 letters telling people to pay a small ‘ fine ’ ( usually about £ 600 ) and they ’d make a lawsuit against them ( for file - sharing ) go away .
This is what is known as ‘ extortion ’ .
Luckily for the consumers , and all of those of us who enjoy freedom from criminals , Davenport - Lyons were quickly picked up by BBC ’s Watchdog program , and promptly disappeared .
I note though , that in today ’s ( 25th August 2009 ) response , you do n’t mention a fair trial .
In fact you do n’t mention any opportunity for those accused with this flawed and faulty evidence to defend themselves .
Which rather gives the impression that there will be no opportunity for the accused to defend themselves .
What you do say is this :
“ … the previous proposals , whilst robust , would take an unacceptable amount of time to complete in a situation that calls for urgent action … ”
So what you ’ve stated , is that it is impossible for your draconian anti-file - sharing measures to be implemented fairly .
Which is correct .
What this means , is that this route of anti-file - sharing legislation , the ‘ criminalise - 7 - million - of - your - citizens ’ route is wholly unfeasible , impossible to implement without massive cost to the tax - payer , and impossible to implement without massive damage to the progress of the UK ’s creative industries .
What this does not mean is that instead of fair trials and the assumption that the accused are innocent until proven guilty , everyone should be presumed guilty until they are proven innocent .
This is perverse as the accused would not then have the opportunity to be proven innocent .
In my previous contribution to this consultation , I briefly touched upon the fact that the industry has never been able to show any loss , financial or otherwise , has been caused by file - sharing .
I ’ve gone into a little more detail here , which shows , with numbers , evidence , and references , ( rather than the usual hearsay provided by the industry ) to show that there is n’t a financial loss to any of the most downloaded films this year ( so far ) .
You ’ll note that all of the top ten most downloaded films so far this year ( 3 ) are all incredible commercial successes , each making hundreds of millions of pounds .
Watchmen , the most downloaded film with 16.9 million illegal downloads , still made $ 185,248,060 .
How can anyone argue that file - sharing has caused it a financial loss ?
Benjamin Button was the second most downloaded film so far , being downloaded 13.1 million times illegally .
It made $ 332,860,689 .
A financial loss ?
I think not .
What we are seeing here , is the end of one type of business : the physical distribution of digital products .
We are in a world where DVDs are old technology , in less than ten years Blu-ray disks will go the same way as LPs , as tape cassettes , as VHS tapes , and as DVDs .
The internet however , has outlived the DVD .
And it will outlive the Blu-ray disk .
And it will outlive whatever format ‘ succeeds ’ the Blu-ray disk .
The internet is here to stay .
What we are seeing in the Creative Industry is a very small sector ( distribution ) , which makes massive money from a system which is made redundant by the internet .
It is not the responsibility of the government , of the ISPs to prop up a failing business .
If a business is failing , it is the responsibility of that business to look at itself , at its actions and rethink its operations in order to save itself .
It is wholly unfeasible to enforce any rule against filesharers , and impossible , literally impossible to enforce according to law .
I reiterate the statement I made in my first contribution to this consultation , the majority of my audiences watch my films over the BitTorrent system , a system so revolutionarily brilliant that it means I , an independent film - maker , can distribute a film in full High Definition to hundreds of millions of viewers with absolutely no cost incurred to me , where normally global film distribution costs several tens of millions of pounds .
I think it is acceptable to say then , that my company and I are at the forefront of the industry .
As someone who uses file - sharing systems , not only to gain access to media which I never could ’ve before , but also to distribute my own contributions to the UK ’s Creative Industry , I am utterly shocked and appalled by the lengths to which your government will go to make my audiences , my peers and myself criminals .
This is not the end of the creative industry .
I can say this with great confidence , as someone working in the industry .
The industry is currently undergoing a change , a natural change , a change that it must undergo .
Although this is not the end of the creative industry , it is the end of a disgusting sector of the industry which has been a parasite on the industry for the past half - century , milking it for as much money as it can , promoting false inflation of the rest of the industry only to increase its own profits .
The criminals here are not the teenagers downloading films and music , but the global corporations that extort money from artists and consumers alike , and who operate in a manner not unfamiliar with sinister global criminal networks .
It is the remit of democratically elected Government to protect the citizens , film - makers , and business - owners from the failing business model which threatens freedom , civil liberty , and creative business ’ economic future .
Finally , I take this quote from your statement today :
“ … As ever we would need to ensure any such measure fully complied with both UK and EU legislation … ”
Disconnecting people from the internet does not fully comply with EU legislation .
In fact it directly contravenes EU legislation .
I am referring to amendment 138/46 which was adopted on the 6th May 2009 in response to French attempts to implement a system almost exactly the same as the one proposed here .
A system which was declared unconstitutional by the French High Court .
You will be aware that amendment 138/46 declared that access to the internet was a fundamental human right .
Not only do your proposals directly contravene European Law , but the certainty of wrongful sanctions being taken against citizens opens the government up to legal action .
The fact that cutting off an entire household ’s internet punishes everyone in that household and not just the ‘ accused file - sharer ’ is near - certain to breach the government ’s ‘ Every Child Matters ’ directive where children are punished for others ’ actions .
The probability of cutting off the internet of those who need the internet to survive , the long - term sick , for example , or the disabled , further opens up the government to attack .
Is this the route that my government wants to pursue ?
Or should the government perhaps listen to its ’ citizens ’ outrage and stop neglecting them in favour of the power and massive wealth offered by the global corporations who ’s only motivation is furthering said power and wealth ?
Yours faithfully ,

Stepping through the Caribbean surf in a blue bikini , Kelly Brook is all smiles .
And according to a friend , the never knowingly under exposed 29 - year - old model and TV presenter has every reason to be cheerful .
Contrary to weekend claims , her relationship with England rugby star Danny Cipriani , 21 , is still going strong .
Miss Brook is currently holidaying with her mother and a source suggested that her friendship with Cipriani had cooled .
But a friend said last night : ' Things are fine between Kelly and Danny .
' She 's been away in Los Angeles for some time and is now on holiday .
Danny has his rugby duties so he can't just up sticks and go with her .
They 've never formally lived together - they still have separate homes - so it's no great shock that Danny 's not living at Kelly 's house while she 's away .
' They might not see each other as much as they 'd like to , but they certainly have n't split up .
' The couple were first pictured together just over six months ago , a few weeks after Miss Brook split from her American actor boyfriend Billy Zane , 43 .
While I like and use Facebook and Twitter , there ’s enough hype and abuse of words like innovation , transformation and revolution around all things social media that a critique is warranted .
I hope this post is used whenever someone feels they ’re being sold something phony or that makes little sense and wants a skeptical opinion to calibrate where the truth is .
For starters : social media is a shallow term .
Is there any anti-social media out there ?
Of course not .
All media , by definition , is social in some way .
The term interactive media , a more accurate term for what ’s going on , lived out its own rise / hype / boom cycle years ago and was smartly ignored this time around – first rule of PR is never re-use a dead buzzword , even if all that you have left are stupid ones .
I ’ve participated in stupid terms , from push - technology to parental - controls , so I should know when I see one .
That said , here ’s some points not made often enough :
We have always had social networks .
Call them families , tribes , clubs , cliques or even towns , cities and nations .
You could call throwing a party or telling stories by a fire “ social media tools ” .
If anything has happened recently it ’s not the birth of social networks , it ’s the popularity of digital tools for social networks , which is something different .
These tools may improve how we relate to each other , but at best it will improve upon something we as a species have always done .
Never forget social networks are old .
The best tools will come from people who recognize , and learn from , the rich 10,000 + year history of social networks .
( Read the Excellent Writing On The Wall : The First 2000 Years of Social Media ) .
There has always been word of mouth , back - channel , “ authentic ” media tools .
In Gladatorial Rome , in Shakespearean England and in Revolutionary America , motivated individuals had ways to express their ideas and share them .
Call it gossip , poems , paintings or pamphlets , there is a long history of individuals taking action to express opinions through non-official channels .
The ease of using these channels changes over time , but they always exist because # 1 always exists .
Of note , IRC predates some , but certainly not all , of the features twitter is heralded for introducing to the world .
The new media does not necessarily destroy the old .
TV was supposed to kill radio – this was wrong .
TV forced radio to change and in some ways improve .
The web forced TV , newspapers and magazines to change , and they will likely survive forever in some form , focusing on things the web can not do well .
Its unusual for new thing to completely replace the old ones and when they do it takes years .
Anyone who claims social media will eliminate standard PR or mass media is engaging in hype , as odds are better those things will change and learn , but never die .
It ’s wise to ask what each kind of media / marketing is good and bad for and work from there .
Social media consultants writing about social media have inherent biases .
It ’s difficult to take posts like this about social media seriously , as it ’s written by someone from a social media consulting firm without an ounce of humility or perspective .
It ’s hard to come across as authentic if you promote a revolution that you personally stand to benefit the most from .
Much writing about social media is PR people writing about the importance of PR – see a problem of authenticity here ?
When did PR , like advertisers , become a reliable source for what is authentic ?
How is SEO optimization , or similiar techniques for twitter , authentic ?
When a system becomes popular the greedy will game it and social media is no different .
We should be worried when people with PR and advertising backgrounds or consulting firms are leading us in the ways of authenticity or integrity .
The Twitter Book , from my publisher O’Reilly , takes a surprisingly reasonable , authentic and low - hype approach to social media I wish was more popular .
Signal to Noise is always the problem .
I ’m someone who would rather read 5 or 10 really good things every day , than skim through 50 or 100 mediocre ones .
I find much of social media activity consists of people re-forwarding things they were forwarded that almost none of them appear to have read , as they believe they are rewarded for publishing frequently above all else .
Using twitter , facebook or nearly any social media service I often feel I ’m in the minority since what ’s popular is rarely what ’s good .
If you are interested in quality , and not volume , then the size of your network matters less than the value of what or who is in it .
I ’m more fascinated by how kottke.org and metafilter.org have kept such high signal to noise ratios for years than I am about most media tools I see .
All technologies cut both ways and social media will be no different .
For all the upsides of any invention there are downsides and it takes time to sort out what they all are .
Blogs and Twitter have made self promotion , and self - aggrandizement , acceptable in ways I ’ve never seen before , and I ’m guilty myself .
Is it possible to write or publish without self promotion ?
I do n’t know anymore .
I suspect digital tools for social media may have the negative effect of making authentic communication harder , not easier to find , as more people , and corporations , hover right on the gray dividing line between authentic and corporate , or selfish and generous .
Be suspicious of technologies claimed to change the world .
The problem with the world is rarely the lack of technologies , the problem is us .
Look , we have trouble following brain dead simple concepts like The Golden Rule .
Millions starve to death not because we lack the food , but because of greed and lack of political will .
We will largely behave like idiots on blogs and on twitter because we behave that way in real life .
Every technological revolution must contend with the fact that we bring our stupidity , selfishness and arrogance along for the ride with our generosity , wisdom and love ( 12 for12k.org being a great positive example ) .
This is true for any new technology we use , and invariably it ’s this fact that plays itself out and ruins the current technological wave , setting up the frustrated landscape for the next one .
Democracy , steam power , electricity , telegraphs , telephones , televisions , the Internet , and the web have all been heralded as the arrival of Utopia , and although there has been progress in each wave , it seems there are things we want that technological change can not bring to us .
Always ask “ What problem am I trying to solve ? ”
The smartest thing to do with something new is to ask what is it you need it to do for you .
Recognize good marketing will not make up for bad products or incompetent services .
If your company is marketing itself well to customers , or your social life is fine , perhaps you do n’t need a revolution and need something much simpler and more realistic from social media .
Spend time figuring out what you need .
If you want to experiment and see for yourself , that ’s awesome , but know that ’s what you ’re doing .
But above all use whatever media / communication tools or methods work for you , whether they are old or new , no matter what anyone says , including me .

Update : @jmichelle posted a response , In defense of social media , on O’Reilly Radar .
I responded in the comments .
Update , part 2 : six months later , here ’s a follow up post : twitter reconsidered .
Update , part 3 : A video of me presenting on this topic at Seattle Social Media club ( slides ) :
Having failed in their attempt to inject religion into science education , Texas conservatives have shifted their attention to the state 's elementary school social studies curriculum .
According to some , school children need no longer learn about national figures such as George Washington and Abraham Licoln or Texas leaders like Stephen F. Austin .
Other public figures , Cesar Chavez and Thurgood Marshall for example , too could be excluded from the study material .
According to the right wingers , the former is an " unworthy role model " for young school children and the latter 's life story and influence are deemed " inappropriate . "
Instead , they would like to emphasize the role of Christianity in founding America and formulating Texas history .
I suppose if you can't indocrinate older children with faith based science , it is far simpler to catch them young by way of revisionist history .
Cesar Chavez ?
Not worthy of his role - model status .
Christianity ?
Emphasize its importance .
Such suggestions are part of efforts to rewrite history books for the state 's schoolchildren , producing some expert recommendations that are sure to inflame Texans , no matter their political leanings .
The State Board of Education expects to start discussing new social studies curriculum standards this week , with members of the public getting their first opportunity to speak this fall and a final board vote next spring .
The process is a long one with lasting impact : reshaping the social studies curriculum , including history , for 4.7 million Texas public school children .
“ This is something that every parent would want to be paying attention to .
This will determine whether or not the kids get the education needed to succeed in college and jobs in the future , ” said Dan Quinn of the Austin - based Texas Freedom Network .
“ If we are going to politicize our kids ' education , that will put our kids behind other kids when they 're competing for college and good - paying jobs on down the road . ”
Curriculum standards are updated about every 10 years ; the last social studies update came in 1997 .
According to a preliminary draft of the new proposed standards , biographies of George Washington , Abraham Lincoln , and Stephen F. Austin have been removed from the early grades , said Brooke Terry of the Texas Public Policy Foundation .
The early draft , which is likely to change multiple times in the coming months , also removes Independence Day , Veterans ' Day , and anthems and mottos for both Texas and the United States in a section on holidays , customs and celebrations , she said .

U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner testifies before a House Financial services committee hearing on Regulatory Perspectives on the Obama Administration 's Financial Regulatory Reform Proposals on Capitol Hill in Washington in this file photo from July 24 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Yuri Gripas
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner formally requested that Congress raise the $ 12.1 trillion ( 7.25 trillion pound ) statutory debt limit on Friday , saying that it could be breached as early as mid-October .
“ It is critically important that Congress act before the limit is reached so that citizens and investors here and around the world can remain confident that the United States will always meet its obligations , ” Geithner said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid that was obtained by Reuters .
A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment on the letter .
Treasury officials earlier this week said that the debt limit , last raised in February when the $ 787 billion economic stimulus legislation was passed , would be hit sometime in the October - December quarter .
Geithner ’s letter said the breach could be two weeks into that period , just as the 2010 fiscal year is getting underway .
The latest request comes as the Treasury is ramping up borrowing to unprecedented levels to fund stimulus and financial bailout programs and cope with a deep recession that has devastated tax revenues .
It is expected to issue net new debt of as much as $ 2 trillion in the 2009 fiscal year ended September 30 and up to $ 1.6 trillion in the 2010 fiscal year , according to bond dealer forecasts .
The request to increase the debt limit will likely raise the ire of Republicans who have accused President Barack Obama of runaway spending .
They may try to hold up the legislation in effort to win concessions on Obama ’s health care reform plan .
Geithner urged Reid to not let politics hamper U.S. credit - worthiness and said he looked forward to working with the Nevada Democrat to secure enactment of legislation on the debt limit as early as possible .
“ Congress has never failed to raise the debt limit when necessary .
Because members of both parties have long recognized the need to keep politics away from this issue , these actions have traditionally received bipartisan support , ” he wrote .
“ This is clearly a moment in our history that calls for continuation of that tradition . ”

We look forward to seeing him .
There are few anecdotes about him , and pictures , at least ones that have appeared in public , are scarce .
But Mojtaba Khamenei , the son of Iran ’s supreme leader , wields considerable power and is a key figure in orchestrating the crackdown against anti-government protesters , analysts say .
The younger Khamenei operates tucked behind an elaborate security structure , an overlapping world that stretches from Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard corps to the motorcycle - riding Basiji militiamen .
Analysts and former dissidents describe him as the gatekeeper for his father , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , a reclusive son whose political instincts were sharpened in a post - revolutionary Iran where affiliations with security and intelligence services were just as important as Islamic ideology .
The anxiety in the streets of Tehran today goes deeper than the outrage over the June 12 election that authorities say was won by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad -- it is the newest round in a struggle between hard - liners and reformists that began more than 20 years ago over the legacy of the 1979 Islamic Revolution .

And at the center , or at least very close to it , is Mojtaba Khamenei .
Analysts say the ultraconservative cleric is being positioned to succeed his father but would face tough opposition .
Revered figures of the Islamic Revolution such as Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Hossein Ali Montazeri years ago deemed the senior Khamenei ’s religious and political resumes insufficient for him to succeed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini when he died 20 years ago .
However , they found themselves outflanked .
Ali Khamenei gradually has created a bureaucracy to consolidate his power over Iran ’s military , intelligence and foreign policy .
The younger Khamenei , who is believed to be in his 40s or early 50s , working deep inside a political system that is difficult for outsiders to crack , has emerged as a force in that bureaucracy .
Mojtaba Khamenei ’s influence became evident when he gave key support to Ahmadinejad in the 2005 presidential election .
Ahmadinejad , who analysts say shares the messianic rhetoric and Islamic fervor of the younger Khamenei , unexpectedly defeated two leading conservative candidates as well as Rafsanjani .
The Khameneis are now backing Ahmadinejad against Mir-Hossein Mousavi , the opposition leader who says the June 12 election was fraudulent and should be annulled .

The Guardian Council , which oversees the electoral process , has said the outcome will stand but also announced that it will continue to investigate the disputed vote count through Monday .
The street protests and violence that erupted over the last week -- state news media have reported that 10 to 19 people have died -- were in part the result of a crackdown by forces close to Mojtaba Khamanei .
“ This coup taking place is a political liquidation against the old guard by reckless people like Mojtaba and Ahmadinejad , ” said Mehdi Khalaji , an expert on Iran with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
“ But I do n’t think they will win .
Power that relies only on the military and does n’t care about social or religious institutions cannot last long . ”
Mojtaba Khamenei is a secretive man who does n’t want to “ be on people ’s tongues , ” said Mohsen Sazegara , an Iranian journalist and former government official whose reformist views led to his brief imprisonment in 2003 .
“ Nobody knows much about him . ”
The younger Khamenei is the “ most influential person in his father ’s court , ” said Ali Afshari , a dissident and reformist who spent three years in jail for running pro-democracy programs .
“ The question is , what happens when his father is gone ?
Mojtaba needs to hold on to the security apparatus . ”
Advertisement
Khalaji , who studied in Iran ’s holy city of Qom , said Mojtaba Khamenei “ was raised in a house surrounded by intelligence services .
He does n’t have [ prominent ] clerical credentials , despite the fact that he wears robes and a clerical uniform . ”
He added that the son ’s background is much different from his father ’s .
The supreme leader , in his younger years , immersed himself in literature , novels and music , was friends with intellectuals and spent time in jail with Marxists .
The younger Khamenei , said Khalaji , “ grew up in a very different atmosphere , a post - revolutionary generation . ”
Much of that generation is not grounded in the personalities and passions that underpinned the 1979 revolt .
Analysts say Mojtaba Khamenei lacks the religious and political stature to overcome the opposition he would face in the Assembly of Experts , the body charged with selecting the supreme leader .
His 69 - year - old father is believed to have influence over about half of the assembly ’s 86 seats , but the board is headed by Rafsanjani and includes other reformists who probably would block a bid by the younger Khamenei to succeed his father .
Advertisement
The power struggle that spilled out into the streets after the election may affect how important clerics view the younger Khamenei , and his chances of succeeding his father .
So far , the ayatollahs in Qom have been relatively quiet over the contested election and the demonstrations .
But that could change if Ahmadinejad and the supreme leader press on with harsh police tactics .
“ Neither Ayatollah Ali Khamenei nor Ahmadinejad are popular in Qom , ” Ali Ansari , the head of Iranian studies at St. Andrews University in Scotland , wrote in the newspaper the Observer .
He added that Ahmadinejad is “ regarded with contempt by most senior clerics , while Khamenei has never been accepted as a scholar of note .
The clerics may bide their time , but their intervention , which may come sooner rather than later , especially if violence spreads , could be decisive . ”
Such a scenario would reduce Mojtaba Khamenei ’s prospects of rising to supreme leader .
Advertisement
“ Mojtaba ’s hands are well into the [ Revolutionary Guard ] hierarchy , ” said Said Idriss , an Iranian expert with Cairo ’s Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies .
“ Like all conservatives , he is keen not to let any reformers reach power because then many questions will be raised regarding the financial management of the country and the billions of dollars conservatives use to support their regional political agenda .
“ But I do n’t agree that [ the younger Khamenei ] is the figure behind his father ’s strong support for Ahmadinejad because even if Ahmadinejad is restored , it will not be easy for Khamenei to one day unveil his son as the new supreme leader . ”
Mojtaba Khamenei is not the only son of a supreme leader to have had political ambitions .
Ahmad Khomeini , Khomeini ’s son and chief of staff in the 1980s , was often regarded as a favored choice to become president .
But after Khomeini ’s death in 1989 , his son lost a power struggle with Rafsanjani , then speaker of parliament .
Rafsanjani was elected president , and Ahmad Khomeini was named to the Supreme National Security Council and became caretaker of his father ’s mausoleum .

We BlackBerry owners who have iPhone envy know that there 's never a worse time to be sitting next to an iPhone user than in a waiting room .
You 're sitting there , choosing between rereading e-mail on your BlackBerry or flipping through Westways Magazine ( yawn ) .
Meanwhile , the guy next to you is playing his iPhone like a flute , sending pictures to strangers in the waiting room and figuring out just what hellacious music they 're listening to with his Shazam app .
Makes you wonder :
Why can't your BlackBerry do that ?
It 's all about the apps .
Sure , Apple is gaining market share .
And sure , more consumers are buying iPhones than BlackBerrys these days .
But there are still a lot more Research in Motion smartphones out there than Apple ones , and the BlackBerry is n't just for businesspeople anymore .
What makes the BlackBerry most vulnerable is its lack of cool applications .
Apple 's App Store is jam - packed with 15,000 of them ; iPhone and iPod Touch users have downloaded more than half a billion apps .
There 's a Google Android App Store , and the T - Mobile G1 phone that runs Android comes pre-loaded with a nifty anagram app , perfect for honing your Scrabble skills .
What 's RIM got to offer ?
I asked the company where BlackBerry users might be able to find some free or cheap iPhone - like apps these days .
Its reps sent me to two websites , Built for BlackBerry and BlackBerry Solutions Catalog .
The former , which seems to have more choices , showcases free favorites such as Facebook , MySpace and Flickr apps for the Blackberry .
But the games category was lacking : Wheel of Fortune , Magic 8 Ball and Guitar Hero cost $ 6.99 and up .
The only thing I could find for free was a trial version of UNO that ran out after a few weeks .
There was definitely no cool free Blackberry app like Ocarina that lets you play " Joy to the World " while blowing into your phone .
Tyler Lessard , director of alliances at RIM , defended the company by saying that the amount of apps available for BlackBerry is growing .
And apps launched at the Consumer Electronics Show , such as the Slacker mobile music service , SlingPlayer Mobile and Unify4 Life AV / Shadow , have proved popular .
" There are thousands of applications available for the BlackBerry platform , and some of the most successful ones are free , " he wrote in an e-mail .
MySpace for BlackBerry , he said , had over a million downloads in its first week .
RIM plans to soon debut a storefront where users can see all the Blackberry apps in one place , he said ..
But in terms of new apps , RIM probably wo n't be able to match Apple ...

This is the first in a series of tropical forest policy commentaries John - O Niles will be writing for Mongabay.com leading up to the December U.N. climate meeting in Copenhagen .
John -O is the Director of the Tropical Forest Group .
In late 1991 , I had just finished my undergraduate degree in forest economics at the University of Vermont .
The Rio Earth Summit was approaching and everyone seemed to be wearing “ Save the Rainforest ” T - shirts .
So , being 22 years old and green in more ways than one , I decided to hitchhike across Africa and see the rainforest myself .
After a summer working in an Alaska salmon cannery to save some money and thumbing my way back across America in station wagons and 18 wheelers , I grabbed a $ 199 one - way flight to Spain .
I crossed the Strait of Gibraltar on a ferry and proceeded to get solidly conned my first night in Morocco by one of Tangiers ’ world - famous touts .
I then got sick in the Sahara and stranded during a coup in Algeria .
I stayed with a one - eyed farmer ( Jo - Man ) in Niger , and floated down the Niger River into northwestern Nigeria on a pirogue .
I wandered around the notoriously difficult nation for a few weeks and then headed southeast to make my way into Cameroon .
In Cameroon , I knew , I could see some real rainforests .
While phoning home from Calabar , Nigeria , to my distraught mother ( I had n’t contacted her in months and she had called the State Department to report me missing ) , I ran into Liza Gadsby .
Liza and her partner , Peter Jenkins , run Pandrillus , an excellent primate and forest non-profit working in southeast Nigeria and southwest Cameroon .
They invited me to stay at their “ ranch ” to help care for orphaned chimpanzees and drill monkeys .
After several months on my own in Africa and having lost 20 pounds , looking after cute young chimpanzees and eating real food ( Liza is a great cook ) was a refreshing and welcome opportunity .
John - O in the Afi Mountains in 1992 .
Peter and Liza fed me enough hearty dinners to restore some weight .
In exchange I diapered sick and remarkably manipulative young chimpanzees and hand - fed palm - size infant drills that looked like miniature aliens .
All the primates cared for by Pandrillus , orphans of the bushmeat trade , get medical care and live with same - species friends in enormous enclosures .
After a few weeks of rest and volunteering , I decided to leave my simian friends and continue my jaunt through Africa .
Peter and Liza suggested that if I wanted to see a rainforest , I should go to the Afi Mountains , a few hours ’ drive north .
The Afi Mountains marked a major frontier of deforestation .
To the west there were few forests left ; most had been cut to feed Nigeria ’s growing rural population .
To the east , toward Cameroon , there were still plenty of forests , though they too were being exploited fast .
Nigeria ’s Afi Mountains had key outposts of chimpanzee , gorilla , and elusive drill monkey populations .
I caught a lift to the village of Buanchor , a relatively remote village of the Boki tribe .
Buanchor , nestled under the Afi mountains , was a colorful and rowdy town , with dozens of chiefs , all whom wore red hats .

The next morning , having hired guides and met some of Buanchor ’s chiefs , I journeyed into my first rainforest .
I had n’t taken more than a few steps into the forest when I stopped , threw off my pack , and then just plain threw up .
Months of dysentery and amoebas , some palm wine the night before and a breakfast of fried yams and kola nuts took their toll .
The guides were clearly curious about this hairy white guy losing his guts within minutes of what was to be a several - day excursion .
Despite my flawed first yards in a rainforest , after a few days of trekking around the majestic and primitive mountains , I was hooked .
The rainforest was disorienting , amazing , and completely wild and strange to this Vermonter .
The sense of adventure sneaking through a jungle and stalking distant ancestors is beyond description .
During the day the jungle ’s air glowed green .
At night unseen animals joined together in a cacophony of wild sounds that rose and fell in a disorienting and muddled unison .
There was a religious sense of awe from the intertwined trees that towered above me .
We spent a few days scrambling up and down mountains , calling to attract duikers ( small African antelope ) , reading animal clues , and eating sardines and hard bread in caves .
It was during a lunch break , when I heard my first stories about Udoga , a famous hunter who wore only a loin cloth and caught everything from bush rats to gorillas .
Since that fateful trip to the Afi Mountains , I have spent most my life trying to do something positive for tropical forests .
This has included several return trips to Nigeria ( where I lived with a growing ranch of chimpanzees and worked beside the former hunter Udoga ) , as well as writing academic articles , helping diplomats , leading an effort to create global forestry projects standards , and starting a non-profit to support forestry projects in post - conflict zones .
And this year , for the first time in decades , I have a sense of hope .
The world seems to finally recognize the severe human and environmental costs of tropical deforestation .
Ambitious plans are being assembled to provide massive new support for tropical countries to rein in the devastation .
Tropical Deforestation

Every year , tens of millions of acres of tropical forests are destroyed .
This is the most destabilizing human land - use phenomenon on Earth .
Tropical forests store more aboveground carbon than any other biome .
They harbor more species than all other ecosystems combined .
Tropical forests modulate global water , air , and nutrient cycles .
They influence planetary energy flows and global weather patterns .
Tropical forests provide livelihoods for many of the world ’s poorest , most marginalized people .
Drugs for cancer , malaria , glaucoma , and leukemia are derived from rainforest compounds .
Despite all these immense values , tropical forests are vanishing faster than any other natural system .
No other threat to human welfare has been so clearly documented and simultaneously left unchecked .
Since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit ( when more than 100 heads of State gathered to pledge a green future ) 500 million acres of tropical forests have been cut or burned .
For decades , tropical deforestation has been the No. 1 cause of species extinctions and the No. 2 cause of human greenhouse gas emissions , after the burning of fossil fuels .
For decades , a few conservation heroes tried their best to plug holes in the dikes , but by and large the most diverse forests on Earth were in serious decline .
In short , until very recently there has been no concerted effort to tackle what is arguably the most acute threat to Earth ’s ecological integrity .
Developing countries had other priorities .
Conservation can rarely compete financially against putting in a soy bean crop or palm oil plantation , or selling trees , or growing coffee , or raising cattle .
Wealthy countries were spending substantially more on toothpaste than on trying to save magnificent tropical forest ecosystems .
A New Plan

And then in 2005 , a small group of countries changed everything .
Papua New Guinea teamed up with Costa Rica and a handful of other countries to make a formal plea to the United Nations .
Their request was simple — if developing countries can credibly reduce rates of deforestation and the associated CO2 emissions , the countries should get paid .
This band of countries , organized as the Coalition for Rainforest Nations , was even more specific .
They asserted that tropical nations should get lucrative carbon credits for each ton of CO2 that otherwise would have been emitted because of deforestation .
The global market for carbon credits was worth tens of billions of dollars , so tying rainforest protection to carbon finance would raise vast new sums to conserve tropical forests .
Since almost 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions are from tropical land - use change , and with growing concern about global warming , other countries began to listen .
Since 2005 , the concept of paying countries to conserve their forests and reduce global warming has been dubbed by diplomats as reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries , or REDD .
REDD is a bold and evolving plan to radically slow the pace of CO2 emissions by offering hefty incentives for developing countries to stem deforestation .
Instead of a couple hundred million dollars per year in conservation charity , billions of dollars in carbon credits could be spent to curtail logging , stop agriculture expansion , or in other ways prevent forests from getting knocked down or set on fire .

REDD is also an incredibly risky gamble .
The whole plan relies on resolving gaping problems in forest tenure and governance , technological capacities , and regulatory oversight .
In many countries it is not obvious who has rights over a forest .
And nowhere in the world are there clear answers to the trickier question of who has rights to the carbon stored in the trees .
Another key challenge is the need for a new , uniform way of “ interlocking ” satellite data with tree measurements taken from forests around the world .
We can tell reasonably well from space where and when forests are cleared .
Not so well understood is how much carbon is stored in a particular forest and how much is oxidized upon deforestation .
In addition to issues of rights and technologies , new global institutions are needed to make this REDD plan work .
And even with all these pieces in place , REDD assumes that appropriate price signals for saving trees will make a real difference on the ground in forest communities .
This is a huge leap of faith , given that many developing countries currently deforesting have only loose control over vast areas of their land .
There are also huge political differences about the ideal way to design a new REDD system of forest conservation payments .
What is amazing is that , despite these challenges , some of the brightest conservation minds on the planet , and most governments , now believe that this so - called REDD plan is the best shot for saving millions of acres of tropical forests .
REDD has inspired a whole new cadre of optimistic , creative , and determined people who are self - organizing to stop tropical deforestation .
Non-profits , forest communities , governors , presidents , consultants , and scientists are working to usher in this ground - breaking plan for saving rainforests .
Others are equally determined to prevent a REDD fiasco , citing the problems already noted with particular concerns about REDD ’s impact on indigenous peoples and on the global price of emitting carbon dioxide .

But for now , the overwhelming momentum points to several new policy mechanisms that would pay developing countries that can demonstrate credible drops in deforestation rates and carbon emissions .
The idea of using carbon finance to pay for reductions in deforestation has been introduced in United States legislation ( in a bill that passed the House of Representatives as well as in earlier Senate bills ) and in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change .
In other words , REDD proposals are moving ahead in the two mega - forums that matter when it comes to climate change policy .
What is left to decide now are the details .
As in all things , the details will make a huge difference as to whether REDD will succeed or fail .
My future Mongabay.com commentaries will investigate the details , disagreements , and developments of emerging REDD policy proposals .
I ’ll also explore how the concept of REDD got started in the “ voluntary carbon ” markets and how proposed policies could dramatically hurt or help these early efforts to make saving tropical forests more profitable than tearing them down .
With the United States and the United Nations scrambling to complete new agreements to limit greenhouse gas emissions , this year will be monumental for climate change and tropical forests , one way or another .
So far , the signs are dramatically positive but there are many obstacles yet to overcome .
You know those powerful choppers – customized motorcycles , often with unusual designs – that can be heard in the next county when they zoom down the highway .
Well , Orange County Choppers ( OCC ) , the custom bike shop in Newburgh , N.Y. , that has its own TV reality show , has a new take on the genre : no noise .
No , it ’s not a special muffler developed by NASA .
It ’s what OCC is calling the first custom electric motorcycle .
Yes , it 's a chopper that can keep up with a Harley - Davidson “ hog ” at 100 miles per hour without even waking up a baby .
And , because the machine is electric , it has zero emissions compared with most cycles , which pollute the air at about the same level as a car built in the 1980s .
As Paul Teutul Sr. , the driving force behind the bike shop , steered it around New York ’s Columbus Circle on Wednesday , the only noise was the sound of truck drivers honking their horns in admiration of the sleek futuristic bike .
Mr. Teutul , wearing his trademark red sleeveless T - shirt , says that driving the machine is “ awesome . ”
Known as “ Senior ” on the show , Teutul built the machine over the past month for Siemens , the German engineering company .
It wanted an “ ecobike ” that looked “ real cool , ” in the words of a Siemens company official .
To satisfy the environmental request , OCC used recycled materials , water - based paint ( the machine is white with powder - blue trim ) , Siemens 's LED lights , and high - tech 12 - volt batteries .
The bike will go 60 miles before it needs to be plugged in for a charge , OCC estimates .
Most choppers built by OCC get about 35 to 40 miles per gallon .
“ When you need a charge , you can just pull in to a McDonald ’s , ” says Teutul .
It 's not clear , however , that McDonald 's does battery - charging in addition to burgers .
In July , a company in Ashland , Ore. , Brammo , announced it was selling an electric motorcycle that the company estimates gets 378 miles per gallon .
The machines cost $ 11,995 .
But , Teutul says his company is the first to make an electric chopper .
Both Siemens and OCC were reluctant to reveal how much the bike cost .
Jim Quinn , an engineer at OCC , says a “ normal ” chopper built by the company costs between $ 70,000 and $ 150,000 , depending on the amount of work .
But Siemens made special arrangements to have some of its products used on the bike , and it has naming rights .
Also , it is paying special appearance fees .
Siemens , calling the bike the “ Smart Chopper , ” plans to show it at energy and industrial trade shows and conferences over the next year .
In 2010 , the motorcycle will be auctioned off , with the proceeds going to a charitable cause that helps the environment .
This episode of the OCC show , called " American Chopper , " will air on TLC on Thursday , Oct. 22 , at 9 p.m. , Eastern time .
But do n’t look for a lot of fireworks between Senior and his son , Paul Jr. Often sparks fly as the two spar over the construction of a machine .
But , Senior says , “ Junior was not involved . ”
Oh , and whoever buys the bike at auction , might want to add some vroom to it .
The Oregon bike company has added a microchip to generate sound so other drivers can hear the motorcycle coming .
Bionano Genomics
SAN DIEGO , Sept. 30 , 2020 ( GLOBE NEWSWIRE ) -- Bionano Genomics , Inc. ( Nasdaq : BNGO ) announced today that its stockholders have voted in favor of the company ’s proposal to increase the number of its ...
More than two decades earlier , the 1986 ad for Microsoft 's first version of Windows looked more like an ad for Lowes or a home shopping item than a software product , with Ballmer shouting into the camera for a full minute .
In the intervening years , Ballmer 's crazy cheerleading behaviour has amused geeks the world over , and there are countless YouTube videos showing him up on stage screeching , shouting and performing his trademark " monkey dance " and " developers , developers , developers " chant .
" It 's almost like an evangelist movement when he's up there and you can imagine a few Hail Marys and the like being thrown in .
It 's got that sense to it , " said Dr Peter Langford , a senior organisational psychologist with Macquarie University .
Ballmer 's constant gesticulating , tongue - poking , finger - pointing and various outlandish facial expressions during speeches have quickly made him a photographer 's favourite .
He even popped out of a cake at Microsoft 's 25th anniversary celebrations .
Langford , who specialises in corporate culture and leadership , examined Ballmer 's unbridled enthusiasm and concluded that , while it 's definitely bizarre , it was most likely a deliberate performance .
Ballmer , Langford believes , would n't have lasted for more than 30 years at the top of a $ US200 - billion software company if he was genuinely insane .
" It [ his behaviour ] is unique to CEOs , but not so if we compare to some entertainment celebrities , motivational gurus or evangelists , " Langford said .
" He 's building a celebrity status for himself and Microsoft .
It is important that CEOs are larger - than - life and this is his way of doing that . "
Ballmer 's shoot - from - the - hip style has also been a boon for journalists , who have lapped up incidents such as the time he reportedly threw a chair across his office .
Former Microsoft employee Mark Lucovsky said in a sworn court statement that Ballmer said of Google and its chief executive Eric Schmidt : " I 'm going to f... ing bury that guy .
I have done it before and I will do it again .
I 'm going to f...ing kill Google . "
Ballmer has also described the free Linux operating system , which competes with Microsoft 's Windows , as a " cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches " .
In 2004 , he said the most common format on Apple 's iPod was " stolen " .
Ultimately , Langford said , Ballmer had been able to get away with a lot of his behaviour and maintain an endearing persona because Microsoft had continued to perform so successfully and produce compelling products .
" If Microsoft was to come out with another Vista - like product and continued to lose ground in the areas of browsers and search engines , then I think people would be saying that he 's a buffoon , he 's a fool , look at how he 's performing on stage , " Langord said .
Langford noted that Ballmer appeared to be far more reserved when speaking to foreign audiences such as Indians .
He said he could probably pull off his character better in the US than he could in Australia or Europe because Australians were " a little more sceptical and distrustful " .
" An act does n't mean that it 's false .
It 's just he's got that capability to hype up when he wants to or when he thinks it 's appropriate , " Langford said .
But he said there was a risk Ballmer 's antics could be seen as unstable or unethical , which might cost Microsoft in the post - Gates era .
Loading
" He 's clearly got a very different style to Bill Gates ... but Bill Gates has a guru aura without having to perform like that , " Langford said .
" Bill Gates is seen as the guy who started and grew Microsoft and he was a legend in his own right .
He did n't have to hype it up to grab the attention . "
As you may have noticed , newspapers have had a rough 2009 .
But you may not quite appreciate the magnitude of the collapse .
So far this year :
105 newspapers have been shuttered .
10,000 newspaper jobs have been lost .
Print ad sales fell 30 % in Q1 '09 .
23 of the top 25 newspapers reported circulation declines between 7 % and 20 % .
What happened ?
The economy collapsed and advertising budgets went with it , accelerating a process already underway : the Internet 's erosion of the entire newspaper industry .
The Atlantic 's Megan McArdle explains :
For most of history , most publications lost money , or at best broke even , on their subscription base , which just about paid for the cost of printing and distributing the papers .
Advertising was what paid the bills .
To be sure , some of that advertising is migrating to blogs and similar new media .
But most of it is simply being siphoned out of journalism altogether .
Craigslist ate the classified ads .
eHarmony stole the personals .
Google took those tiny ads for weird products .
And Macy 's can email its own damn customers to announce a sale .
This perfect storm hit four major newspaper conglomerates -- the Gannett Co. Inc. , GateHouse Media Inc. , The Sun-Times Media Group and The Journal Register Company -- especially hard .
Together , they 've closed 61 newspapers this year .
( See the full list here )
Gannett Co. Inc .
Revenue fell 34.1 % in Q1 '09 .
It has laid of more than 10,000 employees since 2007 .
At least 90 employees were laid - off in the beginning of 2009 and 1,400 more will be laid off by July 9 .
Detroit Free
Press delivery cut to three days a week , from daily ; The Tuscon Citizen went online .
Most employees have been forced to take two weeks of unpaid leave .
Gatehouse Media
Revenues declined by 15 % this year and losses increased $ 3 million .
It cut 10.5 % of its workforce since Jan 2009 and cut pay 7 % - 15 % for the rest of its employees .
Though local advertising revenues sank 13.4 % in 2008 , CEO Mike Reed says the company plans to focus more on local publications : " We view our exclusive local content as our greatest asset and as our sustainable competitive advantage .
We are working diligently to intensify our local news coverage to further solidify these advantages . "
The Sun-Times Media Group
Filed for bankruptcy in April 2009 .
It has until July 29 to sell or reorganize its operations , though it has asked for an extension until October .
Court documents show that the company bled $ 4.5 million a week between Jan and March 2009 .
The company initiated pay cuts of 15 % , up from 7 % in January .
The Journal Register Company
Filed for Chapter 11 in February , with an overhanging debt of $ 692 million .
Court papers show the company claimed " advertising revenue had been driven lower by the housing downturn , declining automotive sales , the retail sector slowdown , a slow labor market that has hurt employment classifieds and a shift to online media . "
But the company 's downfall began in 2004 , when it bought several newspapers in Michigan for $ 415 million .

Birchers to birthers : a GOP quandary
They ’ve been christened the “ birthers , ” and they ask , “ Is Barack Obama the left ’s very own Manchurian Candidate , come out of Darkest Africa and smuggled into the New World to assume the presidency as Citizen of the World , ushering in an era of post- racial , big - government socialism ? ”
As many have been asking , is the GOP being pulled under by its conspiratorial fringe ?
This is not the first time the Grand Old Party has had a problem with conspiracy theorists who threaten to undermine the broader conservative agenda .
In its infancy , the conservative movement faced a serious problem with extremists who threatened to discredit the integrity and seriousness of their political project .
These were the “ Birchers , ” members of the John Birch Society , a far - right organization that originated the myth of the U.N. ’s black helicopters , of fluoride poison in our drinking water and of communists hidden in every corner — even the Oval Office .
Yes , they argued that Ike Eisenhower was a Commie .

Back then , leaders like the late William F. Buckley Jr. were thinking strategically about the future of conservatism in the postwar era .
They wanted to get beyond the legacy of isolationism that had branded their party and led it to defeat after electoral defeat .
Buckley and his associates made the decision to split with the Birchers and to do so in no uncertain terms .
They cut them off .
Publicly , in print and for the record .
And to be fair , the modern National Review has taken a similar attitude toward the birthers , writing them off in an editorial July 28 .
But NR is not the powerhouse it once was , and in the age of the blogosphere and 24 - hour news coverage , it bears little resemblance to the institution built by Buckley .
The modern GOP does n’t seem to have the stomach or integrity of those earlier conservatives .
Confronted by loony conspiracy theories about the legitimacy of the president ’s citizenship , too many conservatives are either silent or stammering , hemming or hawing when asked if our first black president is an illegal alien .
The situation is sad and does not bode well for the future of the GOP and the conservative movement .
Such as it is .
“ This is a period of transition for conservatism , ” said Lee Edwards of the Heritage Foundation , himself a veteran of the Buckley - Goldwater era .
“ There is no political leader , or intellectual leader , who could step up and say ‘ Basta ! ’ ‘ Enough ! ’ ”
Can you imagine William F. Buckley countenancing the know - nothing evasion of this current crop of conservatives ?
Seeking shelter , as they have been , behind rhetorical figments when asked about the president ’s citizenship : “ There are questions ” ; “ I could n’t swear on a stack of Bibles ” ; “ I have n’t seen the original documents ” and so forth .
The fact of the matter is that Republicans are kowtowing to the extreme wing of their party .
Old - guard conservatives would be jettisoning these flim - flam “ birther ” panderers , just as they jettisoned the Birchers .
Buckley and his colleagues had serious policy goals :
They sought to defeat communism , not contain it .
They sought to roll back the New Deal ’s regulations in favor of the free market .
They had a serious agenda to pursue .
They had no time to dabble with the candy - man , Trilateral Commission conspiracies of the Birchers .
And they found their champions in Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan .
Today , there are no comparable figures on the conservative right .
There are no intellectual dynamos like Buckley , no political icons like Goldwater or Reagan .
In short , the problem faced by today ’s conservatives is that there is no one of sufficient stature , and no group of serious political operatives , to tell the “ birthers ” to cut it out — to disown them as they deserve to be disowned .
It ’s a sad state of affairs .
The entire political process suffers as a result .

He is working on a book about the history of the conservative movement .

Scary ass stuffed bear they use to show kids how to brush their teeth .
" When governments fear the people there is liberty .
When the people fear the government there is tyranny . "
Some of the latest town hall meetings show that our representatives have absolutely no fear of their constituency .
In the irresponsible and unprofessional case of the old and crotchety Arlen Specter , he makes it clear that he has no patience for any of his constituents that disagree with him , ask a question that he does n’t feel is appropriate or ca n’t bullshit his way through .
He makes comments to the affect that a question is " too vague " to have his support and moves on to the next question .
In one video he is seen and heard shouting at one man to leave for passionately expressing his disgust with business as usual on Capitol Hill .
A comment in which the man received resounding applause from Specter ’s other constituents .
But that ’s how our government deals with dissent : you simply have it forcibly removed .
Barney Frank is another example of a congressman who does n’t hesitate to label , criticize and insult his constituency , among many , many others .
I wonder just how long you or I would last at our current jobs if we spoke to our employers in such a manner .
Truth is we could fire them all today and it would have absolutely no long - term ill effects on the country or the economy .
Except for probably national defense and a body to coin and regulate a sound currency — this would be only to decrease the transaction costs of doing business amongst the states and with foreign countries —
I believe that we really have no need for a federal government at all .
The framers of the constitution had a similar point of view and hence wrote that document in such a way as to purposefully limit the government ’s power to a small subset of economic responsibilities .
Even they were too optimistic though as the federal government has proven that it ca n’t even provide simple postal services without fraud , waste and abuse .

An idea like this always sounds odd and radical to people since our entire lives all we ’ve ever known is a behemoth bureaucracy that invades our personal and professional lives at all levels .
We ’ve just come to expect it and tend not to think what life would be like without it , or even if life would be possible without it .
My wife grew up in communist Romania .
She was 14 in 1989 when Nicolaie and Elena Ceausescu were taken out back of the federal building in Bucharest , Romania and summarily executed by a firing squad for decades of abuse of Romania ’s people and resources .
My wife and others have told me on many occasions of how the Romanian government literally disappeared overnight .
How the day after the communist party was driven out that everyone looked at each other as if to say : what do we do now ?
It was a surreal time since all most of the people had ever known was the government ’s control of them and the factors of production .
It turned out that the Romanians did n’t need the central government at all .
They actually knew how to make it through their daily lives all by themselves .
They knew how to get up and get dressed and cook breakfast and drive to work without imposing any costs on anyone else in the process .
They knew how to be productive at work and get along with their boss and colleagues .
They knew how to go grocery shopping and pay for their goods all by themselves .
They knew how to communicate with one another and trade with one another .
And oh how they traded .
The Left , The Right an ... Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr Best Price : $ 7.33 Buy New $ 40.00 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
Literally overnight , as quickly as communism disappeared , new markets appeared .
Once the government constraints on trade no longer existed people were free to trade as they wished and there was an unprecedented economic boom in the 90’s .
The only ill effect of this boom was the fact that the government had controlled prices for so long and kept them artificially low for so long — as the current administration is now proposing doing with healthcare prices — and had printed so much worthless currency that when those price controls were lifted and the markets cleared it became evident just how artificially low the prices had been held and hyperinflation ensued .
But other things appeared that had n’t previously existed : innovations in technology and science , inventions in businesses and commerce , newfound creativity in the arts and social sciences .
It was remarkable .
And all of it because of the lack of government intervention .
It would seem though that the only way to ensure lack of government intervention is to limit government .
Since even such a clearly written document as our constitution is n’t able to invoke the necessary integrity and morality in our federal civil servants , it ’s clear that the only solution is to limit the federal government to nothing and allow the states to govern and trade amongst themselves and with other economic agents .
I do n’t think it ’s difficult for a man to imagine a country in which he actually gets to keep 95 % or more of the money he earns .
A country in which he does n’t have to pay rent on his own land in the form of property taxes .
A land of opportunity where hard work and ingenuity is rewarded and laziness and political posturing is punished .
A land where men like Arlen Specter , Chris Dodd , Barney Frank and so many others can’t make a living off of the fruits of hard - working people but rather are forced to compete with everyone else for their share of the economic pie .
A country where our president is treated as the civil servant that he is and not as royalty at the expense of the commoners .
I think I ’d call this land : America .

Obama Joker poster hits LA , Atlanta
Posters of U.S. President Barack Obama , made to look like Heath Ledger ’s version of the Joker in The Dark Knight , have started spreading throughout L.A. , but nobody seems to know who ’s responsible for it .
Obama is shown with white makeup on his face and , like the Joker , he has his mouth slit wide open .
Below the image is the word “ socialism , ” although I ’ve seen similar pictures on the internet that say “ why so socialist ? ”
A version of the poster showed up in Atlanta .
Obviously , the Obama Joker poster is an attack on the president ’s push to reform America ’s healthcare system .
He is apparently losing some support among the public for his plan and this was cleared with the latest survey conducted by the New York Times recently .
What ’s your take on the Obama Joker poster ?
Is it a good political commentary ?
Or just another a protest fail ?
In today 's New York Times , an article about psychologists Bruce Jessen ( L ) and Jim Mitchell ( R ) — two military retirees with no Al Qaeda expertise , foreign language skills , or experience in conducting interrogations .
Their lack of experience did n't stop them from pawning themselves off as top architects of America 's " war on terror . "
They sold their psychological credentials and familiarity with the brutal tactics used decades ago by Chinese Communists to the CIA , which in turn paid them millions of dollars as contractors .
The NYT story details how Mitchell and Jessen directed the torture and interrogation of Abu Zubaydah , who was at the time described as " Al Qaeda 's No. 3 . "
In late July 2002 , Dr. Jessen joined [ Dr. Mitchell ] in Thailand .
On Aug. 1 , the Justice Department completed a formal legal opinion authorizing the SERE methods , and the psychologists turned up the pressure .
Over about two weeks , Mr. Zubaydah was confined in a box , slammed into the wall and waterboarded 83 times .
The brutal treatment stopped only after Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Jessen themselves decided that Mr. Zubaydah had no more information to give up .
Higher - ups from headquarters arrived and watched one more waterboarding before agreeing that the treatment could stop , according to a Justice Department legal opinion .

The Ecological Revolution : Making Peace with the Planet
By John Bellamy Foster
Monthly Review Press , 2009
328 pages .
Review by Simon Butler
Karl Marx and Frederick Engels famously urged the world ’s workers to unite because they had a world to win , and nothing to lose but their chains .
Today , the reality of climate change and worsening environmental breakdowns globally adds a further vital dimension to this strident vision of human liberation .
We still have a world to win — but we also have a world to lose .
The ecological crisis is not simply the result of poor planning or bad decisions .
Nor is it an unforeseeable accident .
It ’s the inevitable outcome of an unjust economic and social system that puts business profits before all else — even as it undermines the natural basis of life itself .
With his previous books , such as Marx ’s Ecology and The Vulnerable Planet , and as the editor of the US - based Marxist journal Monthly Review , John Bellamy Foster has established a well - earned reputation as one of the world ’s most persuasive voices arguing for fundamental social change to tackle the looming ecological catastrophe .
His new book , The Ecological Revolution , could not have been published at a more timely moment .
It argues a solution to the ecological crisis “ is now either revolutionary or it is false ” .
Foster draws on the warnings from leading environmentalists such as Bill McKibben , James Hansen and Lester Brown among others .
McKibben has said we have now entered the “ Oh Shit ” era of global warming – it ’s already too late to stop the harsh impacts of climate change entirely .
NASA scientist Hansen has said the rapid pace of climate change amounts to a “ planetary emergency ” .
In his 2008 book Plan 3.0 Brown said : “ We are crossing natural thresholds that we cannot see and violating deadlines that we do not recognise .
Nature is the time keeper , but we cannot see the clock ...
We are in a race between tipping points in the earth ’s natural systems and those in the world ’s political systems .
Which will tip first ? ”
The Ecological Revolution is a call for urgent action and an intervention into the debates about the kind of action needed to win this “ race ” .
The dwindling band of climate change deniers aside , general awareness of the extent of environmental decay is more widespread than ever — even among the world ’s elites .
The upshot is that two distinct visions of ecological revolution have emerged .
The first tries to paint business as usual economics green .
The second , following Che Guevara ’s maxim , holds it must be a genuine eco-social revolution or it ’s a make - believe revolution .
“ The conflict between these two opposing approaches to ecological revolution ” , writes Foster , “ can now be considered the central problem facing environmental social science today ” .
The economics of exterminism
The dominant view says the a new ``green industrial revolution ’’ can unleash the technological changes to allow sustainable capitalist development and end environmental destruction .
In its typical variations , the driving force of sustainable change are not the goals of preserving life , improving society or allowing for the full development of human potential , but the profit motive .
It assumes new market opportunities will arise on the back of ecological innovations , spurring on further developments .
Apart from an explosion in clean technology , virtually nothing else in the structure of society is expected to change .
Foster looks at the work of some of the most well - known promoters of a green industrial revolution such as the US economist William Nordhaus , British economist Nicholas Stern ( author of the Stern Review on the economics of climate change ) and the conservative New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman .
The Australian government ’s main advisor on the economics of climate change , Ross Garnaut , also fits into this broad category .
All assume that economic growth , the expansion of markets and the unlimited accumulation of capital can continue .
Paul Hawkin , Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins , the author ’s of the 1999 book Natural Capitalism , even say outright hostility to ecological outcomes is no barrier , as long as money can be made .
They say : “ Because there are practical ways to mitigate climatic concerns and save money than such measures cost , it almost does n’t matter whether you believe that climate change is a problem or not .
These steps should be taken because they make money . ”
Yet at the same time , this vision of a green capitalist industrial revolution also rules out ecological measures that do n’t return a profit in the short term .
The framework is to sustain capitalist economic growth , rather than the planet ’s damaged ecosystem .
As a result , Stern and Nordhaus , for example , have argued against strong greenhouse gas emissions cuts based on climate science because it would be “ economically unsupportable ” .
As a way to deal with the planetary emergency , such market - based responses are absurd , irrational , dangerous , self - defeating and destined to fail .
They have also been warmly welcomed by the world ’s capitalist governments and provide much of the basis of false responses to climate change such as carbon trading and “ clean coal ” .
John Bellamy
Foster aptly sums up the capitalist economics of a market - based green industrial revolution as “ the economics of exterminism ” .
He advances an alternative approach that puts ecological concerns above capital accumulation .
We need “ a more radical , eco- social revolution , which draws on alternative technologies where necessary , but emphasises the need to transform the human relation to nature and the constitution of society at its roots ” .
The goal of such as revolution must be “ to return to a more organic , sustainable social - ecological relations [ requiring ] a civilisational shift based on a revolution in culture , as well as economy and society ” .
He argues that a key point of difference between ecological revolution and a green industrial revolution is the involvement and mobilisation of ordinary people in the process of change .
Green industrial revolution is conceived ... as a top - down attempt at a technological shift ...
The goal of the vested interests is to keep social change in relation to the environmental challenge contained within the limits acceptable to the system , even at the risk of endangering the entire planet ...
In contrast , a genuine ecological revolution ... would be associated with a wider social , not merely industrial , revolution , emanating from the great mass of the people .
Many environmentalists who recognise the need to break from business - as - usual responses to global warming still hesitate to draw this more radical conclusion .
Changing the whole system seems too big a task .
The shrinking timeframe we have left to prevent runaway climate change has led some activists to try to separate climate change from social change .
The idea is that we can fix the environment first and then , as long as we succeed , move on to broader social goals .
In many ways , this strategy reflects a mistaken hope that the world ’s elites will ultimately decide to change course as the evidence of ecological distress becomes undeniable and the climate movement grows .
In contrast , Foster argues that if we are to make peace with the planet we have to take political and economic power away from the privileged minority who now hold it .
Otherwise , they will lead us all to oblivion in a vain attempt to preserve their system .
Sustainable development is only viable if we open the road to sustainable human development as well .
“ A revolutionary turn in human affairs many seem improbable ” , he says .
“ But the continuation of the present capitalist system for any length of time will prove impossible — if human civilisation and the web of life as we know it are to be sustained . ”
Ecological imperialism
Leaving aside the ecological crisis , capitalism condemns millions to extreme poverty , starvation and inequality .
The money spent on the military by the world ’s capitalist governments , for example , would be more than enough to secure adequate food , shelter , clean water and basic health and education for all .
The latest Forbes magazine ``rich list ’’ said there were 793 billionaires worldwide with a combined wealth of more than US $ 4 trillion .
Meanwhile , the World Bank estimated in 2005 that more than half the world 's population lived on less than $ 2 a day .
The world ’s malnourished topped 1 billion for the first time in 2009 even though the two largest total cereal yields occurred in 2008 and 2009 .
The cause and extent of environmental breakdowns worldwide cannot be fully grasped without an understanding of how a system of global inequality drives and worsens the problems .
Foster decribes modern capitalism as a system of ``ecological imperialism ’’.
At the planetary level , ecological imperialism has resulted in the appropriation of the global commons ( i.e. the atmosphere and the oceans ) and the carbon absorption capacity of the biosphere , primarily to the benefit of a relatively small number of countries at the centre of the capitalist world economy .
He predicts that as the ecological crisis mounts and natural resources become more scarce , the system will become even more barbarous .
The relentless drive to increase profits is incompatible with humane , people - centred responses .
Already , the nearness of a peak in world oil production is driving what Foster calls a new energy imperialism .
The new energy imperialism of the United States is already leading to expanding wars , which could become truly global , as Washington attempts to safeguard the existing capitalist economy and stave of its own hegemonic decline ... [ Oil ] consumption [ is ] built into the structure of the present world capitalist economy .
The immediate response of the system to the end of easy oil has been , therefore , to turn to ... a strategy of maximum extraction by any means possible .
The US - led invasion and occupation of oil - rich Iraq is one horrendous outcome of this response .
The British medical journal the Lancet estimated that more than 1 million Iraqis have died since the 2003 invasion .
Foster examines how the US government is already drawing up plans for a ``military response ’’ to the ecological crisis .
The administration of US President George Bush was notorious for its climate change denialism .
Yet behind the scenes the US military was taking it very seriously .
In a 2003 report the Pentagon said global warming was accelerating and urged it be “ elevated beyond a scientific debate to a US national security concern ” .
Rather than act to cut greenhouse gas emissions urgently and preserve life , US imperialism is preparing to “ safeguard Fortress America at all costs ” , Foster warns .
Along with the stark prospect of new wars and invasions , imperialism ’s response to climate change has been to try to push more of the costs of climate change onto the global South .
Without drastic change the poorest countries , who are least responsible for carbon pollution , will face the worst consequences of climate change .
This analysis is important for environmental movements in the developed world .
The politics of the movement against climate change must be anti-imperialist , anti-war and demand the repayment of the ecological debt to the Third World , if it is to succeed .
Any attempt to impose the main burden for global warming on underdeveloped countries in accordance with past imperialist policies , will inevitably fail .
To the extent that the United States and other advanced capitalist nations promote such a strategy , they will only push the world into a state of barbarism , while catastrophically undermining the human relation to the biosphere .
Marxism and ecology
In the landmark work Marx ’s Ecology Foster explored Marx ’s often neglected contributions to ecological thought .
The Ecological Revolution includes several chapters that further build on an understanding of Marx as one of the most perceptive environmental thinkers of the 19th century .
Marx ’s insights are of lasting significance today .
Far from ignoring ecological questions , celebrating unbridled economic growth or uncritically embracing a belief in inevitable scientific progress , Marx warned that production for profit had devastating consequences for humankind and the natural world .
In his works he commented frequently on the connections between capitalism and the major ecological problems of his day .
The two core ecological concepts in Marx ’s writings are the ``treadmill of production ’’ and the ``metabolic rift ’’ .
The treadmill of production refers to capitalism ’s core impulse to expand production without regard to natural limits to growth set by the biosphere .
This impulse makes the process of capital accumulation inherently unsustainable and anti-ecological .
Were the entire world to consume as much as the average Australian , we would need the resources of five planet Earths .
Were the entire world to live like a North American then seven planets would be required .
The advanced capitalist economies are so unsustainable because production is locked into this capitalist treadmill of never - ending expansion and growth for growth ’s sake .
This is a key element in the ecosocialist explanation of the ecological crisis .
The metabolic rift refers to Marx ’s theory that capitalist production necessarily creates a sharp break in the relationship – the metabolism – between nature and human society .
Marx used the concept of metabolism to describe the complex and co-dependent union between humanity and the environment .
In Marx ’s time the rift was most apparent in the biggest ecological crisis of the 19th century : the depletion of soil fertility by large - scale capitalist agriculture .
On this basis he drew wider conclusions about how capitalist agriculture deprived both the soil and the workers of nourishment and sustenance .
In Capital Volume 3 Marx wrote :
Large landed property reduces the agricultural population to an ever decreasing minimum and confronts it with an ever growing industrial population crammed together in large towns ; in this way it produces conditions that provoke an irreparable rift in the interdependent process of the social metabolism prescribed by the natural laws of life itself .
The result of this is a squandering of the vitality of the soil , which is carried by trade far beyond the bounds of a single country .
He concluded :
Large scale industry and industrially pursued large - scale agriculture , have the same effect ... since the industrial system applied to agriculture also [ weakens ] the workers there , while industry and trade for their part provide agriculture with the means of exhausting the soil .
In Capital Volume 1 Marx passed a scathing assessment of the “ progress ” of capitalist - based agricultural methods :
All progress in capitalist agriculture is a progress in the art , not only of robbing the worker , but of robbing the soil ; all progress in increasing the fertility of the soil for a given time is a progress toward ruining the more long - lasting sources of that fertility ...
Capitalist production , therefore , only develops the techniques and the degree of combination of the social process of production by simultaneously undermining the original sources of wealth – the soil and the worker .
Foster argues Marx used the concept of the metabolic rift more broadly than just agriculture .
Capitalist production for profit progressively alienates human society from all spheres of nature – even though a stable relationship with nature is essential for human existence .
The task of healing the rift and building a truly sustainable society was a central goal in Marx ’s vision of a democratic socialist future .
In Capital Marx said :
Freedom ... can only consist in this , that socialised [ humans ] , the associated producers , govern the human metabolism with nature in a rational way , bringing it under their own collective control rather than being dominated by it as a blind power ; accomplishing it with the least expenditure of energy and in conditions most worthy and appropriate for their human nature .
Unlike mainstream economic approaches , Marxists hold that private ownership of natural resources is the major barrier to dealing with environmental problems .
In the third volume of Capital Marx even compared the relationship between nature and humanity under capitalism to slavery .
From the standpoint of a higher socio-economic formation , the private property of particular individuals in the earth will appear just as absurd as the private property of one man in other men .
Even an entire society , a nation , or all simultaneously existing societies taken together , are not owners of the earth .
They are simply its possessors , its beneficiaries , and have to bequeath it in an improved state to succeeding generations .
Marx ’s co-thinker Frederick Engels said capitalism was incapable of a sustainable relationship with the natural world because “ in relation to nature , as to society , the present mode of production is predominately concerned only about the immediate , the most tangible result ” .
One revolution
The entire thrust of The Ecological Revolution is that “ the transition to socialism and the transition to an ecological society are one ” .
Venezuela ’s President Hugo Chavez has advanced what he calls an “ elementary triangle of socialism ” to explain the goals of 21st century socialism .
These are : 1 ) social ownership 2 ) social production organised by workers and 3 ) the satisfaction of communal needs .
Fosters says an “ elementary triangle of ecology ” must also lie at the root of this revolutionary outlook .
He summarises these as : 1 ) social use , not private ownership , of nature 2 ) democratic and rational regulation of the metabolism between nature and human beings , and 3 ) the satisfaction of communal needs – of present and future generations .
“ The goal ” , Foster says , “ must be the creation of sustainable communities geared to the development of human needs and powers , removed from the all - consuming drive to accumulate wealth . ”
He underscores the responsibility that lies with movements for social and ecological justice in the advanced capitalist countries , such as Australia and US , to make a revolutionary transition to a just and sustainable society in time :
It is only through fundamental change at the center of the system , from which the pressures on the planet principally emanate , that there is any genuine possibility of avoiding ultimate ecological destruction .
The Ecological Revolution is an extremely valuable and important contribution towards this essential task .

A member of my family - someone I 'm very close with , one of the most intelligent people I know - is a 9/11 Truther .
This , of course , is the movement that believes that the attacks on September 11 , 2001 , were planned and executed by the Bush Administration and their allies .
After years of arguing with this person , I 've come to the conclusion that I need to speak out about my experience with the 9/11 Truth , through their eyes .
As such , I wo n't be linking to the writings of 9/11 Truth leaders ( such as Alex Jones ) , but will rely on what I 've heard from this relative .
No doubt , many opednews readers will point to some of these links , in trying to prove me wrong .
When I first heard of the movement through my relative , I thought it was an interesting hypothesis , though I did n't really buy it .
Another acquaintence actually introduced me to " Loose Change , " the film that presents evidence of the proposed plot .
While I had an open mind , I took the position that Thom Hartmann does : that the evidence that the Bush Administration ignored mounting evidence of an attack is damning enough .
I suppose you could even take the view that the administration willfully ignored the evidence , which would dovetail with the " Loose Change " argument that they were looking for an excuse to invade Iraq .
But actually orchestrating the attack ?
I could n't go that far .
The shear flat - footedness of Bush 's response on the morning of 9/11 , is enough to convince me otherwise .
But my problems with the movement have little to do with the actual 9/11 facts , but rather with how it has gradually become infused with many of the classic right - wing arguments and causes of the last few decades .
A common 9/11 truther argument is that the distinctions between the Right and Left are a mirage , created to distract us from the true agenda of the powers that be .
In other words , liberals that believe in traditional progressive causes are just being manipulated .
However , I 've come to the conclusion that it is the 9/11 truthers that are being manipulated , as I hear my cousin rattle off more and more right wing talking points that go way beyond the facts of 9/11 .
Take global warming , for instance .
My relative has now incorporated opposition to " man-made " global warming into this conspiracy worldview .
Why ?
Because those who warn about global warming have the hidden agenda of imposing a carbon tax , and taxes are just another way the government is trying to control us .
Taxes are used to support organizations such as the Federal Reserve , which is part of the unaccountable forces controlling our fate .
( My relative has not actually seen An Inconvenient Truth , other than clips from rebuttal pieces . )
My argument has been that I can see that there are problems with institutions like the Federal Reserve .
But rather than approach it with an anti-tax stance , I would work to change the way taxes are spent .
A general anti-tax stance works against the poor and disenfranchised in this country , so I do n't understand why the movement would take that on .
In principle , I can see some merit to the argument that an overly rigid conception of " Left " and " Right " can obscure points of agreement , and common enemies .
In particular , I have long felt that the extremes on either side can find themselves coming out on the opposite side of the fence .
But my question to my relative and other 9/11 truthers is : why is it that your arguments always seem to wind up as classic right - wing canards ?
On the issue of taxes in particular , I worry that those in the movement are being persuaded to take positions against their own self interest , as illustrated in Thomas Frank 's What 's the Matter with Kansas ?
I understand how the rich and well - connected have little use for income taxes and the social structures they support .
How many 9/11 truthers are members of that exclusive group ?
In short , I 'm less concerned with the mechanics of 9/11 itself , and more concerned with the way that the 9/11 Truth movement is turning anti-Bush liberals into rabid right - wingers .

The hot - button topic of population growth is feared and avoided by politicians and enviro - minded folks alike .
Contraception , abortion , family planning , religious beliefs — yikes !
Even if you believe that curbing procreation is key to solving our environmental and climate woes , who ’d want to touch that powder keg of issues ?
But Robert Engelman in the current issue of Scientific American says it does n’t need to be that way , and in fact , if we really want to shrink human reproduction rates , those are the wrong things to focus on .
Before we even get to discussing population growth , we seem to get tangled up and sidetracked in talk about consumption rates .
The idea is that while families in poor , developing nations usually have more children , they consume so much less energy , food , water , and other resources per person than developed countries that what we really need to deal with is cutting consumption rates in rich countries .
That ’s true , but it ’s not the whole story .
Find this article interesting ?
Please consider making a gift to support our work .
While poorer countries consume less than we do now , they ’re striving for more comfortable , resource - intensive lives .
Who can blame them ?
And US reproduction rates are on the rise , with American women averaging 2.1 children leading to a growing nation , immigration numbers aside .
So if we want to slow climate change and save the environment as best we can , we ’ve got to get back around to reproduction .
And Engelman says that the answer is n’t in punitive actions : legally limiting couples to a single child , sterilization , or creating a tax structure that rewards small families .
Instead , the solution lies in investments that make women smarter , employed , and more equal to men .
It ’s the same case that Sightline Institute founder Alan Durning made back in 1997 in the publication Misplaced Blame : The Real Roots of Population Growth : “ If we take care of people , population will take care of itself . ”
Consider these arguments from Engelman :
“ ( E ) vidence suggests that what women want — and have always wanted — is not so much to have more children as to have more for a smaller number of children they can reliably raise to healthy adulthood …
“ Women with no schooling have an average of 4.5 children , whereas those with a few years of primary school have just three …
With one or two years of college , the average childbearing rate falls even further , to 1.7 …
“ ( W ) hen women enter the workforce , start businesses , inherit assets and otherwise interact with men on an equal footing , their desire for more than a couple of children fades even more dramatically . ”
So how does our region measure up ?
Check out this lovely fertility rates map from our own Cascadia Scorecard .
Most of Washington , Oregon , and BC are below 2 kids per woman , with a couple of counties in Washington and Idaho at higher rates .
Looking at education rates alone , do Engelman ’s correlations hold for our region ?
For the most part , yes .
Here ’s a breakdown for a couple of counties with more extreme birthrates ( keep in mind this is just a simple correlation and does n’t control for factors such as race and income , which could also play significant roles in birthrates ) :
We know what to do , but will anyone take the necessary steps to address the issue ?
Engelman says he hopes that current US leadership will support programs “ likely to encourage slower population growth . ”
He continues :
“ Like almost all politicians , however , Obama never mentions population or the way it bridges problems from health and education all the way to food , energy security and climate change .
Bringing population back into the public conversation is risky , but the world has come a long way in understanding that the subject is only one part of most of today ’s problems and that “ population control ” ca n’t really control population .
Handing control of their lives and their bodies to women — the right thing to do for countless other reasons — can .
There is no reason to fear the discussion . ”

RITE AND REASON : THIS YEAR the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin is celebrating a year of evangelisation .
The project ’s website notes that “ evangelisation is . . . an essential mission of the church ” .
Necessary , courageous , no doubt , but , one might well ask the question , “ why now ? ”
A friend told me , several years ago , of a conversation he had with a prominent Irish bishop whose diocese had the first exposure of an abuse scandal .
“ With this , what time do you think I have left for evangelisation ? ” asked the forlorn pastor .
But worse was to come .
In recent times , it can be argued , the Catholic Church in Ireland has reached the nadir of its long history on this island .
This institution is paying the price for its past success and for the kind of clerical dominance that almost inevitably leads to arrogance and the abuse of power .
Is it entering a land of exile ?
The Ryan report was horrendous .
The damage done to the victims was incalculable , the effect on the morale and reputation of the church , and , I would suggest , much of the country , devastating .
“ How did we come to this ? ” we ask .
It reflected not only on the church but also on the whole of Irish society .
This will be followed up by the report on clerical sexual abuse in the archdiocese of Dublin .
In the days following publication of the Ryan report , I was travelling on a train from Dublin to Tralee .
Sitting opposite me were two elderly ladies , one going to visit her family , while the other was eventually joined by her sister , a retired religious in civil attire .
The conversation turned almost inevitably to Ryan .
The two lay persons , both of whom had sisters who were religious , reacted largely as one might have expected from people of this generation and class .
There was a kind of uncomprehending anger towards the victims of abuse expressed in the most negative terms ; a defence of the church , and those representing it ; as well as an anger that was diffuse and directed at everybody and nobody , including the church .
Above all there was a sense of confusion and loss .
These women , like many people today , struggled with the fact that the ecclesiastical institution , in grave difficulty , often reviled , had let them down .
While we have come to assume that young people have lost faith , this is not , of course , always the case .
They continue their search for truth and for God .
A bond of trust has been so severely damaged that it is not clear whether it can ever be restored .
While priests often receive generous support , they often sense distrust , even among their own family and friends .
And yet , this is the situation within which the church must carry out its mission .
If we speak of contextual theology , a locus theologicus , it is within this context of vulnerability and weakness that we must start today .
If we are to speak of evangelisation or re-evangelisation this is the locus where it must happen , for all those who present themselves as witnesses to truth .

3 SFO luggage handlers convicted of stealing SAN FRANCISCO
Three baggage handlers at San Francisco International Airport have been convicted of stealing from luggage during an undercover sting begun after the theft of a retired police sergeant 's gun , authorities said Friday .
Andrew Balamiento , 28 , John Emil Victoria , 21 , and Tauailapalapa Laulu , 27 , pleaded no contest to embezzlement for stealing from passenger luggage while working for Servisair , a ground handling company that serviced Delta Air Lines .
The case began in September when a retired San Francisco police sergeant checked his custom - made handgun with his luggage for a Delta flight .
The weapon disappeared after check - in and was the latest in a spate of thefts from luggage , said Steve Wagstaffe , San Mateo County 's chief deputy district attorney .
A sting operation was launched in which three bags were checked on two different flights .
A game system and an Apple laptop computer were stolen from one bag , and a gold watch and foreign currency were taken from the second bag , Wagstaffe said .
Some of the stolen items were found in Balamiento 's work locker , while the stolen handgun was found at Victoria 's home .
The computer was found in Laulu 's possession , Wagstaffe said .
Balamiento will be sentenced Sept. 10 .
Victoria was sentenced to three months of jail and three years of probation .
Both were convicted of felony embezzlement .
Laulu was sentenced to a month in jail and two years of probation for misdemeanor embezzlement .
Senator Judd Gregg ( R - NH ) says it 's either the " bipartisan " Senate bill ( you know , the one with no public option , and not much of anything else , and which Republicans are n't even going to be voting for anyway ) or nothing :
Well , I think the real question is — if there is a bipartisan bill that comes out of the Senate , and there may well be , because the Baucus - Grassley group is working hard , you ’ve got the Wyden - Bennett bill as you mentioned , which is bipartisan — how do you preserve the bipartisan elements of that bill when you go to conference with the House and you ’ve got people like Speaker Pelosi who are absolutely committed to having the government take over the system ?
And that I think is the great , is the big hurdle here .
In other words , why would people sign onto a bill in the Senate if they know that the Speaker of the House and the President ’s people are going to torpedo that bill and move towards the government plan when it gets into conference ?
So unless the President comes out and says he ’s for the bipartisan bill as it leaves the Senate , and he ’s going to stand by that bill as it goes to conference , I do n’t think you ’re going to get a bill here .
Whenever one of these senators pops up saying something especially anti-reform or just plain stupid in the healthcare debate , or when someone like Grassley latches on to the notion that healthcare reform is going to kill your grandma , I go check out Nate Silver 's chart that lists which senators get the largest percentage of corporate PAC money in relation to individual contributions .
What is useful about this chart is that it does n't just show who brings in the most corporate cash , but how dependent each senator is on that cash compared to the cash they get as donations from their own constituents .
... and whenever I look on that short list of senators most indebted to corporate PAC donations , the anti-reform senator in question is always on that list .
Always .
In this case , Judd Gregg is # 3 .
Max Baucus himself is on that list too , of course .
As is Grassley .
And Conrad .
And Nelson .
And Enzi .
And so on .
In fact , Max Baucus ' entire bipartisan " negotiating " group -- all six of them -- are on that list .
So golly gee , that one small list of corporate PAC beneficiaries sure seems to have predictive powers , when it comes to what position someone will take in the healthcare debate , and how " concerned " they are about the potential tragedy of government competition against corporate interests .
There 's no question but that the goal of those like Grassley , Nelson , Conrad and yes , Gregg is to kill reform dead , or barring that water it down so that it does not so much as strike even a glancing blow against insurance industry profits .
That 's why we 're a hell of a lot closer to seeing a provision out of the Senate mandating that every American must buy private insurance from the companies in question than we are to any provision meant to reduce costs or encourage competition .
But it 's important to remember that these people , this small handful of very " bipartisan " senators who are the single biggest roadblock to American healthcare reform , due to their insistence on bending to the needs of corporations to make a profit in the deal , just somehow are coincidentally the very same senators who are most dependent on corporate contributions .
When it comes to elections , the people living in the states they represent are not their most important constituents .
Healthcare reform -- the whole concept , the very possibility of reform at all -- is being held hostage .
Unfortunately for us , we do n't have much hope of coming up with the ransom money .
We do n't have that kind of cash .

This list takes a look at some important and well intentioned inventions that eventually ended up causing catastrophe through environmental damage or loss of life .
All of the inventors were honest scientists who were trying to improve the world , but unfortunately ended up doing quite the opposite .
This list is in no particular order .
10 Zyklon B
Fritz Haber was a Nobel Prize winning Jewish scientist who created cheap nitrogen fertilizer and also made chemical weapons for the German side in World War I .
It was his creation of an insecticide mainly used as a fumigant in grain stores that was responsible for the deaths of an estimated 1.2 million people .
His Zyklon B became the preferred method of execution in gas chambers during the Holocaust .
9 Agent Orange
Arthur Galston developed a chemical that would speed the growth of soybeans and allow them to be grown in areas with a short season .
Unfortunately in high concentrations it would defoliate them and it was made into a herbicide even though Galston had grave concerns about its effects on humans .
It was supplied to the US government in orange striped barrels and 77 million litres of Agent Orange were sprayed on Vietnam causing 400000 deaths and disabilities with another 500000 birth defects .
8 Gatling Gun
Richard Jordan Gatling invented the Gatling gun after he noticed the majority of dead from the American Civil War died of illness , rather than gunshots .
In 1877 , he wrote : “ It occurred to me that if I could invent a machine – a gun – which could by its rapidity of fire , enable one man to do as much battle duty as a hundred , that it would , to a large extent supersede the necessity of large armies , and consequently , exposure to battle and disease would be greatly diminished . ”
The Gatling gun was used most successfully to expand European colonial empires by ruthlessly mowing down native tribesmen armed with primitive weapons .
7 TNT
Joseph Wilbrand was a German chemist who discovered trinitrotoluene in 1863 for use as a yellow dye .
It was n’t until 1902 that the devastating power of TNT as it is better known was fully realized and it was adopted as an explosive in time for extensive use by both sides in World War I , World War II .
It is still in military use today .
6 Leaded Petrol
Thomas Midgley discovered the CFC Freon as a safe refrigerant to replace the highly toxic refrigerants such as ammonia in common use .
This resulted in extensive damage to the Ozone Layer .
His other famous idea was to add tetraethyl lead to gasoline to prevent “ knocking ” thus causing worldwide health issues and deaths from lead poisoning .
He is considered to be the man that – “ had more impact on the atmosphere than any other single organism in Earth ’s history . ”
5 Sarin Gas
Dr. Gerhard Schrader was a German chemist specializing in the discovery of new insecticides , hoping to make progress in the fight against hunger in the world .
However , Dr. Schrader is best known for his accidental discovery of nerve agents such as sarin and tabun , and for this he is sometimes called the “ father of the nerve agents ” .
4 Nuclear Fusion
Sir Marcus Laurence Elwin Oliphant was the first to discover heavy hydrogen nuclei could be made to react with each other .
This fusion reaction is the basis of a hydrogen bomb .
Ten years later , American scientist Edward Teller would press to use Oliphant ’s discovery in order to build one .
However , Oliphant did not foresee this – “ We had no idea whatever that this would one day be applied to make hydrogen bombs .
Our curiosity was just curiosity about the structure of the nucleus of the atom ” .
3 Rockets
Despite a lifelong passion for astronomy and a dream that rockets could be used to explore space , Wernher von Braun ’s talents were used to produce the Nazi V2 rocket which killed 7,250 military personnel and civilians and an estimated 20,000 slave laborers during construction .
Later in the US he developed a series of ICBM rockets capable of transporting multiple nuclear warheads around the globe before redeeming his reputation with the Saturn V rocket that put men on the moon
2 Concentration Camps
Frederick Roberts , 1st Earl Roberts set up “ refugee camps ” to provide refuge for civilian families who had been forced to abandon their homes for one or other reason related to the Boer War .
However , when Lord Kitchener succeeded Roberts as commander - in - chief in South Africa in 1900 , the British Army introduced new tactics in an attempt to break the guerrilla campaign and the influx of civilians grew dramatically as a result .
Kitchener initiated plans to - “ flush out guerrillas in a series of systematic drives , organized like a sporting shoot , with success defined in a weekly ‘ bag ’ of killed , captured and wounded , and to sweep the country bare of everything that could give sustenance to the guerrillas , including women and children . ”
Of the 28,000 Boer men captured as prisoners of war , 25,630 were sent overseas .
The vast majority of Boers remaining in the local camps were women and children .
Over 26,000 women and children were to perish in these concentration camps .
1 Ecstasy
Anton Köllisch developed 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine as a by - product of research for a drug to combat abnormal bleeding .
It was largely ignored for 70 years until it became popular in the dance clubs of the early 80s .
It was only when the Rave culture of the late 80s adopted Ecstasy as its drug of choice that MDMA became one of the top four illegal drugs in use killing an estimated 50 people a year in the UK alone .
Its inventor died in World War I .

I have some constructive criticism as well , first off , I agree with AntonKerezov .
Other things :
The line separating the options menu button and the weelchairsymbol , is it really neccesary ?
Think it looks better without .
The highlight when going in to the options menu is way to glossy .
Otherwise nice !
- olskar
What you have done is just superb !
If you can implement that then you are the men I have some things I 'm not sure about but they are not fatal :
The right / left edge of menus I would not make round so that it merges better with the bottom bar .
Also that spot on the floor and the user selection window do n't fit imo but I have no idea how I could improve it .
Just to mention that this new shiny login will need a whole lot of beautiful preinstalled user images .
-- AntonKerezov
Also it looks still a little bit too cold for me to be " human " ...
( Of course this is * my * opinion .
Unfortunately I can't work on an own take these days ) -- xfuser4
Please do n't use this one !
The original Mr. Dobbs ones were much better , more refined .
Shiny is on its way out to be replaced by matte .
Mr. Dobb's matched the design aesthetic of notify - OSD ( using similar alerts ) and is consistent with other Ubuntu imagery ( the one that immediately comes to mind is the UbuntuOne website ) .
This one looks nothing like Ubuntu ( I actually like the brown ) and just really rubs me the wrong way .
It 's aggressive , even though this is the OS for human beings . - 1 .
To me these themes look very , very good ; professional and pleasing to the eye .
I 'd say they are the best mockups I have seen so far .
The ' spotlight effect ' gives a feel of space , which I find nice .
I do n't see anything wrong with how the rounded corners are done for the menus .
The menus are not supposed to merge with the bottom bar , but the buttons which launch them .
I agree with some in that the selected menu item is a little too bright .
Congratulations !
Anyway , the black elemets are a good suggestion to start developing a nice theme , so this way the GDM does n't look too alien on the first boot ( and if it 's good enough , i'll be keeped on the next boots ..) what i mean is that the theme should be similar to the GDM and to the screensaver lock - dialog coffcoffDustcoffcoff dael99
Not bad .
However , I 'd make it browner and add some red and orange in there too ( to tie in with the present Human palette ) and get rid of the ' spotlight ' effect on the background .
I 'd also be interested to see how the OS / kernel switcher will work , and what would happen when fsck determines the computer needs restarting .
-- jrothwell97 2009-08-13 05:29:27
That idea is wonderful , natewiebe13 !
If it is not implemented I will write it myself .
Anyway , I 'd just like to say that for as many people who complain about the Human theme , it 's certainly puzzling to see that when Canonical finally finds a way to change it a bit , there are more complaints about it not being like the Human theme .
-- bryanlbasil
Maybe ( if this get implemented ) make an option in gnome - appearance - properties to make it public or not .
Probably a checkbox underneath the style selection .
If the box is checked , it will show during gdm , if not checked , it stays to whatever it was when no user was selected .
( Just an idea ) -- natewiebe13
Oh , that 's clever !
I can see you have some experience there ...
Nah , what I mean is that you are giving some kind of privacy by sharing your wallpaper to any computer user .
Although you 're doing that already by sharing your avatar .
I guess it all depends of whether you 're aware that your wallpaper is going to be public or not .
-- mr.doob
really good idea , well , if you do n't want your mom to see your p0rn wallpaper , do n't use it , put it in a folder with a dot at the beginning ( it 's not that i'm doing that ...)--dael99
Never thought of it that way .
Haha ..
Why not though ? :P
But if it 's possible , I hope it is implemented , it would give the illusion that you are already a step further to a ready desktop when you click / enter your username .
-- natewiebe13
What about for the GDM when you click on the user , it uses the current background from that user .
Have it fade just like when you select a wallpaper for a user .
If it were to fade in when the user was selected , I think it would help to make a smoother transition into a session .
-- natewiebe13

Long time reader , first time writer here .
The first iteration was quite good , but it needed more warmth , the second has too much brown in it .
I like the goldish version of mr.doob a little more ( his fifth iteration ) .
It has more class than this brown ( and is a little bit lighter than the brown ) .
I like the throbber a lot ( great job ) .
I do n't have problems with the spotlight , but I would like to see how it looks with only one user .
Mr.doob pointed out , that the background can cause compression artefacts , could this be a problem ?
-- Rackstar 2009-08-18 12:41:00
First , I really like mr.doob 's iteration 3 .
For the GDM I would still like to see what I suggested before .
For the GDM , when you click on the user , it should use the current background from that user .
It should fade just like when you select a wallpaper for a user .
If it were to fade in when the user was selected , I think it would help to make a smoother transition into a session .
It would also give the illusion that you are already a step further to a ready desktop when you click / enter your username .
People said it would take away from privacy .
In that case , make an option in gnome - appearance - properties to make it public or not .
Probably a checkbox underneath the style selection .
If the box is checked , it will show during gdm , if not checked , it stays to whatever it was when no user was selected .
I think this would put our login experience above others .
If this is not possible , let me know and I 'll stop suggesting it .
But until then , I really want this to happen .
But please remove the glows and the spotlight .
Use a gradient like mr.doob .

The choc ubuntu I like it , and looks like real choc color , dark choc even better although this one already look nice [-> Hafiz / Ubuntu - My LoCo ] muhammadhafiz-3989
Oh c'mon !
This does n't look innovative at all .
I love Ubuntu but I think the artwork team is messed up .
MadsRHs mockups all the way !
hpis2cool
As much as the first one lacks color , this one is WAY too brown .
Looking forward to Iteration 3 -- MadsRH
I also like the gray / black one more .
The bright white hilites and black the brown do n't really look very good next to the brown .
-- jamesgecko 2009-08-15 03:11:51
I prefer the first iteration .
The neutral colour looks more professional and the KDE style highlights to the frame make it easier to see against the background .
I love the way the currently selected item 's glow bleeds slightly .
If you do move in another direction please release the grey one as an option on gnome - look -- linuxoflondon
Both are good proposals , but the gdm theme is too dark for my taste .
I would prefer a dark usplash , then a lighter gdm ( at least the face browser box and menus ) .
User 's mood would welcome it I think .
-- pepinmore
(1) I agree that the spotlight is distracting .
( 2 ) I think that once it gets to the point where the user can login or select other options , it looks great .
But something is still off at the start , when the Ubuntu logo shows up ... maybe it needs to be more centered vertically ?
( 3 ) An actual loading bar , similar to 9.04 's , would be more useful than the oscillating indicator , which does n't really give the user any information .
-- csquest99
Great job on the two extra lights !
Brings more light and feeling to the " stage " .
But I still think you should try doing more like a goldish color , instead of this purple .
But I like it better than the brown .
-- Rackstar 2009-08-18 12:41:00
Well , since it seems like you do n't really listen to us and there is no way that mrdoob's or MadsRH 's mockups will make it in the final version .... this one is better than the other ones .
I still do n't like it , do n't get me wrong .
But the rounded corners are better .
What I REALLY can't stand in all these mockups , however , is the first image with the Ubuntu logo .
It just looks wrong .
Like something anyone could do .
I think the initial animation with the logo should be both unique and memorable .
hpis2cool
The black elements in other images look good to me , so perhaps the boot logo could benefit from a touch of black too .
I agree that in it 's current form , although I like it , it still lacks something .
Anyway , generally I think these mockups are great .

Purple can be a nice colour to use by default ( but MAC uses it ) , anyway .
The backgpund on the menus do not look prefessional , can they hava an alpha ?
The GDM , just beautiful .
The splash ... lack on something ...
COLOUR !
the ubuntu logo is just nice in colours , why just make it dull ?
also , the prgress bar can have a little inspiration from Mr. doob .
I truly think it should have the release number on the boot , this would solve a few issues ( like helping friends or giving support ) .
If purple is going to be the main colour , it should be reflect more the aesthetic of other components , life notify - osd and splash in some apps ( like OO.org ) .
Cheers .
--dael99
Okay , we are getting closer :-) .
It 's great , that the thin lines were removed !
There are still some points , I would change :
The background color contains too much purple , this does n't fit to any other Ubuntu artwork ( neither the icon theme , nor any of the Ubuntu GTK Themes - like Dust or Human ) .
I think this is the major problem of the design , because such inconsistencies give it an unprofessional feeling .
For me the boxes are a little bit too dark ( you ca n't distinguish them from the background ) .
This could be an issue for people with an visual impairment ( and its even a problem if the sun shines on my screen ) .
In the user list , the color difference between the items is too small , so you do n't really see it .
I also still dislike the flat white background of selected elements and the flat background of the menus .
You are also wasting space on the menus - you could shrink the borders a little bit more .
But as I said - we are getting closer .
The most important thing is : make a background color that is consistent !
-- xfuser4
The more I look at these mockups , the more I just do n't like them .
It 's still too cold and artificial ; the colors are wrong ; the logo looks out of place .
There 's just too many things wrong , and I do n't think it 's getting any better .
I hate to say it , but I think you need to scrap the whole thing and try again .
This seems to be a sentiment shared by a number of commenters here .
Personally , I think we should consider doing something with Mr. Doob 's 3rd iteration .
It is both sleek and professional and draws me into the OS .
Does anyone really like this mockup or are we just consigning ourselves that it is what we 're stuck with , so tweak it the best we can before October ?
csquest99
Well , I agree .
It seems like we 're stuck with this even though mrdoob's and MadsRH 's mockups have been mentioned several times .
I really wish they 'd trash this .
hpis2cool
I also think , that Mr. Doobs propasal looks way more professional , friendly and more " human " .
I personally prefer the 3 .
Iteration .
Mr Doob , perhaps you could make a mock up with a user selection and password entry ?
-- xfuser4
On a second thought I think it still lacks some contrast .
I really love the background , but the dialog boxes do n't stand out enough .
-- Rackstar 2009-08-19 11:31:00
This is nice , but I think this is the right road to take .
Human vivid colors , nice depth and lights , nice look of the buttons ... I like it best .
Well for this one , kinda confuse the color actually .
But for me also , it still nice [-> Hafiz / Ubuntu - My LoCo ] muhammadhafiz-3989
I hate to jump on the bandwagon , but I also like the direction taken by Mr. Doob and the subsequent revisions to his work ( iterations 6/7 ) .
Those boot splash look professional , the colors are lively and bright .
Just because the OS theme itself may end up using blacks / greys or darker colors for the main UI does n't mean that the boot splash can't be vibrant and immerse the user .
-- yarly
I love it .
It looks gorgeous and professional .
An improvement on the 9.04 GDM theme while maintaining a hint of that wine / burgundy color .
--Colonel_Panic
Not to be disrespectful or inconsiderate , but does the Ubuntu Design Team respond to user comments and suggestions made here ?
I 'm curious as there does n't appear to have been much if any response to comments or even an acknowledgement of user contributed work .
I think we 're all appreciative to be a part of a process , but how much of this process is predetermined and how much is open to change ?
Many people here seem to be of the opinion that the work shown here by the design team is leading in the wrong direction .
There has also been a shared consensus amongst a number of people here that Mr. Doobs designs in iteration # 6 /# 7 and the subsequent edits are leading in the right direction .
( https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Incoming/Karmic/Boot#Iteration%206 ) ( https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Incoming/Karmic/Boot#Iteration%207 )
I do n't understand why the Ubuntu Design Team is ignoring this work even if it did not originate from them .
As I stated in the comments section for Mr. Doobs iteration # 7 , I really hope that if the Ubuntu design team chooses to ignore Mr. Doob 's work that someone will work with him to implement it as a functional boot splash .
It would be a shame to see his excellent design work go to waste .
-- yarly
That 's a good question , yarly ...
We 're coming up on the UI Freeze date , and it would be nice to hear some response from the design team to our input .
And I agree that Mr. Doob 's work should at least be included in the release as an option , even if the design team chooses not to set it as the default .
-- csquest99
I love the way this is headed , however I think ( as others have ) that the glow is a bit garish , especially on the Login Options menu .
It actually does n't take much glow to achieve the polished effect you 're after .
As it is , it feels as though it 's smacking me over the head : " Look ! GLOW !! " -- topdownjimmy 2009-09-15 13:12:44
In the past decade , have you downloaded music from a peer - to - peer service like LimeWire ?
Or shared files on the original Napster ?
Once ?
Twice ?
Lots ?
If so , you might want to hire a good lawyer , or consider moving to another country .
Lately , major record labels specifically , the " Big Four " ( EMI , Universal Music Group , Sony Music Entertainment , Warner Music Group , and their many subsidiaries ) have been looking for folks like you .
You may not immediately recognize the names or Joel Tenenbaum , but you should .
Ms. Thomas - Rasset is the Minnesota single mother who , in June , was sued by the major record labels and ordered to pay roughly $ 1.9 million for downloading and sharing 24 songs .
Mr. Tenenbaum , 25 , was just successfully sued by subsidiaries of Universal , Warner , and Sony for sharing what he admitted in court last week were hundreds of songs over Napster and Kazaa , starting around 1999 .
Here 's a snippet from a BBC News story last week that focused on Tenenbaum 's trial :
Under U.S. law , the recording companies are entitled to $ 750 to $ 30,000 per infringement .
However , the jury can raise the amount to $ 150,000 per track if it finds the infringements were wilful .
In the [ Thomas - Rasset ] case , the jury awarded $ 80,000 per song .
Tenenbaum got off easy ; on Friday he was ordered to cough up a measly $ 675,000 , a decision he 'll appeal .
If he loses again , he 'll file for bankruptcy .
Tenenbaum 's lawyer , Harvard Law School professor Charles Neeson , argued that major record labels have not adjusted to the age of the Internet , and that his client was simply " a kid who did what kids do . "
Now , his second argument would n't hold up in court if Tenenbaum had , say , stolen someone 's cell phone .
But as for the first point about record labels not accepting the new business models necessary to succeed in the digital age : Um , you think ?
Here 's an example of how smart record labels are operating these days .
At some point in the last few years , the independent labels noticed a trend :
Of those who were still actually paying for music , very few people were buying CDs anymore , some people were still buying vinyl , and most were downloading music via iTunes or other sources .
So the independent labels have started making better - looking packages and higher - quality pressings of vinyl releases , and including coupons for free digital downloads of the full records .
Are they nuts ?
Why on earth would they give irresponsible consumers , the Joel Tenenbaums and Jammie Thomas - Rassets of the world , files that are n't protected , that can be passed on from friend to friend or traded on the Internet ?
Because they like making money .
One thing about Joel Tenenbaum :
He admits to " swapping " several hundred files over the past ten years , but he also bought more than $ 100 worth of CDs during that time .
Tenenbaum represents a stereotype : someone who swaps songs online , and is duh a music lover .
Not all of the people like this are rich , so there are only so many CDsor digital downloads they can afford .
Make no mistake : Music lovers still purchase songs , even full albums .
But the Internet has made it easier for enthusiasts to get their hands on music they might not have otherwise bought .
A funny thing can happen when someone listens to a free album and really likes it :
That person may become a fan , or what record companies have come to know as " the only thing that keeps us employed . "
So , wisely , the indie labels realized that maybe they should keep those folks happy .
I imagine the thought process probably went something like this :
If they 're willing to buy vinyl , let 's reward them with a free digital download , so they can also listen to the record on their iPods .
They may decide to share these files , but let 's be rational :
At worst , there 's nothing we can do about it ; at best , it 's free advertising .
Someone who might have never heard this record may become what 's that term again ? oh , yes , a fan .
Or even someone who goes to live shows , buys merchandise , and coughs up for future records .
Now , I 'm not suggesting that the major labels revert to selling only vinyl and offering free digital downloads .
These are just some ways smart companies have adapted to the new way music is consumed , instead of fighting it .
And to be fair , Nonesuch Records , which is owned by Warner , offered a free CD forget the download with the vinyl package for Wilco 's latest record .
Nonesuch , however , is a rare breed : a label with independent spirit and artists that also has major - label backing .
In general , the major labels are afraid of digital files look at how long it took them to remove DRM ( digital - rights management , or copy - protection coding ) from their iTunes offerings .
The Big Four have all been loath to adapt to the Internet and develop lucrative business plans , though file - sharing and the Web have been popular for well over a decade now .
What 's a multi-billion dollar industry to do ?
Well , for starters , it could develop a new way of thinking about file - sharing and copy protection , as the indie labels have .
Or it could sue the pants off some kid who is just about as guilty as most of us .
After all , they already succeeded in getting millions out of a single mom , right ?
It 's a Pyrrhic victory at best they 're unlikely to collect , and now they 're facing a public backlash .
Kind reader , I implore you to send the brain trust of the Big Four a message and make August " Ban Major Record Labels Month . "
Is there a record you really want to buy that 's being released on a major label in the next four weeks ?
Wait until September to buy it .
I bet you can stream it for free from the band 's Web site or MySpace page .
Or just suck it up for the next 29 days .
And if you bought music this weekend , just extend the ban until September 2 .
Let 's also make August " Support the Indies " Month .
I recognize not everyone is into indie rock , rap , jazz , or electronic music , but I promise you there 's some really great stuff out there .
Web sites like OtherMusic.com ( which is also a brick - and - mortar record shop in New York City ) , Insound.com , eMusic.com , and iTunes itself all offer a wide variety of independent music .
And Web sites like Bandcamp.com allow artists to sell music directly and you can stream an entire song or album before you buy it , as many times as you want .
Some of the downloads are even free !
Hopefully , if enough people ban the major labels , it will offset the profit ( er , compensation ) these companies make from the Joel Tenenbaums of the world .
This may sound cruelafter all , major label employees want to pay their bills just like the rest of us but it 's actually just tough love .
A message sent by the public in the form of a horrid August might finally make these companies realize the error of their ways , and that instead of suing so - called criminals , they 'd do better to focus on improving their business plan for the Internet era .
After all , when cassettes were popular , people shared songs all the time , but you never really heard about lawsuits dual - cassette deck boomboxes and mix -tapes were the rage .
Companies tend to not sue their customer bases when things are going well .
Although the details are still sketchy , Apple is working on a project involving the Big Four called " , " which is basically a plan to change and improve the way major labels sell music on the Web .
Even if it does n't work , it 's a step in the right direction .
I 'll close with this challenge to the Big Four : Forgive the " debt " owed by Ms. Thomas - Rasset and Mr. Tenenbaum , publicly apologize for pursuing litigation against the people you should be wooing instead of suing , and I 'll write a column imploring people to buy your records because , for once in the last decade , you did the right thing .
The NHS has set aside £ 787 m this year to cover the cost of compensation claims Escalating fees from no win , no fee solicitors are hitting NHS patient care , the BBC has been told .
Steve Walker , chief of the NHS Litigation Authority , said payouts for compensation claims and lawyer fees could only come from the NHS 's budget .
And the BBC has also learned that a law firm acting for parents in the Alder Hey organ retention case tried to claim nearly £ 4.5 m in costs from the NHS .
Lawyers argue costs rise because the NHS takes too long to settle claims .
Mr Walker said the NHS was facing an increasing number of claims from no win , no fee solicitors arguing these were more attractive propositions for claimant and solicitor .
The rising cost of litigation means the NHS has had to put aside a record £ 787 m this year to cover the cost of claims .
Last year , solicitors suing the NHS received more than £ 91 m in costs - nearly three times as much as solicitors acting for the NHS .
Cash diverted Mr Walker told BBC Radio 4's File on 4 : " The present system means there is too great a drain on public resources largely for the benefit of ... claimant solicitors who are effectively recovering at a rate of perhaps as much as four times what we would pay our solicitors for doing the same quality of work . "
FIND OUT MORE Listen to File on 4 , BBC Radio 4 2000 BST , Tuesday 30 June 2009 , repeated 1700 , Sunday 5 July 2009 .
Listen on iPlayer Download the podcast Mr Walker added , " There is only one source of money for the NHS .... we have to pay claims from money that would be spent on patient care . "
Law firms can earn substantially more in fees than their clients get in damages .
Documents obtained by File on 4 outline the disparities .
In just one of many such cases a successful claimant was awarded £ 5,000 , but their solicitor received £ 56,000 .
Another claimant received £ 7,000 , their solicitor over £ 77,000 .
File on 4 has been told that no win , no fee solicitors have charged as much as £ 800 pounds an hour and the programme has seen bills where a law firm charged more than £ 700 because their train was delayed and another charged £ 26 to " consider the arrival of a letter " .
Late settlement However medical negligence lawyer Russell Levy claimed that legal costs can rise because the NHS drags cases out .
" They hope the harder they make it and the more they discourage people , they will go away , " he said .
He claimed the NHS lawyers often left settling cases until they were on the verge of a court hearing .
" By the time they accept the inevitable , it costs much more than it should . "
The NHS is currently facing 6,000 plus medical negligence cases of which half are from no win , no fee solicitors .
If an NHS trust believes a costs claim is excessive it can challenge the costs at a hearing before a costs judge .
Alder Hey Mr Walker told File on 4 in one case the NHS decided to fight a claim for £ 4,479,957.06 submitted by Liverpool firm E Rex Makin which had been working on behalf of parents in the Alder Hey organ retention scandal .
" We told them we would n't be paying and began at considerable expense to prepare for a hearing , " he said .
After two months of negotiation the law firm agreed to accept £ 430,000 settlement .
E Rex Makin said the submitted bill included all items of work for which its solicitor believed he was entitled to recover payment .
The firm said its bill was never assessed by the court and the negotiated settlement that was reached with the Health Authority 's solicitors reflected a number of technical arguments that were raised over the costs claimed .

Only Germans , perhaps , could make a game about economics  a stylish , intelligent and captivating one at that .
Dawn of Discovery is the best new single - player strategy game I have played in several years .
It will not satisfy anyone ’s inner warlord ; if pillaging , bombing and grinding your virtual enemies into submission is your idea of strategic game play , Dawn of Discovery is not for you .
But if building a grand , classical empire spanning both the Occident and Orient sounds appealing , Dawn of Discovery , particularly the Windows version , is the kind of game that can easily occupy hundreds of hours over many years .
It is understandable , if vaguely condescending , that Ubisoft , the game ’s publisher , has called the game Dawn of Discovery in North America while calling it Anno 1404 in the rest of the world .
( The game is set in an approximation of the early 15th century . )
After all , the broad American consumer has never been that great at history , especially when it comes to times before our own .
Ubisoft is French , but the game ’s developer , Related Designs , is German , and Dawn of Discovery is a quintessential German game .
It almost goes without saying that American media products are far more filled with depictions of violence than European ones .
Having experienced war and genocide at home quite recently , Europeans are far less enamored than Americans are of turning violence into entertainment .
Like her predecessor , Howard has long red hair
US actress Bryce Dallas Howard is to play evil character Victoria in the third Twilight film , Eclipse .
The screen star will replace Rachelle Lefevre , who took on the role in the first two instalments of the franchise , its makers have said .
Lefevre quit because production on a film with Dustin Hoffman is due to start in another part of Canada at the same time .
Howard 's other screen credits include Terminator Salvation and Spider - Man 3 .
' New dimension '
Her father is Oscar - winning director Ron Howard , whose films include Frost / Nixon and A Beautiful Mind .
The character of Victoria in the vampire saga is the sworn enemy of the story 's heroine , Bella .
Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart play Twilight 's leads
The first film in the series was released last year , and its follow - up , New Moon , is due to hit cinemas in November .
Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart are the stars of the franchise , which - to date - has proved a box office success .
The third film , also based on the books by Stephanie Meyer , is due to begin production next month and is scheduled for release next June .
A fourth movie based on Meyer 's novel Breaking Dawn is also due to be produced .
Summit Entertainment 's Erik Feig said : " Rachelle brought Victoria to great screen life and Bryce will bring a new dimension to the character .
" The franchise is lucky to have such a talented actress as Bryce coming in to fill the role . "
A restaurant has just opened in Nagoya , Japan that uses robots instead of humans as its chefs .
It may not seem that amazing at first , but once you see the video later in this post I think most of you will be as blown away as I am .
The chefs work their gastronomic magic in a kitchen placed front and center in the middle of the restaurant , giving customers a front row seat on the action .
The video is shot from the perspective that you are one of the customers .
You can hear the sounds of the robots as their joints make that characteristic sound of robot movement .
You can see other customers in the restaurant as they experience the restaurant in their own way – some mesmerized by the robots , others focused on their food and seemingly oblivious to the fact that the robots are even there .
Its an awesome scene .
Its yet another one of those increasingly common moments that forces us to ponder the rapidly evolving future of man and machine .
Check out the video below :
The robots are fully autonomous , taking a customer order and cooking it from start to finish .
This includes boiling the noodles , pouring broth , adding spices and toppings , and so on .
The orders are complex too , requiring the robots to take customer preference for amount and type of sauce , salt , noodle , and so on .
The finished product is handed off to a human server who brings the food to the customer ’s table .
The irony could not be more real as we witness the lowly human in the role of a mere server while the robot takes on the cooking .
Reuters says the robots are serving 80 bowls of tasty ramen soup on a busy day .
It takes the robots about 1 minute 40 seconds to cook a bowl that costs the equivalent of 7 US dollars .
The restaurant , called FA - men ( pronounced Fu-a - men ) based in Nagoya , Japan , takes its name from the phrase “ Fully Automated raMEN ” says Ni-Lab .
Not content to simply sit around when there are no orders to cook , the robots can be seen doing tricks and even performing pretend combat with a sword ( knife ) and a shield ( plate ) in homage to Manzai , a style of stand - up comedy in Japan .
If you know Japanese , or are just curious , you can check out FA - men ’s website .
The robots are produced by AISEI , an industrial robotics company that has apparently re-purposed its industrial robotic arms for the task of cooking rather than for your more standard industrial process .
Although first appearing in robotic hotbed Japan , we can expect robotic chefs to move their way across the world in the coming years .
This is a fascinating trend and I can’t wait to see a restaurant like this here in the States .
Somebody please make it happen !
I think my insurance company is trying to kill me ; not in an
aggressive stabby way , more a passive aggressive , we can see you ’re dying of thirst but we ’re not going to let you use our well kind of thing .
It ’s all passive - aggressive , not taking responsibility ,
just going to not do our job and if harm comes to you because of
that it ’s not our fault kind of thing .
It ’s really annoying , stressful
and truly a shitty way to be treated .
Given that I give them more than I pay in rent each month , you would
think that they could live up to their minimal responsibility to
provide the drugs that they are contractually obligated to provide .
When I saw the doctor Monday morning , she told me ( not that it was a
surprise ) , that if I did n’t get this medication soon , hospitalization
would be considered .
I ’ve been trying to get this medication for three
months ; because I knew this was coming .
Hi , my name is Larry , I ’ve been suffering from Psoriasis for most
of my life .
I ’m trying to restart a prescription for a drug called Humira
that is very effective ; while on it I was as clear of psoriasis as I
have been in my adult life .
My psoriasis is severe enough that I’ve
been hospitalized multiple times .
When it ’s really raging I can barely
walk , much less work at anything more physically strenuous than
tapping on a keyboard .
I ’m fairly sure that if it ’s not kept under
control , and I get into a state known as ‘ pustular exfoliation ’ I
would probably die of septic infection .
My health insurance provider seems bound and determined not to cover one of the few medications that I know to be effective at letting me live a normal life .
The thing is that I was on this medication for about 2 years , before
they decided to start throwing obstacles in the way of renewing the
prescription .
I went for a routine visit to my dermatologist in
April .
He wrote a renewed prescription ; the insurance company replied
that they needed a Tuberculosis test before they could approve the
medication ; well since I was vaccinated with the BCG Vaccine as a child I of course test positive for the antibodies to TB .
A fact which is easily discoverable to anyone with access to my medical records and which had already been determined at least once by the same insurance company .
So two months go by , I get a chest x-ray to show that in fact I ’m not wasting away from TB .
I request my medicine , I ’m told it ’s in processing , and that the pharmacy will call soon , by this point I ’ve been off the medications for two months , but I ’m still doing OK .
I ’m busy with work , and various other projects ( hey I have a life ! ) and I think that the medication flow will start in
July .
During July and August , I ’m calling the pharmacy every week , and they say they have n’t received authorization , I call the insurance company , and they deny all knowledge of prior authorization .
This brings us to the last two weeks , I ’m calling the pharmacy , the
doctor ’s office and the authorizations department to see if my medication will ship .
Monday morning , I called from the doctors office , after speaking to the nurse who faxed the form twice in the last week ; both times , the insurance company claims not to have received it .
So I picked up a copy of the form and took it to the insurance companies office ; to make sure they received it since apparently their fax machine is broken .
This morning when I called , the insurance authorization person I spoke to claimed that the clinic had “ the wrong fax number ” ; I was looking at the form the clinic gave me at the top of which , in bold face is the correct ( verified ) fax number .
They also want more data , which they have already received at least once .
Folks , this sort of thing is why we need to hold the health insurance companies to account ; we need a public option , if only to change the dynamic of the industry .
I have decided to give my insurance company one last chance to make this right .
But if the drugs are not shipping by 11 am pacific time on Wednesday August 26 .
I will name them .
It will be a new post so subscribe to the RSS feed now if you want to be the first to know .

A trust fund has been set up for the Beaver Lake Cree Nation , who are fighting the extraction of tar sands from their ancestral lands in Alberta
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
People in the UK are being urged to support a legal fight by a Canadian Cree community against " tar sands " – a form of fossil fuel which campaigners warn could help push the world into a climate disaster .
The Co-operative Financial Services is backing the Beaver Lake Cree Nation , who are fighting the extraction of tar sands from their ancestral lands in the boreal forest of Alberta because of the damage it is doing to their environment .
The Beaver Lake Cree claim the strip mining , drilling for oil and prospecting for fuels through the forest is harming human health and wildlife and polluting rivers , lakes and water supplies .
They say it is also preventing them from hunting , fishing and gathering plants – rights enshrined in a 19th - century treaty and now part of the Canadian constitution .
The Co-operative is backing their legal battle as it believes it is the " one of the last and best hopes " to stop new tar sands developments , which use far more energy to produce oil than conventional fossil fuels .
A charitable trust fund has been launched to allow people to give money to support the Cree 's legal fight , with the financial group donating £ 53,000 to the cause .
The donation follows £ 50,000 given by the Co-operative to help record the testimony of Cree elders for the case about the damage being done to their environment .
Tar sands are a mixture of sand or clay and bitumen , which are either pumped from underground using steam or dug out in strip mines and which need pre-processing or " upgrading " before they can be refined .
Shell is among the companies developing tar sands in Alberta , despite its extraction project losing $ 42 m ( £ 25.4 m ) in the first three months .
Campaigners say the process of extracting tar sands produces an average of three times the carbon emissions of conventional oil production .
A study last year by WWF and the Co-operative warned that the extraction of all the unconventional fossil fuels in North America would produce enough emissions to push atmospheric carbon dioxide levels well past the point at which dangerous climate change would occur .
But tar sands are big business in Canada , where multi-national oil companies are rushing to exploit the estimated 315 bn barrels thought to be under the ground , developing huge areas of the wilderness for extraction .
The Cree , who gave up ancestral lands almost as big as England and Scotland put together in return for the guaranteed right to hunt , fish and gather plants in the territory , say people 's health is suffering as the result of local pollution .
Toxic lakes of water used in the extraction process are harming wildlife , the fish and animals they hunt are unhealthy and moose and caribou populations have been hit as a result of lines clear - cut through the forest for seismic prospecting for oil .
The deer will not cross the " seismic lines " , which wolves exploit for hunting , and have also found their movement hampered as a result of hundreds of miles of pipelines through the forest and breeding grounds disturbed , the Cree say .
Chief of the Beaver Lake Cree , Al Lameman , said : " We are facing powerful and wealthy opposition , but we remain firm in our resolve to protect these lands from destruction . "
He added : " Our fight is your fight . "
Paul Monaghan , head of social goals and sustainability at the Co-operative , said the Beaver Lake Cree 's legal fight was bigger than lawsuits against " big tobacco " or Erin Brockovich 's battles against pollution .
" The Beaver Lake Cree 's legal case maybe one of the last and best hopes to stop new tar sands development .
" This small group of indigenous people are taking on not just the governments of Canada and Alberta , but some of the biggest companies in the world .
" They have the support of Canada 's leading lawyer on aboriginal law , who has a track record of winning such cases .
But they are going to need financial support – and lots of it . "
Costs for the case , which is expected to take several years to come to court , is likely to run to millions of dollars .
Conservative activism , these days , is spread out over a handful of groups with member lists under 800,000 , working together in loose affiliations around tea party events and other cooperative alliances ( some of the groups , like Tea Party Patriots , are tea - party - centric ) .
Here 's what they 're planning for August .
First of all , there will be tea parties .
A conservative coalition has planned a national day of health - care - specific tea parties on August 22 - - organizers hope for a tea party in each of the nation 's 435 congressional districts , according to one official -- and another coalition has planned one in DC September 12 , when Congress comes back .
There 's a national website set up ( recessrally.com ) to help conservatives find the August 22 tea parties in their areas , along the same lines as TaxDayTeaParty.com , which served as a ( more or less ) official hub for the national tea party activity on April 15 .
The same three groups who helped coordinate the April 15 tea parties are working to organize the August 22 events : American Liberty Alliance ( formerly the Don't Go movement ) , FreedomWorks , and Americans for Prosperity .
They 've joined in a coalition with new media / community organizing group The Sam Adams Alliance and political training institute American Majority .
" Organize " is used in a loose sense here .
The model is to provide information about where tea parties will take place ( via the recessrally .com website and the websites of the organizing groups ) , alert group members via email or telephone , and largely leave it up to individuals to access that information and find out where to go .
Tea party organizers have always insisted , and still do , that their movement is , in that way , fundamentally organic .
But they do , as this coalition has done , set the dates ... so while August 22 events may be more or less organic , they 're not spontaneous .
The tea parties will be promoted through an affiliation with conservative blogs and websites including RedState , Michelle Malkin , NetRightNation , and Smart Girl Politics , who have also signed onto the coalition , as well as through the e-mail lists kept by the organizing groups ( as mentioned above , generally comprised of fewer than 800,000 people ) and through a Facebook group of 50,000 tea partiers handled by American Liberty Alliance .
Organizers hope for a tea party in each of the nation 's 435 congressional districts August 22 , according to American Liberty Alliance Communications Director Corrine Williams .
The September 12 tea party , headed up by FreedomWorks ( over 760,000 members ) , will include some more established / establishment players in Republican advocacy : Americans for Tax Reform , the National Taxpayers Union , and The Club for Growth will all pitch in .
FreedomWorks spokesman Adam Brandon says his group expects 20,000 people to show up .
World ’s Biggest Cave Discovered in Vietnam
Caves are cavernous and scary places , filled with bats , bottomless pits , and other natural mysteries .
In Vietnam , some brave explorers have discovered and mapped the world ’s biggest cave .
The Son Doong cave is 262 feet wide throughout most of the passage , and features a 1.6 mile long river and 230 feet stalagmites .
For a couple of miles of the passage , the cave measures 460 feet wide .
A local farmer discovered the cave and led the joint British and Vietnamese exploration team in their April expedition .
The team mapping the cave got as far as a 46 foot high wall before they were stymied .
“ The second team that went in got flooded out , ” Adam Spillane , a member of the British Cave Research Association expedition that explored the limestone cavern , said .
“ We ’re going back next year to climb that wall and explore the cave further . ”
The previous record - holder , Deer Cave on the Malaysian island of Borneo , is 300 feet wide , but it is much shorter than Son Doong .
The Vietnamese terrain , which is filled with similar limestone caves , presented a lot of difficulties to the explorers .
The research team surveyed the cave using precise laser technology to assess its size .

President Barack Obama will announce the nomination of Ben Bernanke to a second term as Federal Reserve chairman on Tuesday , opting for continuity in U.S. economic policy despite criticism in Congress of the low - key central banker 's frantic efforts to rescue the financial system .
Mr. Obama 's decision had become a subject of growing speculation and uncertainty in financial markets and in Washington policy circles .

A year ago I posted on open source business practices and conversion rate myths .
A colleague asked yesterday whether we should n't still use it as a measure until a better one is found , since it 's the best we have .
The problem is n't that it 's a poor measure , but I believe it 's a wrong and misleading measure .
It is NOT similar to lines - of - code in software engineering ( a poor measure ) .
Variation in LoC is still within a few percentage points when you resolve for the project differences .
Conversion rate is orders of magnitude different between companies .
Business measures are typically within percentage points .
Think of ratios like gross margin .
They vary between types of businesses by as much as 30 % but within an industry they 're pretty steady and act as a benchmark .
Using a wrong or misleading measure will put you in jeopardy if you 're the marketing or community manager .
( You 're being judged against the metric . )
If you distribute for " free " as open source software , you capture your user base depending upon how good you are at getting the word passed onward .
If you 're good , you build community around your software .
Remember software only forms part of the value network that is your solution — and customers buy solutions to problems .
Mårten Mickos well observed that your early community is willing to trade time to save money and your later community is willing to trade money to save time — and the later community contains his customers .
The observation implies a timeline for community growth depending upon the software project .
Companies starting a business around a new project need to be sensitive to this .
Customers ( people that are going to buy something ) will use free access to test that your software might solve their problem before they pay for your solution .
Many users in community do not have money to spend today .
They can't be converted .
As a " lead " they will never become a " qualified " lead , and getting in their way trying to sell to them will only be a source of frustration for everyone involved .
BUT while in a normal proprietary software company this means you 've disqualified someone that is n't a customer in the pipeline , in the open source corporate world , I believe they sit in a different process .
Instead of a manufacturing metaphor ( pipelines ) we need a more organic social metaphor to track success and growth of the community .
Lead generation is a measure of community engagement .
You want to grow your community .
Customers will self - qualify .
This WILL be reflected in a number of downloads , but this is correlative not causal , and it's an ambiguous metric .
It 's very software function dependent .
If a user downloads one copy and installs it on a hundred machines , your knowledge is already off by two orders of magnitude — counting downloads is useless .
The greater user community still needs care and feeding because they contribute code , bugs , time to answer one another 's questions , beta bodies , and interesting applications of your software you may not have thought about or had time to develop yet .
They are a source of innovation , not simply within the software ( small contributions ) but at the solution level .
They will tell your BUSINESS new places to go to capture money in the network around your software .
These are very valuable people .
Growing your community is important for this reason .
Do n't simply measure downloads and compare to a number of customers .
Measure everything you can think of about your community :
Unique members on the forums .
Time to answer a question ( internally versus community ) .
[ And do n't reward your employees for answering quickly or your community will never get a chance to answer . ]
Number of code contributions .
Number of bug reports .
Number of documentation contributions ( howto , tutorials , etc. )
Feature requests .
etc .
For numbers that tie back to specific releases of software , use them to tune your engineering process , i.e. involve your users in your engineering process .
Consider letting USERS vote on importance of bugs so they feel a part of the process .
( Do n't draw the line between customers and users .
It will be tempting , but customers probably buy something else from you in their solution .
Disenfranchising users is disenfranchising the larger community of interest and probably a false feature . )
Engage their time ( appropriately ) and you will win community mind share .
Mind share is everything for profitability .
It 's the stickiness .
It will create customer advocates .
There will come a time when the users move to other organizations bringing their knowledge with them and the new organization will self - qualify to become a customer .
Or the user 's own company grows to a point that they become customers .
But they do n't " convert " in the traditional sense .
The lead did not become a qualified lead and you do n't need to " sell " to them to convince them to buy your solution .
They have internal needs that makes buying your solution more important than using your software .
I 'm betting those internal needs are very function - centric ( e.g. one company will buy JBoss support while using RHAS for free ) .
Determining those functional decisions in relation to your solutions will give you better insight into how to grow your customer base , i.e. revenues , without sacrificing your community in " conversion " games .

Realism and toleration
In my last post , I argued that the U.S. policy of “ do n’t ask do n’t tell ” is contrary to a realist view of world politics , because it excludes qualified people from military service and thus makes it harder for the United States to field the most effective forces in a competitive international environment .
I think there are other objections to the policy as well , but I was primarily concerned in that post with the strategic implications .
The policy obviously does n’t prevent the United States from producing highly capable fighting forces , but restricting the talent pool in this way means our forces will cost more than they have to and / or be less effective than they could be .
This got me thinking : might a similar logic be at work at a more global level ?
Specifically , does the competitive nature of international politics give some states an advantage because their political systems and social values make it relatively easy to attract and assimilate talented citizens from other countries , thereby enabling them to draw more - or - less selectively on the entire global talent pool ?
If so , then these states will be able to improve their relative position over time , and to the extent that globalization now facilitates people moving from place to place , that tendency should be increasing .
By contrast , states that make assimilation difficult or that discriminate on other areas will tend to be less attractive destinations for highly educated and / or entrepreneurial individuals , and these states will for the most part have to work with the citizenry they ’ve got or pay a very high premium to attract talent from abroad .
One can see this dynamic by comparing Japan and the United States .
Japan is an ethnically homogeneous society , with small minority populations who remain objects of discrimination .
It is possible for foreigners to become naturalized citizens after five years of continuous residence , but this practice is not widespread .
Japan also has a rapidly aging and declining population , which will have significant long - term effects on its power and influence .
Yet given Japan ’s current policies discourage talented foreigners from immigrating and assimilating , thereby making it harder for Japan to attract the best and brightest from around the world and reverse its demographic slide .
The United States , by contrast , is the very model of a melting - pot society .
People automatically qualify for citizenship if either parent is a citizen or if they are born on American soil , and naturalization is quite common ( about one million people became naturalized citizens last year ) .
Although support for immigration has waxed and waned throughout U.S. history and remains a contested issue today ( mostly due to issues pertaining to illegal immigration ) , the United States has had remarkable success attracting and assimilating some of the best and brightest from all over the world .
All I have to do is look at my colleagues , whose ranks include an impressive number of scholars born outside the United States .
Each of them was hired as a result of a global talent search , and we ’d have a less distinguished faculty if we had looked only at U.S. citizens .
Some of my colleagues eventually returned to their countries of origin ( such as Andres Velasco , currently Minister of Finance in Chile ) , but others are likely to spend most if not all of their careers here in the United States .
The success of the American melting pot , as many scholars have commented , is due partly to good fortune ( North America was rich in natural resources , arable land , etc. ) but also to the particular nature of American civic nationalism ( or what Anatol Lieven calls the American Creed ) : faith in liberty , constitutionalism , democracy , the rule of law , individualism , and political and cultural ( but not economic ) egalitarianism .
Although the United States has hardly been free of racial or ethnic conflicts during its history , these features have made it possible for every new group to integrate itself as full citizens .
The United States is an attractive destination not just because it is a wealthy society , but also because many different groups and individuals can become integral parts of that society instead of facing permanent second - class status .
If I ’m right , then the pressures of international competition give an advantage to any society that can “ cream ” some of the smartest and / or hardest working people from all over the world .
How ?
By making that society an attractive place to live and work , mostly by creating an atmosphere of equality and toleration .
By contrast , societies that limit their de facto talent pool by defining citizenship narrowly , by treating minorities badly , by discriminating on the basis of race , religion , or other characteristics are placing themselves at a competitive disadvantage vis -à - vis the rest of the world .
Over time , therefore , we should expect a growing gap between “ cosmopolitan ” societies that develop institutions and cultures in which diversity and tolerance are prized and where potential conflicts between them are managed well , and more restrictive societies that are either attractive only to a fixed population of particular ethnic identity , or who are face recurring internal conflicts between various contending groups .
My bet would be that , other things being equal , the former do better over time .
And note that this argument is n’t just about ethnic assimilation .
In effect , what I ’m suggesting is that from a realist perspective , there is a strong case for “ small - l ” liberal toleration .
All else equal , societies that establish strong norms and institutions that protect individual rights and freedoms ( including those governing sexual preference , I might add ) will become attractive destinations for a wider array of potential citizens than societies that try to maintain a high degree of uniformity .
And when you can choose from a bigger talent pool , over time you ’re going to do better .

Statement on Conference Report of HR 2346 , FY 2009 War Supplemental Appropriations
Mr. Speaker , I rise in strong opposition to this conference report on the War Supplemental Appropriations .
I wonder what happened to all of my colleagues who said they were opposed to the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
I wonder what happened to my colleagues who voted with me as I opposed every war supplemental request under the previous administration .
It seems , with very few exceptions , they have changed their position on the war now that the White House has changed hands .
I find this troubling .
As I have said while opposing previous war funding requests , a vote to fund the war is a vote in favor of the war .
Congress exercises its constitutional prerogatives through the power of the purse .
This conference report , being a Washington - style compromise , reflects one thing Congress agrees on : spending money we do not have .
So this compromise bill spends 15 percent more than the president requested , which is $ 9 billion more than in the original House bill and $ 14.6 billion more than the original Senate version .
Included in this final version — in addition to the $ 106 billion to continue the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq — is a $ 108 billion loan guarantee to the International Monetary Fund , allowing that destructive organization to continue spending taxpayer money to prop up corrupt elites and promote harmful economic policies overseas .
As Americans struggle through the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression , this emergency supplemental appropriations bill sends billions of dollars overseas as foreign aid .
Included in this appropriation is $ 660 million for Gaza , $ 555 million for Israel , $ 310 million for Egypt , $ 300 million for Jordan , and $ 420 million for Mexico .
Some $ 889 million will be sent to the United Nations for peacekeeping missions .
Almost one billion dollars will be sent overseas to address the global financial crisis outside our borders and nearly $ 8 billion will be spent to address a potential pandemic flu . 
Mr. Speaker , I continue to believe that the best way to support our troops is to bring them home from Iraq and Afghanistan .
If one looks at the original authorization for the use of force in Afghanistan , it is clear that the ongoing and expanding nation - building mission there has nothing to do with our goal of capturing and bringing to justice those who attacked the United States on September 11 , 2001 .
Our continued presence in Iraq and Afghanistan does not make us safer at home , but in fact it undermines our national security .
I urge my colleagues to defeat this reckless conference report .

The Best of Ron Paul
In the moments that followed the first bite , as the flavour of beef and bacon and cheese filled our mouths , we knew this was one of our more brilliant plans .
Of course , it did n’t start out that way .
It started out as a tongue - in - cheek joke , a nod to our mutual love of burgers .
But as my sister ’s trip from the coast to Cowtown neared , it morphed into a serious scheme .
The burger tour of southern Alberta was born .
You see , a truly great burger is more than the sum of its parts .
A solid , but not too filling , bun provides the backbone .
It needs to hold the burger together , soak up the juices from beef and sauce , but not be too tall , too bread -y or so flimsy it becomes an annoyance .
Sauces–relish , mustard , ketchup , special or otherwise– should add to the flavour and not overpower the patty taste .
Lettuce and tomato are optional .
Onion is not .
The burger should just fit into your hands and be bitten through without feeling you have to dislocate your jaw .
It should be messy .
Bonus points for burgers that cause juices to trickle down your hands .
( The trick , I would come to learn , is to turn your plate so the burger drippings fall onto your french fries . )
Establishing a plan took several e-mail exchanges and thorough research .
A cruise through the Chowhound online forums , suggestions from friends and even a photo posted on Flickr — a photo - sharing website — gave us our plan of attack : five burger joints in four days .
There were tentative discussions about beef detox after that point .
And so , to the journey .
From Calgary International Airport , we made our way to the first tour stop : Boogie ’s Burgers on Edmonton Trail .
The little sister was off to the races with a double patty burger , adorned with cheese , bacon and pickles .
( And a bacon , banana , peanut butter milkshake to wash it all down ; if I had n’t been around when she was born , I would swear she was adopted . ) I wanted a slower pace and went with a single with bacon and cheese .
The burgers were the size of my outstretched hand , with a tangy red sauce .
The buns were fresh - tasting , with a slightly crisp crust that gave nicely when bitten into .
Thick slices of bacon and melted cheddar cheese rounded out the burgers .
And they passed the requisite messy test with me having to go through several paper napkins .
We were off to a good start .
Day 2 took us down Highway 22 to Turner Valley for a stop at the Chuckwagon Cafe .
Charmed by the red barn exterior and the slightly kitschy decor inside , we were eager to see what this little restaurant had to offer .
We both ordered the House Burger , minus the mushrooms , featuring a six - ounce patty of beef raised on a Longview farm with no hormones or steroids , topped with fried onions , bacon and marble cheese .
After the plates were set down , the first five minutes were punctuated solely with the sounds of beef contentment , echoed by little more than groans of acknowledgment .
Mmmm .
Uh - huh .
Mmmm . Seriously .
The thick patty was juicy and flavourful , had nice charred bits and was well - spiced and complemented by the homemade relish .
For the next hour as we drove further south on Cowboy Trail–she marvelled at the expansive Prairie sky while we sang along with bubble gum pop songs – there were moments when we stopped to talk about those burgers again .
In High River , we pulled up to a little red-roofed burger shack whose reputation is well known .
The Hitchin ’
Post is a local favourite and the steady line of traffic in and out of the dirt parking lot surrounding the tiny takeout restaurant spoke volumes .
Cheeseburgers topped with a full slice of onion and sitting atop yellow mustard and relish were ordered up and washed down with orange soda .
The burgers were about the size of my palm and tasty , but more akin to a burger from a fair .
It filled the burger need , but not in the way that would keep us talking about them for days after .
By 11 a. m. the next morning , we were ready for round four : Rocky ’s Burger Bus –literally , an old red bus jammed into the city ’s southeast industrial area just off Blackfoot Trail , with a few picnic tables in behind .
The cheeseburgers were adorned with little more than a generous helping of mustard and relish and a piece of processed cheese .
But the thick wedge of beef was the star attraction of this meat - centric burger .
It was juicy and tender , likely because the patties are shaped by hand .
And it was hot off the grill , which was deliciously unexpected .
The final stop on the tour was at downtown steak house Saltlik , where friends joined us to try the double - fisted bacon cheeseburger .
This was not just a turn of phrase .
A thick patty topped with bacon , cheddar , a healthy tomato slice , lettuce and red onion , all jammed into a tall bun–two hands were definitely necessary .
But , as we entered a virtual beef coma at the end of day four , there was no debate about who served the best burger .
Even now , weeks later , I think about the Chuckwagon Cafe and how easy it would be to climb into my car and head south .
The sister has already marked it as a must - do for the next tour .

Herb de Provence Chicken
Here is another quick and easy dish for those of you ( me included ) who have hungry ones in your home hounding you for food after a long day .
When I get home for work and am starting dinner , almost without fail , Hubby is poking around the kitchen informing me that he is hungry ( like I did n’t know ) and picking at whatever I am making for dinner that night .
Like when he was stealing my sausage the other day .
I keep a wooden spoon handy so I am covered .
I have seen herbs de provence used on other blogs but I myself had never tried them .
The other day when I was at the grocery story I came upon this small jar of herbs de provence and decided to give it a try .
I usually try and buy and least one new and different ingredient every time I go grocery shopping .
I may not need it that day , but I will eventually come across a recipe that will call for that one ingredient and I will have it on hand . 😀
If you have been watching the Next Food Network Star you will quickly recognize where I got this idea from , if not you can just imagine that I am a genius and I came up with this all on my own .
It ’s really is super easy , I just dropped the chicken in the skillet , put another and when along making the rest of our dinner .
Herbs de Provence is a blend of thyme , rosemary , basil , marjoram , sage , fennel and lavender .
You can taste all the herbs especially the lavender , which makes all the difference .
It is not perfumey in any way , it is very light and delicate .
The chicken gets a nice crispy skin and is very juicy and tender .
It is perfect to server with fresh vegetables , pasta or potatoes .
It really can do with anything .
We were totally sucking the bones when we were all done .
Sometimes the best part is sucking and gnawing on the bone .
Oh and do n’t forget to lick your fingers .

Sex chromosomes originated from ordinary autosomes , and their evolution is characterized by continuous gene loss from the ancestral Y chromosome .
Here , we document a new feature of sex chromosome evolution : bursts of adaptive fixations on a newly formed X chromosome .
Taking advantage of the recently formed neo -X chromosome of Drosophila miranda , we compare patterns of DNA sequence variation at genes located on the neo -X to genes on the ancestral X chromosome .
This contrast allows us to draw inferences of selection on a newly formed X chromosome relative to background levels of adaptation in the genome while controlling for demographic effects .
Chromosome - wide synonymous diversity on the neo - X is reduced 2 - fold relative to the ancestral X , as expected under recent and recurrent directional selection .
Several statistical tests employing various features of the data consistently identify 10 % – 15 % of neo - X genes as targets of recent adaptive evolution but only 1 % –3 % of genes on the ancestral X .
In addition , both the rate of adaptation and the fitness effects of adaptive substitutions are estimated to be roughly an order of magnitude higher for neo -X genes relative to genes on the ancestral X .
Thus , newly formed X chromosomes are not passive players in the evolutionary process of sex chromosome differentiation , but respond adaptively to both their sex - biased transmission and to Y chromosome degeneration , possibly through demasculinization of their gene content and the evolution of dosage compensation .
Sex chromosomes have evolved independently many times in both animals and plants from ordinary chromosomes .
Much research on sex chromosome evolution has focused on the degeneration and loss of genes from the Y chromosome .
Here , we describe another principle of sex chromosome evolution : bursts of adaptive fixations on a newly formed X chromosome .
By employing a comparative population genomics approach and taking advantage of the recently formed sex chromosomes in the fruit fly Drosophila miranda , we show that rates of adaptation are increased about 10 - fold on a newly formed X chromosome relative to background levels of selection in the genome .
This suggests that a young X chromosome responds adaptively to both its female - biased transmission and to Y chromosome degeneration .
Thus , contrary to the traditional view of being passive players , the X chromosome has a very active role in the evolutionary process of sex chromosome differentiation .
Here , we describe patterns of DNA sequence polymorphism at many gene fragments across the D. miranda neo - X chromosome and compare them to gene fragments surveyed from the ancestral X chromosome .
Contrasting patterns of polymorphism of genes from the recently formed neo -X with genes located on the ancestral X allows us to control , to some extent , for recent demographic events and life - history differences that otherwise pose a problem for identifying adaptive evolution using population variability data [ 25 – 27 ] .
Thus , the unusual chromosomal configuration of D. miranda enables us to test for an elevation in rates of adaptation on a recently formed X chromosome relative to background rates of adaptive evolution in the genome [ 28 ] .
The ancestral X chromosome of D. miranda consists of two arms ( Figure 1 ) ; X - L ( Muller 's element A ) , which is part of the X chromosome in all species of the genus Drosophila ( and > 60 million years [ MY ] old , [ 22 ] ) , and X - R ( Muller 's element D ) , which became part of the X only approximately 10 MY ago , and this X - autosome fusion is shared by species in the D. affinis and D. pseudoobscura subgroup [ 11 , 12 ] .
Interestingly , X - R has already acquired the classical characteristics of an evolved X chromosome , including the evolution of dosage compensation over all its length [ 11 , 12 ] and demasculinization of its gene content [ 17 ] .
The neo -sex chromosomes of D. miranda ( Muller 's element C ) were formed about 1 MY ago ( ∼ 10N e generations ) [ 23 ] , and appear to be in transition from an ordinary autosome to a pair of heteromorphic sex chromosomes [ 4 ] .
Specifically , about half of all genes have become pseudogenized on the neo -Y chromosome of D. miranda [ 24 ] , and some genes on the neo - X are acquiring dosage compensation [ 11 , 12 ] .
The ancestral X chromosome consists of two chromosomal arms ; X - L ( light grey ) , which is part of the X chromosome in all species of the genus Drosophila ( >60 MY old ) , and X - R ( medium grey ) , a former autosome that fused to X - L approximately 10 MY ago .
The neo -sex chromosomes ( dark grey ) were formed by the fusion of another autosome to the ancestral Y chromosome about 1 MY ago .
The neo - X chromosome segregates with the X chromosome in D. miranda , but is not fused to it .
X - R has already acquired all the stereotypical properties of X chromosomes , whereas the neo -sex chromosomes are in transition from an ordinary autosome to a pair of heteromorphic sex chromosomes .
To test for signatures of pervasive adaptive evolution at the DNA level on a newly formed X chromosome , we take advantage of the unusual sex chromosomes ( termed neo - sex chromosomes ) of Drosophila miranda ( Figure 1 ) .
In the genus Drosophila , fusions between autosomes and the ancestral sex chromosomes ( that is , the original X and Y chromosomes shared by all members of the genus Drosophila ) have repeatedly created so - called neo - sex chromosomes [ 19 – 21 ] .
As a result of such a fusion , one chromosome — the neo - Y — is cotransmitted with the Y chromosome through males only .
Given the lack of crossing over in male Drosophila , such fusions restrict recombination between the male - limited neo -Y chromosome and its former homolog ( the neo - X chromosome ) .
In fact , the neo - Y chromosome is completely sheltered from recombination and thus exposed to the evolutionary forces causing Y degeneration [ 19 – 21 ] .
The neo - X chromosome , in contrast , can still recombine in females and cosegregates with the ancestral X chromosome ( i.e. , it is present in two copies in females and one copy in males ) .
Over evolutionary time periods , neo -sex chromosomes of several Drosophila species have evolved the classical properties of ancestral sex chromosomes ( i.e. , the neo - Y chromosome degenerates , and the neo - X chromosome evolves dosage compensation [ 19 – 21 ] ) .
In particular , genes on X chromosomes are faced with several unusual challenges relative to autosomal genes .
First , the degeneration of the Y chromosome creates a gene dose problem for X - linked genes in males [ 10 ] , resulting in the evolution of dosage compensation mechanisms on the X [ 10 – 13 ] .
Another consequence of Y chromosome degeneration is the hemizygosity of X - linked genes in males , increasing the efficacy of natural selection acting on recessive mutations ( known as faster - X evolution [ 14 ] ) .
Finally , sex - biased transmission of X chromosomes can result in an accumulation , or deficiency , of genes with female - or male - beneficial functions [ 15 – 17 ] .
Indeed , ancestral X chromosomes have often evolved dosage compensation mechanisms , and male - specific genes are depleted ( i.e. , demasculinization of the X chromosome ; [ 11 , 12 , 17 ] ) .
Genes on a newly formed X chromosome may therefore undergo accelerated evolutionary change relative to background levels of adaptation in the genome , to adjust to their altered genomic environment [ 13 , 18 ] .
Sex chromosomes have originated independently many times in both animals and plants from ordinary autosomes [ 1 , 2 ] .
Their evolution is characterized by a loss of gene function on the nonrecombining Y chromosome , as seen in many taxa [ 3 – 5 ] .
For example , of the roughly 1,000 genes originally present on the ancestral Y chromosome of humans , only a few dozen remain [ 3 ] .
Conventionally , X chromosomes were often viewed as static entities in the evolutionary process of sex chromosome differentiation , with relatively little change occurring that would distinguish the X from the autosome from which it was derived [ 2 ] .
However , several recent studies have shown that the X chromosome has also undergone substantial evolutionary modifications ( reviewed in [ 6 – 9 ] ) .
Results and Discussion
Reduced Diversity on the Neo - X Natural selection can increase the frequency of a beneficial mutation in a population , thereby reducing neutral variation in the genomic region linked to the advantageous allele ( i.e. , a selective sweep [ 29,30 ] ) .
Thus , one signature of directional selection at the DNA level is a reduction in neutral variation in genomic regions surrounding the targets of selection [ 29 ] .
To test for increased rates of adaptation on the D. miranda neo - X chromosome , we surveyed DNA sequence polymorphism at 152 gene fragments across the neo -X and compare them to 112 gene fragments from the ancestral X chromosome ( 60 genes from X - L and 52 from X - R ) .
Certain classes of genes tend to undergo increased rates of adaptive evolution in Drosophila , such as genes showing sex - biased expression or genes involved in some biological pathways [ 31,32 ] .
Genes on both the neo -X and the ancestral X chromosome were selected randomly with regard to gene function or expression patterns , and no significant heterogeneity in gene count among gene ontology classes or patterns of sex - biased expression was detected between loci on the ancestral X chromosome and the neo - X ( see Tables S1–S4 ) .
Estimated levels of synonymous variation and synonymous divergence to an outgroup species are similar for genes on X - L and X - R ( mean π s = 0.51 % vs. π s = 0.71 % ; Wilcoxon two - sample test , p > 0.05 and mean K s = 4.26 % vs. K s = 3.98 % between D. miranda and D. pseudoobscura ; Wilcoxon two - sample test , p > 0.05 ) , consistent with observations that X - R has reached the typical properties of an evolved X chromosome ( i.e. , X - R appears fully dosage compensated in males and its gene content shows a similar deficiency of male - biased genes as X - L , the ancestral X chromosome ; [ 12,17 ] ) .
Table 1 summarizes average levels of synonymous diversity across the genomic regions studied .
Synonymous site diversity is reduced by about 50 % on the neo - X compared to the ancestral X ( average π s = 0.33 % vs. π s = 0.60 % ; Wilcoxon two - sample test , p < 3e - 6 ) , while levels of synonymous divergence to an outgroup species between the chromosomes are similar ( K s = 4.36 % vs. K s = 4.13 % for the neo -X and the ancestral X chromosome between D. miranda and D. pseudoobscura ; Wilcoxon two - sample test , p = 0.13 ) , suggesting that the two chromosomes have similar mutation rates .
Comparison of polymorphism and divergence levels at synonymous sites on the neo - X versus the ancestral X using a Hudson - Kreitman - Aguadé ( HKA ) test [ 30 ] confirms that the reduced diversity observed at neo - X genes is not attributable to a lower mutation rate ( HKA test p < 10−4 , see Table S6 ) .
Additionally , many more invariant loci are observed on the neo - X chromosome ( 23 vs. three genes , Table 1 ) .

Nonequilibrium demography , such as recent population bottlenecks , or differences in life - history strategies between males and females can cause levels of diversity to differ between sex chromosomes and autosomes [ 25 – 27 ] .
However , because the ancestral X chromosome and the neo - X chromosome show identical patterns of inheritance , demography and life history are expected to influence patterns of diversity on the X and the neo - X in a similar manner [ 25 – 27 ] .
Note , however , that the neo - X chromosome was segregating as an autosome until the formation of the neo -sex chromosomes roughly 1 MY ago .
This event was presumably associated with a modest decline in the population size of the neo - X ( from 2N to 1.5N ) , but is sufficiently ancient ( ∼10N e generations ago ) to not leave signatures in current levels of population variation [ 33,34 ] .
Thus , the ancestral X should serve as an adequate control for demographic effects on the neo - X , which suggests that natural selection is responsible for reduced levels of variability on the neo -X relative to the ancestral X .
We employed several statistical approaches in order to quantify rates of adaptive evolution on the neo - X versus the ancestral X .
More Recent Selective Sweeps on the Neo - X Recent positive selection results not only in a local reduction of variation in the genomic region surrounding the target of selection , but also in a skew in the frequency distribution of mutations surrounding the target of selection ( i.e. , the hitchhiking effect ; [ 29,35 ] ) .
In particular , recent adaptive evolution in the genome results in an excess of both low - and high - frequency mutations relative to neutral expectations [ 33,36,37 ] .
Such approaches to detect selection using population variability data cannot be applied to invariant loci , but the 129/152 polymorphic neo-X–linked and 109/112 polymorphic X - linked loci can be examined .
A composite likelihood ratio ( CLR ) test [ 38 ] that utilizes these population variation patterns to detect recent adaptations reveals that a greater proportion of genes located on the neo - X chromosome relative to the ancestral X reject a model of neutral sequence evolution in favor of a genetic hitchhiking model at the 5 % significance level ( 19/129 testable neo -X genes , 15 % , vs. 3/109 testable X - linked genes , 3 % , Table 1 ; p = 0.0013 , Fisher exact test ) .
Further , the distributions of CLR test p-values for the neo -X and X are significantly different from one another ( p = 2e−9 , Kolmogorov - Smirnov test ) .
Although the CLR test is not robust to some demographic scenarios [ 34 ] , the ancestral X chromosome functions as an internal control to account for such effects ( see above ) .
Thus , we detect about 5 - fold more adaptive events on the newly formed neo -X compared to the ancestral X .
To further evaluate evidence in support of more adaptation on the neo - X , we also applied a goodness - of - fit test ( GOF test ) [ 34 ] to genes rejecting the CLR test .
This statistic was proposed to assess the fit of data to a selective sweep model , in order to identify loci with significant CLR tests that may be explained by demographic effects .
Only one of the three genes that rejected the CLR test on the ancestral X chromosome were consistent with a selective sweep model using the GOF test , whereas 13 of the 19 neo - X genes rejecting the CLR test were consistent with a recent selective sweep ( Table 1 ) .
Adaptive evolution also leaves characteristic signatures in patterns of linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) , with reduced LD across the target of selection , and increased LD in genomic regions flanking the target [ 39 – 41 ] .
The ω max statistic [ 39 ] was used to identify loci under selection based on these patterns of LD .
Again we detect more selection on the neo - X chromosome ( 7/129 testable genes , 5 % , reject neutrality at the 5 % significance level ) compared to the ancestral X ( 1/109 testable genes , 1 % , reject neutrality at the 5 % significance level , Table 1 ; p = 0.07 Fisher exact test ) .
The genes identified as targets of recent adaptive evolution using the ω max statistics are a subset of those identified with the CLR + GOF test .
Thus , several locus - by - locus tests identify a much larger fraction of genes having undergone recent adaptive evolution on the neo - X chromosome compared to the ancestral X .
Note that the locus - by - locus tests for selection are not corrected for multiple testing , because our main interest lies in quantifying the relative excess of statistical tests rejecting neutrality on the neo -X relative to the ancestral X , and not the absolute number of significant rejections .
A similar excess of adaptive evolution of neo -X–linked genes relative to the ancestral X is found if we use the false discovery rate to account for multiple testing ( see Table S7 ) .
In addition , the above locus - by - locus tests of selection assume that the genomic regions surveyed are unlinked .
Indeed , the genes surveyed on the neo -X and the ancestral X chromosome appear mostly independent from each other , with levels of LD being similarly low between loci ( unpublished data ) .
Also , the genomic regions we identified as having undergone recent selection on the neo - X show little evidence of clustering ( the median distance between loci using the D. pseudoobscura genome sequence as a guide is 0.97
Mb for the 19 significant loci identified using the CLR test , and only two regions rejecting this test are adjacent to each other ) .
In addition , many of the gene fragments studied here were mapped previously by in situ hybridization experiments , and found to be scattered along the polytene chromosomes of D. miranda [ 42 – 44 ] .
Thus , most selective sweeps identified on the neo -X represent independent events .
A more formal approach to take account of multiple testing and linkage when comparing rates of evolution on the ancestral and the newly formed X chromosome is to consider all loci simultaneously rather than testing them individually .
To this end , we employed a composite likelihood method ( the maximized composite likelihood surface test [ MCLS test ] ) [ 45 ] for detecting positive selection , which uses a similar likelihood framework as the CLR test .
As opposed to the CLR or GOF tests , however , which use a specific population genetic model as the null ( the equilibrium neutral model or a selective sweep model , respectively ) , the MCLS statistic derives the null model from the empirical data itself .
In this way , the test seeks to identify loci that show unusual patterns of variation relative to the other loci ( the “ background loci ” [ 45 ] ) in the genomic screen .
To determine significance of the test statistic , it is still necessary to simulate data based on an explicit model [ 45 ] .
In our implementation , we use the background allele frequency distribution ( the background site - frequency spectrum ) obtained from the ancestral X , to test for selection on both the ancestral X and the neo - X chromosome .
Again , we find evidence for many more genomic regions having undergone recent positive selection on the neo - X ( 13 nonoverlapping regions ) compared to the ancestral X ( three genomic regions , Figure 2 ; p = 0.035 , Fisher exact test ) .
The distributions of the minimum p-value windows are significantly different for loci surveyed on the neo -X and the ancestral X ( p = 0.022 , Kolmogorov - Smirnov test ) .
All 13 neo -X regions identified as targets of recent adaptive evolution using the MCLS approach correspond to loci identified as positively selected using the locus - by - locus CLR +GOF test ( above ) .

The horizontal line indicates the 5 % cutoff values ( LR crit ) as determined separately for the X ( LR crit = 4.5 ) and the neo - X ( LR crit = 2.7 ) by simulation under a neutral equilibrium model .
More significant peaks are identified on the neo - X , suggesting that more recent selective sweeps have occurred on this chromosome .
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000082.g002
Could other systematic biases — such as differences in overall recombination rates or levels of variability between sampled loci— result in differential power to detect selection on the two chromosomes ?
Specifically , selective sweeps are more easily identified in low - recombining regions due to the increased effects of hitchhiking [ 34 ] , and statistical tests have reduced power to detect selection if levels of variability are low [ 34 ] .
Recombination rates do not appear to systematically differ between loci on the neo -X and the ancestral X chromosome ( average levels of LD , as measured by Wall 's B or Q [ 46 ] , are not significantly different within loci on the two chromosomes ; p > 0.2 , Kolmogorov - Smirnov test ) .
However , the neo - X chromosome has significantly reduced levels of variability and more invariant genes relative to the X ( Table 1 ) , as expected under a model of recurrent selection .
Methods based on the site - frequency spectrum ( CLR , GOF , and MCLS ) and LD ( ω max ) have reduced power to detect selection when levels of variability are low ( and can not be applied to invariant loci ) , implying less power to detect selective events on the neo - X chromosome .
This suggests that the difference in rates of adaptive evolution between the neo -X and the ancestral X is likely underestimated .
Nevertheless , utilizing many different features of our data , we consistently estimate that the fraction of genes having undergone recent adaptive evolution on the newly formed X chromosome increases 5 – 10 - fold relative to background levels of adaptation on the ancestral X .
Increased Rates of Adaptation on the Neo - X
To what extent are rates of adaptation accelerated on the neo -X ?
To evaluate the difference in rates of adaptation on the neo - X versus the ancestral X using all loci ( including invariant ones ) , we estimate parameters of a recurrent selection model for each chromosome .
Under a model of recurrent adaptation , the average reduction in levels of variability depends on the rate at which adaptive substitutions occur ( 2N e λ ) and their average effect on fitness ( s ) [ 47 ] .
We use a recently developed approximate Bayesian approach [ 48 ] to estimate these parameters .
This approach uses multiple summary statistics of the population variation data ( see Materials and Methods ) , to obtain maximum a posteriori ( MAP ) estimates of both 2N e λ and s. Figure 3 shows the marginal and joint posterior distributions of the rate and the strength of selection inferred for loci on the ancestral X and the neo - X .
The MAP estimate of the rate of adaptive substitutions again is roughly 10 - fold higher for neo -X–linked genes compared to genes that are located on the ancestral X ( Figure 3 ) .
Interestingly , we also estimate the strength of selection to be an order of magnitude higher for genes on the neo - X chromosome ( Figure 3 ) .
Importantly , MAP estimates of the strength and the rate of sweeps for the neo - X fall outside of the 95 % credibility intervals for the estimates on the X .
Thus , not only does adaptive evolution appear to be more frequent on a newly formed X chromosome , but also the selective benefit of mutations arising may be larger for genes that have only recently become X - linked relative to genes that have been evolving under a stable chromosomal configuration .
This may be expected if genes on a young X chromosome are further away from their optimum fitness [ 49 ] , since they experience a new genomic environment ( i.e. , they used to segregate as an autosome but have only recently become X - linked ) .

Originally posted on China Journal :
With the continued growth in China ’s official foreign - exchange reserves now having pushed them past the $ 2 trillion mark , the debate over what to do with them shows no sign of dying down .
There ’s an increasingly strong sentiment in China that these funds should be used to benefit the nation , rather than being lent to the U.S. and other rich countries .
Premier Wen Jiabao said earlier this week that China should “ combine the use of foreign exchange reserves with the ‘ going out ’ strategy of enterprises ” ( in Chinese here ) .
That echoed earlier government statements — a deputy administrator at the State Administration of Foreign Exchange , for example , also raised the idea in February of using the reserves to support Chinese companies ’ growing outward investments .
Despite such high - level official backing for this idea , there ’s no evidence that China has actually done anything about it .
China Investment Corp. , the nation ’s sovereign wealth fund , does own shares in several foreign companies .
But it has been careful to present itself as a financial investor uninterested in operational control and its deals do n’t seem to be coordinated with those of ordinary Chinese enterprises .
The sheer size of the reserves does give a daunting impression of China ’s financial firepower .
As Eswar Prasad and Isaac Sorkin note in a new piece for the Brookings Institution , $ 2 trillion is equivalent to :
all the land and property in New York City , Los Angeles and Boston
73 % of the market capitalization of the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the end of June
25 % percent of the market capitalization of the S&P 500 at the end of June
But the sheer size of the reserves is increasingly a handicap for China , which would find it impossible in practice to actually buy any of the above assets .
It is restricted to markets large enough to absorb the enormous amount of funds it has to work with .
“ China has begun to diversify into gold and other commodities , and has also agreed to buy some SDR - denominated IMF bonds .
But the amounts involved pale in comparison to either the stock or even the monthly pace of reserve accumulation , ” Prasad and Sorkin write .
They think there ’s no real likelihood that China is going to be able to do anything different with the reserves than what it is already doing : parking a very large percentage of them in U.S. government debt .
And the latest figures from the U.S. Treasury show that China continues to buy US Treasury bills and bonds on a massive scale .
I ’m looking for some advice .
My husband recently injured himself at work .
He drives a forklift .
When he came in one morning , the seatbelt was broken , but he was told to drive it anyway .
Then , of all things imaginable , someone drove another machine into his .
He fell , broke his arm , and seriously bruised his pelvis .
We ’ve talked to a lawyer about suing for his work injury , and the lawyer thinks we have a case .
That ’s great , because of his medical bills , but now we have another problem .
My husband ’s doctor prescribed him some painkillers for his arm .
We told him that my husband had addiction issues earlier in life , and he said he ’d give a light dose to help avoid that and to be careful about taking the pills only when prescribed on the bottle .
We reluctantly agreed , and we took the pills with us .
It had n’t been three days , and already my husband was sneaking pills .
He was n’t being honest with me about it , but I kept a count and I kept a journal .
I contacted his doctor , but the only advice he gave was to throw away the pills .
When I asked for something else for the pain , he said he could give another prescription but that they all had some addictive qualities .
This , obviously , was n’t much help .
I confronted my husband about the pills , and he admitted it and apologized , but he said he still needed them , that he grew anxious without them , and that his arm hurt when it went more than two hours without taking some ( the bottle says he should take two once every eight hours ) .
In the end , I took the bottle and flushed them down the toilet .
My husband is having a tough time with all this .
He ’s been shivering on the couch for the last day , in a cold sweat .
He says it ’s worse than the last time he went through withdrawal years ago .
He ’s begged me to call the doctor and get more pills .
Unfortunately , I do n’t think there ’s an easy solution to any of this , but my question is n’t about my husband .
It ’s about lawsuits .
Is there a case for medical malpractice because our doctor prescribed pills knowing my husband is a former addict ?
Our other lawyer does n’t deal with medical issues , and the lawyer he recommended charges for consultations .
Since my husband is n’t working right now , I do n’t want to spend that money if the answer is no .
Does anybody have any idea if I should pursue this ?
I ’ve looked at some lawyer sites , but I do n’t see anything that is directly related .
Perhaps improper treatment ?
Would that count ?
And how much would we be entitled to if we pursued this ?
Please , if anyone has any advice let me know .
I do n’t know anything about the law , but I think this is a time - sensitive issue .
And besides , I want to collect all the evidence I can if there ’s a case to be made .
Sony enjoyed a flood of press last week with the announcement of the newly redesigned — and less expensive — PlayStation 3 .
Directly after the announcement executives were conducting interviews , the gaming blogs were desperate for any and all news , and in a masterstroke Sony sent production units of the hardware to some news sites ; the unboxing videos were online hours after the announcement .
" We expect a material and substantial increase in sales and purchase intent , " Sony 's John Koller told us in rather blunt fashion .
With a lower price and excitement around the hardware , one question remained : what will Microsoft do ?
Ars Technica reached out to Microsoft for comment on the news .
" A smaller console size does not necessarily mean more value for consumers , " Ars was told .
" Starting at $ 199 , Xbox 360 offers the best gaming and entertainment experience at the most consumer - friendly price on the market . "
Microsoft expects the 360 to be the " entertainment center " into the next decade , and the platform will be " constantly evolving . "
They also pointed out that Natal will provide gamers with new ways to play games .
The statement was somewhat snarky , but mostly by the numbers : it says the 360 is still better , it will continue to be , and the fight will be won on hardware and software .
In North America , the 360 has outsold the PS3 consistently , and in fact Microsoft has the only system that has shown year - to - date growth from 2008 ; even Nintendo can't match its lofty numbers from last year .
Sony does n't have to just show some growth , it has to catch up with its competitors .
We 've also long known that the PS3 Slim would launch right around the time that Microsoft drops the price on the 360 Elite , and scans from store circulars are beginning to materialize showing a $ 300 Elite coming August 30 .
The company is n't willing to give up the value game to Sony .
Let 's move the $ 300 Elite from the " rumor " file into " fact . "
It 's coming .
It 's also worth pointing out that it 's much more of a hardware update than a price drop ; you 're simply getting more storage space for your money .
That 's a good thing —
Microsoft wants you to buy TV shows and movies and Games on Demand — but it 's not actually cheaper .
A better value , surely .
But not cheaper .
Microsoft has enjoyed large margins by overcharging for its hard drives , making this price drop a painless one in terms of hardware cost .
While the $ 200 Arcade model is still the least expensive option , without a hard drive the system is n't suitable for anyone but the most casual gamers .
This puts Microsoft and Sony on a level playing field in the US : both systems come with 120GB hard drives standard , and both sell for $ 300 .
While the press and the fanboys will be watching this month 's NPD numbers with great expectation , the gamers win : both systems are either less expensive , or give you more bang for your buck .
That 's a good thing , no matter how you want to slice it .
A stripper accused of raping the best man at a bucks party has been found not guilty of the charge in a Melbourne court .
After less than a day of deliberation , the Victorian County Court jury found Linda Maree Naggs , 40 , whose stage name is Tiffany , not guilty of the charge .
In evidence , the court heard Ms Naggs was the second stripper for the night at the September 2007 Mornington Peninsula party and came armed with a whip , vibrator and a " strap - on penis shaped " sex toy .
The best man gave evidence at the trial of being pressured by his peers into sitting on the seat where Ms Naggs performed her routine .
Witnesses described how at one point the best man " sort of screamed " and winced .
The best man reported the alleged anal rape to police the next day .
Ms Naggs appeared relieved as the verdict was delivered and later wept as Judge Tim Wood formally discharged her .
Outside court , her lawyer James Dowsley said his client wished to thank the jury for the attention they gave to the case and their verdict .
Ms Naggs smiled but refused to answer reporters ' questions as she left the court area .
The complainant was not in court .

At a movie studio , once the pesky task of actually making a movie is out of the way the guys in the suits go to work .
Their job is to bend and manipulate the movie footage into a short trailer that will tell you exactly what they think you want to hear .
And it should be noted at the outset , they think you 're retarded .
5 Show Scenes That Are Not In The Movie

Superbad's 30 second trailer promised that " Every generation has one iconic movie that is ... quoted non-stop ...
Superbad is that film . "
That 's high praise for movie producers ; while we might mutter " douchebag " when a grown man emerges from a public restroom , fans his crotch and says , " Do not go in there ! " in his best Jim Carrey inflection , the marketing community considers that shit free advertising .
What makes less sense is why , in a movie that 's chock full of quotable nuggets , they chose " McLovin , sounds like a sexy hamburger ! " to be the one line that turned up in the trailer that bragged about quotability .
You know , since that line was so memorable that the filmmakers left it out of the movie altogether .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
It did n't matter that the line was in no way quotable since it was a response to a name that does n't exist anywhere outside of the movie , nor did it matter that both Jonah Hill and Michael Cera had funnier TV - friendly lines that were actually in the film .
The studio wanted a line by Seth Rogen since he was in the previous summer 's " once in a generation " quotable movie , Knocked Up .
So the suits rifled through the footage left on the cutting room floor until they found a Seth Rogen line that did n't contain the word fuck , and we got a preview that did a great job hiding the fact that Superbad was actually pretty funny .

" This is a line in a movie ! "
But what happens when marketing folks do n't have an over abundance of good material to discard in favor of a deleted scene ?
The trailer for Black Christmas got around that problem by featuring a few moments that were shot just for the trailer .
And by a few moments , we mean just about everything you see in the trailer was shot just for the trailer .
According to the IMDB page , the list includes :
An unknown caller saying , " All is calm , all is bright , who is in my house tonight ? "
A woman rubbing the snow off her car and a hand reaching through it .
A woman falling off the roof tangled in Christmas lights .

For all of the actual film footage the trailer shows us , Black Christmas very well could be a remake of A Miracle on 34th Street starring Danny Glover and Webster .

‘ Shrink to Survive ’ – Entire Neighborhoods In U.S. To Be Bulldozed
Dozens of US cities may have entire neighbourhoods bulldozed as part of drastic “ shrink to survive ” proposals being considered by the Obama administration to tackle economic decline .
The government looking at expanding a pioneering scheme in Flint , one of the poorest US cities , which involves razing entire districts and returning the land to nature .
Local politicians believe the city must contract by as much as 40 per cent , concentrating the dwindling population and local services into a more viable area .
The radical experiment is the brainchild of Dan Kildee , treasurer of Genesee County , which includes Flint .
Having outlined his strategy to Barack Obama during the election campaign , Mr Kildee has now been approached by the US government and a group of charities who want him to apply what he has learnt to the rest of the country .
Mr Kildee said he will concentrate on 50 cities , identified in a recent study by the Brookings Institution , an influential Washington think - tank , as potentially needing to shrink substantially to cope with their declining fortunes .
Most are former industrial cities in the “ rust belt ” of America ’s Mid-West and North East .
They include Detroit , Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , Baltimore and Memphis .
In Detroit , shattered by the woes of the US car industry , there are already plans to split it into a collection of small urban centres separated from each other by countryside .
“ The real question is not whether these cities shrink – we ’re all shrinking – but whether we let it happen in a destructive or sustainable way , ” said Mr Kildee .
“ Decline is a fact of life in Flint .
Resisting it is like resisting gravity . ”
Karina Pallagst , director of the Shrinking Cities in a Global Perspective programme at the University of California , Berkeley , said there was “ both a cultural and political taboo ” about admitting decline in America .
“ Places like Flint have hit rock bottom .
They ’re at the point where it ’s better to start knocking a lot of buildings down , ” she said .
Flint , sixty miles north of Detroit , was the original home of General Motors .
The car giant once employed 79,000 local people but that figure has shrunk to around 8,000 .
Unemployment is now approaching 20 per cent and the total population has almost halved to 110,000 .
The exodus – particularly of young people – coupled with the consequent collapse in property prices , has left street after street in sections of the city almost entirely abandoned .
In the city centre , the once grand Durant Hotel – named after William Durant , GM ’s founder – is a symbol of the city ’s decline , said Mr Kildee .
The large building has been empty since 1973 , roughly when Flint ’s decline began .
Regarded as a model city in the motor industry ’s boom years , Flint may once again be emulated , though for very different reasons .
But Mr Kildee , who has lived there nearly all his life , said he had first to overcome a deeply ingrained American cultural mindset that “ big is good ” and that cities should sprawl – Flint covers 34 square miles .
He said : “ The obsession with growth is sadly a very American thing .
Across the US , there ’s an assumption that all development is good , that if communities are growing they are successful .
If they ’re shrinking , they ’re failing . ”
But some Flint dustcarts are collecting just one rubbish bag a week , roads are decaying , police are very understaffed and there were simply too few people to pay for services , he said .
If the city did n’t downsize it will eventually go bankrupt , he added .
Flint ’s recovery efforts have been helped by a new state law passed a few years ago which allowed local governments to buy up empty properties very cheaply .
They could then knock them down or sell them on to owners who will occupy them .
The city wants to specialise in health and education services , both areas which cannot easily be relocated abroad .
The local authority has restored the city ’s attractive but formerly deserted centre but has pulled down 1,100 abandoned homes in outlying areas .
Mr Kildee estimated another 3,000 needed to be demolished , although the city boundaries will remain the same .
Already , some streets peter out into woods or meadows , no trace remaining of the homes that once stood there .
Choosing which areas to knock down will be delicate but many of them were already obvious , he said .
The city is buying up houses in more affluent areas to offer people in neighbourhoods it wants to demolish .
Nobody will be forced to move , said Mr Kildee .
“ Much of the land will be given back to nature .
People will enjoy living near a forest or meadow , ” he said .
Mr Kildee acknowledged that some fellow Americans considered his solution “ defeatist ” but he insisted it was “ no more defeatist than pruning an overgrown tree so it can bear fruit again ” .

( CNN ) -- Blog fans in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , saw PittGirl as their masked superhero -- a comedian and local commentator who jibed the mayor without reserve and ranted freely about her hatred of pigeons .
Virginia Montanez says she was fired because she revealed her identity as a local blogger .
But despite her effort to keep her real name secret , people started to figure out who PittGirl was .
Feeling pressure to take control of her identity before someone else outed her , PittGirl on Wednesday posted pictures of herself on her blog and introduced readers to her real - world self : Virginia Montanez , a 35 - year - old married mother of two who worked in the nonprofit sector .
" My friends and family call me Ginny , " she wrote on her blog .
" But you can continue to call me Your Majesty , because I 've grown accustomed . "
On Thursday morning , Montanez was fired from her job because of her online persona , she said .
Montanez 's and other online coming - out stories highlight the complicated way people view anonymity on the Internet and the high stakes that come with trying to keep up an online persona .
The reasons people want to be anonymous online vary .
Political whistle blowers fear retribution ; employees want to separate the personal from the professional ; artists want their work to stand up without an attached biography ; and some writers like Montanez take on a sort of Everyman quality by keeping their real names off their posts .
But there also are reasons why a person with an online persona might want to come out of the closet .
Some anonymous bloggers , like PittGirl , worry their veils of anonymity will be pulled back against their will , and plenty of news events validate their fears .
Earlier this week , for example , a New York Supreme Court judge forced Google to reveal the identity of a blogger who had been posting rants about onetime cover girl Liskula Cohen on Blogger.com , which Google owns .
No true anonymity
That case , and similar ones before it , send the message that the cloak of online anonymity easily can be lifted , said Judith Donath , a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University .
But it 's difficult to say whether the Web is becoming more or less anonymous , she said .
" What 's increasing is the range of forums and the types of anonymous environments people have to choose among , " she said .
Some sites , like Facebook , encourage people to give lots of information about their real - world selves .
Blogs are more of a mixed bag , she said , where many people write under assumed names or put their words in the mouths of invented characters .
But such split identities can easily be merged -- either through the judicial process or by using technology .
Courts have set general guidelines that a plaintiff must meet before forcing a person out of online anonymity .
But the rules are still in the making and are up for interpretation , said Daniel Solove , a law professor at the George Washington University Law School and author of " The Future of Reputation . "
On one end of the spectrum , a court could out a blogger simply because a legal action is filed against the person .
That 's troublesome because any good attorney could leverage the courts simply to expose a person 's identity , he said .
At the other extreme , a judge could say a plaintiff must prove the blogger defamed someone before forcing a company like Google to reveal the person 's identity .
Technology also can be used to unmask someone .
Matt Zimmerman , senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which advocates for the rights of anonymous speech , said there are tools people can use to try to hide their footprints online .
But none is 100 percent effective , he said .
That leaves some online writers who use pseudonyms in the stressful situation of not knowing if or when their real names will be revealed .
Blogging waiter wants publicity
For Steve Dublanica , a New York City waiter who ragged on his customers for years through a blog called Waiter Rant , the tension of being outed gnawed at his stomach like a bad cheeseburger .
Dublanica said his boss and co-workers knew of his blog .
But as his site got more and more popular , people started having contests to figure out who he was .
He valued his secrecy because he says it afforded him creative freedom and access to good material .
" If [ the customers ] know you 're going to write down what they 're saying or what they 're doing they tend to act differently , " he said .
Dublanica did n't out himself because of the stress of keeping the secret , though .
He got a book deal .
And he wanted the publicity and recognition that came with it .
" The nice thing about not being anonymous is I can take credit for all the work I do , " he said .
" The bad stuff ... was that it was terrifying in the beginning .
You just did n't know how people were going to treat you . "
Alaska blogger outed by politician
Jeanne Devon , a 43 - year - old political blogger in Alaska , had her identity revealed after a state legislator published her name in a newsletter .
Devon , who blogs on a site called The Mudflats , says she has mixed feeling about being forced out of the closet .
In one sense , she says , she was able to be more herself while writing under an assumed name .
" There are things that you know , or that you feel sort of in your heart of hearts , that you might not want to put out there in a public way " with your name attached , she said .
" If people always spoke without filters , we 'd learn a lot more . "
She also says she has felt more support from her readers and her community since her real name was published .
Some bloggers who post under their real names say that those who write under pseudonyms have something to hide or do n't want to be held accountable to their audiences .
Getting ' dooced '
Heather B. Armstrong , who was fired from her job after her employer discovered her blog , Dooce , where she posted under her real name , said there are few valid reasons a blogger should veil his or her identity .
" I think if you 're doing something anonymously you 've got some issues going on , " she said .
" There 's a reason that you 're hiding . "
People now use the term " dooced " to refer to being fired because of a personal blog .
Armstrong , who writes about her family , says she 's received all kinds of hate mail -- from people who call her kids ugly to those who tell her she 's an unfit mother and should have her children taken away from her .
Being honest about her identity has helped Armstrong get through those criticisms and through other hard times .
" I credit my audience with saving my life back when I had postpartum depression because of all of the encouraging e-mails they sent me , " she said .
" The good far , far , far outweighs the bad , and my life has been incredibly enriched through the Internet . "
Hero unmasked
Montanez , the fired blogger in Pittsburgh , said she 's trying to find an upside in what 's happened to her .
Her former employer , the Negro Educational Emergency Drive , did not respond to CNN requests for comment .
She does n't like the idea of being in the public eye .
She describes herself as shy and said part of the reason she wanted to remain anonymous was so she would n't draw attention to herself .
She also feels like her larger - than - life persona has been somewhat deflated now that readers know who she is .
But now that she 's out , she figures she might as well try to capitalize on her newfound openness .
" I just want to write and get paid for it , " she said .

New migrants who demonstrate an " active disregard for UK values " , possibly including protesting at homecoming parades of troops from Afghanistan , could find their applications for a British passport blocked under new citizenship proposals published today .
But migrants who contribute to the " democratic life of the country " by canvassing for political parties could find the application process speeded up so that it takes one year instead of three .
The proposals unveiled by the immigration minister , Phil Woolas , set out a much tougher regime for the 150,000 people who apply for a British passport each year , using a points - based system for " earned citizenship " .
The Home Office consultation paper proposes a new category of " probationary citizen " whose application for a British passport can be speeded up or slowed down depending on the points system .
Family members and refugees will automatically pass the test , but for those who come to work in Britain the speed at which they might get a British passport will depend on their earning potential , special artistic , scientific or literary merits , qualifications , their ability to speak English and how long they have lived in Britain .
In addition , those who demonstrate involvement in voluntary work or other forms of " active citizenship " such as canvassing for political parties or being a school governor could get a passport within a year .
However , those who fail to integrate into " the British way of life " by engaging in criminal or antisocial behaviour could face having points deducted or other penalties .
The paper says this includes " circumstances where an active disregard for UK values is demonstrated " .
The Home Office would not rule out the possibility that this would include protesting at the return of British soldiers from Afghanistan or Iraq .
Woolas said : " As a point of principle ... if you do n't break the law and you are a citizen , that 's fine .
But if someone is applying to be a citizen to our country we do think that you should not only obey the law but show you are committed to our country .
This is what America does , it is what France does it's what other countries do and we think we should do the same . "
The Liberal Democrats ' home affairs spokesman , Chris Huhne , criticised the idea .
" With the proposal that people could be barred for unpatriotic behaviour , it looks as if the government wants to play the thought police .
But there should be no question of barring people because they criticise government policy .
Democratic values must come first , " he said .
The proposals include a new two - stage citizenship test with an early examination of practical knowledge of life in Britain and English language skills , and then at the final stage a more challenging test of knowledge of British history and politics .
Those who fail the tests will be given further chances to pass them .
Ministers hope that local authorities will build on the popularity of existing citizenship ceremonies by holding orientation days to encourage integration into the local community .
The new system proposes to counter the effects of the brain drain of skilled workers from the developing world to Britain by rewarding those who are prepared to take their skills and knowledge back home for a time before they become full British citizens .
A lot of people will be upgrading to Snow Leopard this weekend .
There ’s the right way to do it , and there ’s the wrong way .
Here ’s how to do it right .
When it comes to upgrading to Snow Leopard , you ’ve basically got two options : upgrade Leopard or wipe the old OS and start fresh .
Upgrade :
This is the easiest option — simply upgrade .
Install Snow Leopard right on top of your existing Leopard install .
Apple recommends this , and in most cases it ’ll be an easy , painless upgrade .
Of course ‘ painless ’ is a relative term in Cupertino , and if our experiences upgrading from Tiger to Leopard are any indication , this option leaves us a bit wary .
Not to mention , over time our computers become crud-magnets ; collecting up all order of detritus .
Our recommendation :
Start From Scratch : Here ’s what you should do : wipe your drive and start from scratch .
That sounds radical , we know , but we ’re such big fans of this option that we actually do this every six - months , wether or not there is an OS upgrade to be performed .
You ’ll be amazed how snappy your ‘ old ’
Mac is when it ’s starting on a pristine new disk .
Ingredients :

Extra hard drive or external hard drive ( preferably Firewire ) – Firewire is faster , and only Firewire drives are bootable , so get a Firewire drive if you want to make sure you can roll back to Leopard if anything goes wrong ( or mission - critical software is incompatible with Snow Leopard ) .
Otherwise , you can use a USB2 external drive .
The recipe :
Step 1 – Put your hard drive on a diet
More than saving space , you will ultimately save time during the upgrade process if you ’ve removed most of the useless garbage from your drive first .
Start with Singular , drag your most likely suspect folders ( Documents , Photos , Movies , Music ) to its main window and start killing your duplicates
After you ’ve cleaned up all your redundant files , now it ’s time to ‘ sweep ’ your disk .
Our hard drives always seem to be shrinking , and it ’s often hard to tell where most of that space goes .
Fortunately , our friends at Omni Group have a utility just for that .
Give it a whirl , and you may be just as surprised as we were to learn that your ‘ Downloads ’ directory is taking up half your hard drive .
Step 2 . Create a Reliable backup
Update : Reader Ben G , advises us ( and we ’ve confirmed ) that Intel Macs can indeed boot from USB 2 now .
If your Mac supports it , we recommend a Firewire external drive .
Not only is the sustained transfer rate of Firewire MUCH faster than USB , but it ’s the only kind of external drive that your Mac can boot from .
To create a bootable backup of your main drive there is only one choice , Carbon Copy Cloner , and it ’s push one button simple .
Just remember to make your backup drive bootable , you will have to completely wipe your destination drive .
Now , depending on the size of your hard drive , you ’ve got a chance to watch either the standard , or extended version of Lord of the Rings .
Once CCC is done , reboot your Mac with your external drive still connected , holding down the option key to boot from the backup drive .
Make sure everything boots up , poke around a bit , make sure everything seems to be working .
Pop the installer in , power down your Macintosh and unplug your backup drive , it would be a cryin ’ shame if you accidentally installed over your backup .
Step 3 . Install Snow Leopard
Very straight forward , only remember you ’ll need to wipe your hard drive first .
This is easily accomplished from the installer , just select the erase and install option ( remember to breathe , it ’s okay , you booted from your backup right ? ) , and follow the remaining onscreen prompts .
Time to watch that episode of House you tivo’d .
Step 4 . Migrate settings
On booting Snow Leopard , your Mac will boot up just like it did when you first took it home from the Apple Store –heck that feeling alone is worth doing this every 6 months .
You ’ll be presented with an option to migrate files and settings , select “ Other Mac ” and plug your external drive back in .
Now if you select the default option of copying everything you ’ll be back where you started , why not do what we do , do n’t migrate anything you have n’t used in the past 6 months .
Time to watch The Two Towers , extended version with director ’s commentary .
Now the reason we love this process is you loose a lot of the garbage that builds up in systems over time slowing them down .
It also gives you an upgrade process that is completely non-destructive and reversible .
The disadvantage is that things that require “ device drivers ” like VMWare / Parallels , or Little Snitch , or what have you may need to be reinstalled to work properly ( just as with any “ Migrate me from my old mac ” upgrade ) .
If you need more detail , the fantastic Take Control series has a pair of new PDF ebooks to guide you through the Snow Leopard installation : “ Take Control of Upgrading to Snow Leopard ” ( $ 10 ) and “ Take Control of Exploring & Customizing Snow Leopard . ” ( $ 15 ) .
Both highly recommended .
It 's hard not to like new - school tech named after old - school instruments , and so Logitech 's ( Slim - developed Squeezebox lineup has at least that going for it .
Decently solid reviews , too , for the models we 've seen thus - far , and thanks to our old friends at the FCC we know that a new model is coming soon .
Dubbed the Squeezebox Radio X - R0001 , it 's described as " a compact tabletop network music player and internet radio that lets you listen to virtually any internet radio station . "
How it 'll handle the variety of streaming formats and functions remains to be seen , but it 'll also go fetch your local music collection over an internal network and play it all through its combination of 3/4 - inch tweeters and 3 - inch woofer .
A 2.4 - inch LCD is on the front , 802.11b/g WiFi and wired Ethernet are standard features , and it's all enclosed in a " compact design . "
That 's all we know at this point ( assuming you do n't care that it has a 11.11d Bm rating at 2.412MHz when in 802.11g mode ) , but hopefully Logi will set this one free from the Faraday cage soon .
Stadium of light : Dramatic double rainbow illuminates football match
Advertisement
Nature provided a stunning backdrop to a football match last night in the form a dramatic double rainbow .
The colourful bow arched over the Keepmoat Stadium yesterday evening , as players from Doncaster Rovers and Tottenham Hotspurs filed onto the pitch .
The players line up for their second round Carling Cup match as a double rainbow arches over the stadium
A rainbow is created by both reflection and refraction .
Sunlight shines on raindrops and the light is reflected back towards the observer .
The raindrop also acts as a prism .
The light is bent or refracted as it enters the water and splits into the full spectrum of colours from red to indigo .
The colours are so vivid here because the water droplets are between one and two millimetres in size , any smaller and the rainbow appears hazy .
The sky is brighter underneath the bow because raindrops scatter light inside the arc as well .
When you consider the time of day this occurred , the darker sky is being accentuated because the sun is about to set , creating a dramatic contrast with the dark clouds above the stadium .
The stadium lights also illuminate the sky in relation to where the photograph is being taken from .
Rainbows are highest in the sky when the sun is lowest .
This rainbow lit up the sky at a 7.30 pm kickoff because summer days are longer .
The optical phenomena are clearest in early morning and late afternoon when the sun is closer to the horizon .
This is because they are always centred around an imaginary point directly opposite to the Sun in the sky – the so - called anti-solar point .
So the lower the sun is the higher the bow .
Met Office spokesman John Hammond said : ' The smaller the rain drops the clearer the rainbow will be .
' Looking at the weather for South Yorkshire last night , light rain and drizzle falling over the stadium combined with breaks in the cloud allowing the sun to shine through just before it set , provided ideal conditions for the rainbow to form .
It ’s a case of being in the right place at the right time to see such a clear and colourful rainbow ' .
Why you will never seen a rainbow at noon in summer
However , you will never see a rainbow at noon in summer because light leaves raindrops at an angle of 42 degrees as it passes from water to air .
This angle is significant because it means rainbows wo n't form if the sun is higher than 42 degrees up in the sky .
In 1831 , the painter John Constable , well - known for depicting stormy skies , noted that rainbows were not visible in England during the middle of the day from April through to August .
To form a secondary bow like the one in the picture , light must bounce twice within a water droplet , leaving at an angle of 51 degrees .
The outer bow always appears as a ghostly arch because each time the beam of light is reflected the intensity of the resulting bow is one tenth of the first .
It is also known as a second - ordered rainbow because red is seen on the inside edge rather than the outside .
The cheapest T - shirt in Asda costs £ 1.50 .
You do n't have to be a mathematician to calculate that this figure does n't add up .
Someone , somewhere bought that cotton seed , planted it , irrigated it , pumped it full of pesticides , fertilizers and herbicides , harvested it , sorted it , baled it , shipped it to another country , carded it , spun it , wove it , cut it , sewed it , packaged it , shipped it again , and sold it .
For £ 1.50 .
If we 're not paying the price of that cotton T - shirt , someone , somewhere is .
Lee Holdstock , a textile consultant for the Soil Association , says , " There is no such thing as a cheap product .
The consumer may not be paying at point of sale but there are hidden environmental and human costs . "
The supermarkets are full of cheap clothes - can they really produce goods at these prices without cutting corners ?
According to the Environmental Justice Foundation 's 2005 and 2007 reports , cotton is hugely damaging to the environment : a single T - shirt will have used 80g of fertilizer and 3g of pesticides .
The EJF maintains cotton is grown so cheaply because child labour is involved , particularly in Uzbekistan .
Rob Harrison , the editor of Ethical Consumer magazine and the author of a report on ethical clothing , says that no manufacturers can guarantee their cotton was grown without the involvement of child labour unless it 's certified as Fairtrade or organic .
" Certainly every area that can be cut is being cut , " says Harrison .
" The supermarkets would argue that efficiency and bulk ordering reduces costs and that is true , but in producer countries what we see are reverse auctions .
A retailer will advertise for a producer who can make 20,000 copies of a dress and the producers bid in an open tender system .
It 's a race to the bottom . "
Harrison estimates that the person who makes each garment will receive less than 5 % of the final price .
For those of us who are n't mathematicians , that 's 7.5 p for every £ 1.50 spent on that Asda T - shirt .
A report published by War on Want in December 2008 showed that factory workers in Bangladesh who supply Asda , Tesco and Primark are in a worse position than they were two years ago .
Harrison says : " The crux of the problem is that factories overseas are getting conflicting messages from clothing buyers in the west .
On the one hand companies say we want better human rights , and on the other they say we want lower prices .
And factories know in their hearts which one is going to secure the contract . "
In his report , Harrison ranked 29 high street retailers according to their ethical practices .
They were given an ' ethiscore ' out of 20 , which included the companies ' policies on human rights , use of toxic chemicals , and climate change .
Tesco scored 2.5 and Asda zero .
However , the supermarkets are beginning to include some organic and Fairtrade clothes in their fashion ranges .
Asda now sells a Fairtrade T - shirt and Tesco is on the brink of signing an agreement with ethical label Izzy Lane .
Could the tide be turning ?
Izzy Lane was founded by Isobel Davies , who tends a flock of rescued sheep opposite her house in North Yorkshire and uses their wool to create a range of tailored skirts , jackets and coats , as well as knitwear .
" Tesco approached us " , says Davies , " which shows a willingness to be progressive . "
Most wool in this country ( 80 % ) is imported from Australia and New Zealand .
Davies has singlehandedly revived the supply chain of traditional weavers and spinners in the north of England ; what is groundbreaking for a supermarket is that Tesco is committed to using her producers and only using British wool .
Izzy Lane 's clothes are gorgeous and ethical , but they 're not cheap .
It takes the wool from an entire sheep to make a single skirt , and it costs £ 60 a year to keep a sheep even before you start doing anything with its wool .
" The supermarket is realistic that the costs of processing are going to be more than shipping the garments to Asia " , says Davies , " but Tesco wants these clothes to be affordable , as do we .
We want the animal welfare message in fashion and Tesco will provide a fantastic platform .
What is different about these garments is that you can identify which flock the wool came from and who the farmer is , which has n't been done before . "
Unfortunately , Davies has hit a snag , which means that her capsule collection wo n't hit the shops just yet .
Davies ' personal code of conduct is that none of the sheep whose wool is used in her clothes should be transported for more than three hours and / or 120 miles and she wants this stated on each garment .
The Wool Marketing Board is refusing to endorse this because they believe it could upset other farmers who do n't adhere to such a strict ethical position .
An affordable Izzy Lane line would only be a bonus , but are supermarkets - and are we - prepared to pay slightly more for our clothes to ensure that the people who made them are paid fairly ?
The United States – Peru Trade Promotion Agreement is a bilateral free trade agreement between the United States and Peru , signed on April 12 , 2006 that was implemented on February 1 , 2009 ( Wikipedia ) .
The Peru free trade agreement , promoted by the Bush administration , is now bearing fruit , just like NAFTA did in Mexico .
By 2003 , 1.3 million Mexican peasants had lost their livelihoods because of NAFTA .
Many of the displaced farmers came north in search of work .
Mexican migration to the U.S. increased an estimated 75 percent in the five years after the trade agreement took effect .
Elites in the Mexican and Peruvian governments have made agreements with multinational corporations that enrich the elites while impoverishing the native people and taking their natural resources .
NAFTA caused a war between the native people of Chiapas and the Mexican government .
Now , the Peru free trade agreement is starting a war between the Peruvian elite and the indigenous people of the Peruvian Amazon .
I 'm writing this right now from Peru after having taken part in a 5 day Indigenous Peoples Summit held in Puno , Peru in the high Andes .
At that gathering we heard from representatives , including Alberto Pizango , elected representative of the Peruvian Amazonian peoples , about the ongoing protests they were waging , and the repression faced as a result , from their opposition to some of the plans the Peruvian government has for ' developing ' the Amazon region and opening it for oil , mineral , logging , and agricultural exploitation , on the homelands of many Indigenous communities .
In response , there have been over 50 days of continuous protest , shutting down parts of the Amazon and the Andes .
This morning , the situation took a turn for the worst .
The government reacted by sending in police to violently remove the protesters , with different reports claiming as many as 20 , 30 , or more lives lost in the violent fight that erupted .
The protesters had been sleeping at a roadblock maintained over the past few weeks when helicopters arrived and shot at people below , according to witnesses and local journalists .
The government has also put out an arrest warrant for Pizango , who spoke today in Lima , for instigating the violence , as if to pretend the intense anger and frustration is n't coming out of the communities themselves .
This is not how World Environment Day should be celebrated .
The government has recently signed a number of free trade agreements , including with the US and Canada , and has been seeking to change their domestic laws to encourage foreign investment in the Amazonian region , for the benefit of those companies and the central government in Lima .
Many of those new laws have been ruled unconstitutional , and have been in violation of Indigenous Peoples ' rights to Free , Prior and Informed Consent , as well as participation in decision making , rights affirmed by the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples .
They threaten the fundamental rights of the Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon , and can not be allowed to go through .
Please take action .
Send a message to the president of Peru .
Tell the Peruvian Government : 1 . Immediately suspend violent repression of indigenous protests and the State of Emergency
2. Repeal the Free Trade Laws that allow oil , logging , and agricultural corporations easy entry into indigenous territories
3. Respect indigenous peoples ' constitutionally guaranteed rights to self - determination , to their ancestral territories , and to prior consultation
4 . Enter into good faith process of dialogue with indigenous peoples to resolve this conflict
The International Federation of Human Rights has backed the protesters .
The protests were non violent until the government attacked .
Protesters from a movement of 65 indigenous groups had declared an " insurgency " against the government for refusing to repeal the laws that threaten their ancestral land and resources .
They later withdrew their decision .
The indigenous groups were backed by the International Federation of Human Rights , which groups 155 human rights organizations from around the world .
It called on Peru to rescind the decrees because of the government 's failure to consult indigenous peoples .
Government officials acknowledge that the country 's indigenous groups have historically been marginalized , but insist that Peru 's constitution makes the state the owner of the country 's mineral wealth .
Please help .
The people of the Amazon and the rain forests need your help .
Update
The New York Times writes that 9 detainees ( hostages ) taken by the indigenous protesters died in the battle .
How they died and who killed them is unclear .
What is clear is that the protesters had reason to expect a brutal attack .
Hostage ( detainee ) taking has traditionally been a means of trying to prevent attack by a more powerful opponent .
A maneuver here in Congress sparked the clashes between protesters and the police , after lawmakers blocked an effort Thursday to allow debate on one of Mr. García ’s most polemical decrees , which would open as much as 60 percent of Peru ’s jungles to oil exploration and other extractive investments .
Ollanta Humala , a nationalist political leader and a former lieutenant colonel in Peru ’s army who was defeated by Mr. García in the most recent presidential elections , has sided with the protesters , lambasting the use of use of force against the Indians and raising his profile ahead of the next elections in 2011 .
Meanwhile , the climbing body count in the rain forest , along with unconfirmed reports that the number of Indians killed could be higher , threatens to deplete the legitimacy of Mr. García ’s government .
Mr. García , 60 , is still hounded by claims of human rights violations from his first term as president in the 1980s , when soldiers suppressed a prison rebellion in 1986 , killing more than 100 inmates suspected of being Maoist guerrillas .
Expanded oil leases will devastate the people and the land of the Peruvian Amazon .
Over 70 % of Peru's Amazon is being opened to development .
That development would damage or destroy the land for conservation , traditional agriculture and subsistence hunting .
Death in the Amazon
After reports yesterday of the attacks made by US Republicans on the NHS , Twitter users grabbed their keyboards and mobiles to defend the health system .
Critics in the US claimed that elderly people in the UK are left to die , and that the NHS put an " Orwellian " financial cap on the value on human life – in a bid to discredit Barack Obama 's own healthcare reforms .
Twitterers hit back , tweeting on the thread " #welovethenhs " to explain exactly why the NHS meant so much to them .
Here are some examples :
@timlusher :
The NHS is incredible in a medical emergency .
They saved me when I had a brain abscess .
It 's worth every penny of our taxes .
@bird42 : Because they got me safely through two pregnancies , and the one that did n't work out .
@LizzieCharlton :
When my dad died after 2 weeks in ICU in multiorgan failure we were n't made bankrupt by the cost of his care .
@gailtwist : heartwarming stuff ... saved my husband 's , father 's and son's lives within 6 months ... great people .
@will_tooke : Looking after grandad for free .
@ceona :
My birth control is free !
Free !
@dancourse :
On a personal note , they really sorted me out when I ruined my toe attempting capoeira on a desk . . .
Would n't want to lose it !
@zara_tweets :
The NHS has its flaws but I dread to think how many loved ones I 'd be missing without it .
Makes me proud to be British .
@KingOfAnkh :
If it was n't for the NHS , my two - year - old niece would have died without a liver transplant .
She 's now eight and doing well .
@gullstory : US Republicans can lie all they like about the NHS but it's a great service for every Brit & we 're proud of it .
@ajjenkins :
For all those doctors and nurses who work long hours to keep us well .
@natguest : During my breakdown just two months ago my GPs were caring & compassionate and listened through my tears .
@bitoclass : Because I 'd rather my healthcare decisions were taken by someone interested in public health / value than in profits .
@aaronrussell : Brought me into the world , removed that doll 's eye I got stuck up my nose , fixed my collar bone , patched up my hernia ( twice ) .
One of the things I 've learned from my many years in journalism ( and yes , even my short stint as a political staffer ) is that when legislation is first proposed , people throw a bunch of crap on the wall and duke it out over the details .
You know why they say it 's like watching sausage being made ?
Because it 's stomach - churning .
Several bloggers linked to this .
They 're taking the article in good faith and assume it 's accurate in its conclusions ( that the public option has been gutted and the idea of " reform " amounts to a bait and switch ) , and I just do n't believe that .
The author does n't even seem to understand how legislation is made .
It 's kind of like judging the way a finished room will look by painting a stripe on the wall :
It 's not the whole picture .
The bills are usually weakened at this point in the process - but they 're fixed later in committee .
One of the reasons it still works like this is so politicians can say , " I voted against that ! " if part of a bill becomes controversial in his or her district .
( Remember the thing with Kerry , where he said , " I actually did vote for the $ 87 billion before I was against it " ?
He 's right .
All politicians do it . )
Some of the same politicians who are screaming on the teevee against this will be a lot more reasonable once the cameras are n't running .
The final committee work is what counts .
So really , the sky is n't falling .
I would tell you if I thought it was .
I mean , I 'm not exactly known as Obama 's biggest booster , am I ?
I 'd rather ward off the attacks from the insurance companies and the Blue Dogs instead .
It 's no secret that I think single payer is the best solution - but I 'm not going to try to poison this compromise bill to prove a point .
The next best thing to single payer is structural change that really makes people understand and support the concept that health care can and should be accessible to everyone .
This bill will do that , and we can improve from there .
I 'm actually shocked to find the more I look at the long - term strategy here , the more I like it .
The fact is , it will be a lot more politically difficult for members of Congress to vote against those future incremental improvements than to vote against the entire plan now .
Once it 's in place , and constituents start calling their elected officials with complaints about flaws in the bill , they 're going to have to fix those problems - or at the very least , not get in the way of the solution .
Remember : Social Security only covered about half of the people when it first passed .
It took almost 10 years to get there , but you could n't take it away now .
The voters would be furious .
We wo n't get there overnight , but this bill will at least be a decent start .
Andrew Rowat
Today , the problem is lead .
Barrett Comiskey sits on a couch in a factory behind a brick wall and a sign that reads SHANGHAI HONG HUI PLASTICS COMPANY .
He 's a thirty - two - year - old New Yorker with an open , friendly face and his shirtsleeves rolled up , sipping from a bottle of water .
Across from him sits Mr. Sun , the factory 's Taiwanese owner , dressed in shorts and a T - shirt and still sweating , having just supervised the loading of yet another truck .
His is one of the hundreds of factories here in Minhang , the manufacturing district southwest of downtown Shanghai .
Minhang is the birthplace of much of America 's stuff .
Mr. Sun is a tough old bastard who hits his palm with his fist when he talks .
Comiskey has come to sit with him on behalf of an American client who has ordered thousands of plastic rulers with MADE IN CHINA stamped on them .
Comiskey and Mr. Sun have done business before , producing parts for another of Comiskey 's American clients , a vending - machine company on the East Coast .
Those parts are being churned out on the factory floor this afternoon , as they almost always are , spun from bags of melted pellets by rows of injection molds and Chinese migrant workers , recent transplants from the valleys and farms .
But making plastic rulers requires an extruder , which Mr. Sun does not have in his factory .
So Mr. Sun subcontracted the job to another factory , and the rulers have since tested positive for lead .
Although there are no regulations in China or America restricting the lead content of rulers -- lots of plastic products , from lawn chairs to picture frames , have traces of lead in them , because lead is used as a stabilizing agent in liquid plastics -- Comiskey 's client is demanding a new , lead - free batch .
His client is not interested in the letter of the law .
Unlike lawn chairs or picture frames , rulers sometimes end up in people 's mouths .
This Comiskey understands .
His job is to understand .
The next part of his job -- the harder part -- is helping either his American client or his Chinese counterpart , depending on which party finds itself lost in translation , to understand , too .
Now , after a long , loud conversation in Mandarin punctuated by his incessant fist pounding , Mr. Sun comes to understand that because Americans eat their rulers , today the problem is lead .
Here , however , their understanding ends .
Mr. Sun wants to give his subcontractor another chance .
That 's the Asian in him .
Comiskey wants to find a different factory .
That 's the American in him .
He takes a sip of water and contemplates the ocean in between .
Shanghai is a fifteen - hour flight from New York but so much farther .
Comiskey landed here for the first time in 2002 , when he was working on his M.B.A. at Stanford .
A group of students decided to tour industrial China , wanting to see what hypercapitalism looks like , and out of so many cities , massive and teeming , Shanghai -- and its eighteen million inhabitants -- dug its elbows deepest into Comiskey 's ribs .
In the rain , the city looks like the Los Angeles of Blade Runner .
Every glass - and - steel skyscraper is taller and gaudier than the one thrown up in the weeks before it ; spotlit billboards and an overabundance of blue neon turn dusk into dawn ; a high - speed maglev train , the world 's fastest , rockets from the futuristic airport into towering Pudong , an entirely new section of the city that has risen double - time out of the marshes along the river , an instant metropolis .
Walking wide - eyed through the bustle , Comiskey felt the crackle of pure , unhinged commerce .
" It felt like the frontier , like the Wild West , " he says now .
" It felt electric . "
He 's yelling his memories over the music pounding at an upscale dance club .
This is the last stop on an all - night bender , a Shanghai weekend staple .
Saturday nights and Sunday mornings are when valves are opened and a week 's worth of pressure is released into the muggy dark .
The bar is filled mostly with white men and women .
These particular whites are not scruffy English - as - a - second - language teachers or hippies looking for what 's become of Buddha .
Those foreigners are asleep on their futons , three to a room , their bellies filled with ramen .
In this obnoxious bar , at this obnoxious hour , it 's all about the money , newborn millionaires toasting their success , a thousand smiling Maos folded and stuffed into their back pockets .
These are Germans , Brits , Americans , a few French , most of them young , most of them rich or well on their way to being rich .
They are the high - priced consultants who work for McKinsey , the emissaries for international interests in steel or copper or indium , the princes and princesses of manufacturing empires that span three quarters of the globe and have their eyes on that last quarter .
These people are in love with Shanghai so long as Shanghai turns them a profit during the day and supplies them with a dance floor at night .
Comiskey watches the show and can laugh , because over the years he 's been able to remove himself from it .
When the sun rises and the window behind the bar fills with light , he heads out to the street , waves down a taxi , and directs the driver in his new language to his new home , the house where he 's built a garden and is building a family .
In his first days in Shanghai , he thought he could help change this place , make it cleaner and fairer and better .
Change has come , but it has come slowly , and while Comiskey remains an idealist , a believer in an almost quaint theory of world progress , inching forward transaction by transaction , Shanghai forced him to develop a more practical streak .
He decided , instead , to let the city change him .
He has n't joined the ranks of pirates and robber barons -- the " devils with white faces , " the Chinese call them -- except when he drinks in their bars just before sunrise .
He is still Barrett O'Connor Comiskey , proud Irish son of New York .
But in his time in this city , he has also become a new kind of American , one made in China along with everything else .
He was drawn to Asia even before he felt Shanghai 's buzz , shaking the money trees for a start - up called E Ink , which he cofounded shortly after his graduation from MIT in 1997 .
A mathematician by training -- he still illustrates his thoughts with napkin sketches of parabolas and vectors -- Comiskey invented magical balls of ink that alternate , on command , between black and white .
They promised a future of constantly changing electronic ink .
( Some of you can see it in action on the cover of special editions of this issue of Esquire . )
But after spending three years perfecting E Ink 's technology , he had grown weary with the company 's science and wanted to try his hand at the company 's art : those tricky , delicate negotiations that bring together investors and invention , building the bridges that cross the water .
America felt tapped out .
Up rose Asia over his mind 's horizon , and off he went .
A colleague beat him to the money in Japan , but Comiskey did one better and found a future wife , Jojo , in Taiwan .
Having caught the business bug while he was at it , he left E Ink , earned his M.B.A. , got married on a California beach where he liked to surf , and together he and Jojo booked passage for Shanghai to make their fortune -- by selling eyeglasses .
Guys like Comiskey , they 're awake with ideas .
Some of his ideas , like E Ink , had worked .
Some of his ideas , like the Argentine vineyard that sold wine the way time - shares sell sunshine , had not .
But along with a Shanghainese classmate at Stanford , Comiskey had come up with his young life 's can 't - miss .
The existing model for selling eyeglasses is flawed , he decided after a long and careful analysis .
( He is an unrepentant logician , even here in Shanghai , a place that defies rationality . )
Most eyeglass stores are high - inventory , low - volume enterprises , and high - inventory , low - volume enterprises are death from above and below .
Comiskey and his friend were going to change that , targeting their stores toward narrower markets : trendsetting women and children , the two groups that go through frames the quickest .
And afterward , they were going to build their own shining tower into this crowded , birdless sky .
That was before Comiskey 's friend -- the local partner , the one who could make sense out of Shanghai 's glorious , infuriating tangle -- decided New Zealand was a better bet .
Fuck New Zealand , Comiskey thought .
He had his heart set on Shanghai .
" It was where I wanted to be , " he says .
And as luck would have it , right about then , E Ink decided it wanted to start production in China , making displays for clocks , calculators , cell phones , and electronic books .
They became Comiskey 's first American client , and he became their first man in Shanghai , and alone but for Jojo he began cold - knocking on factory doors .

Today , the problem is a woman in a surgical mask .
Comiskey has taken a taxi to Shanghai EELY - TDI - ECW Co. , Ltd. , another Minhang factory , the factory that first opened its doors to him .
He was just Barrett Comiskey then .
Now he 's the managing partner -- along with another ambitious young American M.B.A. , Andy Mulkerin -- of Nicobar Group , a dozen - employee go - between outfit named after an obscure archipelago off India .
( " I like the idea of the company being a collection of islands , " he says , " every client and project its own entity under a larger umbrella . " )
In the intervening years , he has worked for several American clients and has found his way into several Chinese factories .
He has helped a company that refurbishes medical equipment look at building hard - to - find parts from scratch ; he has helped a railway company explore a joint venture with a local casting factory ; he has helped a company that supplies components for nuclear reactors ramp up its international manufacturing capability .
But EELY was the start of all that helping .
It is managed by a skinny , stressed - out , middle - aged Chinese man named Simon .
( Many of the Chinese Comiskey deals with have adopted English names for our lingual benefit , but they are endearingly antiquated names .
Nobody here is named Braden .
They call themselves Daisy , Fanny , Henry , Arthur , as though they 'd gone to the beach and picked up the names we decided we were done with and tossed into the sea . )
Simon wears short - sleeved dress shirts and sits in his spartan office , his desk empty except for a laptop and an ashtray filled with butts .
He is eager to please Comiskey .
Before they discuss business , Simon likes to take Comiskey for lunch at a restaurant that seats three thousand people .
Simon will try to impress
Comiskey by ordering lavish amounts of food , deep - fried chicken intestines and fatty wedges of pork , lotus fruit stuffed with sticky rice , freshwater shrimp in vinegar , picked over with chopsticks and washed down with big bottles of Tsingtao .
As is Chinese custom , Simon will pour the beer for Comiskey , holding the bottle with his right hand but guiding it with his left , an act of deference .
in return , Comiskey will pour for Simon .
These are tiny , simple , but important customs .
Comiskey knows and observes them like a Catholic attending Mass .
But today there is no time for lunch or ritual .
Comiskey wants to see how work is progressing on the Esquire cover .
EELY is responsible for making the twin display panels , and Comiskey fears they are running behind their tight schedule .
In polished rooms that look like microbiology labs , workers in full - body anticontamination suits with hoods , booties , and surgical masks hunch over laser cutters and industrial laminators .
It 's an incredibly laborious , intensive process , fraught with potential for delays .
" That 's a problem , " Comiskey says through his own surgical mask , eyeing a cardboard box in the corner filled with the excess ink film trimmed from the Esquire displays .
Comiskey has asked that it be carefully sorted and kept , because even the smallest pieces can be used for something like cell - phone screens , and because it 's worth a lot of money .
It turns out that a woman in a surgical mask misunderstood his request and has been throwing it out .
It 's a misunderstanding that will cost Comiskey tens of thousands , perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars .
He is calm in expressing his displeasure , but he expresses it , in clipped Mandarin , and after , the woman retreats to a corner .
While Comiskey continues his tour of the factor , the woman follows him but keeps her distance .
He can see only her eyes , and she can see only his , but each can see how the other is feeling from across the dustless room .
After a few minutes , Comiskey stops and asks her gently to come over to him .
She is reluctant .
She shakes her head and stays in the corner .
She has seen how Americans react to Chinese mistakes .
She has had Americans treat her and her friends like Jawas , as something less than human .
But Comiskey talks to her some more , in soothing tones , and then he extends his hand , palm down , and she comes to him , slowly , and their hands touch -- not in a handshake , exactly , but more tenderly , and whatever he says to her , her surgical mask stops popping in and out so quickly , and her eyes change , and in them Comiskey can see that she 's smiling , and he knows that his precious inventory is gone along with his money , but he also knows that in exchange he has made a new friend who will do her best to understand him from now on .
" Onward , " he says .
He says it in English .
Shanghai is not a warm city .
It is not welcoming .
" People are busy , " Comiskey says .
When he and Jojo first came here , surrounded by so many millions , he was nearly crushed by loneliness .
He could n't speak the language ; he could n't read the street signs ; Jojo was his single conduit to the world .
Everything had to be filtered through her , and sometimes he felt like the boy in the bubble .
It did n't help that Shanghai 's expatriate community is as insular as the Chinese can seem .
There are the true expats , the mostly male executives whose wives shop on Nanjing Road and whose children attend posh international schools .
They live in the suburbs with their maids and gardeners , drivers take them to their offices , and they pick up dinner at KFC or McDonald 's , counting off the days until they can return home to Chicago or London or Frankfurt .
They are in this city but they are not part of it .
They believe , This is China , and therefore I can expect nothing .
Then there are those foreigners who have integrated themselves completely -- in fact , they have gone over the wall and become Chinese in their hearts and minds .
They in turn look down at the third brand of foreigner here , the relentless waves of plunderers who drink Coca - Cola and fumble with their chopsticks , the neocolonialists who believe , This is China , and therefore I can expect the world .
Comiskey set about working his way somewhere into the middle of everything and everyone .
In his first difficult months , he wanted to feel at home in Shanghai , drawn into its irresistible currents , but he also wanted to stay true to his essential Americanism .
He had to choose which parts of him he would fight to keep and which parts of him he was willing to lose .
That 's how he ended up where he is today .
This is China , he believes , therefore everything is possible , but nothing is easy .
His office space documents his evolution in plaster and art .
He opened shop in a five - story building that houses mostly painters and sculptors .
As Nicobar Group has expanded , he 's blown out the walls .
Now he occupies three units , with his Chinese , Taiwanese , and American employees spread between them , busy at their desks .
The first , the original suite , he calls New York .
It looks like a SoHo loft , with exposed pipes and high ceilings and black - and - white photographs of the Chrysler Building on the exposed - brick walls .
It was built by a man who missed home .
The second suite is Minhang , the factory , with lab benches and industrial lighting .
It was built by a man who had become enamored with industry .
The third suite is Shanghai .
It was built by a man who had flat - out fallen in love .
One half has been decorated in 1930s art deco , reminiscent of the city 's romantic jazz age , with floral wallpaper , Tiffany lamps , and custom leather furniture .
Comiskey has also put up a collection of antique American posters .
They read like Chinese propaganda -- What Is Good for Industry Is Good for Your Family and Let 's All Work Together -- but they were produced by the National Association of Manufacturers .
It 's funny to see how much China has become what we once were .

They read like Chinese propaganda-- What Is Good for Industry Is Good for Your Family and Let 's All Work Together -- but they were produced by the National Association of Manufacturers .
It 's funny to see how much China has become what we once were .
One afternoon , Comiskey takes his next great leap into his new life .
He decides to buy a car .
Most foreigners would n't dream of driving here .
The roads are lawless , except that cars must turn right on a red light without stopping .
That , combined with millions of new drivers , thousands of poorly maintained trucks , and gaggles of bell - ringing bicycles , has turned Shanghai 's congested streets into a gladiator pit .
Comiskey , however , is tired of being driven .
The American in him wants to drive , and he 's waded through China 's arduous bureaucracy -- it 's what he does -- to get his license .
Now he 's off to the local Shuanghuan dealership to take a SCEO for a spin .
It looks suspiciously like a BMW X5 .
The Chinese call it an " homage . "
The Germans -- and most Americans -- would call it " stealing . "
It 's a perfect copy , at least in looks .
( The engine is a Mitsubishi . )
The young salesman helpfully tells Comiskey that 90 percent of customers ask for the logos to be removed and replaced with BMW's .
He also points out that the BMW retails for $ 130,000 here .
The Shuanghuan SCEO goes for $ 20,000 , fully loaded .
Comiskey is nervous about how his clients , who fear the stealing of their own ideas , might react to his driving a forgery .
" From my research , Shuanghuan has n't broken laws , " he says , smiling , when he pulls onto the highway .
" I hope people think it shows my practical side . "
Given its lack of guts coming up the ramp , the Shuanghuan is clearly not a BMW where it counts , but like most things made by the Chinese , it occupies that sweet spot between good enough and cheap enough .
He pulls off the highway and takes to the streets .
One of Comiskey 's friends is working on a massive new housing development out here , the kind of sweeping construction project that would be next to impossible back home , and he wants to take a look at what can still happen here .
It is acres of towering apartment blocks , going up a dozen at a time , set against distinctly artificial touches of American suburbia .
The world 's largest skate park sits somewhere among the graded , empty fields and rows of billboards that celebrate our good fortune , blessed to have found ourselves in A CITY ZONE OF SHANGHAI NEW DREAM .
Comiskey stumbles upon the skate park and stops in for a peek .
It 's an enormous collection of bowls , ramps , and half - pipes .
It 's maybe a year old , but already the concrete is cracking .
( " Things look old in Shanghai really quickly , " he says , walking through the open , unmanned gates . )
There are no skateboarders .
There is a lone man squatting near the bottom of one bowl , which is half filled with water .
He emerges carrying a plastic bag filled with small freshwater lobster -- crayfish , really -- that he 's just caught for dinner .
Nothing in Shanghai lives as it was born .
America is built on intention , everything planned and focused and engineered and intractable .
Here , nothing is static .
Everything is in flux .
Everything evolves .
" Everything 's negotiable , " Comiskey says , climbing back behind the wheel of his new car .
He did n't grow up dreaming of driving a Shuanghuan , but right now , it will get him where he wants to go .
Today , the problem is a scam .
Comiskey is eating lunch on a restaurant patio when his phone rings .
It 's an American friend here in Shanghai on business .
" I 'm in a spot , " the friend says .
" There 's a big bill . . . "
" Tell me where you are , and I 'll fix it , " Comiskey says , already rising from his seat .
Unfortunately , the friend does n't know where he is , except in a spot .
Comiskey jumps in a taxi , his phone still pressed to his ear .
" I need to know where you are .
What 's happening ?
What can you see ? "
The details emerge in sketchy , short bursts .
A restaurant with a green sign , up some stairs .
A pretty Chinese girl .
A bill for 3,000 yuan -- more than $ 400 .
A windowless back room with a big angry man in it , wanting to be paid .
The friend is scared .
In Shanghai , it 's called " getting worked . "
It almost always starts with a girl .
In this case , the friend was trying to buy a cell phone and got lost in the bewildering , overheated chaos of People 's Square .
Cars honking , bicycles zipping past , the sidewalks crowded and suffocating .
He was sweaty and disoriented when an angel appeared out of the crush .
She asked if he needed help .
He said that he did .
She helped .
Then she asked if he wanted to go for lunch .
He said that he did , and they went .
She picked the restaurant .
They ate eel .
Then she ordered a glass of wine .
Then another glass , then another glass , and then another .
Finally , Comiskey 's friend said he had to get going .
He asked for the bill .
Lunch was reasonable enough .
The wine , not so much .
The restaurant 's manager said the wine was very expensive .
The wine was probably plonk .
It was maybe even water .
" I need to know where you are , " Comiskey says again .
The friend suddenly remembers a street name .
" That 's a long street .
I need something else . "
Comiskey directs the taxi driver toward the long street .
" Yeah , okay .
Put him on the phone . "
The friend gives his phone to the manager .
Comiskey begins barking at him in Mandarin .
" Are you Chinese ? " the manager asks .
" Yes , " Comiskey says .
" Tell me your address . "
" What are you going to do ? " the manager says .
" This is just business . "
The manager throws the phone back to the friend .
" Listen to me , " Comiskey says , sounding rattled for the first time .
" You need to get out of there .
Just get out of there . "
The taxi gets stuck in traffic on the long street .
There are many restaurants with green signs , up some stairs .
There is a lot of everything in Shanghai .
It all begins to blur .
The friend 's voice is shaking .
" Get out of there , " Comiskey says again .
Finally , the friend hears him .
Finally , he obeys .
He sees an opening past the big angry man and finds his courage and bolts from the back room , into the restaurant .
He throws 200 yuan on the table and runs down the stairs .
He 's back in the sun on the street and gulps down the polluted air .
The crowds , so maddening before , feel like armor , or a blanket .
They surround him and he 's safe .
Comiskey picks his friend out from the thousands and bundles him into the taxi .
" Are you all right ? "
" Yes , " the friend says , although he 's clearly not .
" I 'm all right . "
" It 's okay , " Comiskey says .
" It 's okay . "
The friend wipes the sweat from his forehead and begins to catch his breath .
" It 's okay . "

On its worst days -- like today -- Shanghai can seem like a soulless , selfish place .
For all its fetishistic beer pouring , the city can be startling in its callousness , a function of an otherworldly pace and scale .
Walking is a contact sport .
Motorcycles race down sidewalks .
Fights break out on the crowded subway platforms and over taxis .
The police seem too busy bugging phones and reading other people 's e-mails to be bothered minding the chaos .
A Canadian model , forced into dancing and wanting badly to go home , ends up stabbed to death in a hallway .
She joins the permanent ranks of Shanghai 's voracious supply side .

A Canadian model , forced into dancing and wanting badly to go home , ends up stabbed to death in a hallway .
She joins the permanent ranks of Shanghai 's voracious supply side .
The city 's all engine .
There are no parks and there are no oases , unless you carve them out yourself .
( Stepping into the relative quiet of Comiskey 's garden , behind its high wall , feels like diving underwater . )
In those rare parts of the city where the sky suddenly opens up -- somewhere like the French Concession , where most of the foreigners live , with its Irish pubs , cob -blestone streets , and treelined boulevards -- it can seem just as quickly closed off by pollution and vapor trails .
Sometimes when Comiskey goes back to the U. S. , he feels like the returning veteran of a foreign war .
" Like I 've returned to the land of milk and honey , " he says .
Even New York seems like a quaint English village in comparison .
He probably would n't have made it here without Jojo .
She would n't let him stay an outsider .
She did n't want to be his translator for life .
Early in their relationship , she took him to spend some time in Taiwan , a gentler place , more laid - back and even - keeled , and there she nurtured a side of Comiskey that might never have surfaced had he remainedexclusively in Shanghai , or in America for that matter .
She did n't make him type B , exactly .
But she encouraged the surfer 's humility in him .
He had been the kind of boy who always finished first .
Jojo taught Comiskey that in Asia , and in Shanghai especially , it was okay for the other guy to win , too .
Which is why he does n't feel guilty about the work he does here .
Sometimes he gets a call from a new client and knows right away what the conversation is really about behind the corporatespeak :
It 's about closing factories , downsizing and rightsizing , lowering costs , increasing margins .
The better he is at his job , the more Americans will lose theirs .
But he is n't looking out his window at Detroit , and he is n't in St. Louis .
He 's in Shanghai .
His perspective is global .
And from here , through his window , it looks as though America has finally returned to its former role of exporter : not of goods , but of good .
Of money , of technical expertise , of brainpower , but also of more important things .
It 's the reason Mr. Sun understands today why rulers should n't have lead in them .
It 's also why Comiskey finally decides to give Mr. Sun 's subcontractor another chance to make things right , and it's why Comiskey can smile through a hundred daily frustrations punctuated by the occasional calamity :
He has a missionary 's zeal .
He will make everything better .
He is the American .
He is the fixer .
Maybe the new Americans can help make China into something better than it is today .
But maybe they can help us change along the way .
Among the things that Comiskey 's learned : Maybe we do n't have all the answers .
" Americans have every right to be proud of their country , but maybe we 're not respectful enough of other countries , " he says .
" It 's like we do n't care what happens to anybody else .
We have to become better integrated into the world and its economy .
We have to become more than a destination for products and a source of culture .
We have to be willing to make some serious changes in how we see the world and the world sees us . "
Comiskey can remember the moment he finally saw clearly .
He was in another meeting at another factory about another problem .
He had been in Shanghai for nearly a year .
He still did n't speak the language .
Jojo was still his only conduit .
The factory 's manager was talking , and Jojo was turning to Comiskey to translate , and suddenly he realized that he knew what she was going to say .
He knew what the manager had said .
It all made sense .
As though in an instant , this seemingly incomprehensible language was English to him .
And along with it , this impenetrable country was his , too .
He did n't go over the wall ; the wall came down .
Suddenly , almost miraculously , his world opened up , and he saw then , in that meeting , this future for himself and for his new country .
That 's when he first thought , I live in the land of the possible .
One night , the Stanford Symphony Orchestra comes to town .
Comiskey gets tickets .
He goes with a couple of friends to the gorgeous new recital hall in Pudong .
Rain is falling outside , and everyone is soggy , the steam coming off their shoulders .
Waiting for the music to begin , a strange feeling fills the room , a kind of emptying out , like everyone is exhaling after their hard , hustling days and sinking deeper into their seats .
The orchestra takes the stage .
These kids are unmistakably American .
They are mostly white , mostly big , mostly healthy , mostly privileged .
They wear tuxedos and black dresses , cradling their cellos and violins , their music printed on crisp white pages in a language that only people like them know .
One of the trombone players has muttonchop sideburns ; the tuba player has a white man 's Afro , curly blond .
Spend enough time in Shanghai and even American college kids can look alien , Palo Alto becoming the moon .
The conductor stares down the audience , waiting for an American brand of quiet that 's unfamiliar in Shanghai .
At last he lifts his baton , and the music starts .
It 's like a gift .
It 's soaring and beautiful , providing the open space that we 've all been missing .
Two hours pass in twenty minutes .
After , back out in the rain , pushing toward the jammed night subway out of neon Pudong , Comiskey 's asked if seeing the concert made him miss home .
" No , " he says , jumping a puddle .
" I am home . "
Today , the solution is an umbrella .
A typhoon has hit southern China .
In Shanghai , hundreds of miles to the north , it 's arrived as the heavy , flooding rain that soaked the symphony audience .
On the long , muddy road in between , Comiskey is told , a truck has bogged down .
The truck is carrying the small batteries that need to be soldered to the circuit boards that drive the E Ink displays for the Esquire cover .
Seven different companies are making parts for the boards in seven different factories .
The batteries from southern China drive them all .
But the story of the truck is not true , not entirely .
Like a lot of stories in China , the truth is worse than the party line ; the Chinese hate so much to deliver bad news .
Comiskey heads out for EELY to find out the real story , and Simon cracks .
It 's true that a typhoon has hit southern China .
It 's probably true that several trucks are stuck on the road between here and there .
But none of those trucks contains Comiskey 's batteries .
The batteries never left the factory .
More than two hundred thousand of them were destroyed in the flood .
The battery supplier will have to begin making them all over again .
It 's June 30 .
The first batch of boards was supposed to be shipped on July 3 .
" That 's not going to happen , " Comiskey says .
Compounding the problem is a new government edict .
The rules can change in China overnight .
A few nights ago , they did .
Beginning July 1 , because of the Beijing Olympics and security concerns , the government will ban the shipment of anything classified as " dangerous goods " through eight mainland airports , including Shanghai's , for the next three months .
Somehow , batteries have fallen under the classification .
Comiskey asks for the batteries to be tested in a government lab that will prove they are safe .
He needs , in essence , for the government to change its own mind , which is like hoping for the rain to turn into rose petals , and he knows this to be true .
He wonders about the cost of sending a boat to Japan , filled with batteries that do n't yet exist .
He lives in the land of the possible , after all .
There are many more problems in China than there are in America .
But there are many more solutions .
Simon stutters smoke through his nostrils .
He 's worried that Comiskey is upset .
Simon thinks now is probably a good time for lunch .
Comiskey agrees .
They go to their usual restaurant .
Simon orders .
The food arrives in great piles .
Glasses are filled with beer , emptied , filled , and emptied again .
Outside , the rain continues to fall .
The car is a short walk away .
Simon does n't have his umbrella .
Comiskey opens his and gestures to Simon .
Simon steps out of the rain and under the umbrella .
The two men , one American , one Chinese , begin walking to the car together , in step and safe from the rain .
Simon puts his arm tight around Comiskey .
" It 's okay , " Comiskey says .
The American Diaspora
The city 's all engine .
There are no parks and there are no oases , unless you carve them out yourself .
( Stepping into the relative quiet of Comiskey 's garden , behind its high wall , feels like diving underwater . )
In those rare parts of the city where the sky suddenly opens up -- somewhere like the French Concession , where most of the foreigners live , with its Irish pubs , cobblestone streets , and treelined boulevards -- it can seem just as quickly closed off by pollution and vapor trails .
Sometimes when Comiskey goes back to the U.S. , he feels like the returning veteran of a foreign war .
" Like I 've returned to the land of milk and honey , " he says .
Even New York seems like a quaint English village in comparison .
He probably would n't have made it here without Jojo .
She would n't let him stay an outsider .
She did n't want to be his translator for life .
Early in their relationship , she took him to spend some time in Taiwan , a gentler place , more laid - back and even - keeled , and there she nurtured a side of Comiskey that might never have surfaced had he remained exclusively in Shanghai , or in America for that matter .
She did n't make him type B , exactly .
But she encouraged the surfer humility in him .
He had been the kind of boy who always finished first .
Jojo taught Comiskey that in Asia , and in Shanghai especially , it was okay for the other guy to win , too .
Which is why he does n't feel guilty about the work he does here .
Sometimes he gets a call from a new client and knows right away what the conversation is really about behind the corporatespeak :
It 's about closing factories , downsizing and rightsizing , lowering costs , increasing margins .

Pidgin users have a lot of things to be happy about with the release of the 2.6.0 version of their favorite instant messaging application , announced this morning by John Bailey .
Thanks to the hard work of developers and contributors , the new release has a plethora of new features , about 221 bug fixes , all listed in a changelog so big that it makes you think about Christmas wish lists .
For the video and audio part we have Mike Ruprecht to thank , who started to implement these features back in 2008 , in a Google Summer of Code project , so it was a lot of work to get this far .
For now , support for these functions is available only for XMPP , but the developers are working to bring at least partial support to the other protocols that Pidgin uses .
Audio and video call options on the Conversation menu for XMPP
Yahoo users have a lot to be happy about , especially if they 're on the Japanese part of the network .
Support for Yahoo Japan has been moved into a separate plugin , so from now on you can be logged in both parts of the network with the same id .
Also , SMS support is available in this version , along with peer - to - peer file transfer support to fix all those pesky problems that Pidgin had when moving large files over Yahoo .
Moreover , it 's now possible to add MSN buddies , but that feature wo n't reach prime - time until Pidgin 3.0.0 .
For all of these we have Sulabh Mahajan to thank , another Summer of Code student from 2008 .
Do n't think that XMPP voice and video support is all that users of this instant messaging protocol will get .
On top of that , buddy icon support ( avatar ) support is here , along with a service discovery browser plugin , custom smiley support , " buzzing " capabilities , idle time reporting , an alternative method for file transfers and , of course , many other bug fixes and enhancements .
Finch , Pidgin 's text - mode counterpart , received some attention too .
It now has a TinyURL plugin for URL shortening and some important bugfixes .
Update :
We 've discovered a few minutes ago that Pidgin 2.6.1 is available .
This release fixes a crash when some users send you a link in a Yahoo IM and some compilation problems on Windows or when the installed GTK + version was less than 2.6.0 .
Download Pidgin 2.6.1 right now from Softpedia .
Security researchers plan to reveal a security hole that would enable hackers to take complete control of an iPhone with a text - messaging attack .
Security researchers Charlie Miller and Collin Mulliner will publicize the exploit Thursday at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference , according to Forbes .
The researchers said the hack involves sending a series of mostly invisible SMS bursts that effectively hijack an iPhone .
From thereon , a hacker could control all the functions on the iPhone , such as e-mailing , dialing contacts — and , most alarmingly , sending more text messages to hijack even more iPhones .
How can you know if you 're being SMS attacked ?
According to Miller , one giveaway is if you receive a text message containing a single square character .
If that happens , he suggests you immediately turn off your iPhone .
" This is serious , " Miller told Forbes .
" The only thing you can do to prevent it is turn off your phone .
Someone could pretty quickly take over every iPhone in the world with this . "
Though many customers hail the iPhone as one of the most well designed and versatile smartphones , security researchers have criticized the phone for its weak security .
For example , Wired.com recently reported on forensics researcher Jonathan Zdziarski's discovery that the new iPhone 3GS ' data encryption can be cracked in a few minutes with free software .
Because of this flaw , Zdziarski recommended against the iPhone being used by businesses .
Miller and Mulliner said they contacted Apple about the SMS exploit a month ago , but the company has not released a software update to fix the issue .
Apple did not immediately respond to Wired.com 's request for comment .
Though the researchers informed Forbes of the SMS exploit , it 's worth noting they did not demonstrate it to Forbes .
We 'll be convinced this is true once we see it .

Reporters Without Borders has branded Iran as the new champion in journalistic repression , which wo n’t come as much of a shock for anyone following the crisis of the past week .
Five days ago , the BBC reported that foreign press had been confined to their offices or homes , and forbidden to report on anything in Iran without official approval .
Now they ’re being confined in the more traditional manner ( via Newsbeat1 ) :
The Islamic Republic of Iran now ranks alongside China as the world ’s biggest prison for journalists .
The crackdown has been intensified yet again following Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei ’s endorsement of the result of the 12 June presidential election and the opposition ’s decision to call another demonstration on 20 June .
Iran now has a total of 33 journalists and cyber - dissidents in its jails , while journalists who could not be located at their homes have been summoned by telephone by Tehran prosecutor general Said Mortazavi .
“ The force of the demonstrations in Tehran is increasing fears that more Iranian journalists could be arrested and more foreign journalists could be expelled , ” Reporters Without Borders said .
“ The regime has been visibly shaken by its own population and does not want to let this perception endure .
That is why the media have become a priority target . ”
The press freedom organisation added : “ The international community cannot continue to ignore the situation .
It must have a clear and unanimous reaction that is proportionate to the gravity of these events .
And there will never be any question of recognising the results of the 12 June election . ”
Maybe they should direct those remarks to the White House , especially that last statement .
Not only will Barack Obama accept those results , he wants direct talks with the people who fabricated them to keep their hold on power .
RSF ( from the French Reporters Sans Frontières ) lists a number of reporters that have gone missing , been arrested , or ordered to leave the country .
It also notes that a portal for reporting has been shut down :
After being blocked since 11 June , the Iranian news website Entekhab ( www.entekhabnews.com) has now been closed down on the orders of the Tehran prosecutor general .
Its most recent stories report that Mousavi criticized the extra polling time demanded by Ahmadinejad , the swine - flu outbreak in Israel , and that Palestinians rescued a family of “ Israeli occupiers . ”
The last update appears to be from June 13th , the day after the election and the day when protests erupted across Iran .
Iran does n’t even want it open for official reports , let alone the possibility that the repression and violence the regime is perpetrating might leak out in the form of reporting , pictures , and video .
RSF has taken a tougher stand on Iran and oppression than the White House .
Should n’t that embarrass the current occupants ?
The Pirate Bay was shut down by its ISP two days ago but the story is far from over .
After several false - starts , the Swedish company Global Gaming Factory X has approved its CEO ’s plans to purchase The Pirate Bay ’s domain .
The company intends to relaunch the service as a legal file sharing site .
We know that it ’s hard to get PirateBay down , or rather it ’s impossible .
Now , just because the board has approved the purchase does n’t mean that it will happen that easily .
There continue to be questions about the company ’s ability to raise money to complete the deal , and the Swedish government is investigating the company .
So does this change anything ?
Theoretically , maybe , but in reality , the Pirate Bay as it was once known is still gone , if it does come back it wo n’t be the same service , and users have already migrated out to other BitTorrent sites for their file sharing needs .
What ’s next ?
PirateBay Clone Threatened with LegaAction
On one side the parent is stuggling to be online , the new born clone faces Legal action .
When we first heard about BTARENA , the first Pirate Bay clone , we figured at some point in time , the RIAA would point their crosshairs at BTARENA .
That ’s exactly what ’s happening , according to the TorrentFreak blog — who was reportedly contacted by the Romanian AIMR ( Asociatia Industriei Muzicale din Romani ) with the following statement : “ We are Music Industry Association of Romania , and we represent the local labels for both romanian and international content .
The website btarena.org ( The Pirate Bay clone ) is hosted in Romania and we already started the legal action against it . ”
BTARENA ’s owner , by the name of Alex , is apparently aware of the so - claimed legal action by means of local news reports .
It is unknown how he will choose to proceed , but it is known that the site ’s host was also contacted about the matter by the AIMR .
The host stated they would relay the message to the site ’s owner .
As of this writing , the website is still up and running .
Still , it seems like the statement produced by AIMR to TorrentFreak was written by a seven - year - old .

The statistical test featured in the study is known as the “ False Discovery Rate , ” and is used in fields as diverse as computational biology and astronomy .
In effect , the method is designed to simultaneously avoid false positives and false negatives  in other words , conclusions that something is statistically significant when it is entirely random , and the reverse .
Both of those problems have plagued previous studies of mutual funds , Professor Wermers said .
The researchers applied the method to a database of actively managed domestic equity mutual funds from the beginning of 1975 through 2006 .
To ensure that their results were not biased by excluding funds that have gone out of business over the years , they included both active and defunct funds .
They excluded any fund with less than five years of performance history .
All told , the database contained almost 2,100 funds .
The researchers found a marked decline over the last two decades in the number of fund managers able to pass the False Discovery Rate test .
If they had focused only on managers running funds in 1990 and their records through that year , for example , the researchers would have concluded that 14.4 percent of managers had genuine stock - picking ability .
But when analyzing their entire fund sample , with records through 2006 , this proportion was just 0.6 percent  statistically indistinguishable from zero , according to the researchers .
This does n’t mean that no mutual funds have beaten the market in recent years , Professor Wermers said .
Some have done so repeatedly over periods as short as a year or two .
But , he added , “ the number of funds that have beaten the market over their entire histories is so small that the False Discovery Rate test can’t eliminate the possibility that the few that did were merely false positives ”  just lucky , in other words .
Professor Wermers says he was surprised by how rare stock - picking skill has become .
He had “ generally been positive about the existence of fund manager ability , ” he said , but these new results have been a “ real shocker . ”

For your consideration : A few Tweets from a complete nutcase :
( click on image to enlarge )
I have dished out a healthy share of criticism about the paths we are taking into the energy future , so perhaps it ’s time I offered some paths of my own .
I will outline them as simply as possible , since the data and thinking behind them could fill a book .
First we must know where we ’re going .
Credible models show that by the end of this century , essentially all of the fossil fuels on earth will be consumed — oil , natural gas , and coal .
Presumably , whatever fuels do remain at that point will be reserved for their highest and most valuable purposes like making crude oil into plastics and pharmaceuticals , not burning it in 15 % efficient internal combustion engines .
Consider the following world model for all fossil fuels :
Source : “ Olduvai Revisited 2008 , ” The Oil Drum , by Luís de Sousa and Euan Mearns .
Cumulative peak of fossil fuel energy is 2018 .
Data sources : Jean Laherrère for natural gas , Energy Watch Group for coal and The Oil Drum for oil .
[ This is an exceptional study and I recommend it to my readers ! ]
By the end of this century then , a mere 90 years from now , we ’ll need to have an infrastructure that runs exclusively on renewably generated electricity , biofuels , and possibly nuclear energy .
That ’s where we ’re going .
Fortunately , there is more than enough available renewable energy to meet all of our needs , if we can harness it .
Unfortunately , we ’re starting from a point at which less than 2 % of the world ’s energy comes from renewables like wind , solar and geothermal .
Hydro provides about 6 % , and nuclear about 6 % , but for reasons too numerous to get into here , some of which my longtime readers have already heard , I do n’t believe either source will increase much in the future , and both could actually decline .
Our challenge then is to make that 2 % fraction grow to replace about 86 % of the world ’s current primary energy , in 90 years or less .
We are currently at peak oil , a short , roughly 5 - year plateau which goes into terminal decline around 2012 .
All fossil fuel energy combined peaks around 2018 , less than a decade from now .
All strategies for accommodating the fossil fuel decline require decades to have any significant effect .
The now - iconic study “ Peaking of World Oil Production : Impacts , Mitigation , & Risk Management ” ( Hirsch et al. , 2005 ) demonstrated that it would take at least 20 years of intensive , crash - program mitigation efforts to meet the peak oil challenge gracefully .
Another study , “ Primary Energy Substitution Models : On the Interaction between Energy and Society , ” ( C. Marchetti , 1977 ) showed that it generally takes decades to substitute one form of primary energy for another , and 100 years for a given source of energy to achieve 50 % market penetration .
Therefore , we are going to have to accomplish most of the renewable energy revolution in a scenario of ever - declining fuel supply .
In just 50 years , we ’ll be working with about half our current energy budget .
So in fact we may only have about 50 years to build most of the new renewable energy and efficiency capacity we will need to get us through the end of the century .
Another important factor is that exports will fall off much faster than total supply .
( See my article on the oil export crisis from last year . )
Foucher and Brown ( 2008 ) have shown that the world ’s top five oil exporters could approach zero net oil exports by around 2031 .
Net energy importers like the US could be increasingly starved for fuel as decline sets in and accelerates , and net energy exporters could wind up shouldering much of the burden of new manufacturing .
This factor means that we will have to front - load as much of our development as possible .
The final and most important factor is population .
The few population models that actually take fossil fuel depletion into account assume that global population increases roughly out to the global fuel peak , and then stabilizes at that level or declines naturally while economic development promotes lower fertility rates and renewables and energy efficiency increase to fill the gap of declining fossil energy .
I understand why this assumption is made — because the alternative is too ghastly to contemplate — and for the immediate purpose of this article I will go along with it .
I will note however that history and scientific observation of populations suggest some sharp episodes of decline are more likely , and in my estimation we will end this century with a considerably smaller population than anyone forecasts , at some level well below today’s .
How , then , can we replace or offset through efficiency at least 40 % of our current energy supply with renewables in the next 50 years , while fuel prices are rising and the global economy is flat or shrinking due to a lack of fuel ?
A proper model for achieving this goal would be a very large undertaking , the sort of thing that should be done by a team of experts with a budget .
( Is anybody at the Department of Energy listening ? )
But I can identify some key pathways that are , in my estimation , no - brainers .
Because the solutions going forward will be quite different for each country , I will limit my recommendations to the US .
1 : Rail .
Rail should be Priority 1 , and should be granted the largest portion of public funding .
2 : Rooftop Solar PV .
Utility scale projects like giant solar farms in the desert and giant wind farms in the Midwest ( or offshore ) all face serious hurdles in siting , permitting , environmental impact , and transmission capability .
Rooftop photovoltaic ( PV ) solar systems face no such issues and can be deployed right now , building capacity incrementally over time .
3 : Alternative Vehicles .
Since reconfiguring our urban topology around transit and deploying light rail will take decades , we will need some transitional solutions that still allow us to get around in cars for a good many years .
4 : Efficiency .
Most of the efficiency gains we can make are thermal : reducing the energy it takes to heat and cool buildings .
5 : Utility Scale Renewables .
We ’ll need large solar plants across the Southwest , and huge wind farms in the Midwest and offshore .
6 : A Beefier , Smarter Grid .
The good news is that we already have most of the technologies we need in this area .
All that we lack is the will and the funding to put it in place .
7 : Keep Drilling .
If we back off too much too soon from oil and gas production , it could leave us without adequate or reasonably priced fuel to accomplish this transformation , and sink the entire effort .

[ Go to ``South Korea : Ssangyong workers face brutal police / thug attacks as factory occupation continues '' for the backgound to the sit-in . ]
Urgent appeal by the Korean Metal Workers Union and Korean Confederation of Trade Unions
[ Please send solidarity messages to the KCTU at inter@kctu.org ]
August 5 , 2009 -- Today , police helicopters dropped two containers of SWAT team members onto the roof of the assembly plant building ( adjacent to paintshop ) .
They began to rush out and assault union members who were on the roof of the assembly line building .
See Hangyoreh newspaper video above .
More video HERE , HERE and HERE .
Two union members who were being chased by SWAT team members on the roof of the assembly building fell off the building and plummeted to the ground .
One of the union members who plummeted to the ground during this operation has head , neck and back injuries , particularly to vertebrae 3 and 4 .
Another union member ( in his early 40s ) was shot directly in the head and lost consciousness .
He woke up in the hospital needing 20 stitches to his head .
The doctor believes he was shot at close range with a rubber bullet .
A fire broke out in the assembly line building which is connected to the paintshop building by third floor walkway .
We are afraid the fire could spread to the paint shop .
A union member ( in his early 40s ) was shot directly in the head and lost consciousness .
He woke up in the hospital needing 20 stitches to his head .
The doctor believes he was shot at close range with a rubber bullet .
Another union member ( in his late 30s ) was dodging water cannon fire , and let his wooden shelter ( used as shield ) spread open a little and was promptly hit in the chest with a large nut with enough force to cause a fracture to his ribs .
Riot cops fire taser - like weapons
Other injuries to union members include : electrical shock by taser gun ; shot by rubber bullet fired by what police call a “ multipurpose launcher ” ; head split open ; broken bones ; harm caused by riot police boots , batons and sharpened edges of riot shields .
Riot police arrested people requiring hospitalisation and dragged them to police station for questioning , briefly having open wounds stitched together .
Meanwhile company goons and private security forces rushed out of the plant around 9 am to clear out the union supporters encamped in front of the plant .
They began beating people with wooden sticks and steel pipes , pulling people away from the group of supporters and ripping apart our tents again ( as they had also done on August 4 ) .
The private forces directed by the company have no authority to use force much less beat women and unionists on the sidewalk outside the plant .
When students came to our aid , the company forces backed off and the riot police cleared away the students with tear gas - laced water cannons .
The paint shop # 2 , the only remaining occupied building , is the light blue building .
Korean Metal Workers '
Union members are hanging in there and the strike - attacking forces have been unable to enter the paintshop 2 building ( the union offices are on the 3rd and 4th floor of the building , the paintshop is on the 1st and 2nd floor ) .
We already have a near comatose union member with spinal cord injury , a fire in the assembly line building and we have no water for fire - fighting purposes ( much less for drinking or washing ) .
The fact that the South Korean government is even attempting this raid at all in spite of the extremely dangerous situation is excessive if not lethal behaviour .
The continued denial of food , water , proper medical care is an ongoing human rights violation .
We desperately need the International Labour Organisation to make some some kind of intervention asking South Korean government to call off this extraordinarily dangerous raid and participate in negotiations over alternatives to dismissal and a future for the plant .
Our union members ' lives are at stake .
Any international solidarity demonstrations should take place in front of South Korean embassies with the above two demands .
We also appreciate it if you use any other diplomatic channels possible to ask the South Korean government to stop the raid and participate in or foster negotiations .
August 4 , 2009 : Day of fierce fighting
By Owen Miller in Seoul
August 4 , 2009 -- Socialist Worker ( UK ) --
The attack began at dawn today and lasted until late afternoon .
Under a hail of metal bolts and stones from Ssangyong company thugs , liquid tear gas dropped from police helicopters , incessant loud music and an all - out assault by police commandos armed with steel pipes and taser guns , the occupying workers at the Ssangyong auto factory in Pyeongtaek , South Korea , have held out for one more day .
The factory occupation began in May .
They forced back a number of attempts by police to retake the car plant ’s paintshop , using every means at their disposal including flaming barricades , petrol bombs , slingshots and anti-helicopter spikes .
This sort of fierce resistance reflects the real desperation of workers faced with the loss of their jobs and unlikely to find another in South Korea ’s harsh labour market .
It is also a reaction to the sheer brutality of the company and the South Korean government in their repeated attempts to crush the occupying workers .
There is a widespread belief here that the right - wing Lee Myung - bak government wants to make an example of the Ssangyong workers and achieve a decisive victory against unionised labour in South Korea in order to pave the way for more widespread restructuring .
There are now around 500 - 540 workers left inside the factory ’s paintshop , living under terrible conditions after more than two months of occupation .
The company and police have been enforcing a complete blockade on the occupying workers and for the last week they have had very little to eat or drink and practically no water to use for washing or going to the toilet .
Many of the workers have sustained injuries during the last week of fighting but the company and police have consistently tried to block medical aid from reaching them .
Negotiations took place at the weekend between management and union leaders but they were broken off by the company on Sunday morning .
Now the company , which has been under bankruptcy protection since February , faces liquidation in the next day or two and it is likely that many more will lose their jobs .
Although it is clear that nationalisation is the only solution for the ailing car company , the Lee Myung - bak government seems quite happy to let it sink as long as it can score a victory against a militant section of the working class .
The remaining workers say they are ready to fight on and are surrounded by thousands of litres of flammable liquids which pose a threat to both themselves and the attacking police .
On the outside of the paintshop building the occupiers have daubed the words , “ If you do n’t want to talk , you ’d better kill us all ! ”
The families of the Ssangyong workers have been camped outside the plant for weeks and themselves faced violent attacks from company thugs and strike - breaking employees who have smashed up their tents in the early hours of the morning .
This evening at 6.30 pm , as the day of fighting came to an end , they released green helium balloons over the factory as a signal of solidarity with their loved ones inside the occupation .
Despite their pleas for more negotiations there is little doubt that tomorrow morning will bring another savage assault from the police .

A special division of 2500 police are engaged in an assault on the occupied factory .
The cops have removed most barricades and are using aerial ladders to attempt to reach the fortified roof positions of the strikers .
Three helicopters are supporting the cop attack .
Hand - to - hand battles are presently occurring and the strikers are fighting back with molotov cocktails .
Starting at 10.30 am , more than 400 riot cops , using aerial ladders , failed to take the roof from the workers .
In the map below , the red circles show areas where the cops are fighting to overtake the strikers ' positions .
The paint department is at the bottom , containing the number " 2 . "
The workers still control the assembly - line buildings , shown by the numbers " 3 " and " 4 " .
The riot cops have managed to take control of the areas " 1 " and " 2 " , which are the three circles on the lower left .
On the ground level , the cops are five meters from the paint department building .
At present , more than 2500 special forces police are involved in the attack .
Around 9am , 2000 scabs , who are the company loyalists wearing uniforms with armbands , were brought in to " clean up the factory " and in the process destroyed the strike supporters ' encampment .
Around 10 am , scabs marched to factory from company parking lot , then attacked the strike supporters , destroying their water and medical supplies .
And emptied out water intended for the workers occupying the factory .
Strikers , with sign saying : " If you come in , there will be fire " .

Organisers of the Melbourne International Film Festival ( MIFF ) are expecting continued attacks over the screening of a documentary about exhiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer .
Chinese hackers have targeted the festival 's website putting tickets on hold , so that it appears all sessions had been sold out .
They are pushing to have the documentary The Ten Conditions of Love withdrawn from the festival .
MIFF executive director Richard Moore says organisers were shocked by the results of the latest attempt to derail the festival .
" That 's sort of like the dream of an executive director , but it just does n't happen , so we went behind the system and we found out that there 's a fairly sophisticated attack on our ticketing system , " he said .
" Basically meaning that people , we 're identifying them from China , are loading tickets into their cart and basically holding all those tickets so that every session looks like it 's sold out , when in fact they 're not . "
Australia 's diplomatic relations with China are being tested over the website attacks .
The Australian Ambassador in Beijing has been summoned to hear China 's protest about Rebiya Kadeer 's visit to Melbourne next week for the film 's premier .
Mr Moore says officials have found a Chinese website which tells people who to disrupt the event 's ticket sales .
He says people have also been targeting the phone and fax systems .
" They 're attacking the telephone system by ringing us and we answer the phone and it says ' you are on hold ' from a particular service in the United States , " he said .
" So this has really seriously escalated and it's a direct attempt to sabotage the festival .
" I 've got here a whole pile of faxes , I mean , this is just a small sample of them : this one here shows ' LOL , a bunch of pathetic kangaroos ' and then behind is reams and reams of Chinese text , " he said .
" On the ID of the fax it says China and it gives a telephone number . "
Mr Moore says he is in contact with Victoria Police about the attacks .
" They 're consulting with various other agencies , so we 're keeping them abreast of the situation , " he said .
" I 'm not sure how it 's going to escalate , but I know that Rebiya Kadeer is due to come into town next week , so we 're expecting another onslaught next week . "
Organisers say tickets are still available at the Box Office or over the phone .

Canada is about to reform its copyright law .
Our government is holding a public consultation , and we need to be involved .
Big media companies are pushing hard to make more activity illegal and to institute extraordinarily harsh penalties .
They want your Internet provider to spy on your private communications to make sure you are n’t sharing anything you should n’t .
They want to terminate your Internet access on the basis of mere accusations of infringement — with no need to prove you did anything wrong .
They want to outlaw DVD players capable of playing legally purchased movies from Asia , Europe , or South America .
They would allow teachers to critique popular culture without asking for permission — but then force them to destroy the lesson materials , and ensure that all students ’ copies are also destroyed .
This is not hyperbole .
In the United States , many of these measures are already a reality .
Amazon sells electronic books .
It went into customers ’ e-book readers and deleted books they had paid for .
Copyright law was on Amazon ’s side : not because the customers had done anything wrong , but because Amazon manufactured the readers .
One of the books ?
George Orwell ’s 1984 .
An American woman was recently fined $ 1.9 million for sharing 24 of her favourite songs on - line .
The response of the Department of Justice ?
That the judgement was not “ disproportionate to the offense ” .
Bankers who have cost the economy trillions receive bonuses , while file - sharers are driven to bankruptcy .
U.S. copyright law has suffered regulatory capture by media and technology behemoths .
The U.S. in turn has threatened Canada with non-cooperation on trade unless we follow its lead on copyright .
Many of these measures were proposed in Bill C - 61 , introduced in Parliament last year .
When Canadians found out what was happening , tens of thousands wrote to their MPs .
Appropriation Art , an artists ’ group , described the bill as “ censorship ” .
Documentary filmmakers said that the law would block them from commenting on aspects of our politics and culture .
Hundreds of Canadian musicians , who had already broken with the American - led Canadian Recording Industry Association over this issue , responded that they saw nothing in this bill for them .
Following the unexpected resistance to C - 61 , the Canadian government decided to ask Canadians what kind of copyright we want .
Until September 13 , the government is holding public consultations about what should be in the new law .
This law will affect you .
It will shape the kind of society and culture you live in .
It will effect fees of up to 25 cents a page to be paid by students to study their own culture ( American law exempts educational use ) .
It will determine whether we get to decide how we use our cellphones and our computers , or whether manufacturers can dictate exactly what we can and cannot do — regardless of whether it has anything to do with copyright .
It will determine whether artists need permission before they make political and social comment on our society .
All the evidence from around the world is that draconian copyright laws do not work .
They fail to stop freeloaders .
But they are devastatingly effective at restricting artists and innovators — because they operate in the public eye .
People see this .
When they see copyright blocking the creativity it is supposed to promote , they lose respect for the law .
For copyright law to be effective , it must be respected .
To be respected , it must be fair .
I am a member of the Vancouver Fair Copyright Coalition .
We want a fair law that benefits all Canadians — artists , innovators , educators , citizens , consumers .
At faircopy.ca/ , you can find more details .
You can download a guide that makes it easy to write a submission reflecting your interests .
Please participate in the consultation .
Please help our government write a good law .

Shoaib Akhtar realised West Ham 's match against Millwall was going to be a night to remember – for the worst reasons – when he looked out of his kebab shop window and saw a bloodied fan uprooting a concrete bollard to hurl into a crowd of screaming rivals .
What started as a normal , midweek Carling Cup tie , with Hammers supporters crowding into the take - away 500 metres from the Boleyn Ground before kick - off , had within 10 minutes become what one witness described as a " scene from hell " .
" These guys looked and behaved like they wanted to kill each other , " he added .
The rampage outside Upton Park Tube station on Green Street , the multicultural thoroughfare that leads to the stadium , was merely the opening salvo in nearly six hours of violence inside and outside the ground on Tuesday night .
It drew comparisons with the football hooliganism of the 1970s and 1980s , and yesterday prompted allegations that police and officials had dropped their guard for a pre-arranged clash between two sets of fans with a century - long history of mutual hatred and drink - fuelled barbarity .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
With broken glass and pieces of brick still littering the street , Mr Akhtar , 37 , said : " It was like someone fired a starting pistol .
They were just animals . "
Scotland Yard said it was using a specialist team to identify from CCTV footage the perpetrators of the clashes inside and outside the ground .
The Football Association promised life bans for anyone involved .
Messages left on websites and chatrooms , apparently by members of notorious hooligan " firms " associated with the two clubs , showed that the tie had been identified as an opportunity for a showdown between the rival groups , whose teams are separated by two divisions and last played each other in 2005 .
One message advised : " Make sure you bring your bats and do n't bring your kids . "
Another message posted on Monday on the West Ham fans forum , Bubble Blowers , laid out plans to rendezvous with a hard core of the 2,300 - strong Millwall contingent , saying : " Heartfelt message to all concerned .
PLEASE be in the right place at the right time tomorrow .
No fucking excuses .
We can all hang our head in shame if we let any of those cunts even think they can take liberties . "
Senior police admitted they were aware of plans for a brawl but insisted they were adequately prepared for the match , which was designated " category five " , with the highest risk of hooliganism .
Chief Superintendent Steve Wisbey , the officer in charge of policing the game , said the violence was limited to a small number of supporters .
But witnesses found this difficult to square with the events that ultimately required the presence of more than 700 riot police , and whose aftermath left one man stabbed in the chest , 13 people arrested and dozens of fans bloodied and bruised .
Among those treated at the scene was a man who was hit in the head with a dart .
After the initial skirmish outside the Tube station , splinter groups of supporters roamed surrounding streets looking for a confrontation as the match was being played .
A 43 - year - old man , reportedly an innocent bystander , was in a stable condition in hospital last night after he was knifed in the chest during these clashes .
In a statement on their official website , West Ham said they were investigating the " appalling events " at the Boleyn Ground to ensure appropriate was action taken as swiftly as possible , with life bans for anyone behind the disturbances .
The chief executive , Scott Duxbury , said : " We will leave no stone unturned in identifying the perpetrators , rooting them out and then taking the proper action .
The vast majority of people at the game were law - abiding , loyal football fans and a small minority spoiled it for everyone .
They will not be allowed to succeed . "
But his words fell on deaf ears among some of those involved .
Jonny , a Millwall supporter who said he saw the violence but did not take part , told The Independent : " I 'm delighted .
The best thing that came out of last night was the reignition of the hatred between us .
Shame it can't be like that every week . "
The best league in the world is back .

Researchers at the University of Texas have developed a method to create photovoltaic panels at one - tenth the cost of existing technologies using nanoparticle " inks " to generate electricity from the sun .
The group , lead by Brian Korgel in the University 's chemical engineering department , predicts that the technology , which would allow solar panels to be painted on rooftops or the sides of buildings , could be market - ready in three to five years .
" The sun provides a nearly unlimited energy resource , " Korgel said in a statement , " but existing solar energy harvesting technologies are prohibitively expensive and cannot compete with fossil fuels . "
The technology has been in development for the past two years , with Korgel collaborating with professors Al Bard and Paul Barbara , both of the University of Texas 's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , and Professor Ananth Dodabalapur of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department .
The team last year published a proof of concept paper in the Journal of the American Chemical Society .
{related_content}When the technology has been improved , the panels could consist of inks painted on plastic or stainless steel , or directly onto buildings themselves .
While the technology has yet to reach efficiency levels of existing solar technologies -- currently the spray - on panels are just 1 percent efficient , while existing panels can reach 25 percent efficiency or more -- using the nanoparticles can potentially boost efficiency because of the tiny size of the materials .
" If we get to 10 percent , then there 's real potential for commercialization , " Korgel said .
" If it works , I think you could see it being used in three to five years . "
Korgel added that other future uses for the technology could include a semi- transparent layer that would allow windows to double as solar cells .
An outspoken Communist Party official in China has confirmed long - held suspicions that GDP data was being massaged and exaggerated by regional party leaders to show higher economic growth , in the process “ squandering social resources . ”
In a brutally honest and searing speech recently , Wang Yang , the reformist - minded party secretary of Guangdong province in southern China , laid bare the dishonest means party leaders at the provincial level were employing “ to polish their numbers . ”
Since
Wang is one of the few provincial party leaders who is also a member of the decision - making central Politburo , his words — and the fact that even the official media has reported them — is being seen as a signal that Beijing is wary of the accuracy of GDP data reported by the provinces .
“ Some of our GDP data sure looks rosy , ” Wang told party officials .
“ But they do not amount to growth of social wealth ; in fact , social resources are being wasted to show GDP growth . ”
For instance , he said , provincial party officials build a bridge , which contributes to GDP ; they then “ dismantle ” and rebuild the bridge , each time contributing to GDP .
“ We may have boosted our GDP this way , but this is a huge waste of social resources . ”
Likewise , he said , some regional governments registered GDP growth by encouraging “ polluting industries ” , and then showed even higher growth by cleaning up the pollution .
Wang said that such practices , which went against “ the laws of a market economy ” , were causing him deep disquiet .
“ Amidst the economic downturn , when everyone is eager to show ‘ rosy ’ numbers , all manner of backward productive forces are being revived , ” he said .
Chinese policymakers have set a target of 8 % GDP growth for this year , and going by the 7.9 % GDP growth reported for the first half of 2009 , that looks like it will be achieved .
But independent economists have expressed scepticism about the authenticity of the official data ( Is China faking economic recovery ?
DNA Money , June 26 , 2009 ) .
Others have voiced concern that an excessive preoccupation with the pace of growth ( as opposed to the quality of growth ) was spawning structural distortions in the Chinese economy ( ‘ China should get rid of its GDP growth target ’ , DNA Money , July 25 , 2009 ) .
Indicatively , the provincial GDP data for the first half of 2009 , released by China ’s 31 provinces over the past week , adds up to 1 trillion yuan higher ( or about 10 % more ) than the national GDP data released by Beijing earlier this month .
Strikingly , 24 of the 31 provinces reported growth rates higher than the national average —- which , while not statistically impossible , is highly improbable , according to economists .
Party leader
Wang argues that instead of artificially boosting GDP data , provincial leaders should focus on “ restructuring and transforming ” the industrial structure —- that is , move away from labour - intensive , low - technology , polluting and energy - inefficient industries .

FAITH & REASON FAITH & REASON Blog : Join the conversation on religion , spirituality and ethics | Forum : Debate fellow readers PARIS 
In a groundbreaking case , a Paris court will decide for the first time whether to dissolve the Church of Scientology in France , which is facing charges of organized fraud .
The demand was made by French prosecutors on Monday as they wrapped up their case against the church 's Paris headquarters and bookshop .
If found guilty , the institutions may also face a nearly $ 6 million fine .
FAITH & REASON : Newspaper alleges Scientology leadership is harsh , violent Six members of the church are also on trial , and may also face heavy fines along with prison sentences if convicted .
The plaintiffs , two former Scientologists , claim the church conned them into spending tens of thousands of dollars in bogus products in the 1990s , including an " electrometer " that the church says can measure energy levels .
But the church , which claims a membership of 45,000 in France , rejects the accusations and claims it is being persecuted .
The plaintiffs , are " apostates who ... want to criticize their ex-religion , " Fabio Amicarelli , a European Scientology representative , told French media recently .
While the charges pose the most serious challenge to the French church to date , they are only the latest clash in a nearly two - decade long battle against Scientology .
Several fraud cases have already been judged and several members convicted of embezzlement in France , where Scientology is viewed with deep suspicion .
In one case , the head of the church 's Lyons chapter was sentenced to 18 months in prison in 1996 for his role in a member 's suicide .
Founded in 1954 by late American science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard , the church is considered a religion in the United States with adherents that include Hollywood stars Tom Cruise and John Travolta .
The French government , however , lists Scientology as a sect , reflecting an official intolerance of unorthodox religions .
Indeed , the government even has an official sect watchdog body — known as MIVILUDES , the Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combatting Cultic Deviances .
A government report published in May said the number of religious sects had tripled in France over the past 15 years to at least 600 different movements .

A premature baby declared dead by doctors at a hospital in Paraguay was found to be alive hours later when he was taken home for a funeral wake .
Jose Alvarenga said he had discovered his son was alive after he heard crying from the box in which he was placed .
The baby is now back at the same hospital 's intensive care unit and reported to be in a stable condition .
The head of paediatric care at the hospital said a doctor had not properly checked the infant 's vital signs .
" This is a very unusual case , " Ernesto Weber told the AFP news agency , adding that an investigation into the incident would be carried out .
A doctor who works at the hospital 's maternity unit said staff had tried to revive the baby for an hour before declaring him dead .
" His pulse was so low that it was undetectable , " Aida Notario said .
According to medical records , the baby weighed only 500g ( 17.6oz ) .
The smallest on record was an American baby who weighed just 280g ( 10 oz ) , born at less than 22 weeks .
The rise in killings was not seen among people receiving care
The number of people killed by those with a mental illness increased between 1997 and 2005 , official figures show .
The National Confidential Inquiry reported while 54 people were killed in England and Wales in 1997 , this had risen to over 70 in both 2004 and 2005 .
It was murders by people who were not under mental health care which accounted for the increase .
The head of the inquiry said the report must be kept " in perspective " , but that the rise needed to be investigated .
The research , which was funded by the National Patient Safety Agency , was carried out by University of Manchester researchers .
It found that the number of suicides among in - patients had by 2006 fallen to its lowest level since data collection began in 1997 - from 219 to 141 .
These figures illustrate yet again the way in which the care in the community policy can fail to protect both patients and the public .
Marjorie Wallace
Sane
But there were nonetheless hundreds of suicides over that period among patients who had left a ward without permission .
The majority of these were open wards , although there were cases of patients absconding from secure units and then killing themselves .
There were no homicides by people who had absconded from secure units in the nine years to 2005 .
There was however an increase in the number of perpetrators with symptoms of mental illness at the time of the killing , but not in mental health care .
These symptoms included hypomania , depression , delusions and other psychotic manifestations .
Of those who were psychotic , nearly 80 % had a diagnosis of schizophrenia .
The inquiry noted a rise in the number of homicides by people with schizophrenia - from 25 in 1997 to 46 in 2004 .
Pleas ' unheeded ' Professor Louis Appleby , Director of the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness , said : " There has been an unexplained rise in the number of homicides by people with mental illness and we now have to try to understand why this has happened .
" It is important to emphasise that the increase has not occurred in mental health patients .
It is also important to keep these findings in perspective .
" The risk of being a victim of homicide in England and Wales is around 1 in 1,000 and the risk of being killed by someone with schizophrenia is around 1 in 20,000 . "
Marjorie Wallace , chief executive of the mental health charity Sane , said : " We are concerned by the disturbing increase in the number of people with severe mental illness , particularly schizophrenia , who commit homicide .
The stigma around mental health can stop people from asking for help , and this only stresses the importance of ensuring people feel they can come forward when in distress , and seek support
Paul Farmer
Mind " While such cases are extremely rare in comparison with the general population , we believe many could be prevented if mental health services provided better care and treatment .
" These figures illustrate yet again the way in which the care in the community policy can fail to protect both patients and the public .
" In many cases known to us , the person with mental illness had shown all the warning signs before the tragedy and the families ' pleas gone unheeded . "
Paul Farmer , chief executive of mental health charity Mind : " Homicides by people with mental health problems are very rare , and account for only a small proportion of all homicides - contrary to the stereotypes , figures show that you have as much chance of being hit by lightning as being killed by a stranger with a mental health problem .
" Although such tragic incidents do occur , there has been no increase in homicides by people who are in touch with mental health services , or receiving treatments .
The stigma around mental health can stop people from asking for help , and this only stresses the importance of ensuring people feel they can come forward when in distress , and seek support . "

SAO PEDRO , Brazil --
For generations the residents of Sao Pedro , Brazil and neighboring Candido Godoi have known their isolated hamlet in southern Brazil was special .
Twins Lenardo and Edwardo , six , are just one of the 40 pairs of twins in the hamlet of Sao Pedro , Brazil .
more photos »
They say about a decade ago the rest of the world figured it out too .
Since then , despite the remoteness , they 've been visited by researchers , authors , journalists and even a few tourists .
We saw the print articles , we knew the story ; 40 pairs of twins in just a four kilometer stretch of land .
But it sounded too good to pass up .
It was something we had to see for ourselves .
So when we landed in Rio de Janeiro , it was the first story we set out to cover .
A second flight to the southern city of Porto Alegre and then what turned out to be a ten hour drive and we finally found ourselves in " the Land of Twins . "
On a foggy , misty , winter morning we set out to find the residence of Paulo Sauthier , who like many here can trace his roots to the area 's first European settlers .
And like many , is a twin .
Watch the Vital Signs ' team report on the twins phenomenon »
The area around Sauthier 's home is unassuming , rural farmland .
And at the time we arrived , there really was n't much to see , just Paulo in his front yard , ready to greet us .
But then through the mist they came , car after car , twin after twin .
There was Cladis and Clovis , John and Javan , Lenardo and Edwardo .

Over Sunday brunch they talked about the mystery surrounding the twins .
They told us , it was an attitude .
Women here just sort of expect to have pairs .
They say even the cows are twins .
The explanations for the phenomenon are numerous .
Healthy lifestyle and healthy food are popular .
Even more popular , they say , is the existence of a magical mineral in the town 's water .
They seem in no hurry to crack the mystery , content in their uniqueness .
Geneticist Ursula Matte , has been studying the twins of Sao Pedro and Candido Godoi off and on for over a decade .
" You have what in genetics is called a founders effect , " Matte told CNN .
" Propagated because there are n't too many people coming from the outside to this community . "
Matte says the answer almost certainly lies in genetics .
She is currently studying blood samples in hopes of isolating the gene responsible .
But until then , the mystery remains , which seems to be just alright , with residents in " the Land of Twins . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Men who drink beer or liquor on a regular basis may face a heightened risk of several different types of cancer , according to a Canadian study .

Researchers from McGill University in Montreal surveyed nearly 3,600 Canadian men aged 35 to 70 and found those who averaged at least a drink per day had higher risks of a number of cancers than men who drank occasionally or not at all .
These included cancers of the esophagus , stomach , colon , lungs , pancreas , liver and prostate .
When the researchers looked at individual types of alcohol , though , only beer and “ spirits ” -- and not wine -- were linked to elevated cancer risks .
In general , the odds increased in tandem with the men ’s lifetime alcohol intake , according to findings published in the Cancer Prevention and Detection .
With several cancers , men who drank at least once per day tended to have higher risks than those who drank on a regular , but less - than - daily , basis .
When it came to esophageal cancer , for instance , men who drank one to six times per week had an 83 percent higher risk than teetotalers and less - frequent drinkers , while daily drinkers had a three - fold higher risk .
In addition , when the researchers looked only at daily drinkers , the risks generally increased with the number of years the men had been drinking daily .
“ Our results show that the heaviest consumers over the lifetime had the biggest increases in the risks of multiple sites of cancer , ” researcher Dr. Andrea Benedetti told Reuters Health .
Many studies have suggested that moderate drinking -- usually defined as no more than a drink or two per day -- can be a healthy habit , particularly when it comes to heart disease risk .
But the current study suggested that even such moderate drinking levels are linked to higher risks of certain cancers , at least when the alcohol of choice is beer or liquor .
The question of whether moderate drinkers should cut down , however , cannot be answered by a single study , according to Benedetti .
“ In terms of balancing this risk ( of cancer ) with risks of cardiovascular disease , people should talk with their doctor , ” she said .
After a year - long investigation by the US government into allegations of tax fraud at UBS , the Swiss bank agreed to give up the account details of as many as 4,450 Americans .
The individuals in question are suspected by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) of tax evasion .
But some believe that the accounts could have been used to hide cash not just from the tax man .
If the names are released to the public , the account holders could see a flurry of lawsuits from ex-wives , creditors and business partners on suspicion of hidden money , lawyers told Time .
" You see allegations of Swiss bank accounts in divorce proceedings all the time , " Prominent New York City divorce lawyer Raoul Lionel Felder told the magazine .
" A lot of divorces are going to get opened up , " he said to Time .
Felder told
Time that he is already getting calls from clients who long suspected their exs had been hiding money that could have been rightfully theirs .
Most US states do n’t have a statute of limitations for divorce cases , so a previous settlement could become void if it was discovered that assets were undisclosed , the Time report pointed out .
It is it 's not clear how many of the UBS accounts will be made public as the IRS is giving holders until September 23 to come clean about fraud to try and avoid jail time , the report said .
Early disclosure would likely allow the account holders to remain anonymous .
However , if the holder used their UBS account to defraud a bankruptcy court or others , it is possible they would not get clemency from the IRS , the report said .
" People hid money in Swiss bank accounts not just to avoid the IRS , but other creditors as well , " Martin Press , a lawyer representing numerous UBS clients , told Time magazine .
" If these names become public , we are going to see a number of cases of bankruptcy fraud , corporate fraud and divorce fraud , " he told Time .

The evictions by Israel sparked protests at the scene
The US has led international condemnation of Israel after it evicted nine Palestinian families living in two houses in occupied East Jerusalem .
Washington said the action was not in keeping with Israel 's obligations under the so - called " road map " to resolve the Israel - Palestinian conflict .
Jewish settlers moved into the houses almost immediately .
Israel occupied East Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed it , a move not recognised by the world community .
The removal of the 53 people was also condemned by the United Nations , the Palestinians and the UK government .
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said he was outraged at the action .
" Israel is once again showing its utter failure to respect international law , " he said .
" New settlers from abroad are accommodating themselves and their belongings in the Palestinian houses and 19 newly homeless children will have nowhere to sleep . "
' Deplorable '
The operation to evict the Palestinians from the Sheikh Jarrah district of the city was carried out before dawn on Sunday by police clad in black riot gear .
Israel 's Supreme Court ordered the eviction , following a complex 37 - year legal battle during which Israeli courts upheld a claim that the land is Jewish - owned .
Jewish groups want to build homes for settlers in the area .
Eviction in battle for E Jerusalem " I deplore today 's totally unacceptable actions by Israel , " the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process , Robert H Serry said .
" These actions are contrary to the provisions of the Geneva Conventions related to occupied territory .
" These actions heighten tensions and undermine international efforts to create conditions for fruitful negotiations to achieve peace . "
The UK government said the Israeli action was " incompatible with the Israeli professed desire for peace " .
" We urge Israel not to allow the extremists to set the agenda , " the British Consulate in East Jerusalem said .
Sovereignty ' unquestionable ' Israel considers a united Jerusalem to be the capital of the state of Israel .
" Our sovereignty over it is unquestionable , " Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last month .
" We cannot accept the idea that Jews will not have the right to live and buy [ homes ] anywhere in Jerusalem . "
The BBC's Tim Franks in Jerusalem says the houses are in what is probably the most contested city on earth and the diplomatic ripples from the evictions will spread .
The UN said the 53 people evicted comprised nine families belonging to the Hanoun and al - Ghawi extended families .
The legal battle over the site has been complex .
Jordan , which occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem after the creation of Israel in 1948 , and the UN housed several Palestinian families on the plot of land .
But Israeli courts have since upheld a Jewish association 's claim that the site was owned by Jews before that , and their demand for rent that the Palestinian families have refused to pay .
Palestinian and left - wing Israeli organisations say Palestinians and Israeli - Arabs cannot , in the same way , make effective ownership claims to land dating back to before 1948 through the Israeli court system .
There are an estimated 250,000 Palestinians living in East Jerusalem and 200,000 Jews .

They say history repeats itself .
If you are like me and have lived two lives , you have a good chance of seeing the re-enactment with your own eyes .
The current takeover of General Motors by the U.S. government and United Auto Workers makes me think back to Romania 's catastrophic mismanagement of the car factories it built jointly with the French companies Renault and Citroen .
I was Romania 's car czar .
When the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu decided in the mid-1960s that he wanted to have a car industry , he chose me to start the project rolling .
In the land of the blind , the one - eyed man is king .
I knew nothing about manufacturing cars , but neither did anyone else among Ceausescu 's top men .
However , my father had spent most of his life running the service department of the General Motors affiliate in Bucharest .
My job at the time was as head of the Romanian industrial espionage program .
Ceausescu tasked me to mediate the purchase of a minimum , basic license for a small car from a major Western manufacturer , and then to steal everything else needed to produce the car .
Three Western companies competed for the honor .
Ceausescu decided on Renault , because it was owned by the French government ( all Soviet bloc rulers distrusted private companies ) .
We ended up with a license for an antiquated and about - to - be - discontinued Renault - 12 car , because it was the cheapest .
" Good enough for the idiots , " Ceausescu decided , showing what he thought of the Romanian people .
He baptized the car Dacia , to commemorate Romania 's 2,000 - year history going back to Dacia Felix , as the ancient Romans called that part of the world .
In that government - run economy , symbolism was the most important consideration , especially when it came to things in short supply ( such as food ) .
" Too luxurious for the idiots , " Ceausescu decreed when he saw the first Dacia car made in Romania .
Immediately , the radio , right side mirror and backseat heating were dropped .
Other " unnecessary luxuries " were soon eliminated by the bureaucrats and their workers ' union that were running the factory .
The car that finally hit the market was a stripped - down version of the old , stripped - down Renault 12 .
" Perfect for the idiots , " Ceausescu approved .
Indeed , the Romanian people , who had never before had any car , came to cherish the Dacia .
For the Western market , however , the Dacia was a nightmare .
To the best of my knowledge , no Dacia car was ever sold in the U.S .
Ceausescu , undaunted , was determined to see Romanian cars running around in every country in the world .
He tasked me to buy another Western license , this time to produce a car tailored for export .
Oltcit was the name of the new car -- an amalgam made from the words Oltenia , Ceausescu 's native province , and the French car maker Citroen , which owned 49 % of the shares .
Oltcit was projected to produce between 90,000 and 150,000 compact cars designed by Citroen .
Ceausescu micromanaged Oltcit , but he did n't even know how to drive a car , much less run a car industry .
To save the foreign currency he coveted , he decreed that the components for the Oltcit were to be manufactured at 166 existing Romanian factories .
Coordinating 166 plants to have them deliver all the parts on time would be a monumental job even for an experienced car producer .
It proved impossible for the Romanian bureaucracy , which pretended to work and was paid accordingly .
The Oltcit factory could produce only 1 % to 1.5 % of its intended capacity owing to the lack of the parts that those 166 companies were supposed to furnish simultaneously .
The Oltcit project lost billions .
Ceausescu was an extreme case , but automobile manufacturing and government were never a good mix in any socialist / communist country .
In the late 1950s , when I headed Romania 's foreign intelligence station in West Germany , I worked closely with the foreign branch of the East German Stasi .
Its chief , Markus Wolf , rewarded me with a Trabant car -- the pride of East Germany -- when I left to return to Romania .
That ugly little car became famous in 1989 when thousands of East Germans used it to cross to the West .
The Trabant originally derived from a well regarded West German car ( the DKW ) made by Audi , which today produces some of the most prestigious cars in the world .
In the hands of the East German government , the unfortunate DKW became a farce of a car .
The bureaucrats and the union that ran the Trabant factory made the car smaller and boxier , to give it a more proletarian look .
To reduce production costs , they cut down on the size of the original , already small DKW engine , and they replaced the metal body with one made of plastic - covered cardboard .
What rolled off the assembly line was a kind of horseless carriage that roared like a lawn mower and polluted the air worse than a whole city block full of big Western cars .
After German reunification , the plucky little " Trabi " that East Germans used to wait 10 years to buy became an embarrassment , and its production was stopped .
Germany 's junkyards are now piled high with Trabants , which cannot be recycled because burning their plastic - covered cardboard bodies would release poisonous dioxins .
German scientists are now trying to develop a bacterium to devour the cardboard - and - plastic body .
Automobile manufacturing and government do not mix in capitalist countries either .
In the spring of 1978 Ceausescu appointed me chief of his Presidential House , a new position supposed to be similar to that of the White House chief of staff .
To go with it he gave me a big Jaguar car .
That Jaguar , which at the time had been produced in a government - run British factory , was so bad that it spent more time in the garage being repaired than it did on the road .
" Apart from some Russian factories in Gorky , Jaguars were the worst , " Ford executive Bill Hayden stated when Ford bought the nationalized British car maker in 1988 .
How did the famous Jaguar , one of the most prestigious cars in the world , become a joke ?
In 1945 , the British voters , tired of four years of war , kicked out Winston Churchill and elected a leftist parliament led by Labour 's Clement Attlee .
Attlee nationalized the automobile , trucking and coal industries , as well as communication facilities , civil aviation , electricity and steel .
Britain was already saddled by crushing war debts .
Now it was sapped of economic vigor .
The old empire quickly passed into history .
It would take decades until Margaret Thatcher 's privatization reforms restored Britain 's place among the world 's top - tier economies .
The United States is far more powerful than Great Britain was then , and no American Attlee should be capable of destroying its solid economic and political base .
I hope that the U.S. administration , Congress and the American voters will take a closer look at history and prevent our automotive industry from following down the Dacia , Oltcit or Jaguar path .

Antonio Cangiano's latest series of Ruby benchmarks showed that IronRuby performs much better than Ruby 1.8.6 .
Luis Lavena commented that Antonio is " comparing IronRuby performance with a 12 years old compiler ( VC6 ) which is the one used by official One - Click Installer " .
Luis is working on a replacement for the One - Click Installer , which would have performed much better , as a second round of benchmarks showed .
InfoQ talked to Luis Lavena to learn more on this , apparently urgently needed , new Windows installer for Ruby 1.8.6 and 1.9 .
Although very useful for the Ruby community , there must be more exciting things to do than writing an installer ?
Yes , indeed there are more funny things to do than building and rebuilding Ruby and it 's dependencies until you get it right .
The motivation behind it was always to scratch my own itch .
Personally , I 've used Ruby on Windows as glue and scripting for my development dealing with C , C++ and even Assembler , Ruby helped me stay on focus and automate several tasks .
I thought it was valuable to share my knowledge and experience gained over the years with the community , which was very receptive and open .
How does this new installer differ from the old one ?
The new installer focuses on getting Ruby right , and get it to integrate more properly and easily on Windows .
The second big point of it is to lower the barrier between Linux and Windows users with regards to the tools available .
Most of the Windows users that lack the knowledge to build stuff on Windows need to wait for gem authors or other contributors to release native gems for them .
It became a huge deal since the way Ruby builds extensions and how it integrates with the compiler forced the usage of a 12 years old compiler ( Visual C 6.0 ) .
That compiler not being available on the net made things more difficult to maintain .
This new installer , instead of being based on binary releases provided by some Ruby - core developers , builds completely from scratch , that gave us the opportunity to further tweak configuration options , versions of extensions bundled , etc .
Not only that , but we substituted certain dependencies like GNU Readline with a pure - ruby version called rb-readline .
Aiming to accelerate release cycles , this new installer does not include 3rd party libraries , which consume a huge amount of time to verify and maintain into the installers .
Users are going to get a minimal installer that includes Ruby , RubyGems and documentation , and from there they will be able to install needed gems without to worry about bloated downloads .
Why is creating a new installer such a big deal , ca n't you just recompile Ruby and be done with it ?
While may sound simple , is not just packaging Ruby and shipping it .
Ruby depends on several packages like ZLib , OpenSSL , Readline and many others that require external libraries .
Some of those externals libraries are hard to find pre-compiled for Windows .
When those binaries are not present , we need to fall back and build ourselves .
One example is that we use a not - so - old version of OpenSSL since they lack up to date binaries and building from source is a very complex task .
Sometimes it is more than just Ruby but the whole ecosystem around it that needs to be updated and tweaked .
If we have a new Ruby binary for Windows , what does this mean for Gems with native extensions ?
Can I use Gems with native extensions built for the ' old '
Ruby use with RubyInstaller 's version ?
While you can do it , sometimes forcing a gem to work on this version of Ruby would not work .
This is one of the reasons RubyInstaller has been in development for the past year .
For those who are familiar with C , the language Ruby is written in , they will know that when compiling C programs they link to a library called CRT for C Runtime library , that offers several low level services like memory allocation , string processing , IO , etc .
Both GCC and VC6 target and link against the same CRT ( MSVCRT.DLL ) ( see Luis ' blog for more information ) .
That solves one piece of the problem .
The other part is Ruby code .
Now , when compiling Ruby , it stores inside and in some configuration files the compiler and flags used to built it , so when building with VC6 , it defines the RUBY_PLATFORM as " mswin32 " , and when used GCC it defines it as " mingw32 "
In theory , both are binary compatible , but now is up to the Ruby code for some libraries how is going to interact with that .
Some developers include platform specific code in their libraries , and to determine if the library is working on Windows , they check RUBY_PLATFORM and look for " mswin " , " mswin32 " or sometimes " win "
Being " mingw32 " part of RUBY_PLATFORM , those libraries are going to think you 're running on Linux , and thus , fail .
So now is the time to get those developers fix those bad habits .
I 've been suggesting usage of RUBY_PLATFORM =~ / mingw|mswin/ to guard Windows code .
Do you have a date for the first release in mind ?
The main goals as today has been reached : Get Ruby 1.8.6 and 1.9.1 building in automated fashion
Be able to bundle those into installers Simplify the development using a Development Kit package available to users .
Make it easier for gem authors to ship tools for Windows users , using rake - compiler .
I 've outlined a few tasks in the project TODO .
I 'm going to rearrange it and better reflect all that in the RubyInstaller Wiki .
Once we complete the documentation and most of the Installer tasks , I believe we are going to be in position to release the first stable version .
More information on the Ruby Installer and the recent preview 1 release can be found on Luis ' Blog .
The Ruby Installer repository is located on GitHub .
Dick Mol , a paleontologist in Holland , and Bernard Buigues , curator of the Mammoth Museum in Siberia , examine the remains of a woolly mammoth .
Scientists have mapped part of the genome of the woolly mammoth , a huge mammal that 's been extinct for about 10,000 years .
The breakthrough could lead to recreating the creatures .
A team led by Hendrik Poinar at McMaster University unlocked secrets of the animal 's nuclear DNA by working with a well - preserved 27,000 - year - old specimen from Siberia .
Colleagues at Penn State sequenced 1 percent of the genome in a few hours and say they expect to finish the whole genome in about a year if funding is provided .
" We were stunned , " Poinar said today .
“ Once you successfully sequence a genome , there are a million interesting questions one can begin to address . "
The researcher can now begin to determine what separates mammoths from their closest living relatives , the Indian elephant .
Make mammoths ?
“ More importantly our discovery means that recreating extinct hybrid animals is theoretically possible , " Poinar said .
The scientists are already pondering the ethics involved .
" McMaster is already planning the first conference devoted to the ethics of bringing extinct organisms back to life , " said Mamdouh Shoukri , vice - president research and international affairs .
" We have an obligation as scientists to explore and maintain the responsible use of research . "
Researchers admit , however , that creating an extinct beast from scratch is not something they know how to do yet .
“ While we can now retrieve the entire genome of the woolly mammoth , that does not mean we can put together the genome into organized chromosomes in a nuclear membrane with all the functional apparatus needed for life , " said Ross MacPhee , a researcher at the American Museum of Natural History who worked on the project .
" We can't even do that with modern DNA . "
The study will be detailed later this week in the journal Science .
The decoding was announced earlier than planned because a second study was reported in the media Sunday .
In the other work , researchers sequenced mitochondrial DNA from a mammoth , but that reveals only the maternal side of evolution .
Poinar said his project decodes both sides by looking at the nuclear DNA , where the majority of life 's software resides .
Hunted by humans
Mammoths roamed Siberia and America during the Pleistocene era , which ended 10,000 years ago as the last Ice Age retreated .
Studies have shown that their demise was due largely to hunting by humans , not from climate change as one theory held .
The breakthrough has been anticipated recently as other work has made similar progress .
Scientists in June said they had unraveled snippets of the genetic code of an extinct bear species .
Other researchers have expressed a desire to revive the mammoth by injecting frozen sperm DNA — if they can find some — into elephants .
Over several generations , they 'd create a creature that 's 88 percent mammoth .
The DNA revealed by Poinar 's groups is " very similar to the African elephant genome , " the group writes in their journal paper .
In August , an American research team proposed restoring elephants , cheetahs and other African animals to the American plains .
And a Russian team has created a Pleistocene Park to investigate mysteries of the mammoth .
