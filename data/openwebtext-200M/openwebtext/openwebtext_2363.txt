GOP rep says Palin should stop
Republican Rep. Ray LaHood of Illinois said Friday that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin should cool her rhetoric directed at Barack Obama .
“ This does n't befit the office that she 's running for .
And frankly , people do n't like it , ” LaHood said during an interview on WBBM , a Chicago radio station .

Palin has accused Obama of “ palling around with terrorists ” and of putting “ political ambitions in front of doing what 's right for our troops . ”
As Palin and running mate John McCain have upped the level of attack against Obama , the crowd at their rallies have grown increasingly angry toward the Illinois senator .
In recent days , shouts of “ terrorist ” and “ traitor ” have come from the crowd when McCain has mentioned Obama ’s name .
LaHood criticized the attacks against Obama , which he said “ certainly do n't reflect the character of the man . ”
The Illinois Republican , who announced last year that he will retire at the end of this term , has endorsed McCain .

Montreal , Canada - October 29 , 2008 - A new study in the Canadian Journal of Economics provides the first evidence on sexual orientation and economic outcomes in Canada .
The study found that gay men have 12 percent lower personal incomes and lesbians have 15 percent higher personal incomes than heterosexual men and women .
Christopher S. Carpenter of The Paul Merage School of Business at the University of California Irvine used data from the Canadian Community Health Survey which includes standard demographic questions as well as self - reports on sexual orientation .
Like previous patterns found in the U.S. and the U.K. , results show that gay men have significantly lower personal incomes than similarly situated straight individuals , while lesbians have significantly higher personal incomes than straight women .
Also , similar to gay and straight differences in the U.S. , gay men and lesbians in Canada are more likely to live in urban areas and more highly educated than heterosexuals in Canada .
" This is the first work to document statistically and economically meaningful differentials associated with sexual orientation in Canada , " Carpenter concludes .
" The long - term significance of the study will be to further the call for more research into the causes and consequences of gay / straight differences in Canada and elsewhere . "

e Music Cutting 10 Percent of Staff ; Still Looking for CEO
Yet another digital company is cutting back : eMusic , the digital music subscription service , is firing “ about 10 percent ” of its 100 - person staff , the company says .
e Music explains the cut by offering what has become a stock answer–things are n’t terrible , but the company is bracing for a slowdown and is cutting now so it can avoid doing it later .
But eMusic chair Danny Stein , who runs the firm ’s parent company , JDS Capital Management , offers some additional color :
The specific problem the company is seeing is with its 2,000 retail partners–either chains like Best Buy ( BBY ) or electronics companies that were bundling eMusic offers with their products .
Those companies are cutting back shipments and reporting slower sales , which has been cutting into eMusic ’s subscription business in the second half of the year , he says .
But traffic to eMusic.com has remained consistent and the company will still be able to report 40 percent revenue growth by the end of the year .
“ We are expecting to grow , but we ’re going grow slower than we ’d hoped , ” Stein says .
So what about next year ?
“ Good question .
Definitely double digits . ”
Stein says the company may also consider lowering prices for its subscription offering ( $ 11.99 for 30 MP3 downloads a month ) , but that for now , “ we ’re comfortable with our pricing . ”
The cutbacks come just a few weeks after CEO David Pakman announced that he was leaving to join Venrock , the VC arm of the Rockefeller family .
Spokeswoman Cathy Nevins says the eMusic is looking at a “ handful of very qualified candidates ” as a replacement .
THE Brumby Government has backed Victoria Police 's infiltration of activist and community groups , rejecting calls for greater scrutiny of covert police operations .
Police Minister Bob Cameron said the internal police controls covering the secret activities of the Security Intelligence Group were sufficient .
" There is appropriate oversight in place as Deputy Chief Commissioner Simon Overland outlined last week , " he said .
The activities of the intelligence unit are overseen by Mr Overland , another senior officer and two retired magistrates .
State Opposition Leader Ted Baillieu , the Law Institute of Victoria , Liberty Victoria and numerous community and protest groups have called for the covert activities of police to be supervised by an external body such as a parliamentary committee .
Their calls came after The Age revealed this month that a covert police officer had infiltrated groups such as Animal Liberation Victoria , Stop the War Coalition , Unity for Peace and Socialist Alternative over two years .
Starting Fire With an Ice Lens
by Bob Gillis
Use clear lake or pond ice .
To practice , boil water for 10 minutes to remove gas .
Create a foil container 2 " deep and freeze slowly .
Or buy a clear block of ice .
To make fire , the ice must be clear .
Shape the ice lens for fire making .
First shave with a knife to get the rough shape of a lens .
You can also grind your ice fire lens on cement or a stone .
Finish shaping your ice fire lens by using the heat of your hand to melt the ice lens smooth .
The edge of your lens should look something like this .
Locate tinder that is completely dry and finely divided .
With the sun at its highest in the sky hold your lens perpendicular to the sun and move it up and down to focus the brightest spot of light onto your tinder .
Be careful to avoid dripping water onto your tinder .
The tinder will first smoke and then ignite .
Carefully add more tinder and very small sticks until a good fire is established .

Counterterrorism operations were just one small part of that approach , he said , among other efforts , which could include tribal Awakening Councils , jobs programs , efforts at reconciliation and diplomatic relations with neighboring countries .
For Afghanistan , he spoke of increasing international forces and what he called “ thickening ” local forces as well , through greater political engagement of tribes and reconciliation with fighters who were not hard - core .
There was also the need to engage countries in the region , including Saudi Arabia , to help with the Taliban , he said .
The general also stressed the need to work closely with Afghan leaders on all elements of strategy .
“ There has to be as much unity of effort achieved in the overall international effort in complete conjunction with the national government as this moves forward , ” he said .
Yet some of the Iraq experience is already being examined in the Afghan context , he said .
In particular the success of the Awakening Councils , and persuading former insurgents to reconcile and work against Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia , could work in Afghanistan and was already under consideration there , General Petraeus said .
“ Certainly many on the ground think that perhaps in certain areas local reconciliation initiatives hold some potential , ” he said .
“ One of the areas that of course proved very important in Iraq and may , and I underline may , have some relevance in Afghanistan , is the concept of reconciliation , ” he added .
“ That you can not kill or capture your way out of an insurgency that is as significant in size as was the one in Iraq , nor , I believe , as large as the one that has developed in Afghanistan . ”
In Iraq , General Petraeus had a two - star British general and a senior American diplomat working solely on reconciliation , he said .
“ Its sole mission was to understand various local situations and dynamics , and then in full coordination with the Iraqi government to engage tribal leaders , local governmental leaders , and in some cases insurgents and opposition elements , ” he said .
WASHINGTON --
The Treasury Department is considering buying equity stakes in insurance companies , a sign of how the government 's $ 700 billion rescue program could turn into a piggy bank for a range of beleaguered industries .
The availability of U.S. government cash in the middle of a global credit squeeze is drawing requests from insurance firms , auto makers , state governments and transit agencies .
While Treasury intended for the program to apply broadly , the growing requests could put a strain on the $ 700 billion , a sum that ...
John McCain said running mate Sarah Palin was very experienced Republican John McCain has said his campaign to become US president is " doing fine " despite polls showing him trailing his Democratic rival .
Speaking on NBC's
Meet the Press nine days before the election , Mr McCain said he had closed the gap with Barack Obama in the past week .
Later at a rally he emphasised that he was ready to fight to win the vote .
Urging change , Mr Obama said McCain and President George W Bush were similar .
Mr McCain was campaigning in Iowa and Ohio on Sunday , while Mr Obama was in Colorado .
An NBC poll for Iowa gave Mr Obama 51 % voter support , with Mr McCain at 40 % .
However , a Reuters / C- Span / Zogby poll released on Sunday suggested a closer race overall , with Mr Obama only five percentage points ahead of Mr McCain 's 44 % .
" Those polls have consistently shown me much farther behind than we actually are , " he said .
" We 're doing fine . "
He continued : " We 've closed in the last week and if we continue this close in the next week you 're going to be up very late on election night . "
" I choose to trust my senses as well as the polls , and the enthusiasm at almost all of our campaign events is at a higher level than I 've ever seen . "
She 's a role model for millions and millions of Americans .
She 's just what Washington needs
John McCain on Sarah Palin
He added : " We 're very competitive here , and I 'm very happy with where we are and I 'm very proud of the campaign we 're running . "
With reports of infighting in the Republican camp , Mr McCain was asked if he wanted to defend his vice - presidential running mate Sarah Palin .
" I do n't defend her - I praise her .
She needs no defence . "
He also said the Alaskan governor had " more executive experience than [ Democratic vice - presidential candidate ] Senator [ Joe ] Biden and Senator Obama together . "
He went on : " She is a dynamic person with executive experience , leadership , reform .
She 's exactly what Washington needs .
" She 's a role model for millions and millions of Americans .
She 's just what Washington needs . "
The party has had to respond to revelations last week that $ 150,000 has been spent on Mrs Palin 's wardrobe since her September appointment .
" She lives a frugal life , she and her family are not wealthy , she and her family were thrust into this , " Mr McCain said , repeating that the clothes will be donated to charity .
' Common philosophy '
Responding to the Obama team 's emphasis that he voted with President Bush 90 % of the time , Mr McCain said both he and Mrs Palin were mavericks .
Barack Obama warned people to ' tighten their belts '
" Do we share a common philosophy of the Republican Party ?
Of course .
" But I 've stood up against my party , not just President Bush but others , and I 've got the scars to prove it . "
Mr Obama , addressing a rally in Colorado , said the " common philosophy " of the Republican party included giving more to the wealthy and spending millions on the war in Iraq despite the US economy struggling .
He called for an " immediate rescue plan " for the middle class , saying the recent financial rescue plan for banks was a " necessary step " in safeguarding pensions , jobs and businesses .
Mr Obama said his healthcare , education and energy plans would " not happen overnight " , and warned that everyone would have to " tighten their belts " .
Vote request Mrs Palin also addressed the issue of her clothing .
Speaking at a rally in Florida , she said she had " tried to ignore it because it 's just so ridiculous " .
But she added that the items did not belong to her and she would be wearing her own clothes after the 4 November election .
She mocked reports that Mr Obama has already written his inaugural speech , saying it showed the Democrats looked at the election as a " formality " .
" We do n't take any vote for granted , and we 're not assuming we have your vote - we are respectfully asking for it , " she told cheering supporters .

A boatload of pro-Palestinian activists landed on the shores of the Gaza Strip on Wednesday , the latest move in a campaign to defy Israeli restrictions on access to the territory .
A potential showdown at sea was averted at the last minute when the Israeli government abruptly backed down from threats to intercept the 66 - foot yacht .
“ Last night at the highest level , a reverse decision was taken , ” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor .
The ultimate choice , he said , was made by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .
The yacht Dignity arrived from Cyprus carrying medical supplies and 27 passengers , including a Nobel Peace Prize winner .
Their journey continued a campaign launched in August , when a pair of ships first made the Cyprus - Gaza run .
Advertisement
“ I think we ’re right at the point where [ the boat campaign ] stops being symbolic and begins to seriously weaken the Israeli siege , ” said Palestinian Authority parliament member Mustafa Barghouti .
Palmor downplayed the significance of the campaign , saying that the welcoming crowds Wednesday were significantly smaller than in August .
Several boats full of flag - waving Gazans escorted the Dignity to shore .
The visitors later met with deposed Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh , a leader of the militant group Hamas , which won parliamentary elections in January 2006 and seized control of the Gaza Strip from the Fatah faction in the summer of 2007 after a short - lived unity government collapsed .
Fatah continues to control the Palestinian Authority , but rules only over the West Bank .
Barghouti hailed the day ’s journey as a victory for those who seek to peacefully undermine the Israeli blockade on Gaza .
Advertisement
“ Hopefully it shows all groups , including Hamas , the effectiveness of nonviolent resistance , ” Barghouti said after meeting with Haniyeh .
Israel , with U.S. backing and Egyptian assistance , virtually sealed the narrow , densely populated coastal ribbon after the Hamas takeover .
Limited humanitarian shipments are allowed in , and almost nothing is allowed out .
Israel and Hamas are observing a truce .
Hamas has restrained its cadres from the rocket launches that used to plague Israeli border towns , and Israel has increased the flow of humanitarian goods .
But the Gazan economy remains frozen and almost entirely dependent on goods smuggled through tunnels from Egypt .
“ The government of Israel can not cut off Gaza forever .
We will come again and again , ” said longtime Palestinian rights supporter Mairead Corrigan Maguire , who won the 1976 Nobel Peace Prize for her work with Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland .

In August , when the two boats were permitted to land unhindered , Israeli officials said they were denying the activists the confrontation they desired .
This time Israeli took a harder line .
When the Dignity left Cyprus on Tuesday , Israeli officials flatly stated that the boat would be intercepted .
But Olmert , who resigned weeks ago but remains in a caretaker role until new elections can be held early next year , changed his mind Tuesday night .

Paul Newman Dead at 83
, who has been battling lung cancer , passed away at his home in Westport , Connecticut on Friday around 8 pm .
Bitten and Bound received an email last night that Newman had died , but waited for his rep to confirm before posting the news .
Reports of Newman 's illness began in March when it was learned that he had been seeing an oncologist at New York ’s Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center .
Photographs taken of Newman in May and June showed him looking gaunt .
The 83 - year - old actor began getting his affairs in order in August , telling his family that he wanted to die at home .
Newman , who had a lengthy film career spanning five decades , announced his retirement from acting on May 25 , 2007 , stating , " You start to lose your memory , you start to lose your confidence , you start to lose your invention .
So I think that 's pretty much a closed book for me . "
A noted philanthropist , Newman started Newman 's Own , a line of food products , in 1982 , donating the proceeds to charity .
His daughter Nell will be taking over the business .
FreeBSD : Nginx FastCGI PHP Configuration
Q. How do I configure PHP as FastCGI under FreeBSD Nginx webserver ?
ADVERTISEMENTS
A . You can easily configure php as FastCGI application under Nginx for performance .
You need following components :
spawn - fcgi binary
start.php.sh
FreeBSD Install PHP5
[ a ] –
For spawning a FastCGI process .
This binary can be installed from Lighttpd webserver project .
Nginx does not automatically spawn FCGI processes .
You must start them separately using spawn - fcgi . [ b ] :
A shell script to stop / start / restart php fastcgi process .
This script swap php process on 127.0.0.1 IP and 9000 port .
Once backend is started Nginx can be configured to connect to PHP .
If php5 is not installed type the following commands ( make sure you select FastCGI option ) :
# cd /usr / ports / lang/php5
# make config
# make install clean
Also installed required php extensions such as php-msyql , php-gd and so on :
# cp /usr/local/etc/php.ini-recommended
/usr/local/etc/php.ini
# cd /usr / ports / lang/php5-extensions /
# make install clean
Install spawn - fcgi
Grab latest spawn - fcgi from another Lighttpd installation or just install it as follows :
# pkg_add -r -v lighttpd
Sample output :
scheme : [ ftp ] user : [ ] password : [ ] host : [ ftp.freebsd.org ] port : [ 0 ] document : [ /pub/FreeBSD/ports/amd64/packages-7.0-release/Latest/lighttpd.tbz ]
---> ftp.freebsd.org:21 looking up ftp.freebsd.org connecting to ftp.freebsd.org:21
<<< 220 Welcome to freebsd.isc.org . >>>
USER anonymous
<<< 331 Please specify the password .
..... ..... x lib / lighttpd/mod_access.so x lib/lighttpd/mod_accesslog.a x lib/ lighttpd/mod_accesslog.la x lib/lighttpd/mod_accesslog.so x lib/lighttpd/mod_alias.a x lib/ lighttpd/mod_alias.la x lib/lighttpd/mod_alias.so x lib/lighttpd/mod_auth.a x lib/lighttpd/mod_auth.la ..... ..
Now you can use / usr / local / bin / spawn - fcgi to swap process .
If you want you can copy / usr / local / bin / spawn - fcgi to /root or other directory and just delete lighttpd package by typing the following commands :
# cp /usr/local/bin/spawn-fcgi /root /
# pkg_delete -v lighttpd -1.4.18_1
# cp /root / spawn - fcgi /usr / local/bin/spawn-fcgi
Now you can start PHP Fastcgi from command line as follows :
# /usr/local/bin/spawn-fcgi -a 127.0.0.1 -p 9000 - u www -g www -f /usr/local/bin/php-cgi
Where ,
-a 127.0.0.1 : PHP FastCGI bind IP address , where Nginx will connect .
: PHP FastCGI bind IP address , where Nginx will connect .
-p 9000 : PHP FastCGI port number , where Nginx will connect .
: PHP FastCGI port number , where Nginx will connect .
-u www : PHP FastCGI username .
: PHP FastCGI username . -g www : PHP FastCGI groupname .
: PHP FastCGI groupname .
-f /usr/local/bin/php-cgi : Path to PHP5 fastcgi binary .
Verify that php running as FastCGI , enter :
# sockstat - 4 | grep 9000
Sample Output :
www php-cgi 8998 0 tcp4 127.0.0.1:9000 *:* www php-cgi 8997 0 tcp4 127.0.0.1:9000 *:* www php-cgi 8996 0 tcp4 127.0.0.1:9000 *:* www php-cgi 8995 0 tcp4 127.0.0.1:9000 *:* www php-cgi 8994 0 tcp4 127.0.0.1:9000 *:* www php-cgi 8993 0 tcp4 127.0.0.1:9000 *:*

VIENNA ( Reuters ) -
Two women have made history at Vienna ’s Spanish Riding School by becoming the first female riders to pass the entrance exam in 436 years .
An 18 - year - old Briton and a 21 - year - old Austrian must now pass a one - month trial to train at the school , set up in 1572 .
The school will not name the pair until they pass the trial .
If they pass , the new recruits will train for five years before they can take to the saddle in public on the white Lipizzaner dancing horses which are trained to perform tricky moves such as springing from their hind legs .
“ There has never been a ban for women , ” Erwin Klissenbauer , the school ’s manager , said Friday .
The school has , however , had a masculine image because of its military background , he said .
The horses and riders , clad in uniforms designed in the 19th century , draw sell - out crowds in Vienna and on tour abroad .
The ONLY rule is there ARE NO rules !
NO GODS !
NO KINGS !
ANARCHY AND MALARKEY EVERYWHERE !

Robot lovers and outsourcing opponents could soon have something in common : the fear that their jobs are at stake .
In the future robots will take over many tasks performed by American workers today potentially leading to increased unemployment , says Marshall Brain , founder of How Stuff Works and author of e-book Robotic Nation .
" In theory we should all be able to go on a perpetual vacation as robots do all the work , " Brain told attendees in a presentation at the Singularity Summit in San Jose .
" Instead because of the way the economy is structured right now , when robots arrive it will have devastating effects on all of us because there will be so many unemployed people . "
The implications of an increasingly automated economy could be dire for society unless we restructure our economy , he argues .
While productivity has risen over the year , worker compensation has not kept pace and there is increasing concentration of wealth , says Brain .
Developments in robotics means that technologists could be creating a second intelligent species , claims Brain .
" So far no credible evidence to indicate that there is more than one intelligent species in the universe , which is us , " he says .
" But that changes with the robots . "
Computational power has significantly increased in the last two decades and is growing exponentially .
In 1992 , computers could perform about 300,000 operations per second .
By 2022 , it is likely to jump to a trillion operations per second and by 2042 it could be a quadrillion operations per second , predicts Brain .
" A $ 500 machine that can do that , whenever it happens , combined with vision and natural language processing could change how we look at robots , " he says .
Potential applications of robots could then be in use as automatons in fast food restaurants , transportation , education , construction and retail among other areas .
" We will have robotic cashiers , robotic stocking , sweeping , help and cart retrieval at Wal - Mart , " says Brain .
To deal with that version of the future , he suggests society should redesign the economy to get the benefits of automation .
His solution ?
Spread the benefit of productivity to everyone by breaking the concentration of wealth , increase pay and reduce the work week .
Sounds a lot like socialism , does n't it ?
The idea provoked a question from attendees .
When industrialization first occurred there were fears of massive unemployment which never panned out .
Why will the integration of robots into the workforce be any different ?
" We did n't create a second intelligent species 150 years ago , " says Brain .
" Now we are doing that with intelligence that will get better and better . "
I find it ironic that people are n’t more upset about the bailout package that was supposed to fix our economic woes .
So far , it looks more like an early Christmas present for the banks and investment houses before the Bush administration leaves office , while simultaneously making our economy worse instead of better — by wasting more than a trillion dollars of our tax money .
Even the stuff we know about is pretty disgusting , and I ’m sure there are lots of things we do n’t know about .
For example , according to USA Today , PNC Financial Services Group was approved to receive $ 7.7 billion in bailout money , so they turned around and announced that they were acquiring National City Corp. for $ 5.58 billion .
Excuse me ?
Can someone tell me why we are handing them money so they can buy up other companies ?
I thought that part of the reason this trouble started in the first place was because these companies are “ too big to fail ” — so now we are paying them get even bigger ?
When asked about this , Secretary of the Treasury Paulson , who was given the bailout money basically to do with as he pleases , told Charlie Rose on PBS “ The driver is to have our healthy banks be well - capitalized so that they can play the role they need to play for our country right now . ”
I feel so much better .
Other recipients of bailout money are using that money to pay dividends to their shareholders .
Pardon me , but I thought the whole idea of capitalism was that you took a risk by investing in companies , and that if a company was not well run and got into trouble , then you take your lumps .
But not in our topsy - turvy world where we make sure investors get their dividends , but people who lose their jobs or their homes because of medical problems are left to sink .
And if that were n’t bad enough , the treasury is paying New York Mellon Corp to run the program that buys up worthless assets from banks , but on the same day it hired Mellon to run this program it also decided to give them $ 3 billion in bailout money .
Three billion dollars is a lot of conflict of interest .
My head has n’t stopped spinning from that one .
Neel Kashkari , the head of Treasury ’s financial stability program , told Congress last week that there are few strings attached to the bailout money because too many rules would discourage financial institutions from participating .
So not only do we have to hand them money , we have to be nice about it and not ask too much in return ?
As a result , companies that are getting bailed out are free to use that money to pay bonuses to their executives , or even just sit on the money ( you know , like stuffing it under their mattress ) .
About the only thing that has n’t been done with all this money is to actually stop a single home foreclosure .
We are screwed .

Their football team may 2 - 5 and winless in their conference ( and they have n't even played Oklahoma or Texas yet ) , but the Texas A&M boosters behind AggieReport.com are winning at least one battle this season .
Their smack - talking YouTube videos are a surreal little slice of internet joy .
They make very little sense , which is a huge part of their appeal , and the attacks on the opposing schools and their moonshine making abilities are nothing if not inspired .
And yes , the teams they 've been teasing have made a habit of pounding A&M on the field the last few Saturdays , but that only makes the irony more delicious .
Maybe their luck with incest puppet jokes will change this week against Iowa State .
After all , they are correct that Ames is very boring .

Moderator Steve Paikin held Layton down and let Harper take another shot
The English debates on Thursday night turned out to be much more exciting due to the inclusion of an additional debater in the televised debates .
No , no , I ’m not referring to Elizabeth May , ( although I thought her performance was both intelligent and effective ) .
No , I ’m referring to Steve Paikin , the supposed ‘ moderator ’ of the debate .
Much to my disbelief , Paikin actually entered the debate himself after Stephen Harper reacted to Layton ’s factually correct statement that Harper had been the head of an organization whose stated goal was ( and still is ) the destruction of Canada ’s healthcare system .
Harper reacted by saying , “ Let me just be very quick on this .
I use the public health care system .
My family uses the public health care system .
In fact , in the last federal election campaign at one point it turned out I was the only national leader actually who had used exclusively the public health care system . ” ( source )
Harper was perfectly within his rights to make that point — in fact , in my opinion , it would have still been perfectly within his rights to even elaborate on the point and try to stick the knife into Layton further if he thought it would advance his case .
That ’s debating .
That ’s the whole point .
At the same time though , Layton should have been perfectly within his right to retort that he did n’t pay for his hernia operation , it was covered through his OHIP ( Ontario Health Insurance Plan ) card and thus he never cue - jumped and never went outside the public health care system .
But what came next was completely unexpected .
‘ Moderator ’ Steve Paikin actually stopped the debate there and entered the debate himself .
Just to make sure that the public understood precisely the reference that Stephen Harper was making , Steve Paikin not only repeated the claim himself , but further elaborated on it by giving the name of the clinic and so forth .
Paikin thus saved Harper from having to get himself bloody , by personally ensuring that the knife was into Layton deep enough .
Layton , obviously flummoxed by being attacked on both sides by the moderator and the Conservative leader , only retorted that the grand daughter of Tommy Douglas ( an NDP supporter ) thinks that that qualifies as public health care .
In my opinion , Layton collapsed like a house of cards for about the next 20 minutes of the debate , clearly having lost the vigour , energy and confidence that had characterized his performance prior to the Paikin incident .
Because of this incident , I was shocked to learn that Layton had placed second ( behind Harper ) in the English language debate according to the polling firm Ipsos - Reid .
I was certain that he would have fared much worse .
But then again , I thought that Gilles Duceppe slaughtered everyone else at the French Language debate , but Ipsos - Reid gave the debate to Dion ( who I thought at best tied Harper for third behind Layton and Duceppe ) .
I also thought that the English debate would have been called for Elizabeth May who , in my opinion , was the winner , but Ipsos had her in third .
I guess I should get out of the debate predicting business and stick to the polling and seat projection business .
The biggest Wall Street story most Americans have n't yet heard of is the $ 62 trillion unregulated credit default swaps market .
Here is one scenario :
A hedge fund buys insurance in case a company defaults on its bonds  a so - called credit default swap  when the hedge fund does n't necessarily own the bonds .
Then it immediately shorts the stock , driving down the company 's share price , leading to a downgrade , and eventually triggering a default .
It is the ultimate moral hazard , like taking out fire insurance for a home you do n't own :
There is an obvious motivation to set the house on fire and collect the insurance .
Meanwhile , that same hedge fund may also be issuing its own credit default swaps , where it promises to cover a company 's bonds if it defaults , in exchange for the buyer of the swap paying out a premium .
The premium is paid out in regular intervals , much like an insurance premium , and is a simple means for the hedge fund to generate additional income .
This is especially true because the hedge fund does not have to put aside any capital to cover the swaps it is writing .
Riskier still , no bond has to actually be delivered to settle the swap in case of a default .
" The credit default swap market is the ultimate bubble , and it is about to collapse , " the managing director of Institutional Risk Analytics , Christopher Whalen , said .
" It is a Ponzi scheme , and is basically the same method as a bookie uses . "
Hedge funds have been employing this strategy over the past several months as the financial sector caves in , some analysts and industry observers said .
" If they had tried this any time in the last three years , they would have gotten torched ; it is only very recently that something like this could work , " the chief strategist at Fusion IQ , Barry Ritholtz , said , adding that he had no first - hand knowledge of the strategy .
With defaults on the rise  Standard & Poor 's 12 - month forward default rate forecast is 4.9 % , although it said it could reach as high as 8.5 % , compared to a 25 - year low of 0.97 % at the end of 2007  more credit default swaps are being triggered .
In the past , if credit default swaps were triggered by a default , a hedge fund would just write more swaps to cover it .
But now the credit default swap market is largely frozen following the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings , which was an important player in the market .
Making matters worse , the hedge funds that wrote these swaps never put aside any capital to cover them , so they are unable to pay and are liquidating their positions and closing .
So far , many of the banks that bought the swaps from the hedge funds have quietly eaten the loss , market insiders with knowledge of the industry said .
The banks and others in the markets do not want to arouse the attention of regulators or the bankruptcy court , which could issue adverse rulings that will constrict the lucrative market , people familiar with their strategy said .
" You do n't read about the fails because dealers come in and clean it up , " Mr. Whalen said .
" The dealers are closing ranks , and do n't want anyone to hear about how they are taking back positions and absorbing the losses . "
Because hedge funds are private , and the swaps market is not traded on any central exchange , there is very little transparency and no real documentation .
But the complex credit default swaps market may now be forced to come out of its shadow , as defaults mount and banks are unable to stomach the losses , leading contract disputes and bankruptcies to spill onto the front pages of newspapers and the court , analysts and investors said .
Still , much remains to be clarified .
For example , it is still not clear whether credit default swaps are securities  and therefore under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission  or insurance tools that come under the umbrella of the New York State Insurance Department .
The Commissioner of the state 's Insurance Department , Eric Dinallo , has indicated that the instruments are a type of insurance , but has also said he is only likely to consider as valid those credit default swaps where the underlying bond against which a swap was issued is actually presented .
This could pose difficulties for the billions of dollars in credit default swaps that were purchased without the underlying bond , people said .
The SEC has not taken any position in regards to the credit default swaps market , but on Friday the SEC said it would begin requiring some hedge fund managers to submit their trading activity , including credit default swaps , to the agency .
The trade group that represents the market  the International Swaps and Derivatives Association  has argued against any regulation from the SEC .
" Last week , as liquidity dried up , the derivatives market continued to serve as an outlet for managing risk , " the counsel and head of global public policy at ISDA , Greg Zerzan , said in a statement .
" Over the counter derivatives continue to play a critical role in keeping the markets functioning . "

For the first time in what feels like forever , the price of gasoline is less expensive than it was exactly a year ago .
While this would usually be reason for joy , it appears that the major factor behind the significant decline in the prices of oil and gasoline is the rapidly deteriorating world economy .
Today ’s national average price of gas stands at $ 2.73 per gallon , which is Â three cents below where it was exactly 12 months ago .
Â
While $ 2.73 for a gallon of gas certainly is n’t cheap by any stretch of the imagination , it ’s certainly a heck of a lot more affordable than what we dealt with for most of this year .
Since hitting a record high of $ 4.12 per gallon on July 14 , the price of gas has fallen by over 33 % .
Â
Over the past month alone the price of gas has fallen nearly 25 % – thanks to the credit crisis and fears of a very deep and painful recession .
Currently , there are only five states reporting an average gas price above $ 3 per gallon , with Alaska having the highest state wide average price at $ 3.60 per gallon .
Â
Conversely , there are nowÂ ten states reporting an average gas price below $ 2.50 per gallon , with Oklahoma having the lowest state wide average price at $ 2.27 .
In an effort to help stem the tide of falling oil prices – which are down nearly 60 % from this summer ’s record highs – OPEC has announced that it will cut crude oil production by 1.5 million barrels per day .
Â
However , because this cut was less than the expected 2 million barrel per day cut , the price of oil fell about $ 3 per barrel after the announcement .
This likely means gas prices will continue to fall in the near term .
Â
While this is good news for anyone with a car – additionally , this will effectively kill inflationary pressures – the trade off is we ’re having to deal with the worst economy in decades .
Unfortunately , it looks like things are going to get a lot worse – higher unemployment , further declines in stock and home prices , and sinking corporate profits – before they start to get any better .
( CNN ) --
You can't find it on a map , you 'll never see it on a postcard and forget trying to book a tour .
But it may be the most memorable monument to the current U.S. election campaign .
Republican Sarah Palin , pictured here with John McCain .
It 's the " Bridge to Nowhere . "
Actually the bridge was never built , that was n't its official name and a lot of what 's being said about it is n't true , either .
And yet , it 's been coming - up almost daily in connection with the new star of U.S. politics : Alaska governor and Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin .
The bridge was supposed to go somewhere .
Barely .
It was to connect Ketchikan , Alaska ( population 8 , 000 ) to the island and airport of Gravina , Alaska ( population 50 ) .
They 're tiny towns but the lawmakers and engineers who proposed the project dreamed big -- the structure was to be taller than New York 's Brooklyn Bridge and nearly as long as San Francisco 's Golden Gate .
The cost was estimated at $ 400 million , a sum so startling for a project so silly that it became infamous as a symbol of Washington 's wasteful spending -- the kind of thing that Republicans love to hate .
Still , when Sarah Palin was running for governor of Alaska , the project promised to create a lot of Alaskan jobs with a lot of Washington 's money .
She supported it .
There was so much public outcry , though , that the U.S. Congress eventually refused to fund it .
When Palin was elected state governor in 2006 , she decided not to spend her own taxpayers ' money on it either .
The Bridge to Nowhere went from the drawing board to the dustbin .
Then , three weeks ago , Palin was chosen as John McCain 's running mate .
She boasted that day that she " told Congress , thanks but no thanks on that Bridge to Nowhere . "
She 's said it repeatedly ever since and the McCain campaign put her putative refusal into its ads on TV .
It 's offered as proof that she 's a principled woman who wo n't waste taxpayers ' money .
For a time , the Democrats tried to convince voters that Palin did n't cancel the bridge until after Congress already had .
But that explanation has n't stopped the story or hurt Palin , and the country 's attention has moved on .
Both campaigns are accusing each other of lying about the candidates ' records and remarks in a number of ways .
Palin 's record as a small - town mayor and then a state governor is full of the kinds of anecdotes and petty intrigues common to a lot of political careers .
Her opposition to the Bridge to Nowhere is different because it became a centerpiece of the Republican presidential campaign .
And because before she was opposed to the bridge , she was all for it .

The editorial in the Guardian and various letters , such as that from the Bishop of Lincoln , contain a significant amount of self - righteous criticism of the Royal Society 's decision to ask the Rev Michael Reiss to resign from his position as Director of Science Education .
It is clear that there is almost total ignorance about the real issues involved and a truly pathetic understanding of science – the culture that created the modern world – from anaesthetics and penicillin to jet engines and the internet .
Of course " The origin of the universe and living organisms " is a perfectly respectable question for the science lesson ( perhaps the most exciting and fundamental one ) , as long as someone with intellectual integrity is there to answer it .
There is a major problem however for the religious person , scientist or otherwise , in answering this question and it involves , first and foremost , intellectual integrity .
Let me clarify the fundamental philosophical issue : the scientific mindset .
Science is based solely on doubt - based , disinterested examination of the natural and physical world .
It is entirely independent of personal belief .
There is a very important , fundamental concomitant – that is to accept absolutely nothing whatsoever , for which there is no evidence , as having any fundamental validity .
A lemma : one can of course have an infinite number of questions but only those questions that can be formulated in such a way that they can be subjected to detailed disinterested examination , and when so subjected reveal unequivocally and ubiquitously accepted data , may be significant .
The plethora of more - or - less incompatible religious concepts that mankind has invented from Creationism and intelligent design to Christianity , Islam , Judaism , Buddhism , Mormonism , Scientology , Hinduism , Shinto , Shamanism etc , are all basically indistinguishable , from the freethinkers perspective .
It really does not matter whether one believes a mystical entity created the universe 5,000 or 10,000 million years ago – both are equally irrational unsubstantiated claims of no fundamental validity .
Unfortunately Reiss , who is , apparently , a very nice guy , was in the wrong job .
He , together with all religious people – whether they like it or not , whether they accept it or not – fall at the first hurdle of the main requirement for honest scientific discussion because they accept unfound dogma as having fundamental significance – note that I did not say value ( positive or negative ) .
In the Jeffersonian sense church and state ( including education especially on Sundays ) must be separated – otherwise our democratic freedoms are undermined .
A secular socio-political framework is an absolutely necessary ( though unfortunately , not always sufficient ) condition to guarantee freedom of religion – as well as non-religion .
I do not have a particularly big problem with scientists who may have some personal mystical beliefs – for all I know the President of the Royal Society may be religious .
However , I , and many of my Royal Society colleagues , do have a problem with an ordained minister as Director of Science Education – this is a totally different matter .
An ordained minister must have accepted that there was a creator ( presumably more intelligent than he is ? ) thus many of us ( maybe 90 % of FRSs ) cannot see how such a person can pontificate on how to tackle this fundamentally unresolvable conflict at the science / religion interface .
Reiss cannot have his religious cake in church and eat the scientific one in the classroom .
This is where the intellectual integrity issue arises – and it is the crucial issue in the Reiss affair .
I suggest that Reiss , the Bishop of Lincoln and any other ministers who presume the authority to dictate how religious issues should be handled in the science classroom read from Sam Harris 's book " Letter to a Christian Nation " at their Sunday sermons .
Then perhaps some of their flock may understand what intellectual integrity and true humanity actually involve .
Furthermore I suggest that this wonderful little book be a set text for young people at Sunday School , so they do not grow up like Don Manley who cannot see that the really " vicious " people are the religious ones who are dragging us back into the dark ages , rather than humanists struggling to save the Enlightenment .
Manley and the pope are basically 21st century descendents of Cardinal Bellarmine .
UPDATED with quotes from Jeff Zucker .
NBC may be taking lumps in the blogosphere for its decision to provide so much of its
Olympics coverage exclusively through traditional channels , but they have given advertisers an increasingly elusive commodity — a large , captivated ( and captive ) audience .
NBC 's walled approach to viewership – sidelining the creative opportunities to build the brand online – has short - term appeal the network could not pass up .
Online viewers who came to see the games or catch up on missed events might have been upset to see that videos were not available on YouTube or even NBC 's partner site Hulu .
NBC was hyper vigilant against leaked content and offered video solely through Microsoft ’s downloadable player Silverlight .
Before the networks dive fully into the online marketplace , they want to wring as much money as possible out of the old model – and who can blame them ?
NBC wanted its big brand buys to be seen by plenty of eyeballs , and with ratings working in their favor , their approach worked out .
NBC sold $ 1 billion in ads leading up to the games , and yesterday they reported $ 10 million more in sales since the games began .
NBC CEO Jeff Zucker told CNBC today : “ We ’ve raised much more than we expected to here in the week since the games began , and I think we ’ll be north of that $ 10 million … that 's been written just since the games began . ”
NBC 's 17.6 average rating through Wednesday is the highest for a non-U.S. Olympics since the Barcelona Games in 1992 .
The network has averaged 30.8 million prime - time viewers , a bump of more than 4 million viewers over the 2004 Athens Games .
As far as the network wars go , things are looking pretty good for NBC .
Even skeptics have to admit that NBC is doing much better than expected .
Jupiter Research analyst Emily Riley , who thinks that NBC has taken a " Web 1.0 " approach to the 2008 games , concedes that it makes financial sense for NBC to focus on television rather than the web :
" They could have leveraged their current strength to create opportunities for consumers to use video online , but it makes it makes sense monetarily for NBC to focus on their main revenue source and large global brands . "
Until the networks figure out how to best capitalize on growing online audiences , hoarding does n't seem like such a bad idea .
According to Zucker , " The erosion in network television has been pronounced and there ’s no way of getting around that .
But this event shows that the pipes work .
And if you put on great programming that people want to watch , then they ’ll show up . "
Beyond simply the opportunity for viewers to see television ads , the global brands that advertised in this year 's Olympics are using their position to break into – or further their presence – in the Chinese marketplace .
NBC 's parent company GE , especially , has focused on the myriad ways that the company is helping the Olympics and Beijing operate at peak performance .
" China is growing explosively , " says Jennifer Walsh , Global Director of Digital Media for GE .
" As they expand , there is a need for basic infrastructure – water treatment , transportation , roads " – all services that GE provides .
Neal Pilson , CEO of Pilson communications and former president of CBS Sports , has consulted the IOC on television rights for the 2010 and 2012 games .
He says the real opportunities for earnings at the Olympics lie with the parent company : " During negotiations , we basically argue that GE or FOX News or CBS Inc. would generate a huge amount of business from the games .
This year , the Olympics are being held in a country with enormous potential for new business . "
Already , GE has posted $ 700 million in sales from various projects in and around Beijing , including security equipment for a subway line and airport terminal , medical equipment at the Olympic village , and more than 120 wind turbines north of the city .
All the global brands present on network television during the games are working in China to promote their image and further their presence in the growing marketplace there .
While NBC may have squandered a chance to move online video forward with the summer games , their bird in the hand approach is paying off today .

Well - known and influential photojournalist James Nachtwey won the TED Prize last year , and as part of his award , he made a wish for help - help in bringing a story to light that he felt was important and underreported .
The subject of this story is a new , dangerous type of tuberculosis called Extreme Drug - Resistant Tuberculosis , or XDR - TB .
Tuberculosis is both preventable and curable , but inadequate treatment has been driving the emergence of XDR - TB , especially in developing nations .
Tuberculosis is not a disease of the past - in 2007 alone , 1.7 million people died from TB - it is the leading killer of people infected with HIV .
Nachtwey 's wish was that he could break this story , and demonstrate proof of the power of news photography in the digital age .

As most of you already know , Florida voters will go to the polls on November 4 , 2008 to vote on an amendment to the Florida Constitution that attempts to limit the recognition of same sex relationships .
Specifically , the proposed amendment , known in Florida as Amendment 2 , does two things .
It defines marriage between one man and one woman , and it also prohibits the recognition of any union that is treated as marriage or the substantial equivalent to marriage .
The text of the amendment reads :
Inasmuch as marriage is the legal union of only one man and one woman as husband and wife , no other legal union that is treated as marriage or the substantial equivalent thereof shall be valid or recognized .
The legal question that is raised by this proposed amendment is what the phrase " substantial equivalent " to marriage will mean under the law .
Last year , I saw a law professor from Stetson Law School say during a debate that Amendment 2 does n't appear to do anything but ban marriage for same sex couples .
She came to this conclusion by just reading the amendment .
She did n't have any legal support for her conclusion , and she did n't discuss what has happened in the other states that have passed similar constitutional amendments .
She simply stated that she knew what that phrase meant because she was a family law professor .
I guess she thinks we should just trust her because this is her " specialty " !

Just when the oil industry thought it was safe to go back in the water , along comes the credit crunch .
Sitting pretty ( AP ) Tighter credit threatens to delay or kill a big chunk of the offshore drilling rigs under construction around the world .
That 's bad news for Big Oil , which in recent years has suffered from a dearth of offshore rigs , but which was hoping for some relief in coming years .
But it 's good news for established drilling operators who find their precious rigs are still in hot demand , and still fetch big leasing ...
It is important to look for positive points to find a way out of the financial crisis , apart from philosophic controversy .
All countries , whether separately or collectively , are working hard to contain the crisis , or at least to reduce losses , despite the gloomy picture of the global economy and the pessimistic atmosphere blanketing the entire world .
Although it is difficult to speak about positive points while the entire world is facing such a crisis , there must be some positive aspects .
The first of these positive effects is that the financial crisis ushers in an end to the domination of the sole magnate in international financial relations , which was a major cause of the crisis .
Wall Street was the world ’s most powerful investment house , just a few months ago , where investments used to pour from the East and the West .
Now Wall Street means bankruptcy , and investors in fear of losing their money do their best to avoid it .
At present , there are regions in Europe and Asia , including the Gulf region , emerging as hubs of huge investments , which will bring about more stability to the world financial system .
This shift is important for restructuring international relations in the post - crisis stage .
Read
The second positive result of the financial crisis revolves around redrafting laws and rules that regulate global financial institutions , especially the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , World Bank ( WB ) , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) whose membership could not have been possible without a green light from Wall Street .
The previous rules governing economic relations were appropriate for the post - Second World War era and during the Cold War , but are no longer suitable for the globalization age and the emergence of new and influential economic powers on the map of international relations .
For instance , in China , foreign currency reserve reached $ 1.9 trillion at a time the US budget deficit amounted to $ 1 trillion , in addition to the progress achieved by Europe in the light of its single currency .
The third positive point is related to the change in the world investment map and the opportunities to be provided by the emerging investment hubs , which offer guarantees and opportunities for world capitals .
This potential change will coincide with restructuring of commercial relations , which will be done through the WTO that will allow specialization on the basis of the production priorities of each country .
This will offer middle east countries rare opportunities to take advantage of the possible outcomes of this crisis .
Fourth , the next global financial and banking system will be strictly regulated and supervised by applying the measures of control , transparency and global governance .
The last of the positive effects of the crisis would be the absence of giant financial institutions , which dominated stock markets in the world for long decades .
This in turn would allow new institutions to emerge and take over , which lays the foundation for a new sharing system in international financial and economic work .
In short , a bad situation may sometimes have good effects , and what is required now is to draw lessons from this crisis and the subsequent losses suffered by most countries .

As night looms over Gotham City , Batman and Robin rev up the Batmobile and stalk the shadows for the cowardly criminal element .
</>
The Foreign Rip - Off :
As the sun beats down on the Anatolian steppe , Betmen and Turkish Robin cruise around in a shitty sedan and pump hot lead into the cowardly criminal element .
The music sounds like a swarm of killer bees playing the sitar in an empty grain silo .
Why It 's Better : There 's a lot to love about the Turkish Batman , namely his ability to do more with less .
Whereas the American Batman cloaks his severe mental illness with gee - whiz gadgets and , well , a cloak , Betmen has no need for capes , technology , or subtlety .
He knows that dressing up like a deranged trapeze artist and borrowing the wife 's Chevy Nova for the afternoon will do way more to frighten felons than any bat - shaped airplane .

Why It 's Better :
To be fair , Dariya Dil is n't an Indian Superman movie at all ( the only plot synopsis we could find online said it was a romantic comedy about tax evasion or something ) .
But nonetheless , we dig its freaky take on the Superman mythos .
The problem with the American Superman is he 's basically a god trapped in the mind of a crossing guard .
His M.O. for crime prevention is hovering above the ground , arms crossed with an exasperated frown on his face .
Come on !
We 're talking about Superman here , continents shift when he yawns and oceans boil when he farts in the tub .
But it 's wasted on a guy who has the personality of a mannequin .

Why is that happening ?
The Indian Superman has no such hang - ups .
He 'll dance like no one 's watching .
He 'll canoodle with his girl at 5,000 feet .
And -- at the 2:33 mark -- he 'll use his superbreath to blow a criminal at the force of escape velocity into the vacuum of space , where the perp will orbit the Earth as a frozen corpse for decades .
In short , Indian Superman just does not give a fuck .
Diamondback Capital Management , for instance , a $ 3 billion hedge fund , told its investors that 14.9 percent of its assets were locked up in the Lehman bankruptcy — money it could not extract .
A number of other hedge funds were in the same predicament .
( When called for comment , Diamondback officials did not respond . )
As this news spread , every other hedge fund manager had to worry about whether the balances they had at other Wall Street firms might suffer a similar fate .
And Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were the two biggest firms left that served this back - office role .
That is why Mr. Ackman ’s investors were calling him .
And that is what caused hedge funds to pull money out of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs , hedge their exposure by buying credit - default swaps that would cover losses if either firm could n’t pay money they owed — or do both .
It was fear , not greed , that was driving everyone ’s actions .
Breaking the Buck
There was another piece of bad news spooking investors — and government officials .
On Tuesday , the Reserve Primary Fund , a $ 64 billion money market fund , and two smaller , related funds , revealed that they had “ broken the buck ” and would pay investors no more than 97 cents on the dollar .
Money market funds serve a critical role in greasing the wheels of commerce .
They use investors ’ money to make short - term loans , known as commercial paper , to big corporations like General Motors , I.B.M. and Microsoft .
Commercial paper is attractive to money market funds because it pays them a higher interest rate than , say , United States Treasury bills , but is still considered relatively safe .
A run on money funds could force fund managers to shy away from commercial paper , fearing the loans were no longer safe .
One reason given by the Reserve Primary Fund for breaking the buck was that it had bought Lehman commercial paper with a face value of $ 785 million that was now worth little because of its bankruptcy .
If money market funds became fearful of buying commercial paper , that would make it far more difficult for companies to raise the cash needed to pay employees , for instance .
At that point , it would not just be the credit markets that were frozen , but commerce itself .
Just as important , in the eyes of federal officials , was that money market funds had long been viewed by investors as akin to bank accounts — a safe place to store cash and earn interest on that money .
Despite lacking federal deposit insurance , these funds held $ 3.4 trillion in assets .
“ Breaking the buck was the Rubicon , ” said a federal official .
“ This was the first time in the crisis that you could see stories talking about how it was affecting real people . ”

Despite the Bush Administration ’s insistence that a financial rescue package be drafted and approved before the weekend , the proposed plan was just made available for viewing online and lawmakers will vote on Monday .
As we await the final tally of winners and losers of the plan , American taxpayers around the country remain frustrated and without answers .
How are Montanans reacting to the proposed financial rescue package ?
By and large they are furious and mistrustful .
Our elected representatives are , thankfully , speaking out on our behalf .
Senator Jon Tester grilled Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke this week about why the banking committee was not given information or warnings that the banking industry was in such a precarious position .
He asked :
“ Was n’t there some opportunity somewhere down the line where we could have been informed of how serious this crisis was so we can take some preventative steps before we got to this point ? ”
Speaking on Hardball last Tuesday , Tester complained that Bear Stearns failed six months ago and experts in the financial marketplace should have anticipated that this situation would be likely or inevitable .
Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer also expressed dismay and frustration with the handling of the crisis .
His and Tester ’s offices are both reporting a surge in calls , e-mails , faxes and walk - in complaints from constituents mistrustful of Congress ’ handling of the crisis .
Speaking about his what he is hearing from his constituents , Schweitzer said :
“ " People say , ' Now wait a minute -- my stock has gone down -- I lost 15 or 20 percent . '
I had one guy walk up to me and say , ' I invested in Fannie Mae .
My value is down to zero and they are going to bail out the big banks -- what gives here ? ' "
Schweitzer feels that leaving taxpayers to pay the bill for a crisis caused by bankers is a classic case of Washington ’s disconnect with the real world .
He ’s been touring the state for his re-election campaign and heard widespread frustration from Montanans .
" They say , ' My God , this looks like a condition where the powerful are going to give money to the rich .
What 's new ? ' "
Thanks to politicians like Tester and Schweitzer , this bailout plan may even include some potential for American taxpayers to profit after the real estate market rebounds .
As Schweitzer said earlier this week :
" If we are going to bail these coyotes out , then why would n't we have an equity position ?
Why would n't the taxpayer make a little money if they do turn around instead of just shoving that money out the door and have them pay themselves big golden parachutes ?
Americans are justly angry all over the country .
Avarice and shortsighted policies have forced a choice between a devastating national financial crisis and a $ 700 billion bailout for greedy , mismanaged companies .
Either way we lose .
Montanans are demanding answers from our representatives .
Tester and Schweitzer are doing their best to mitigate the damage to everyday Americans as our country navigates this absurd disaster .

The new giant clam species has a deeply folded shell outline A new species of giant clam has been discovered in the Red Sea .
Fossils suggest that , about 125,000 years ago , the species Tridacna costata accounted for more than 80 % of the area 's giant clams .
The species may now be critically endangered , researchers report in Current Biology journal .
The scientists believe their findings may represent one of the earliest examples of the over - exploitation of marine organisms by humans .
T. costata has " very peculiar characteristics " that set it apart from two other species of giant clam that are also found in the area .
The Latin word costatus means " ribbed " and T. costata has a disitinctive , zig - zag outline to its shell .
" The new species are mid-sized clams - up to 40 cm long and a couple of kilograms heavy , " explained co-author Dr Claudio Richter , from the Alfred - Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research , Germany .
The new species has a distant relative , T. gigas , which can grow up to 1.4 m long .
Live specimens of T. costata appear to be restricted to very shallow waters .
Other species were also found in deeper reef zones .
The clam has an earlier and shorter breeding season that coincides with the seasonal plankton bloom .
Genetic analysis confirmed the status of the new species .
' Time travel ' " One of the great features of the desert - enclosed Red Sea is that you can literally time - travel from the present , several hundred thousand years into the past , " said Dr Richter .
The research team uncovered well - preserved fossil evidence that suggested stocks of these giant clams plummeted some 125,000 years ago - during an interval between Ice Ages .
They believe this period coincides with the appearance of modern humans in the Red Sea area .
Giant clams were abundant , large in size and easily accessible - making them an attractive food source for hunter - gatherers .
In " pre-human times " , T. costata may have been up to 60 cm long .
Since then , shell size has also decreased dramatically .
" The overall decline in giant clam stocks - with the striking loss of large specimens - is a smoking gun indicating over - harvesting , " said Dr Richter .
The scientists were not expecting to find a new species in an area as well studied as the Red Sea .
The research highlights how little is known about marine biodiversity in general , the scientists said .
" The coral reefs in particular ... may still harbour very large surprises , " said Dr Richter .

What are these ?
Ahmed Zawawi implemented my idea from June 2008 and wrote a STD.pm based syntax highlighter for Perl 6 .
It does n't work very well for comments and POD ( because they are parsed as whitespaces by STD.pm and thus do n't appear in the parse tree at all ) , but apart from that it works very nicely ( example here ) .
( The current heuristic for comments is that most of them happen at the statement_list level , so that is coloured blue , and everything else has different colours ) .
And it 's more than a syntax highlighter :
If you have javascript enabled , you can click on the " Show syntax tree " button .
Then when you move the mouse over the text you 'll see the length of current token and the path through the parse tree that led to it .
That already helped to identify at least two mis-parses in STD.pm .
There 's also a directory of syntax - highlighted test files where you can see some more output of the syntax highlighter .

On October 5 , 1991 , the young man who would one day become the world 's most famous programmer - and the brand name and poster boy for the open source software movement - sent a message to a newsgroup announcing the birth of what would become the Linux operating system .
You can read that original message that marks the birth of Linux as an open source project , posted by Linus Benedict Torvalds , on Google 's archive of a newsgroup called comp.os.minix .
It is hard to guess how many programmers and system administrators have been educated by the Linux development project , but it forms the core of what so many experts and newbies believe in terms of what an operating system should have in it , how that code is created , and how the systems software stack that rides atop of it is created and maintained .
It is safe to say that many millions of IT experts have been affected , either directly or indirectly , by Linux and the open source software movement it unleashed on corporations .
While academic and government institutions had long since supported open source software projects as well as the Unix open systems movement , it is Linux - first and foremost - that made open source a commercial idea and one that corporations could embrace .
Linux has come a long way in those intervening 17 years , which are a bit like dog years with respect to how computer technology ( both hardware and software ) moves at an accelerated pace compared to other technologies and areas of the economy .
It is hard to say if Linux is middle - aged or not , since the successors to OS / 360 are still around more than four decades later ( in actual time ) , and the original Unix is almost as old .
Even the commercial implementations of Unix are three decades old , and commercial Windows servers became a reality in 1994 , more than 14 years ago .
Who is to say how long any of these platforms will be around in production environments , but the history of the computer industry suggests that legacy platforms linger longer than many expect but lose their potency in the market ahead of when many might have hoped .
In many companies these days , the only two alternatives are Linux and Windows for new applications - and some day , far into the future that is hard to conceive , these will be legacy platforms too .
What Windows Promised to Be
But it 's remarkable that an open source movement backed by a handful of commercial entities with very little marketing muscle - at least compared to the established proprietary and Unix operating system providers who made so much money in the 1980s and 1990s - could take on the data center and , more importantly , get the begrudging support of the very system sellers who had the most to lose if Linux took off .
This is a testament to the powerful idea of a cross platform , open source operating system .
Linux is what Unix should have been and was n't .
Linux is what Windows had once promised to be - at least in terms of cross- platform support .
In the wake of the PowerPC alliance from IBM , Apple , and Motorola in 1991 , Microsoft made a commitment to support Windows NT 3.51 on PowerPC chips .
Windows eventually added support for Digital 's Alpha NEC's and SGI 's MIPS chips .
Workstation maker Intergraph ported Windows NT 3.51 to its Clipper chips and said it was creating a port to Sparc chips from Sun.
Neither ports saw the light of day .
Windows NT 4.0 , which came out in 1996 , only supported nothing more than f32 - bit x86 , Alpha , and MIPS chips , and by the turn of the millennium , only x86 chips were supported .
( Interestingly , the PowerPC alliance also lined up IBM's OS / 2 and AIX Unixes - the OS / 2 was never delivered - and even Sun Microsystems ' SunOS Unix was slated for the PowerPC chips .
IBM also ported its OS / 400 minicomputer operating system to the 64 - bit variants of PowerPC ) .
While Microsoft has expanded support to cover Itanium processors - mostly at the urging of Hewlett - Packard , Intel 's Itanium development partner and the one with the most to gain from Windows - on - Itanium for its high - end Integrity servers - Microsoft has not made good on the initial cross-platform promises for Windows server .
Microsoft has suffered from this , but not as much as Intel has been helped .
The beauty of Linux is this :
You can't stop a port to a new architecture , even if you wanted to .
I ’ve been running Windows Vista Ultimate on my Acer Aspire One netbook ( with 1.5 GB of RAM , and a 30 GB hard drive ) for a while now , without any problems or performance issues .
I have the full Aero Glass experience , and I did n’t need to do any performance tweaking or fiddling with services .
I even made a few very crappy videos to show it all off .
Apparently , Steven Sinofsky thinks Vista – and therefore , Windows 7 – can run just fine on a netbook too , and that ’s why he demonstrated Windows 7 running on a netbook this morning during the Windows 7 keynote .
In an interview with Ars he gave a little more details .
The fact that OEMs and users resort to Windows XP instead of Vista as their operating system of choice for netbooks ( if they do n’t choose Linux , that is ) is seen as a major loss of face for Microsoft .
Many consider this to be an issue of performance – netbooks simply can’t handle Vista in terms of processing power , video power , and RAM .
Sinofsky disagrees with this , and presents a different culprit : the solid state drives were too small to house Vista .
The key thing that really drove the XP installation where the very first ones of these netbooks tried to have only flash drives .
The reality is that , for better or worse , Vista ’s disk footprint was n’t going to fit on 8 GB of flash .
And the reason for that is not anything to do with performance , or bloat or anything .
We do a lot of really customer focused things , like we have a gigabyte and a half of printer drivers .
So you might not want them , but boy they ’re really useful when you need them . [ … ]
What drove the XP desire was to fit on these very small , solid state footprints , because you can go to Tom ’s Hardware and look up the spec marks for an Atom and compare to a low - end , 1GHz Celeron , and you ’re not far off .
So it ’s not the processor .
And it ’s not the RAM either , he continues , as he bought the model used to demonstrate Windows 7 with only 512MB of RAM , and upgraded it to 1.5 GB for USD 19 .
Netbooks today are all DirectX 9 capable , so Aero Glass works just fine .
Sinofsky also explained that Windows 7 will allow you to remove more components post - installation , so that you can save diskspace .
The fact that he was showing Windows 7 running on a netbook further disproves the claims that these netbooks ( which we all love because they ’re cute and cuddly ) ca n’t run the most recent version of Windows .
As long as you do n’t use the default , cheap SSD , Windows Vista will do just fine .
Small write operations are the real performance killers on these smaller , cheaper SSDs ( the SSD ca n’t keep up with the OS ) , and this problem affects all operating systems that I ’ve tried on my Aspire One before it underwent its HDD surgery .
The default Linpus installation , Ubuntu , Windows XP – they all experienced major cases of SSD lag .
If you ’re buying a netbook , avoid the SSD models .
They might be cheaper , but you are going to get extremely frustrated with the SSD .
The Higher Education Opportunity ( HEO )
Act of 2008 requires US universities and colleges to undertake measures to reduce piracy , and go after students who use filesharing networks to share copyrighted files .
A recent study found that , per institution , between $ 350,000 and $ 500,000 a year is spent tackling the piracy problem .
The methods universities use to reduce piracy on their networks have been scrutinized in our ‘ Tackling College Piracy ’ series .
Most of them have been found to be technologically ineffective , working only at the psychological level .
The main problem with the “ technological approach ” is that it ’s impossible to distinguish authorized from unauthorized network traffic .
Nonetheless , these anti-piracy efforts are quite expensive .
First of all , the amount of time spent dealing with allegations of infringement are huge , according to the study by the Campus Community Project .
IT personnel alone spend a mean time of 750 hours at public universities , while private university IT personnel spend around 620 hours a year on this .
The shorter time for private institutions generally comes about because of their smaller size , and so smaller search size , and less frequent notifications .
Overall , the costs that come with them are larger than most would expect .
It was concluded that between $ 350,000 and $ 500,000 is spent annually per institution – directly and indirectly – dealing with copyright infringement notices .
The quality of US education has already been questioned ( most recently by US presidential candidate Barack Obama in the 3rd Presidential Debate ) , especially in contrast to the high cost of it .
In this light , the costs incurred dealing with copyright infringements are nonsensical .
The study reports that 25 % of public universities use a form of technological filtering , such as Copysense , to try and reduce infringements .
As noted before , such measures are fairly inaccurate and rarely work .
Less common are educational methods , which may be linked with p2p access , as at Missouri S&T .
However , most universities and colleges simply disconnect pirating students from the network , and make them promise to never do it again when they want to get back on .
Financial penalties are also given , but this is not yet commonplace .
We will deal with this in an upcoming piece .
Here is a first - class example of the " fair and balanced " approach of Fox News .
It gives an entirely new meaning to the word " split " .
Call it the magic of live broadcasting .

But many conservatives understood that , by capitulating to the political Left , McCain and the Republican Party were ceding unnecessary ground to Barack Obama and his “ progressive ” Democrats .
In his classic 1932 book , Toward Soviet America , Communist Party boss William Z. Foster wrote about how “ The United Soviet States of America ” would come about .
As a result of various capitalist crises , the national government would assume more and more control over the economy .
“ In finance , ” he wrote , “ it will mean the nationalization of the banking system and its concentration around a central State bank … ”
It would be an exaggeration to say that we are getting close to anything resembling the Soviet system .
But it is also a big mistake to call massive federal intervention in the economy a “ rescue ” or even a “ bailout . ”
Over at Political Affairs Magazine , a publication of the Communist Party USA , writer John Case was gloating .
His article about the crisis was headlined , “ A Dose of Socialism to Forestall Disaster . ”
He thought that Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Board chairman Ben Bernanke had been reading the works of closet Marxists .
While many of the talking heads and pundits on TV were providing calming words of reassurance about federal intervention in the financial system , analyst Peter Schiff of Euro Pacific Capital had been accurately warning for years about a financial meltdown and says that the worst is yet to come .
Asked for comment on media coverage of the financial meltdown , he told Accuracy in Media , “ Absent when they have me on , it ’s pretty bad . ”
Many commentators , Schiff said , were telling people that if the bailout does n’t go forward , there would be an economic crisis .
However , “ if we do it , there will be a bigger crisis , ” he predicts .
“ The politicians want to make believe we can avoid paying the piper if we pass these bailouts , ” he said .
“ It ’s just not true .
It ’s going to collapse the currency .
It ’s going to make a worse economic crisis because the money they ’re printing is not going to buy anything . ”
While he continues to make a number of media appearances , he says that the CNBC cable network wo n’t have him on the air .
“ I predicted all this stuff , and they laughed at me , ” he said .
“ So maybe they ’re embarrassed . ”
Schiff , who labels the government takeover of the financial sector as socialism and refers to the Federal Reserve Board chairman as “ Comrade Bernanke , ” told AIM , “ The government does n’t have the authority to do any of this stuff .
This whole bailout bill is illegal .
They do n’t have the authority to buy up mortgages .
Nothing in the Constitution says they can do this . ”
“ Who needs Bolsheviks when you have the Fed ? ” he had written .
The author of “ Crash Proof : How to Profit from the Coming Economic Collapse , ” Schiff said that “ The government does n’t solve problems .
It makes them bigger .
So if we ’re broke , which is the reality — that ’s why these mortgages are not worth much because Americans can’t afford to pay the money back that they borrowed — the bottom line is we ’ve borrowed and spent ourselves into bankruptcy following the government ’s advice .
They ’re the ones that encouraged all this reckless borrowing and spending . ”
Interviewed by AIM before the House of Representatives had initially voted down the “ bailout ” scheme , at a time when it looked like the plan would actually pass , Schiff had shocking advice for ordinary Americans .
“ The first thing you do if you have a mortgage is you stop making the payments , ” he said .
“ That ’s the number one thing for people who have mortgages based on this plan .
And use that money to buy gold or stock up on food .
You ’re going to need it .
Meanwhile , no one is going to kick you out of your house .
You ’re going to be able to live in your house for probably a year or two before the government calls you up to give you a lower mortgage because nobody is going to foreclose on you right now .
Why would you foreclose ?
You sell the loan to the government .
This plan is a huge moral hazard and it ’s going to lead to a surge in mortgage delinquencies . ”
In an article on his website , Schiff had praised House conservatives for trying to preserve American - style capital - ism by resisting the scheme .
But when the House of Representatives , led by conservatives , initially defeated the proposed $ 700 - billion takeover scheme , Michelle Caruso - Cabrera of CNBC brought up the subject of “ four ways around Congress , ” adding , “ I know it ’s a flippant title and those who believe in the checks and balances in the Constitution will probably be upset by the title . ”
One panelist wondered if the Federal Reserve could just intervene on its own .
What they were entertaining was the notion of bypassing Congress and establishing an economic dictatorship in the United States .
The exchange between Caruso - Cabrera and her colleagues demonstrated that those who posture as “ pro-business ” can really be socialists at heart .
On CNBC , news analysts frequently complained that the “ ideology ” of the House Republicans had gotten in the way of the planned takeover of the financial sector .
That “ ideology ” is free enterprise capitalism .
The Return Of Karl Marx
Libertarian thinker and writer Martin Masse captured public attention with an article insisting that the proposed federal takeover of the financial sector in the U.S. represents a comeback by Karl Marx , the father of communism , who had proposed government control of capital .
“ If he were to rise from the dead today , ” Masse writes , “ Marx might be delighted to discover that most economists and financial commentators , including many who claim to favor the free market , agree with him . ”
He cites commentaries in favor of the “ bailout ” plan from so - called conservatives at the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal and other places .
The Heritage Foundation endorsed the takeover , even though it admitted that “ constitutional concerns remain ” about the plan and the “ centralization of power ” is worrisome .
Don Lambro of the Washington Times was extremely upset that conservative House Republicans had “ cowardly ” listened to their constituents and had voted against the plan .
“ Free - market advocates said that America ’s free - enterprise capitalist system rewards success and punishes failure , and government has no business intervening in the marketplace to pick the winners and losers , ” he said .
“ That is unarguable when the economy is working as it should , but when entire economic sectors are failing as a result of a credit collapse or a loss of confidence in the nation ’s banking and other financial institutions , then it is sometimes necessary for government to step in to restore them .
This is one of those times . ”
Indeed , Marx would be pleased .
But many conservatives understood that , by capitulating to the political Left , McCain and the Republican Party were ceding unnecessary ground to Barack Obama and his “ progressive ” Democrats .
If they had been honest about this debacle , they would have had to admit that , of all the Republicans running for president , only Rep. Ron Paul had predicted the crisis that was coming .
But they could n’t admit this because their proposed “ solution , ” which amounted to more government , more spending , and more debt , would only make things worse in the long run .
And that is why Rep. Paul and so many House conservatives so strongly opposed it .
The takeover plan , in their view , will only postpone the inevitable and leave us with a much bigger government .
The “ debate ” taking place in Washington and the media was being carefully controlled .
The Republican Bush Administration supported the plan and Congressional Democrats wanted to take it further .
The Democrats wanted even more federal involvement in the firms that are being acquired .
In other words , it was a question of how much socialism they want .
“ Government bailouts and takeovers are nothing new , ” pointed out financial advisor Ric Edelman .
He cited the following : “ In 1971 , Richard Nixon rescued Lockheed by providing $ 250 million in loan guarantees .
When the Penn Central Rail - road failed in 1971 , Nixon created Am - trak .
Jimmy Carter gave $ 1.5 billion in loan guarantees to Chrysler in 1979 .
Under Ronald Reagan , the FDIC in 1984 spent $ 4.5 billion to rescue Continental Illinois , which still holds the record as the largest U.S. bank failure .
Then , during the S&L crisis of the 1980s , George H. W. Bush approved the bailout of 747 savings and loans at a cost to taxpayers of $ 124.6 billion .
In 1998 , under Bill Clinton , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York bailed out Long Term Capital Management at a cost of $ 3.6 billion .
During the Mexican Peso Crisis , Clinton arranged for loans and guarantees to Mexico totaling almost $ 50 billion .
Then , following the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , George W. Bush approved $ 15 billion in subsidies and loan guarantees to aid the faltering airline industry .
This year , the Federal Reserve approved a $ 30 billion credit line to help JP Morgan Chase acquire Bear Stearns and engineered takeovers of Freddie Mac , Fannie Mae and AIG .
The names , dates and amounts are different , but that ’s about it . ”
In fact , however , the massive scope and price tag made this plan far different .
Many conservative members of Congress called it socialism .
A GLOBAL TAX FOR GLOBAL SOCIALISM
Meeting in New York on the occasion of the 63rd session of the U.N. General Assembly , members of the Socialist International ( SI ) called for the establishment of a World Financial Organization to provide “ global stability ” and regulate the financial systems of the nations of the world .
This will be the inevitable result of the U.S. Congress passing a socialist - style takeover of the U.S. financial sector .
This centralization of power will make it easier to integrate the U.S. into a global socialist system .
The U.N. has long played host to meetings of the SI and former U.N. Secretary - General Boutros Boutros - Ghali was a former vice - president of the SI .
This year ’s meeting , which was held on September 26 , included “ invited guests ” from the United Nations such as Juan Somavía , Director - General of the International Labor Organization ; Kemal Dervis , Administrator of the United Nations Development Program ; and Alicia Bárcena , Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean .
The proposed World Financial Organization ( WFO ) would “ fill up the gap in the existing structure of the financial system by monitoring and regulating private capital flows , ” its proponents say .
Those “ private flows ” represent capitalism .
The WFO , a long - time dream of officials of the United Nations , could lay the groundwork for a global tax to drain away some of that money for government purposes on a global basis .
A proposed “ World Tax Organization , ” which has been on their drawing board for years , would collect and dispense the revenue .
The SI , which shares the same basic economic goals as international Communism , is an association of 170 political parties and organizations from all continents , including the Democratic Socialists of America ( DSA ) , whose Chicago branch has backed Barack Obama ’s political career from the start .
Obama ’s backers in the Democratic Socialists of America were ecstatic and preparing for a complete government takeover in the U.S.
“ While recognizing the critical limitations of the Obama candidacy and the American political system , ” the organization said in a statement , “ DSA believes that the possible election of Senator Obama to the presidency in November represents a potential opening for social and labor movements to generate the critical political momentum necessary to implement a progressive political agenda . ”
The DSA cautioned , however , that the Left should not be so involved in the national presidential campaign that it ignores the general election races for the U.S. House and Senate .
“ We need more progressives in Congress as well as increased Democratic majorities , ” it said .
The Socialist International , meanwhile , is preparing for a high - level meeting in Mexico on November 17 - 18 , “ to discuss an agenda with the urgent world financial situation at its center , following U.S. elections . ”
MORE BAILOUTS ON THE WAY
Two more bailouts are pending before Congress — both of them sponsored by Senator Barack Obama .
One is the Jubilee Act , which would cancel as much as $ 75 billion worth of Third World debt , and the other is the Global Poverty Act , which would cost an estimated $ 845 billion .
Total potential cost : $ 920 billion .
If they do n’t pass Congress this year , they could come back in an Obama Administration .
Citing AIM research on the topic , commentators such as Andrew C. McCarthy pointed out that Obama ’s Global Poverty Act ( S. 2433 ) would cost even more than the $ 700 billion socialist takeover of the U.S. financial sector .
Obama ’s bill passed the House and Senator Joe Biden ’s Foreign Relations Committee and now awaits full Senate action .
But the Jubilee Act ( S. 2166 ) , which is co-sponsored in the Senate by Barack Obama , has also passed the House and awaits Senate action .
Republican presidential candidate John McCain is not an official sponsor of the Jubilee Act or Obama ’s Global Poverty Act .
But the pressure was mounting on McCain , as well as running mate Sarah Palin , to endorse the legislation .
In fact , McCain recently asked the wealthy rock star Bono , an advocate of more U.S. foreign aid spending , for advice on how to help the rest of the world .
“ The ONE Campaign and co-founder Bono spoke by telephone this afternoon with Senator John McCain , Governor Sarah Palin , and members of the McCain campaign policy staff about the issue of extreme poverty , especially in Africa , ” a September 24 ONE campaign news release declared .
“ The call today was part of ongoing conversations between ONE and both the McCain and Obama presidential campaigns . ”
No details of the conversations were provided .
The ONE campaign organization has been urging Senate passage of the Jubilee Act , which would cancel the debts of 26 foreign countries even while the U.S. suffers through its own financial crisis and Americans are losing their homes and savings .
It passed the House in April on a 285 - 132 vote .
While the Global Poverty Act has started getting more serious attention , the implications of passage of the Jubilee Act have been generally ignored .
Yet , a representative of the Treasury Department , Assistant Secretary For International Affairs Clay Lowery , testified at a Senate hearing in April that “ The Jubilee Bill represents an unfunded international mandate to fully cancel roughly $ 75 billion worth of debts owed by the potentially eligible countries to official bilateral and multilateral creditors . ”
This is on top of the $ 110 billion in debt reduction already being granted to various countries , he said .
Despite foreign aid having cost the American people $ 2 trillion since World War II , Bono ’s ONE organization believes in “ allocating more of the U.S. budget toward providing basic needs ” for the rest of the world .
ONE also promotes compliance with the U.N. ’s Millennium Development Goals , the same expensive effort set forth legislatively in Obama ’s Global Poverty Act .
Hypocrite Bono
Bono , the lead singer of the rock band U2 , is one of the richest entertainers in the world and gets tremendous access to the media — and politicians — because of his anti-poverty campaign .
Less well - known is the fact that his band came in for criticism two years ago when it transferred part of its business empire out of Ireland to avoid high tax rates .
ONE campaign “ partner ” organizations include the United Nations Association , the pro-U.N. lobbying group , and Ted Turner ’s United Nations Foundation , which financially supports the U.N .
While the ONE campaign is generally regarded as a left - wing organization , it claims support from such notables as Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network and Purpose Driven Life author and pastor Rick Warren .
Also bowing to the Left , before he came to Washington , D.C. to work on the $ 700 - billion federal takeover plan for the U.S. financial sector , McCain had taken time to attend and speak at the “ Clinton Global Initiative , ” a campaign underwritten by big companies and rich individuals to promote the pet causes of the disgraced former president .
One of these causes has been an international tax on airline tickets to generate funds to fight HIV / AIDS .
Obama , as well as Bono , also spoke at the Clinton event .
On September 25 , after conversing with McCain and Palin , Bono and his collaborators were scheduled to hold a “ United Nations emergency summit on the Millennium Development Goals . ”
Bono ’s ONE organization described them as “ eight goals ” that were “ drawn from the targets contained in the Millennium Declaration that was adopted by 189 nations — and signed by 147 heads of state and governments during the UN Millennium Summit in September 2000 . ”
Similar language is incorporated in Obama ’s Global Poverty Act , which has passed the House and Senator Joe Biden ’s Foreign Relations Committee , and now awaits full Senate action .
As AIM has documented repeatedly , a careful analysis of the legislation , as well as the follow - up 2002 U.N. Financing for Development Conference , which was designed to make the “ goals ” into a reality , leads to the conclusion that the U.S. will have to provide $ 845 billion in increased foreign aid spending , generated if necessary by a global tax on the American people .
At the Clinton Global Initiative meeting , Obama reaffirmed a “ commitment ” to “ embracing the Millennium Development Goals , which aim to cut extreme poverty in half by 2015 . ”
He added , “ This will take more resources from the United States , and as President I will increase our foreign assistance to provide them . ”
How can we trust a liar as big as John McCain ?
I ’m using the L - word .
So that may come across as a slashing blog remark .
But let ’s slow down and look at the facts that are not being disputed .
John McCain is telling lie after lie .
Not off the cuff remarks that can be excused as accidents or flubs but the same lies consistently and many of them .
Serial liars are never trustworthy people — that is a truism .
But it also demonstrates a deeper character flaw .
A normal job applicant would be disregarded out of hand after such a record became clear .
Lawyers for Hans Reiser claim the Linux developer convicted of murdering his wife may be " mentally incompetent , " an argument that , if successful , could send Reiser to a mental institution instead of prison .
In a court filing Tuesday , defense attorney William DuBois wrote Alameda County Superior Court Judge Larry Goodman " that in my carefully considered opinion , defendant Hans Reiser may be mentally incompetent as a result of a mental disorder or developmental disability . "
" This is complete and total nonsense , " says Reiser 's prosecutor , Paul Hora .
" All of a sudden he 's incompetent a week before he gets sentenced . "
The filing came about a week ahead of a scheduled July 9 sentencing date , in which Judge Goodman was expected to sentence the 44 - year - old developer of the ReiserFS file system to a 25 - to - life term for killing his wife in 2006 .
The filing is expected to scuttle that sentencing date .
The filing also means that Reiser does not immediately intend to lead authorities to the whereabouts of his wife 's body in exchange for a reduced term – a potential deal both sides were discussing last month .
An Alameda County jury in April found Reiser guilty of first - degree murder in the disappearance of his wife , Nina Reiser .
The 31 - year - old woman was last seen dropping off the divorcing couple 's two young children to stay with their father Hans Reiser at his Oakland hills house for the Labor Day weekend .
It is not immediately known whether the defendant , who is being housed at Santa Rita Jail in Dublin , California , is aware of the filing or whether he would challenge it .
Two sources close to the case , speaking on condition of anonymity , said Reiser is seeking new counsel .
If Reiser 's competency is contested , the issue could be decided by a jury .
If found incompetent , Reiser would be sent to a mental institution until he regains his competency .
After that , his sentencing and other post - conviction motions could resume .
During trial , Reiser claimed his wife abandoned their two kids and moved back to Russia , where the couple met in 1998 when he was overseas hiring Russian programmers for his Namesys software company .
Their two children , a boy now 8 and a girl now 6 , are living in Russia with Nina Reiser 's mother and father .
The jury did not buy Reiser 's defense .
With the latest court filing , ( .pdf ) the Reiser trial has come full circle .
As trial was set to begin in November , his attorneys told reporters their client was a mental genius who has rememberedthousands of pages of court records for his upcoming murder trial .
Later on , as part of what became known as the " geek defense , " his lawyers decried the Linux developer in front of jurors as being so socially inept that any guilt - ridden behavior he displayed following his wife 's 2006 disappearance was n't because he committed murder .
He threw away his car seat , tried to hide the car , hosed down the car 's inside and engaged in counter - surveillance moves because he could n't understand social cues , they said .
Jurors often rolled their eyes in disbelief , especially when the defendant took the stand for 11 days .
At one point during the sixth - month trial , DuBois suggested the defendant suffered from Asperger 's , a mild form of autism .
In closing arguments , they likened him to a duckbill platypus .
Dan Horowitz , a California criminal defense attorney who briefly was Reiser 's defense attorney before trial , suggested DuBois is " unable to get his client to function in a way to allow Dubois to prepare for sentencing or other motions to get a lighter sentence . "
Even though Reiser has already been convicted , the sentencing stage of a case is important , Horowitz said .
Among other things , Horowitz suggested that Reiser , if he 's mentally incompetent , might be incapable of assisting in negotiations to turn over the body in exchange for a lighter term , or of assisting DuBois in challenging the conviction .
" If he can get Hans Reiser to be found nuts , or if he can get Hans Reiser to be found almost nuts , he can be put in a psychological setting , instead of prison .
That 's better , " Horowitz said .

As you may have noticed , recently I started identifying external links on this website with a little arrow symbol : ⇗.
Most people agree that this is a neat idea – little visual cue that tells you the link points to an outside resource .
It distinguishes the links to interesting articles from references to my older and less sophisticated rants from the past .
I ’m doing this via really simple CSS trick which I actually stole from underscorebleach.net :
a[ href^ = " http " ] : after { color : gray ; content : " \21D7 " ; font - size : 1.2em ; } a[href ^ = " http://terminally-incoherent.com " ] : after , a[href ^ = " http://www.terminally-incoherent.com " ] : after { content : " " ; }
Simple regexp like pattern matching .
First rule applies the style to all absolute links ( ones that start with ‘ http ’ ) while the second one clears it of the more specific links which point back to this website .
Any relative links will remain un -styled .
Simple is n’t it ?
Unfortunately I ’m running into an ugly problem with this .
If you look at the sidebar for example , you will notice that some of the small button links also have the little arrow applied to them .
I ’m not really happy with this behavior but I can’t figure out how to prevent it from happening .
Of course I could simply put these buttons in a div , and use an overriding CSS rule to disable the formating there but that ’s not the point .
I just do n’t want to apply this style to any image links .
My initial instinct was to simply do :
a img : after { content : " " ; }
Unfortunately that does n’t work .
Can you tell me why ?
It does n’t work because the content style is applied to the A element while the above selects the IMG element .
In CSS you always drill down the DOM tree – each time you specify a child element , the style gets applied to that child .
Ideally , you would want to have some sort of a parent selector – something like :
a < img { /* stuff */ }
This would mean select element A whose child is an element IMG .
But no dice .
This is not the way things work .
People have been asking for this feature since the beginning of time and it is unlikely that it will ever get implemented .
I can sort of see why too - it would just be messy forcing the rendering engine to reverse up the tree and re-cascade all the styles below .
Obviously this is not the way to go .
I wish there was a way to select a text only node , since this is precisely what I need here .
I want to put the little arrow on all text links , and ignore all image links .
So having a text - only selector would be perfect .
I 'm not the only one who thought about it either .
Alastair Campbell for example proposes the following syntax :
a [ href^ = " http " ] : text - only { /* stuff */ }
I can totally get behind that notation , and I do n't really see huge problems with implementation .
Unfortunately , no one at W3C seems to be considering this .
It is a problem that is constantly resurfacing .
I believe that every time someone decides to identify external links with CSS ( which is probably quite often ) they bump into this problem and realize that there is no way to solve it in css .
There are workarounds of course .
You could for example define a custom class for image links and then make sure you use it every time you actually put one on your page .
Something like :
Then you just define a. foo to have blank content and you are home free .
Unfortunately if you are like me and you have a website full of image links , you probably wo n't want to go back and change all of them to use that particular class .
In fact , while you are doing this , you might as well just quit using that regexp solution I posted above and simply start marking your external links as class= ' external ' instead and avoid this whole issue all together .
Slightly more elegant solution would be to use JavaScript .
If you are using JQuery for example you could just use the :has selector :
$ ( " a: has ( img ) " )
But , do I really want to run a tight loop checking all the links on every single of my pages ?
It is a performance hit , and yet another script that needs to run before your page is ready for consumption .
I 'd rather avoid this sort of thing if I can .
So what is your solution ?
Do you have a clever trick to get around these issues ?
Do you make your external links with CSS but do not run into the image problem ?
Let me know .
I 'd love to see if this can be done properly . :)
The New York Times is shutting down City and Suburban Delivery Systems , a unit that distributed the Times and 200 other publications to newsstands in the New York , New Jersey and Connecticut area .
With it , the NYT is shedding 550 full - time union jobs .
Instead , company will increase its reliance on non-union contractors ( read : cheaper ) to distribute the Times to area retailers , much like the national edition of the Times , which is distributed by third - party companies .
The unit was formed in 1992 in a bid to diminish the clout of unions over the newspaper delivery business .
The Times bought two newspaper wholesalers to form the unit and negotiated a long - term employment contract with drivers .
A good idea at the time , but as NYT GM Scott Heekin - Canedy says now , " the business environment has changed dramatically since 1992 when City & Suburban was formed and wholesale distribution is no longer an economical business for the Times Company . "

The city of Asheville , North Carolina and surrounding towns are so short on gas that residents must wait over an hour to fill their tanks , reports the Asheville Citizen - Times .
Many gas stations have closed altogether .
Those which remain open have police stationed at the pumps to prevent fights from breaking out — one driver threatened another with a baseball bat .
Asheville officials have canceled all nighttime events , and the county is asking that nonessential employees work from home or switch to a four - day week .
The gas crunch began after Hurricanes Gustav and Ike swept through the Gulf Coast , shutting down the oil refineries that supply western North Carolina .
Because of its relatively remote location high in the Blue Ridge mountains , county officials estimate that shortages in the Asheville area will continue at least through the end of the month .
Storm recovery efforts , for obvious reasons , usually focus on the places that suffer the worst damage .
But as this year ’s floods and hurricanes have shown us , infrastructure damage in one part of the country can have serious effects on the others .
While Asheville ’s situation is extraordinary , it ’s likely to become more common as the frequency of severe storms increases .
So whose responsibility is it to deal with this problem ?
Several people told the Citizen - Times that they think the federal government should step in get the city moving again , perhaps by tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve .
In the long term , a coherent federal disaster protocol might help us to set our priorities ( though I ’m not holding my breath ) .

Groundskeepers use parks as canvases By Mel Antonen , USA TODAY By David Mellor David Mellor designed this pattern on the Fenway Park grass to commemorate the Red Sox 's centennial season .
Pittsburgh Pirates head groundskeeper Luke Yoder does n't think of himself as an artist , but what creative person would n't like to have his audience ?
The Vortex , a work designed by Yoder and his staff during their minor league days , is n't in a gallery , but their swirls of light and dark green grass are on display through Thursday at PNC Ballpark .
And Yoder , 29 , who has n't taken an art class since high school , is feeling like he 's the mowing version of Rembrandt .
" We 're definitely pumped , " Yoder says .
" I have n't seen anything like this pattern in the big leagues .
...
The best way to describe it ?
It looks like the ( basketball ) uniforms of the Portland Trail Blazers . "
In an era when baseball parks are taking an old - fashioned look , the grass is becoming hip .
Major league fields have come in checkerboards for years , but these days the trend is for something original , if not funky .
" Infield grass is the perfect canvas , and patterns are only limited by your imagination , " says David Mellor , groundskeeper for the Boston Red Sox .
He mowed the team logo in the infield , and a bat and two baseballs forming the number " 100 " into the outfield at Fenway Park in early June to celebrate the club 's centennial .
How to dress up the grass for the All - Star Game on July 10 at Seattle 's Safeco Field is another topic of discussion :
Should the grass be adorned with bunches of little stars or one big one ?
Some people like striping .
Others say it is n't necessary .
When Murray Cook , field consultant for Major League Baseball and the Olympics , had the Olympic rings mowed into the outfield grass at Sydney 's baseball stadium last September , International Baseball Federation officials gasped .
" They actually said , ' The balls are going to go in there and go around in circles , ' " Cook says .
" They did n't understand it was a illusion . "
How do the stripes get onto the field ?
Groundskeepers say it 's simple : A roller  21 inches wide for the infield and 6 feet wide for the outfield  is attached behind a mower reel .
It rolls over the grass so the color of the blades change tone when the sun hits at different angles .
The grass is never cut to different heights nor is it colored .
It 's all in the bending .
The process is referred to several ways : rolling , mowing or striping .
Master painter Mellor , at Fenway , is the master .
He has written a book , Picture Perfect ( Ann Arbor Press ) , which offers instructions on mowing techniques for sports landscapes .
Photos of his patterns have toured in art exhibits .
Groundskeepers were blown away by his Red Sox logo and bat - and - ball design .
" The way he cut it , it 's the most unique thing I 've ever seen , " says Heather Nabozny , the Detroit Tigers ' head groundskeeper .
" I 'm still trying to figure out how he did it . "
The intricate design is gone but is scheduled to return July 6 when Boston hosts Atlanta .
Mellor used to work in Milwaukee , where he striped a No. 19 in the County Stadium infield to honor Hall of Famer Robin Yount 's retirement .
He 's even used designs his daughters , 11 - year - old Cacky and 7 - year - old Tori , colored at home .
Cook practices patterns on residential lawns and Little League and college fields .
Another favorite practice spot is a spring training complex at Jupiter , Fla. , with 13 fields .
" You can erase a field pattern if you make a mistake by just mowing back over the grass , " Cook says .
" Think of it like an Etch - A - Sketch .
When we try a pattern on youth fields , if we do n't like how it looks from the stands , we can easily correct our mistakes . "
By David Mellor Mellor cut this swirling design into Milwaukee 's County Stadium years ago .
The important thing is to make sure the surface provides a true bounce , Colorado Rockies head groundskeeper Mark Razum says : " You can build up grains and a ball will snake , " meaning the ball can take strange little turns in the grass .
So Razum 's crew rotates three patterns : checkerboards , diagonals and straight lines .
On a six - game homestand , each gets used twice .
Buck Showalter , former manager of the New York Yankees and Arizona Diamondbacks and an ESPN commentator , still does n't like the idea .
He thinks baseball is going too far with grass design and says that while the fancy cuts are pretty , they are problem for players trying to field grounders .
" Players are taking an uncomfortable charge toward the ball , " Showalter says .
" It 's like they have to read the outfield grass like they do a golf green . "
But several Boston players say Mellor 's unique design this season at Fenway did n't affect them .
" We could n't even see the designs unless we were in the stands , " outfielder Trot Nixon says .
" It was n't a distraction at all . "
Grass billboards
The roughly 9,000 square feet of grass on a major league field must be alluring to corporate sponsors .
Would we ever see Texas Rangers shortstop Alex Rodriguez , baseball 's richest player , scoop a grounder at the tip of McDonald 's arches ?
While advertising is showing up on basketball courts and football fields , Major League Baseball officials say advertising being mowed into an outfield is n't an option .
" More and more , grass is becoming creative , but it is a long leap to say it is going commercial , " says Sandy Alderson , MLB 's executive vice president for baseball operations .
" There has n't been any suggestion for it , and I 'm not advocating it . "
Teams would have to get permission , and Paul Beeston , MLB 's chief operating officer , says it wo n't happen .
" Right now , that 's not an option . "
Of course , " right now " opens the loophole .
A couple of decades ago , baseball opposed advertising on outfield fences .
Now , home runs to left field at venerable Fenway Park zoom past soda bottles attached to light poles .
And throughout the majors , outfielders can't chase a fly ball without running past a string of billboards .
Baseball has shown some restraint regarding advertising on the field .
In the 1990s , MLB was set to sell ads on players ' uniforms .
Newspaper columnists and fans were outraged , predicting baseball players would look like race - car drivers .
Baseball dropped the idea .
" Advertising in the outfield grass sounds repulsive , and I do n't know if I could live with that , " says Judy Fleming , a San Diego cosmetics salesperson who attends 20 Padres games a season .
" If it pays the bills , you can see it coming , ca n't you ? " says Paul Robertson , an auto mechanic in Mesa , Ariz . , and a Diamondbacks fan .
Stephen Greyser , a sports marketing professor at Harvard Business School , says fans initially would balk at sales messages in the sod .
" It would mentally interfere with the pristine memory of what an infield or outfield is supposed to be , " he says .
But not for long .
" I suspect , that over a modest period of time , fans will get used to it , " he says .
" Naming rights are now acceptable . "
At Roger Dean Stadium at Jupiter , spring training home of the Montreal Expos and St. Louis Cardinals , general manager Rob Rabnecker is thinking about including on - field advertisements in packages when he goes next winter to sell corporate sponsorships for 2002 spring training games .
By David Mellor County Stadium is seen here with a plaid pattern .
The stadium already has sold advertising for the foul poles .
Why not the turf ?
Rabnecker says there are questions , but if he gets approval , he 'll be selling the ballpark 's infield and outfield grass .
" We are always looking for new ideas , for interesting and innovative ways to show people 's products , " Rabnecker says .
Yardwork
Even as groundskeepers are one - upping each other on ballfields , homeowners are making fashion statements on their lawns .
Steve Alioto , a Milwaukee Brewers fan who works for an air - conditioning company in Campbellsport , Wis. , has his half - acre of lawn striped with diamonds of different sizes up to 5 feet long .
It gives people different views from different angles .
" It looks clean , neat and it is easy to see , " he says .
Lysa Schmitt , a school district secretary from Harleysville , Pa. , has mowed a checkerboard into her yard , but she changes it often : " I like that it reminds me of golf courses or baseball fields . "
Artistic expression on wheels
Pro groundskeepers say mowing in different directions is beneficial for the grass .
It 's also aesthetically pleasing and gives workers , who spend up to 18 hours a day at the ballpark when their team is at home , a creative outlet .
It takes 2 hours a day to mow the grass at San Diego 's Qualcomm Stadium .
The design changes daily .
Steve Wightman , the head groundskeeper , lets his workers come up with ideas .
He wo n't veto them " unless they come up with something too squirrelly . "
One of Wightman 's favorites : a wavy pattern that made the ballpark feel " as if a Southern California wave was coming in . "
One design sent the wrong message .
In Detroit , club officials ordered Nabozny to stop using a pattern of concentric circles emanating from the pitcher 's mound .
The reason :
When the Tigers were in a long losing streak , ESPN announcers said the Tigers , like their field , were a bull 's - eye for the rest of the American League .
Want a field without stripes ?
Go to San Francisco's Pacific Bell Park .
Giants owner Peter Magowan wants nothing but green grass .
He says a striped field would be out of character for a ballpark that has an old - fashioned feel .
" Our pattern is no pattern , " head groundskeeper Scott MacVicar says .
In Oakland , head groundskeeper Clay Wood used to alternate three or four patterns but has stayed true to one checkerboard pattern for the past couple of years .
He likes it because the pattern looks different at various angles .
" It is like a kaleidoscope , " he says .
He 's not sure if he will change his stripes : " As long as nobody copies me , I 'll probably keep it . "

While checks within Apple 's supply chain suggest the company is researching a low - end iPhone design , rumors that such a device will surface this year are overly optimistic , according to Lehman Brothers .
The equity research firm used a research note earlier this week to address a report by UK's Daily Mail , which asserted that a low - cost ' iPhone nano ' is set to follow on the heels of the iPhone 3G with a release ahead of this year 's holiday shopping season .
" While we believe Apple is working on a lower - end iPhone form factor , we do not think one will come until Spring 2009 , " analyst Ben Reitzes advised clients .
He then outlined several reasons supporting his thesis .
First and foremost , Reitzes said , Apple is still struggling to reach a supply and demand balance on its latest handset , the iPhone 3G released just last month .
With plans to expand availability of that handset to 50 more countries through the end of the calendar year , releasing a new iPhone model mid-way that process would only threaten to complicate matters .
Reitzes also recalls that Apple customers became furious last year when the company slashed the price of the original iPhone just months after launch , and therefore common sense would suggest that management would be looking to avoid a repeat episode of that scenario , he said .
" While we have picked up indications of a product like this in the supply chain , it doesnât appear that the company has yet solidified the form factor , so it may be hard to get it finalized in time for the holidays , " the analyst added .
In his report Monday , Reitzes also backed a recent report on heightened iPhone production .
He said his own checks indicate that Apple will manufacture more than 3 million of the handsets this month alone , making his estimate of 3.8 million units for the September quarter seem overly conservative ; Apple sold 1 million of the devices in the first three days alone .
" We believe that strong demand in the initial countries could make a rollout overseas take longer simply based on supply , " he said .
" We believe that initial demand overseas could be quite strong and estimate 8.3 million iPhones could be sold in [ the fiscal first quarter of 2008 ] ( December ) with 24.2 million sold in fiscal 2009 . "

It was the speech of a lifetime for the young presidential candidate : Accepting the Democratic nomination before a sea of supporters outside of the party ’s convention hall , and  more critically  addressing concerns of Americans nationwide about his experience level , policy ideas and personal background .
The “ New Frontier ” speech by John F. Kennedy , as it came to be known , electrified the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on July 15 , 1960 , and it was widely regarded as successfully reassuring voters who were wary because he was 43 years old , Roman Catholic and hardly a legislative lion or foreign policy expert in the Senate .
Of all the echoes of Kennedy ’s candidacy that have been noted this year , Senator Barack Obama ’s plan for his speech here on Thursday night is one of the clearest .
Mr. Obama , anointed by the Kennedy family as an heir to J.F.K. , is also leaving the convention hall to deliver his speech  before more than 70,000 people at nearby Invesco Field  and to try to shepherd undecided Democrats and others to his camp .

Kennedy , wasting no time , offered a direct challenge to anti-Catholic bias early in his 1960 speech .
“ I hope that no American , considering the really critical issues facing this country , will waste his franchise and throw away his vote by voting either for me or against me because of my religious affiliation , ” he said .
“ It is not relevant . ”
Investigative journalist Murray Waas just published a feature story on the ties between John McCain ’s transition chief and Saddam Hussein .
Here ’s hoping McCain brings up Ayers tomorrow night .
We can all watch John McCain ’s head explode when Obama hits him with his associate ’s ties to Saddam .
The Washington lobbyist John McCain has named to head his presidential transition team aided an influence effort on behalf of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein to ease international sanctions against his regime .
The two lobbyists who McCain aide William Timmons worked closely with over a five year period on the lobbying campaign later either pleaded guilty to or were convicted of federal criminal charges that they had acted as unregistered agents of Saddam Hussein ’s government … .
Virtually everything Timmons did while working on the lobbying campaign was within days conveyed by Vincent to either one or both of Saddam Hussein ’s top aides , Tariq Aziz and Nizar Hamdoon .
Vincent also testified that he almost always relayed input from the Iraqi aides back to Timmons .
Talking points that Timmons produced for the lobbyists to help ease the sanctions , for example , were reviewed ahead of time by Aziz , Vincent testified in court .
Proposals that Timmons himself circulated to U.S. officials as part of the effort were written with the assistance of the Iraqi officials , and were also sent ahead of time with Timmons ’ approval to Aziz , other records show .
Missouri vandals kick , stomp and steal Obama signs David Edwards and Andrew McLemore
Published : Friday October 24 , 2008
Print This Email This After several political signs were stolen or vandalized from his front yard , a Missouri man installed video cameras in an attempt to catch the vandals in the act .
And that 's exactly what he did .
A video below shows a woman stepping out of a truck and kicking Mike Brown 's Obama / Biden political signs before running away .
" I 'm just a guy who has a sign in his yard , and this is the first election that I have ever felt was important enough for me to voice my opinion in the form of a yard sign , " said Brown .
Police said such acts occur frequently every election year without any sure way of preventing it , Fox 4 reported .
If Brown can gather enough evidence with his surveillance cameras , the criminals can be charged with stealing or defacing property , ABC News reported .
" In my case , I 'll just go get another one and that means I 'm paying more money and putting more money in the campaign for the person that you are against .
It 's rather pointless , " said Brown .
In another instance of defaming Obama signs earlier this week , a black bear cub was shot in the head and the corpse laid on the campus of Western Carolina University with an Obama / Biden sign placed on it , WLOS reported .
" I just can't believe people would go to such an extent to state their political beliefs , " said Bethany Rowe , a junior at WCU .

Someone from the McCain camp must have had a pretty stern talk with former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger .
He just went on Fox with a bracingly abject apology for saying that Sarah Palin was n’t qualified to be vice president .
So abject in fact that I must say that it had something of the feel of one of the Maoist self - criticism sessions or perhaps one of the public apologies during the Moscow show trials .
Some hyperbole , yes .
But , believe me , not much .
We ’ll have the video shortly .
Late Update : Confess !
One of the things I really love is how the Internet has changed politics , but some people have n’t received the memo .
Gone are the days when politicians and pundits could blithely contradict themselves , because now we can just look it up on on the innertubes and point out their hypocrisy .
Glenn Greenwald points out a great example , …
You may have heard of Dick Morris .
He was one of Bill Clinton ’s closest advisors , and nowadays regularly appears on Fox News .
So , here is Morris on September 26 ( from his Newsmax article “ McCain ’s Brilliant Bailout Strategy ” ) :
McCain has transformed a minority in both houses of Congress and a losing position in the polls into the key role in the bailout package , the main man around whom the final package will take shape . …
Then McCain comes out of the process as the hero who made it happen when the president could n’t and Obama would n’t .
He becomes the bailout expert .
And , of course , the bailout will work .
…
Finally , McCain , as the reigning expert on bailouts , then can take the tax issue to Obama , saying that a tax increase , such as the Democrat is pushing , would destroy the bailout , ruin the economy , and trigger a collapse .
This bold move by McCain is about to work .
Big time .
Ok , fast forward to today in the New York Post .
Hard to believe this is the same Dick Morris :
The polls now all indicate an Obama win on Nov. 4 ; some even suggest a landslide .
…
Anger over the Wall Street mess has been pushing voters to Barack Obama in droves .
And John McCain ’s effort to get involved in the solution only hurt him .
By suspending his campaign and heading to Washington , McCain made himself a central actor in the unpopular bailout , and thus a target of populist outrage .
It also hurt his his effort to show how he far he is from President Bush – there he was , shoulder to shoulder with Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , Bush and Wall Street .
How stupid do you have to be to believe anyone who talks out of both sides of their mouth like this ?
" Now I 'll have to pay a company to come out every week to take away a bag of food wrapping .
How much will they charge for that £ 50 ?
£ 100 ?
It 's madness , " he said .
" We 're often phoning the council about fly - tipping round here .
But do they do anything ?
No , they 're too busy coming after people like me . "
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - A Chinese province is searching at home and abroad for experts to clean a lake once famous for its hot springs but now contaminated by arsenic , a newspaper reported on Tuesday .
Arsenic poisoned the Yangzonghai lake in southwest Yunnan province , affecting the drinking water of at least 26,000 people .
In June , the local environmental protection bureau detected dangerous levels of arsenic in the lake .
A nearby firm had not built proper containment pools for its waste , and years of accumulated arsenic were leaching through into the groundwater and the lake , an investigation found .
Now the provincial government is accepting bids “ no matter from China or from overseas ” for qualified personnel to clean up the mess , the Beijing News said .
Odorless , tasteless , colorless and easily soluble , arsenic has long been a feared poison .
A heavy dose can kill , while small amounts can make people sick gradually .
Xinhua news agency said hundreds had fallen ill from arsenic poisoning in two villages in the southern region of Guangxi after drinking water contaminated by industrial waste .
Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton waded into the contentious U.S. presidential campaign Thursday , recording an automated telephone message on behalf of Democrat Barack Obama .
The message challenged Republican John McCain ’s “ record on policing issues and extolled Obama ’s , ” Bratton said in an interview .
It comes , he said , in response to a telephone message recently made by former Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani in support of McCain and critical of Obama ’s law enforcement bona fides .
A spokesperson for Obama declined to comment .
According to Bratton , the campaign held off from making fast use of it , opting not to send it out to potential voters on Thursday .
It was unclear when , or in which states , the campaign planned to use the recording .
Describing himself as “ an independent , ” Bratton said he decided to assist Obama because “ Democrats are much more supportive on policing issues .
Republicans are just not good on local policing . ”

Bratton , one of the nation ’s leading law enforcement figures , is widely credited for his success in dramatically reducing crime rates in Los Angeles and New York , where he led the Police Department for two years in the mid-1990s .
The tit for tat with Giuliani is steeped in ill - will between the two : Giuliani , mayor in New York when Bratton was police commissioner , clashed with Bratton over credit for the falling crime rate .
Bratton eventually resigned his post .
The recording is the first time Bratton has lent his considerable reputation to Obama ’s campaign .
The police chief was widely seen as a firm supporter of Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton during her unsuccessful bid for her party ’s nomination .
The recording is bound to refuel incessant rumors that Bratton is looking to land the top spot at the FBI or Homeland Security in a Democratic administration .
Bratton has staunchly dismissed the idea , saying he is committed to finishing his second term as chief of the Los Angeles Police Department in 2012 .
He reiterated that Thursday , saying , “ I would n’t be able to get anything done in Washington .
I can have more impact nationally on police issues from Los Angeles . ”
Bratton is the first LAPD chief in recent history with a national profile big enough to be used by a presidential candidate , and his decision to do so was a departure for the city ’s top cop .
Past chiefs have maintained a neutral public stance on political matters .
Bratton said he is not identified in the recording as Los Angeles ’ chief in order to steer clear of any ethics violations .

LOS ANGELES —
The new law school at the University of California , Irvine has dropped its original name , the Donald Bren School of Law , and plans to offer full tuition scholarships to students who enroll in the school ’s first semester in fall 2009 .
Donald Bren , the billionaire chairman of the Irvine Co. , a real estate firm , gave $ 20 million to the law school last year .
Bren is a major donor to the University of California , Irvine , having supported the university ’s endowment ; the school of information and computer sciences , which is named after him ; and the school of the arts , which is named after his late stepmother .
In an e-mailed statement , Dean Erwin Chemerinsky wrote : “ We are deeply grateful for the Bren gift , but it was decided between the chancellor and Mr. Bren that our name should be parallel to other UC schools . ”
John Christensen , a spokesman at the Irvine Co. , said the school requested the change and Bren accommodated that request .
He said part of the reason to drop the name was to avoid confusion with other schools that are named after Bren on the campus of UC Irvine .
The move comes as the University of California , Berkeley School of Law , recently reduced the prominence of its Boalt Hall name .
It also comes as UC Irvine School of Law , which began accepting applications for enrollment a month ago , plans to offer full tuition scholarships to its first class , which is anticipated to be about 60 students , said Charles Cannon , assistant dean of development and external affairs at the law school .
Originally , the school , which will focus on public interest law , had planned to offer full tuition scholarships to about half that class ; but , in an effort to lure high - quality students and compete with other top 20 law schools , UC Irvine School of Law has expanded that program , he said .
While the law school has not yet determined the cost of its tuition , each scholarship is anticipated to be about $ 100,000 , given an estimated rate of about $ 33,000 per year , Cannon said .
He said that UC Irvine School of Law , which is actively fundraising for the scholarships , has raised more than one third of the roughly $ 6 million needed to provide full tuition for each student .
But he said the school currently has at least 10 more gifts in line for scholarships .
“ People in the community see it as an investment , ” he said .
In recent years , some top universities , such as Harvard , Yale and Stanford , have announced plans to provide free tuition to students whose families earn less than $ 45,000 to $ 60,000 .
This year , Harvard Law School announced that it would forgive the third year of tuition for students who commit to spending five years in public service after graduation .
The web collectively got a bit shinier this week with Adobe 's release of Flash Player 10 .
The new version offers designers a compelling set of new features including support for rich 3D visual effects , a new antialiasing engine , an improved drawing API , support for color management , and enhanced support for streaming audio and video content .
With this release , Adobe is clearly taking steps to ensure that Flash stays ahead of the curve and wo n't lose traction in the face of competitive pressure from Silverlight .
Typically , the release of an Internet plug - in — even one as widely used as Flash — is interesting mostly to the developers who write software for the platform , but users may have a lot to look forward to in this release , especially those using Linux or Mac OS X .
In addition to strengthening Flash 's media and graphics features , Adobe has also labored to improve performance and cross-platform support .
Between updates to underlying technologies and some bottleneck sleuthing , Adobe says Flash performance has improved as much as 300 percent for " the rest of us . "
Ars Technica decided to investigate whether Adobe was merely blowing smoke in our PDFs .
To get some relatively useful numbers and real web experience with the new Flash player , we decided to compare how well the last Flash 9 release for Mac OS X and Linux performed against version 10 on a number of sites .
The most significant of these sites is GUIMark , a benchmark that puts various web - based technologies like Flash and Silverlight through their paces , all while providing frame rate averages for the duration of the test .
What follows are our results from GUIMarks , our CPU records , and a discussion of the relevant changes in Flash for Mac OS X and Linux ; combined , this should provide a clearer picture of whether Flash 10 actually provides significant performance improvements .
Mac OS X
The Mac version shares the general improvements and enhancements Adobe introduced in Flash Player 10 , like the aforementioned introduction of 3D Effects and enhancements to drawing APIs and color management .
More details on the new features can be found in the release notes for the last beta release .
The most significant improvement for Mac users , however , is briefly described by Tinic Uro , a Flash engineer , on his blog .
Traditionally , Flash has not been one of the Mac 's strong points .
It has never performed well , and a MacBook 's fans are almost guaranteed to kick in when loading up just about any Flash advertisement or that game your boss keeps busting you for playing .
As we 've reported before , though , Adobe 's engineers have discovered a bottleneck in Flash 's text rendering .
The GUIMark benchmark should be very sensitive to this because it spends more than half of its time testing a single Mac OS X text function : ATSUGetUnjustifiedBounds .
As you 'll see from our Mac OS X results below , performance has definitely improved in many respects on Mac OS X , though some Arsians suspect that other problems may still exist with Mac OS X's NSPlugin API .
That said , let 's take a look at the results of pitting Flash Player 10 against its predecessor on both a 1.6 GHz MacBook Air and a Quad 2.66 GHz Mac Pro .
These results were run using the most recent versions of both players , hosted in Safari 3.1.2 on Mac OS X Leopard 10.5.5 .
Flash 9 GUIMark Air : 4 FPS , two separate CPU cores held steady at 103 percent Mac Pro : 9.5 FPS , two separate CPU cores held collectively at 100 Hulu video Air : 98 percent CPU Mac Pro : 63 percent CPU YouTube video Air : 74 percent CPU Mac Pro : 45 percent CPU 2advanced.com
Air : 20 percent CPU , Menu interaction , popups , audio cues , etc. peaked at peaked at 86 Mac Pro : 25 percent CPU , peaked at 75 Winterbells Air : 78 percent CPU Mac Pro : 55 percent CPU
Flash 10 GUIMark Flex3 Air : 17 FPS , 108 percent CPU Mac Pro : 28 FPS , 140 percent CPU Hulu Video : Air : 84 percent CPU Mac Pro : 56 percent CPU YouTube Air : 70 percent CPU Mac Pro : 40 percent CPU 2advanced.com
Air : 20 percent CPU , peaked at 55 Mac Pro : 28 percent CPU , peaked at 66 Winterbells Air : 85 percent CPU , gameplay noticeably ramped up to a more challenging speed Mac Pro : 60 percent CPU , gameplay noticeably ramped up to a more challenging speed
As you can see , GUIMark results offer the best backup for Uro's claims that performance on Mac OS X has improved as much as three times .
Four frames per second in Flash Player 9 on the MacBook Air , and 9.5 FPS on the Mac Pro , is , quite frankly , pathetic .
While 17 FPS on the Air in Flash Player 10 is n't exactly great , it is actually over a 4 x boost in performance .
28 FPS for the Mac Pro is right at 3 x faster , though the GUIMarks test worked both machines noticeably harder ; especially the Mac Pro.
Fortunately , our CPUs were worked at least marginally less in other tests , especially web - based video , where Flash now dominates .
Linux
Flash is widely reviled by Linux users , who almost universally disdain its proprietary licensing model , lousy performance , excessive resource consumption , poor platform integration , and abysmal lack of stability .
Flash is listed by Mozilla 's crash reporting system as the number one cause of Firefox crashes on Linux .
On Ubuntu 's brainstorm web site — where Ubuntu users suggest ways that the Linux distribution can be improved — over a thousand users have voted for items that highlight the need to fix Flash 's dysfunctional behavior and frequent crashes .
Although it is still too early to tell if the stability problems have been addressed , the benchmarks clearly show that performance is on the rise .
Adobe has also fixed several major bugs and added some Linux - related features that improve the Flash user experience .
Benchmarks on Linux , which were conducted with GUIMark on my Mac Pro running Ubuntu 8.04 , show modest improvements .
Flash 9 clocked in at roughly 14 FPS , while Flash 10 boosted that to about 22 FPS .
Previous versions of Flash exhibit a very frustrating z- ordering bug that caused Flash content to always be drawn on the very top layer , where it could obscure dynamic HTML elements like drop - down menus .
This problem was caused by lack of proper WMODE support in Flash and in Firefox .
This long - standing bug has finally been fixed , and drop - down menus are now correctly displayed on top .
Users will need Firefox 3.0.2 or higher , however , in order for this to behave properly .
Another big improvement for Linux users is the addition of support for Flash 's video camera functionality .
Adobe 's Mike Melanson described this feature back in July when it appeared in beta 2 .
Adobe collected feedback and camera information from users to help fine - tune the camera support .
It is implemented with the Video4 Linux v2 API , which is tightly integrated with the Linux kernel and supports a wide range of devices .
Adobe has also stepped up its packaging efforts to better accommodate Linux users .
With the release of Flash 10 , Adobe 's web site now provides the plugin in a convenient DEB package designed specifically for Ubuntu .
This is offered alongside an RPM package and a binary tarball .
It 's also worth noting that the new version of Flash is already packaged and available from the restricted repository in Ubuntu 8.10 .
Although Adobe has addressed some of the biggest problems that have been troubling Linux users , there are still some aspects of Flash that will leave them dissatisfied .
There are still no 64 - bit builds , for instance , and most of the components of the Flash player plugin are still proprietary and closed .
Several open source software projects , including Gnash and Swfdec , aim to eliminate this dependence on Adobe by creating completely open implementations of the Flash player .
These projects are maturing steadily and could eventually displace Adobe 's implementation on Linux .
Conclusion
The latest version of Flash offers tangible improvements for users and for designers .
The growing emphasis on strong cross-platform support reflects the increasing relevance of alternative operating systems in the technology industry .
Adobe 's efforts to improve Flash on Linux and Mac OS X is a tacit acknowledgment of Apple 's rising marketshare and Linux 's modest success on netbooks .
It is also a sign that Adobe is aiming to make Flash a stronger solution for cross- platform application deployment through its popular AIR runtime .
This is further illustrated by Adobe 's commitment to AIR on Linux and recent decision to join the Linux Foundation .
Flash 's massive install base gives
Adobe a lot of power , but the company 's dominance in the rich web content space has n't made it lazy .
Adobe is clearly capable of holding its own against a Silverlight incursion by delivering technical improvements that ensure Flash does n't lose its shine .
Update - Now with more Windows benchmarks
Vista
The original focus of this piece was on the platforms where the Flash player has traditionally performed very poorly .
But , by popular request , we ran the tests again on the same Quad 2.66 Mac Pro with 6GB of RAM , but this time in Firefox 3.0.2 on Windows Vista running under Boot Camp ( no virtualization ) .
As the numbers will show , Flash performs far better in Vista versus Mac OS X running on the same hardware , and it actually improved slightly with the version 10 update .
McCain may not care if his lies get more and more disgusting .
But some are noticing .
Here 's the St Petersburg Times ' editorial today :
McCain 's straight talk has become a toxic mix of lies and double - speak .
It is leaving a permanent stain on his reputation for integrity , and it is a short - term strategy that eventually will backfire with the very types of independent - thinking voters that were so attracted to him .
You can look through my entire archives and columns .
I always respected McCain , even when I disagreed with him .
I made him my close second pick to Ron Paul in the primaries .
I backed him in 2000 .
I have chatted and spent time with him and always admired him .
No more .
His actions and words in the last month have been despicable .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Of all the roles I thought I might play as a classroom teacher , it never occurred to me that I might be called upon to be a spook .
Social worker , surrogate parent , cleaner , technician , crowd controller , salesman for the damaged goods of the national curriculum , yes – but I never imagined I might be required to be a quasi-MI6 agent , snooping around the playground for budding terrorists .
Yet this is what the government is calling for state school teachers like me to be ; government guidance published today will ask teachers to monitor pupils ' behaviour and inform the authorities – including police – if they suspect teenagers are being drawn into violent extremism .
As with much of the guidance that the government provides teachers , it is highly contradictory .
On the one hand , it encourages teachers to discuss the issues surrounding terrorism – the threat from extreme Islamist groups , al - Qaida , and other fanatics hellbent upon blowing up innocent citizens – which seems reasonable enough .
But on the other , the plan aims to extend the " in loco parentis " responsibilities of teachers to monitoring whether pupils are becoming extremists and telling the authorities .
This begs a couple of questions .
Surely , if pupils know that teachers are obliged to report them if they articulate their extreme views , then they 'll be very cautious about saying anything that might incriminate themselves ?
Furthermore , wo n't it inhibit any discussion from those pupils – or teachers for that matter – who are not extremists but have some sympathy for " freedom fighters " who advocate violence – such as Nelson Mandela ?
I am currently teaching Chinua Achebe 's Things Fall Apart , which is about an African man 's violent and ultimately suicidal response to British colonial rule in Nigeria in the 19th century , and fielding all sorts of left - of - field comments from my sixth formers , some of whom are suggesting that the African is right to take up arms against his oppressors , even though it 's clear he's on a suicide mission .
Should I be reporting these impassioned , engaged students as potential fodder for al - Qaida ?
If the pupils knew I might , all sensible discussion about the novel would cease .
Perhaps even more pertinently , I have taught pupils after 9/11 , and during the Iraq war , who have expressed sympathies for both Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein .
On both occasions , this has provoked a furious response from the rest of the class and a lively , impassioned debate has ensued ; the sort of debate about religious fundamentalism , freedom of speech and changing the world that the Secretary for the Department of Children , Families and Schools , Ed Balls , wants lots of teachers to conduct throughout the country .
However , I am pretty sure that they would n't have happened if the pupils who provoked the discussions with their defence of al - Qaida and the former Iraqi dictator knew that I would have to report them to the authorities .
Interestingly , in both cases , these pupils were clearly not budding terrorists , but what I would call clever " wind - up " merchants who relished putting everyone 's backs up .
However , I have come across some characters at school that I have suspected of being serious fanatics .
Funnily enough , they were n't pupils but teachers !
These pedagogues were not the sort of bombastic , careless blusterers who trigger great classroom discussions but quiet , devout teachers who were obviously very religious , praying every day and wearing the appropriate garb .
While I might have suspected them of harbouring dreams of violence , I had absolutely no evidence of it , beyond their belief that homosexuals should be executed .
They certainly were very careful not to talk about Bin Laden or al - Qaida .
I had a gay colleague who was so incensed when she questioned one of these teachers about their attitudes towards homosexuality that she did complain to the authorities .
She was quickly silenced with the response that it was a religious matter – and no action was taken .
Indeed , that fundamentalist teacher went on to pass his trainee year and now is teaching at a state school as a fully qualified teacher .
This has made me think that perhaps teachers need to be properly vetted before we turn our attention to the pupils .
After all , one of the 7/7 bombers was a primary school assistant ; it is possible , he could well have been rooted out if properly questioned about his attitude towards violence in a job interview .
Perhaps he would not have blurted out that he wanted to be a suicide bomber , but his attitudes towards homosexuality could have been fairly easily discovered .
Personally , I think that anyone who believes that gay people should be exterminated should not be allowed to teach our children .
The government , though , seems to reluctant to deal with this thorny issue and instead wants to turn teachers into ineffectual spooks , which will have the effect of stifling all meaningful debate .
Comres did an awesome job on our office build out .
We did a full reconstruction with new and modern cabling options and requirements .
They were amazing to work with , always showed up and worked efficiently until the job was done .
I highly recommend using them for your data cabling needs .
They really did a terrific job for us .

Watching the debate I noticed that Biden referred to the Muslim population of Bosnia and Herzegovina as “ Bosniaks “ .
This is actually the correct term , though in English people often say simply Bosnian Muslims .
When he said it , the first thing I though was , I wonder how many right - wingers would jump on this as a gaffe on the model of candidate George W. Bush ’s reference to ‘ Grecians . ’
I do n’t know who else exposed their own ignorance by falling into this trap .
But Cokie Roberts did .

Here ’s the video :
Late Update : Seems like Mona Charen and Joanna Weiss in the Boston Globe flubbed this one too .
And , alas , the folks at RedState got burned too .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - The Syrian state press has described her as a “ Mossad beauty . ” A Palestinian cartoonist compared her to the Mona Lisa .
One Canadian report called her “ naturally blonde with eyes as blue as the Mediterranean . ”
Israel 's Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni speaks during a joint news conference with President Simon Peres ( unseen ) in his residence in Jerusalem , September 22 , 2008 .

Yet Tzipi Livni , asked by Israel ’s president on Monday to form a government following Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ’s resignation , remains largely faceless when it comes to her country ’s powerful ultra-Orthodox Jews , or haredim .
Citing concerns for feminine modesty , the ultra-Orthodox refuse to publish images of women in their newspapers -- a core source of information as the reclusive community generally shuns the television , Internet and most radio stations .
That poses a unique challenge for Livni , the 50 - year - old foreign minister , as she tries to piece together a governing coalition and campaigns for support among ultra-Orthodox who make up an estimated 8 - 15 percent of Israel ’s population .
“ There ’s no doubt that we have our work cut out for us when it comes to the haredim , ” Avraham Kroizer , one of Livni ’s strategic consultants , told Reuters .
“ Their media are never going to change the no-photograph policy , so it comes down to arranging face - time for her with leading haredi figures who can spread the word , ” Kroizer said .
At meetings with religious legislators on forming political partnership , Livni dons demure skirts and wrist - length jackets , not the pant - suits she usually favors .
Such deference irks many Israeli feminists , who argue it risks papering over the cultural rift in a mostly secular Israel whose Supreme Court and parliament both have women presidents .
Should she become premier , Livni , once a Mossad intelligence agent and a lawyer , would be the second woman in top office since Golda Meir in the 1970s .
“ It ’s strange -- these people ( ultra - Orthodox ) bespeak an attitude whose origins are in the Middle Ages , while on a political level it looks like they are willing to work with Livni , ” Galia Golan , a veteran women ’s rights activist , said .
She said Livni “ radiates something feminine , something fresh , which leads many Israelis to see her as a politician who can bring a new kind of governance . ”
A senior editor at Hamodia , an ultra-Orthodox daily , said there was no plan to reconsider the ban on publishing women ’s pictures .
“ We have always done things according to the Torah , ” said the editor , who declined to be named .
“ This is the way it was since the beginning of the world , and the way it shall remain . ”

Dear Visitor ,
I gotta warn you !
Before you click through my large collection of photos , you should not forget , what you hear and read daily in of your home countrys 's media about China 's boom .
They talk about " The Sleeping Giant " .
About " The Birth of the New Super Power " or " The Awakening of the Red Dragon " .
Often with a strange kind of undertone , which is supposed to frighten us .
The reality definitely looks more peaceful .
For years I 've been fascinated by the country and the people .
Whenever I linger through the boom town Shanghai , I carry my snap shot camera with me .
Because at every corner you can discover people that either are napping in the strangest positions and situations , or are even snoring , while in a deep sleep .
The missing mattresses and pillows are noteworthy !
The calmness , the flexibility and the adaptability of those , who are jointly responsible for the revival of China fascinate me .
I would be happy , if I could bring over some of these feelings to you .
Now , enjoy a selection from my collection of over 700 photos SLEEPINGCHINESE .
Yours ,

Introduction
HyperText Markup Language ( HTML ) was not originally designed to create web applications .
HTML has a limited set of interface controls , and is based around a sequential client server communication model .
Web application developers have gotten around these limitations by creating their own custom components ( widgets ) , using JavaScript to add behaviour to the widgets .
Unfortunately , the techniques used to overcome these limitations have not been accessible .
Although custom widgets might look and behave like regular desktop application widgets , such as a tree view widget , the role ( what the widget does ) , state ( its unique configuration , such as checked ) , and other important properties are not available to assistive technologies , such as screen readers .
This is the same as styling plain text to look like a heading , rather than using a heading element — the plain text looks like a heading , but is n’t revealed as a heading to assistive technology .
Updates are often missed by people using assistive technology .
Assistive technologies usually expect web content to change in response to a navigate event , such as following a link or submitting a form .
Web applications use techniques , such as AJAX , to update content silently in the background , which is sometimes missed by assistive technology .
Even if assistive technology is aware of updates , the user still might not be aware that the content has been updated , or how to locate the updated content .
WAI - ARIA is a specification that provides a means of describing roles , states , and properties for custom widgets so that they are recognisable and usable by assistive technology users .
WAI - ARIA also provides a mechanism to ensure that users of assistive technologies are aware of updates in the application .
A Brief History of HTML
HTML was originally designed to be a hypertext system for structuring and sharing linked documents .
Early HTML drafts defined tags , such as headings , paragraphs , lists , and anchors , to add structure to text - based documents .
The first proposal for an HTML specification by the IETF also included the img element to allow graphics to be displayed inline .
The first formal HTML specification was HTML 2 , based on the early HTML drafts .
This specification introduced forms , and defined a small set of interface components to create edit boxes , buttons , checkboxes , radio buttons , and dropdown lists .
The small set of interface components defined in HTML 2 has hardly changed compared with the set we currently use with HTML 4.01 .
The communication model for HTML is based on the client server model .
In the client server model , the client sends requests and can receive replies ; the server listens for requests , processes the request on the server , and sends replies back to the client .
As HTML did not have a behaviour layer , communication was intended to be sequential — the client requests a page from the server ; the server processes the request and sends a page to the client .
Web Applications
Web applications try to emulate regular desktop applications , except web applications run inside another regular desktop application — a browser .
There are also two fundamental differences between HTML and its communication model , and a regular desktop application :
Regular desktop applications have a behaviour layer that is not dependent on requests to a server .
Regular desktop applications have a far richer set of interface components .
Emulating Regular Desktop Applications
Background Server Requests
In order to emulate regular desktop applications , web applications use JavaScript to add behaviour .
For example , JavaScript might be used to allow a menu item to expand and collapse when the user interacts with it .
Occasionally , data may be required from the server .
For example , the application may have to fetch records from a database on the server to update information on the current page .
When the application has to interact with the server , web applications use techniques such as AJAX or hidden IFrame elements to communicate with the server silently in the background .
Emulating Rich Components
As HTML has very few interface components , web applications sometimes need to create more complex widgets , such as a tri-state checkbox or a slider control .
The look and feel of these widgets is usually created by drawing the widget as a graphic , and adding scripting to make them behave like the native component .
Figure 1 — A dialog with a tri-state checkbox .
Figure 2 — A slider widget that might be used to indicate the quality of a service .
Accessibility Problems with Look and Feel Emulation
Visually , emulating rich components and making server requests in the background creates a richer experience for users .
Unfortunately , this results in accessibility problems that are particularly bad for users of assistive technologies , such as screen reader users .
Widgets built this way are rarely keyboard accessible .
The role of the widget , what it does , is not available to assistive technology .
States and properties of the widget are not available to assistive technology .
Updates , and discovery of the updates are not reported to assistive technology .
WAI - ARIA to the Rescue
Fortunately , all of the problems outlined above are solved by the Web Accessibility Initiative ’s Accessible Rich Internet Applications ( WAI - ARIA ) specification ( shortened to ARIA for the rest of this article ) .
ARIA is a positive , enabling technology — rather than telling developers what they cannot do , ARIA allows developers to create rich web applications .
ARIA is also very easy to implement .
Keyboard Navigation
Along with providing alternative text for non-text objects , being able to interact with interface elements using the keyboard alone is one of the most basic accessibility provisions .
Developers who understand accessibility might build custom widgets using components that can receive focus , such as the input element with a type attribute value of image ( < input type = " image " ...> ) .
Unfortunately , most widgets are not built using components that are keyboard accessible , but instead use elements such as the img element , or may consist of composite elements that need to be in a container element , such as a div , which is unable to receive keyboard focus .
HTML 4 introduced the tabindex attribute for the a , area , button , input , object , select , and textarea elements .
The tabindex attribute from HTML 4 accepts a positive value between 0 and 32767 .
Navigation starts at the elements with the lowest number , and proceeds to the element with the highest number .
Elements with a value of 0 are visited in the order they appear in the markup .
If markup has a logical structure , the tabindex attribute is n’t required for interface elements that are already in the keyboard tab order .
ARIA extends the tabindex attribute so that it can be used on all visible elements .
ARIA also allows a negative value to be specified for elements that should not appear in the keyboard tab order , but can be programmatically focused ( give focus to an element with scripting ) .
As the actual value of the negative number is unimportant ( the element never receives keyboard focus ) , the value - 1 is typically used for elements that should not be included in the tab order , but might need to be able to receive programmatic focus .
For example , you could build a menu widget where the menu itself is in the tab order and receives focus by tabbing to it , but the menu items are not in the keyboard tab order .
Instead , the menu items could be programmed so they can be navigated using cursor keys .
This way , users do not have to tab through all items in the menu , and can better navigate the document .
This is true for all widgets that have a series of components that need keyboard access , such as a tree .
Adding to the Natural Tab Order
The following example uses a tabindex attribute value of 0 to put a div element into the tab order so that a keyboard user can navigate to the element .
< div tabindex= " 0 " > ... </div>
Negative tabindex
The following example uses a negative tabindex attribute value , so that the element can receive programmatic focus .
< div id =" progaccess " tabindex= " - 1 " > ... </div >
In this example , the div element is not placed in the tab order , but having a tabindex attribute value of - 1 means that it can receive programmatic focus .
The following snippet of JavaScript selects the element defined above , and uses the focus method to place focus on the element .
var objDiv = document.getElementById(' progaccess ' ) ; // Focus on the element objDiv.focus ( ) ;
What am I ?
ARIA introduces the role attribute to help define widgets , such as a slider , and define page structure , such as a navigation section .
One of the major problems with web applications is that any element can be used to make a widget .
HTML elements already have pre-defined roles .
The role of an element is what it does - the part it plays in the structure .
For example , the role of a heading is well understood by assistive technology .
When widgets are built with existing elements , the role of the element is what is revealed to assistive technology , rather than what it visually represents in the widget .
For example , if the thumb for a slider control is created using an image element with appropriate alternative text , then a screen reader will likely announce the control as , " Graphic , thumb " , as opposed to something more meaningful , such as " slider , value 16 percent " .
Figure 3 — The thumb on a typical slider control .
The role given by the role attribute trumps the role of the native element .
In the following example , an input element has a role attribute of slider ( we will look at some of the other ARIA properties later in this article ) — the role exposed to assistive technology is slider , rather than input .
< input type = " image " src=" thumb.gif " alt = " Effectiveness " role = " slider " aria - valuemin= " 0 " aria - valuemax = " 100 " aria - valuenow = " 42 " aria - valuetext = " 42 percent " aria - labelledby =" leffective " >
When this element receives focus , a screen reader user understands the role this widget plays .
The ARIA specification maintains a list of roles .
Document Landmark Roles
As well as roles to help define widgets , there are roles that can help define the structure of the document .
Document landmarks are a subset of regular roles that help screen reader users understand the role of a section and help orientate themselves within the document .
Figure 4 — A typical page with a header , sidebar and main content area .
ARIA defines the following document landmark roles .
article Content that makes sense in its own right , such as a complete blog post , a comment on a blog , a post in a forum , and so on .
banner Site - orientated content , such as the title of the page and the logo .
complementary Supporting content for the main content , but meaningful in its own right when separated from the main content .
For example , the weather listed on a portal .
contentinfo Child content , such as footnotes , copyrights , links to privacy statement , links to preferences , and so on .
main Content that is directly related to or expands on the central content of the document .
navigation Content that contains the links to navigate this document and / or related documents .
search
This section contains a search form to search the site .
The following example specifies the landmark roles of banner , navigation , and main to create the page structure shown in Figure 4 .
< div role = " banner " > ... </div> < div role=" navigation " > ... </div> < div role = " main " > ... </div>
ARIA States and Properties
ARIA states and properties allow further information about the widget to be provided to assistive technology to help the user understand how to interact with the widget .
The state identifies a unique configuration of information for an object .
For example , the aria - checked property has three state values ; true , false , and mixed .
In the slider example above , we included various aria - properties , shown below , that helped describe the widget to assistive technology .
aria - valuemin
Stores the lowest value a range may have .
aria -valuemax
Stores the highest value a range may have .
aria - valuenow
Stores the current value in a range .
aria - valuetext Stores readable text to help the user understand the context .
For example , " 30 dollars " .
aria -labelledby
Stores the id attribute of a text label containing an appropriate prompt for this widget .
Some properties might be updated through scripting .
For example , the aria - valuenow and aria - valuetext properties of our slider widget would be updated when the thumb is moved .
//
Set the ARIA property values when the thumb is // moved on the slider objThumb.setAttribute('aria - valuenow ' , iValue ) ; objThumb.setAttribute(' aria - valuetext ' , iValue + ' %' ) ;
Adding ARIA roles and attributes will not validate with HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0 , but that ’s okay , as ARIA is adding important information to specifications that were written a long time ago .
Work is underway defining a DTD that can be used with modular XML , such as XHTML 1.1 .
There is a full list of states and properties to help define accessible widgets in the ARIA specification .
Live Regions
Live regions allow elements in the document to be announced if there are changes , without the user losing focus on their current activity .
This means users can be informed of updates without losing their place within the content .
For example , a chat application could announce the response from the person the user is chatting with , without moving focus away from the text entry field to add a line of chat .
aria-live
The discoverability of updated content is one of the biggest obstacles for screen reader users .
ARIA provides an aria - live property that has a value indicating the verbosity level for the region .
The following are the verbosity values that can be used with the aria - live property .
off
This is the default value , and indicates that the region is not live .
< ul aria - live = " off " > polite
This is normal operation and the expected behaviour for live regions .
A value of polite indicates that it is not necessary to respond until user completes their current activity .
< ul aria - live = " polite " > assertive
This value is a higher priority than normal but does not necessarily interrupt the user immediately .
< ul aria - live = " assertive " >
There are some other important properties that can be used when defining live regions , summarised below .
The aria-atomic Property
The aria -atomic property is an optional property of live regions that can have the values true or false ( the default if this property is not specified ) .
When the region is updated , the aria-atomic property is used to indicate if assistive technology should present all or part of the changed region to the user .
If this property is set to true , assistive technology should present the entire region as a whole ; otherwise , the part of the region that changed might be announced on its own .
In the following example , all elements within the unordered list will be announced in their entirety when the region is spoken , unless another element further down the chain overrides the aria-atomic property .
< ul aria -atomic = " true " aria - live = " polite " >
The aria - busy Property
The aria - busy property is an optional property of live regions that can have the values true or false ( the default if this property is not specified ) .
If multiple parts of a live region need to be loaded before changes are announced to the user , the aria - busy property can be set to true until the final part is loaded , and then set to false when the updates are complete .
This property prevents assistive technologies announcing changes before the updates are complete .
< ul aria - atomic = " true " aria - busy =" true " aria - live = " polite " >
The aria - relevant Property
The aria - relevant property is an optional property of live regions that indicates what changes are considered relevant within a region .
The aria - relevant property accepts a space separated list of the following property values :
additions Nodes are added to the DOM within the region .
removals Nodes are removed from the DOM within the region .
text
Text is added or removed from the DOM .
all
All of the above ( additions , removals , text ) apply to this region .
In the absence of an explicit aria - relevant property , the default is to assume there are text changes and additions ( aria - relevant = " text additions " ) .
The following example would only announce changes if nodes are added to the DOM within the region .
If there are text changes , or nodes are removed within the region , the user will not be notified .
< ul aria - relevant = " additions " aria -atomic = " true " aria - live = " polite " >
When can ARIA be used ?
There are no negative side - effects from using ARIA , so you can start using it right away .
All four of the major browsers have implemented support for ARIA , or have plans to implement support for ARIA .
Opera 9.5 and Firefox 1.5 + already include support for ARIA .
Internet Explorer 8 Beta has ARIA support , and WebKit , the open source application framework behind Safari , have announced that they have started to add support for ARIA .
ARIA is also becoming widely supported by assistive technology .
JAWS 7.1+ , Window - Eyes 5.5+ , NVDA , Zoomtext 9 + , and others , have basic support for ARIA , and the situation is set to improve .
Be an early adopter
As there are no negative side - effects from using ARIA , and support is already in place , there is nothing to lose by becoming an early adopter , but plenty to gain .
Even if you have the simplest of websites , you could include document landmark roles to help users better navigate , and orientate themselves within the content .
Use document landmark roles
On my personal website , I have included document landmark roles for main , navigation , search , and secondary .
Consider the following document structure .
< div id =" ads " > ... </ div> < div id =" nav " > < form id =" searchform " ...> ... </ form > ... </div> < div id =" content " > ... </div>
We could write the role attribute for our document landmarks directly into the markup .
< div id =" ads " role = " banner " > ... </ div > < div id =" nav " role = " navigation " > < form id =" searchform " role = " search " ...> ... </ form > ... </div> < div id =" content " role = " main " > ... </div >
Alternatively , as most pages are structured so they can be styled with CSS , it is likely that the page will be structured with id attributes that could be passed to a JavaScript function .
The following is an example of a simple JavaScript function that accepts the id attribute of an element , and a role value , and sets the role attribute on the corresponding element .
function addARIARole( strID , strRole ) { //
Find the element to add a role property to var objElement = document.getElementById( strID ) ; if ( objElement ) { //
Add the role property to the element objElement.setAttribute ( ' role ' , strRole ) ; } }
The function can then be called with the id of the section , and the document landmark role for the section .
So considering the document structure above , we could use this JavaScript function to insert the role attribute , rather than write it into the markup .
function setupARIA ( ) { //
Add ARIA roles to the document addARIARole ( ' content ' , ' main ' ) ; addARIARole ( ' nav ' , ' navigation ' ) ; addARIARole ( ' searchform ' , ' search ' ) ; addARIARole ( 'ads ' , ' banner ' ) ; } window.onload = setupARIA ;
Indicate required fields
If you have forms containing required fields , you can make use of the aria - required property .
The aria - required property indicates that user input is required on the control before the form may be submitted .
The following example adds the aria - required property to a regular input element .
< label for=" contactname " > Name </ label > < input type =" text " id=" contactname " name= " contactname " size = " 30 " aria - required =" true " >
Wordpress have started to use the aria - required attribute for required fields in the comments section for blog entries .
Add other relevant properties
There are many ARIA properties that can be used on the simplest of websites , such as aria - labelledby and aria - describedby .
The aria - labelledby property points to one or more elements that are considered the label for an element , and the aria - describedby property points to one or elements that are considered the description for an element .
< h2 id =" limg " > Paragliding </ h2 > < p id =" dimg " >
A long description of our paragliding trip ... </p> < div> < img src=" takeoff.png " alt =" Getting ready to take off " aria - labelledby = " limg " aria - describedby = " dimg " >
</div >
Precedence of markup
ARIA markup takes precedence over the host language markup .
This means that if aria - labelledby is used alongside label for= " " , aria - labelledby will take precedence .
The label element is still encouraged for older browsers that do not understand ARIA .
A simple technique to avoid clashes is to use the aria - labelledby attribute to reference a label — this ensures the label is available , regardless of ARIA support .
< label id =" lblef " for = " effectiveness " >
Effectiveness </ label > < input type =" image " role = " slider " id =" effectiveness " aria - labelledby = " lblef " ...>
Look through the full list of states and properties to see how ARIA can help you ensure your content is more accessible .
All together now
HTML was not originally designed to create web applications , but developers have created them by drawing their own custom widgets , and adding behaviour with JavaScript .
The problem is that the role , state , and properties of widgets and updated content on these pages are not conveyed correctly to assistive technologies .
The ARIA specification solves these problems by allowing developers to describe widgets in detail , define document structure , and define regions of the page that will change .
Whether you are developing full - blown web applications with complex widgets and live sections , or whether you have the simplest of websites , you can start to use ARIA now to benefit users with disabilities .

helper testing using ActionView : : TestCase
Testing testing testing .
We test our models , our controllers , and the integration between them .
But how often do we pay attention to helpers ?
Not very often , if the test coverage of my current project ’s helpers is any indicator .
There are a few tools out there for testing your controllers .
There ’s a plugin called helper_test .
ZenTest also provides Test :: Rails :: HelperTestCase .
There ’s an even better way , and it ’s included with Rails itself since at least 2.1 : ActionView : : TestCase .
The name might be misleading , but it ’s intended for testing view helpers .
It also is a kind of underdocumented .
You can skip ahead to the summary if you want the dirty details .
Your very first helper test
The Rails test layout does n’t have an obvious place to put helper tests .
I ’ll take a cue from helper_test , and say to put them in test / unit / helpers .
That way , they will be run by rake test : units .
The skeleton test
Let ’s start out with testing ApplicationController , in test / unit / helper/application_helper_test.rb :
require File .
dirname ( __FILE__ ) + '/../../test_helper ' require ' action_view/test_case ' class ApplicationHelperTest < ActionView :: TestCase def test_nothing assert true end end
Some notes :
We do a typical require of test / test_helper.rb
I ’m requiring ‘ action_view / test_case ’ , because without it , we see an error like uninitialized constant ActionView : : TestCase ( NameError ) .
I feel like ActiveSupport should find this automatically , but it is n’t .
You can also toss this in test / test_helper.rb .
.
I feel like ActiveSupport should find this automatically , but it is n’t .
You can also toss this in .
Inherit ActionView :: TestCase
Placeholder test
What to test
I want to add a helper for displaying a navigation tab .
It will just go to index of a controller you specify .
The link should have the ‘ current ’ class if you ’re rendering from controller you are making a tab for .
Based on that , we have two contexts to test :
Making a tab for the current controller
Making a tab for another controller
Test it first
You ’d always be using the helper from a specific controller , so we ’ll have a parent context of being in a controller , like EventsController .
Now that we have some context , and some specifications , let ’s translate this into a Shoulda ’s terminology .
context " creating a tab for ' events ' " do setup do @tab = tab_for ( ' events ' ) end should " list item with a link to events with ' current ' class " do assert_dom_equal ' < li > < a href= " / events " class= " current " >
Events</a></li >' , @tab end end context " creating a tab for ' projects ' " do setup do @tab = tab_for ( ' projects ' ) end should " list item with a link to projects without ' current ' class " do assert_dom_equal ' < li > < a href= " / projects " >
Projects </a></li >' , @tab end end
The parent context does n’t do anything yet , because we do n’t know any implementation details about how it ’s going to determine the current controller .
assert_dom_equal , as the name implies , checks that the DOM of the given strings are equivalent .
Presumably , this takes care of whitespace , casing , etc .
Let ’s run it the first time …
RED , because we do n’t have any implementation .
First pass at implementing it
Let ’s try a first implementation :
module ApplicationHelper def tab_for ( name ) url = send ( " #{ name . downcase } _path " ) content_tag : li do link_to ( name .
capitalize , url ) end end end
Briefly put :
We ’re generate a url .
This presumes that the there ’s a path defined like events_path , as if by map .
resource :events .
, as if by .
Make a < li >
Make a link to the URL we just generated
Let ’s see how this fares … some GREEN , but still RED .
Creating a tab for another controller passes , but creating a tab for the current controller fails .
That ’s because we never determine if we ’re on on the current controller .
How are we going to do that ?
Here ’s some fun facts towards enlightenment :
Helpers are include d in the view .
d in the view .
The view exposes controller , which is the rendering controller
, which is the rendering controller ActionController : : Base exposes controller_name , which has a stringified name of the controller , ie ‘ events ’ for EventsController .
I want to check the value of controller .controller_name .
We can stub controller to return an actual EventsController using mocha :
context " When on the events controller " do setup do self .
stubs ( : controller ) . returns ( EventsController . new ) end # ... end
And … we have the same failures .
No wonder , because we did n’t change the implementation .
Now to give it another try :
def tab_for ( name ) url = send ( " #{ name . downcase } _path " ) content_tag : li do attributes = {} attributes [ : class ] = ' current ' if controller .
controller_name == name link_to ( name .
capitalize , url , attributes ) end end
Wait for it , wait for it …
GREEN !
Summary
I believe that wraps things up .
Let ’s just do a quick recap :
Stash tests in test / unit / helpers
Name your tests like your helper , ie ApplicationHelperTest for ApplicationHelper
for Inherit from ActionView :: TestCase
require ' action_view/test_helper ' somewhere , probably in test / test_helper.rb
somewhere , probably in Your helper will be include d into your test , so you can just use its methods
d into your test , so you can just use its methods
If you need to touch stuff that would normally be included in the view , stub it out
Use assert_dom_equals to test the output .
Alternative , you might use assert_equal or assert_match
Gotchas
This should be a vendor 's first rule when inviting 1,200 IT pros to a seminar about securing data and protecting personal information :
Make sure you protect the personal information of the 1,200 professionals you 're trying to impress .
How did Verizon do in that regard on Tuesday ?
They failed miserably ... and not just once .
David Williams , technology coordinator for a Texas school district , alerted me to the situation because he had read my recent post -- " Run-amok Verizon robo - caller torments 1,400 customers " -- which recounted the nine phone calls in 24 hours that were received at my house last month .
" I had something similar occur today , " Williams writes .
" In a period of three hours I received 14 e-mails promoting Verizon 's ' Secure the Information .
Secure the Infrastructure ' webinar series , and three e-mails promoting their ' 2008 Data Breach Investigations Report Road Show . ' "
The excessive volume of e-mail was n't the half of it , though .
" Considering their content ( about data - breach seminars ) , I thought it very humorous that the TO : field of the e-mails contained over 1,200 e-mail addresses : 17 e-mails times 1,200 addresses equals more than 20,000 chances for leaks . "
Williams did more than merely chuckle , though , he tried to be helpful by forwarding to the Verizon sender a pair of links -- " Sins of The Internet : Not Using Bcc , " and , " Use BCC field when addressing mass mail . "
Wrote the miscreant in reply : " I apologize for the inconvenience and lapse in judgment by not using the BCC field . "
Contrition , however , failed to stem the flow of seminar invitations into Williams ' inbox .
" You 've got to be kidding , " he wrote to the Verizon guy shortly thereafter .
" I have received seven more duplicates after this response . "
Verizon again : " We ( are ) having issues with our ( Microsoft ) Exchange server and I am working with our help desk to correct the problem .
I apologize for the inconvenience . "
Verizon 's " Secure the Information " lecture series includes a segment called , " Are you prepared for data loss ? "
I presume that 's where they 'll be covering the art of the apology .
This began as many of these pages do in another discussion group I belong to ; in this case with a discussion of the 2000 American Sociology Association convention .
One of the speakers was Ralph Nader .
He was perhaps the least political of those invited ; it was clear that sociology is not a scientific discipline in the same sense as any other .
A number of academics joined in chorus to say that the simples thing to do with sociology was to abolish it : it has no place in the modern university .
Others pointed out that it has a perfectly good place , as a sinkhole for students unable to get an education elsewhere : for those who can't even manage to get a degree in the Department of Education there is always sociology , which has no content , and which will pretty well guarantee you a degree with decent grades in exchange for your learning the proper politically correct attitudes .
Then the following was posted .
I print it here by permission of the author : WHAT TO DO ABOUT SOCIOLOGY Hi-- Far be it from me to suggest the abolition of sociology departments .
After all , I 'm the chairman of one .
But even a chairman would need an inhuman capacity for denial to fail to see that :
1 . The overwhelming amount of current sociology is simply nonsense -- tendentious nonsense at that .
2 . Nearly all of the sociology that is not tendentious nonsense is so obvious that one wonders why anyone would see the need to demonstrate it .
3 . " 1 " and " 2 " are the result of the false analogy of sociology to the physical and natural sciences .
In the physical and natural sciences there is an enormous amount of work that can be done by the " average " physicist , chemist .
biologist , etc .
This is not true in sociology .
The reasons are many .
Just a few of these : people - in - general do n't spend there time observing that which is observed by the physicist , chemist , biologist .
etc. People _do_ , minute by minute , observe social interaction and the like .
And people are , by and large , wonderful observers and do n't need sociologists ' help in observing what they observe .
( I hasten to add that I am _not_ distinguishing sociology from the sciences mentioned in the logic that must guide its analyses .
Logic is logic , and attempts to excuse sociology from logic 's requirements on the grounds of some putative " different logic " are wrong - headed to the point of idiocy .
To be sure , sociology faces practical problems far less difficult in the physical and natural sciences : self - fulfilling prophesy , the impossibility of getting people to act as one would like for experimental purity , a seemingly infinite - dimensional manifold of variables , etc .
But these do not in any way qualitatively differentiate sociology from the physical and natural sciences . )
4 . People may often be wrong in their assumption about the _causes_ of what they observe .
But analysis of such causes would be beyond the means of most sociologists even if the sociologists were not blinded by ideology .
5 . Thus , one would be hard put to deny the desirability of replacing sociology departments as they are now constituted with a small department of social theory that taught the great social theorists and , perhaps , an introductory course in sociology .
( Such a course _can_ be marvelous , though it rarely is .
It 's justification is that there is value in observing life from a sociological viewpoint .
Just as one cannot understand the concept of " team " from an atomistic study of individuals -- even though this may be possible in principle -- one cannot begin to understand society if one does n't have some idea of the meaning of social norms , stratification , cross-cultural universals , etc. )
Other than this , sociology courses should be devoted to important thinkers about society : Plato , Vico , Smith , Marx , and the like .
While , of course , such thinkers ' analyses would be assessed in terms of logic , plausibility , concordance with observation , and the like , one would n't expect the possibility of the sort of " varification " required in the physical and natural sciences .
6 . The irony of all this is that sociology so construed _would_ be critical of society and would expose rationalizations implicit in all value systems .
It would do so because it would -- like the physical and natural sciences at their best -- be the opposite of tendentious and would be biased by neither accepted social beliefs or ideological ones .
7 . I am now holding my breath until the changes I suggest are made .
So it 's just possible that you may not be hearing from me for ... , um , ever .
Best , Steve ( Goldberg ) Steven Goldberg Chairman , Department of Sociology City College , City University of New York I find it hard to fault that .
I would add a few more names , like Vilfredo Pareto and Machiavelli to the list , and perhaps I would , like Plato inscribe above the door " No admission here without mathematics , " but those are fine points ; the goal is clearly right .
You will note that Dr. Goldberg is at what was at one time one of the finest undergraduate institutions in the world .
Dr. Goldberg has also said : Bad as is any attempt to substitute political agenda for empirical curiosity , at least the political Marxists of the thirties accepted the necessity of logic and plausibility in their analyses .
They may have based their work on assumptions incongruent with the reality of human nature , but they did attempt to defend the analyses based on them .
Today there is no spirit whatsoever of a need for rigor or even common sense .
Agreement is more akin to the beliefs that bind the members of a religion , though religion ( to a great extent ) has the sense to merely believe the untestible .
Sociologists believe the refutable and already refuted .
When I was in grad school , sociology was criticized as demonstrating that which is obviously true .
Today it can be , and should be , criticized as " demonstrating " that which is obviously false .
Best , Steve ( Goldberg )
Which is a chilling thought .
But having made the diagnosis he also gave us the prescription .
The question is whether academia will listen .
One great way to briefly turn the conversation toward myself at a party is to answer the question , “ So , what do you do ? ” with , “ I ’m a writer . ”
Not that most of the people I ’ve met at parties have read my novels or short stories or feature articles ; when they ask , “ Have I seen any of your stuff ? ” I shrug and the conversation moves on .
If I want attention for an hour or so , however , I ’ll tell them my horrible secret — for several years I made much of my freelance income writing term papers .
I always wanted to be writer , but was told from an early age that such a dream was futile .
After all , nobody ever puts a classified ad in the paper that reads “ Writers Wanted . ”
Then , in the Village Voice , I saw just such an ad .
Writers wanted , to write short pieces on business , economics , and literature .
It was from a term paper mill , and they ran the ad at the beginning of each semester .
Writing model term papers is above - board and perfectly legal .
Thanks to the First Amendment , it ’s protected speech , right up there with neo -Nazi rallies , tobacco company press releases , and those “ 9/11 Was An Inside Job ” bumper stickers .
It ’s custom - made Cliff Notes .
Virtually any subject , almost any length , all levels of education — indulgent parents even buy papers for children too young for credit cards of their own .
You name it , I ’ve done it .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , the plurality of clients was business administration majors , but both elementary education majors and would - be social workers showed up aplenty .
Even the assignments for what in my college days were the obvious gut courses crossed my desk .
“ Race in The Matrix ” was a fashionable subject .
The term paper biz is managed by brokers who take financial risks by accepting credit card payments and psychological risks by actually talking to the clients .
Most of the customers just are n’t very bright .
One of my brokers would even mark assignments with the code words DUMB CLIENT .
That meant to use simple English ; nothing ’s worse than a client calling back to ask a broker — most of whom had no particular academic training — what certain words in the paper meant .
One time a client actually asked to talk to me personally and lamented that he just did n’t “ know a lot about Plah - toe . ”
Distance learning meant that he ’d never heard anyone say the name .
In broad strokes , there are three types of term paper clients .
DUMB CLIENTS predominate .
They should not be in college .
They must buy model papers simply because they do not understand what a term paper is , much less anything going on in their assignments .
I do n’t believe that most of them even handed the papers in as their own , as it would have been obvious that they did n’t write them .
Frequently I was asked to underline the thesis statement because locating it otherwise would have been too difficult .
But that sort of thing was just average for the bottom of the barrel student - client .
To really understand how low the standards are these days , we must lift up the barrel and see what squirms beneath .
One time , I got an e-mail from the broker with some last - minute instructions for a term paper —
“ I told her that it is up to the writer whether or not he includes this because it was sent to me at the last minute .
So if you can take a look at this , that is fine , if not I understand . ”
The last - minute addition was to produce a section called “ BODY OF PAPER ” ( capitals sic ) .
I was also asked to underline this section so that the client could identify it .
Of course , I underlined everything but the first and last paragraphs of the three - page paper .
The second type of client is the one - timer .
A chemistry major trapped in a poetry class thanks to the vagaries of schedule and distribution requirements , or worse , the poet trapped in a chemistry class .
These clients were generally lost and really did simply need a decent summary of their class readings —
I once boiled the 1000 - page New Testament Theology by Donald Guthrie into a 30 - page précis over the course of a weekend for a quick $ 600 .
Others are stuck on their personal statements for college applications , and turn to their parents , who then turn to a term paper mill .
One mother unashamedly summarized her boy and his goals like so : “ [ My son ] is a very kind hearted young man .
One who will make a difference in whatever he does .
Barely can go unnoticed because of his vivacious character , happiness , and joy in life .
He is very much in tune with his fortune and often helps the less fortunate . ”
The kid planned to be a pre-med major if accepted , but was applying to a competitive college as a Women ’s Studies major because Mother was “ told the chances of him getting into [ prominent college ] under less desirable subjects ( as opposed to Business ) was better . ”
Finally , she explained to me the family philosophy —
“ Since our family places great emphasis on education , [ boy ] fully accepts that the only guarantee for a good and stable future can be only achieved through outstanding education . ”
The third group is perhaps the most tragic :
They are well - educated professionals who simply lack English - language skills .
Often they come from the former Soviet Union , and in their home countries were engineers , medical professionals , and scientists .
In the United States , they drive cabs and have to pretend to care about “ Gothicism ” in “ A Rose For Emily ” for the sake of another degree .
For the most part , these clients actually send in their own papers and they get an edit from a native speaker .
Sometimes they even pinch - hit for the brokers , doing papers on graduate - level physics and nursing themselves .
Term paper writing was never good money , but it was certainly fast money .
For a freelancer , where any moment of slack time is unpaid time , term papers are just too tempting .
Need $ 100 by Friday to keep the lights on ?
No sweat .
Plenty of kids need 10 pages on Hamlet by Thursday .
Finals week is a gold mine .
More than once the phone rang at midnight and the broker had an assignment .
Six pages by 6 a.m. — the kid needs three hours to rewrite and hand in the paper by 9 or he wo n’t graduate .
“ Cool , ” I ’d say .
“ A hundred bucks a page . ”
I ’d get it , too , and when I did n’t get it , I slept well anyway .
Even DUMB CLIENTS could figure out that they ’d be better off spending $ 600 on the model paper instead of $ 2,500 to repeat a course .
Back in the days when a pulse and pay stub was sufficient to qualify for a mortgage , term papers — along with gigs for dot. com - era business magazines — helped me buy my first house .
Term paper work is also extremely easy , once you get the hang of it .
It ’s like an old dance routine buried in one ’s muscle memory .
You hear the tune — say , “ Unlike the ancient Greek tragic playwrights , Shakespeare likes to insert humor in his tragedies ” — and your body does the rest automatically .
I ’d just scan Google or databases like Questia.com for a few quotes from primary and secondary sources , create an argument based on whatever popped up from my search , write the introduction and underline the thesis statement , then fill in the empty spaces between quotes with whatever came to mind .
Getting the hang of it is tricky , though .
Over the years , several of my friends wanted in on the term paper racket , and most of them could n’t handle it .
They generally made the same fundamental error — they tried to write term papers .
In the paper mill biz , the paper is n’t important .
The deadline , page count , and number of sources are .
DUMB CLIENTS make up much of the trade .
They have no idea whether or not Ophelia committed suicide or was secretly offed by Gertrude , but they know how to count to seven if they ordered seven pages .
I had a girlfriend who had been an attorney and a journalist , and she wanted to try a paper .
I gave her a five - page job on leash laws in dog parks , and she came home that evening with over 50 pages of print outs , all articles and citations .
She sat down to write .
Three hours later she was rolling on the floor and crying .
She tried to write a paper , instead of filling five pages .
Another friend of mine spent hours trying to put together an eight - page paper on magical realism in Latin American fiction .
At midnight she declared that it was impossible to write that many pages on books she had never read .
She was still weeping , chain - smoking cigarettes , and shouting at me at 2 a .m.
I took 20 minutes and finished the paper , mostly by extending sentences until all the paragraphs ended with an orphaned word on a line of its own .
The secret to the gig is to amuse yourself .
I have to , really , as most paper topics are deadly boring .
Once , I was asked to summarize in three pages the causes of the First World War ( page one ) , the major battles and technological innovations of the war ( page two ) , and to explain the aftermath of the war , including how it led to the Second World War ( page three ) .
Then there was this assignment for a composition class : six pages on why “ apples [ the fruit ] are the best . ”
You have to make your own fun .
In business papers , I ’d often cite Marxist sources .
When given an open topic assignment on ethics , I ’d write on the ethics of buying term papers , and even include the broker ’s Web site as a source .
My own novels and short stories were the topic of many papers — several DUMB CLIENTS rate me as their favorite author and they ’ve never even read me , or anyone else .
Whenever papers needed to refer to a client ’s own life experiences , I ’d give the student various sexual hang - ups .
It ’s not that I never felt a little skeevy writing papers .
Mostly it was a game , and a way to subsidize my more interesting writing .
Also , I ’ve developed a few ideas of my own over the years .
I do n’t have the academic credentials of composition experts , but I doubt many experts spent most of a decade writing between one and five term papers a day on virtually every subject .
I know something they do n’t know ; I know why students do n’t understand thesis statements , argumentative writing , or proper citations .
It ’s because students have never read term papers .
Imagine trying to write a novel , for a grade , under a tight deadline , without ever having read a novel .
Instead , you meet once or twice a week with someone who is an expert in describing what novels are like .
Novels are long stories , you see , that depict a “ slice of life ” featuring a middle - class protagonist .
Psychological realism is prized in novels .
Moral instruction was once fairly common in novels , but is now considered gauche .
Novels end when the protagonist has an epiphany , such as “ I am not happy .
Also , neither is anybody else . ”
Further , many long fictions are called novels even though they are really adventures , and these ersatz novels may take place in a fantastical setting and often depict wild criminal behaviors and simplified versions of international intrigues instead of middle - class quandaries .
Sometimes there are pirates , but only so that a female character may swoon at their well - developed abdominal muscles .
That ’s a novel .
What are you waiting for ?
Start writing !
Underline your epiphany .
There ’s another reason I never felt too badly about the job , though I am pleased to be done with papers .
The students are n’t only cheating themselves .
They are being cheated by the schools that take tuition and give nothing in exchange .
Last year , I was hired to write two one - page summaries of two short stories .
Here are the client ’s instructions :
i need you to write me two different story in all these listed under .
The introduction of the story , the themes , topic and character , please not from internet , Or any posted web sites , because my professor will know if from internet this is the reason why i’ m spending money on it .
Not two much words , because i will still write it back in clsss go straight to the point and write me the conclution at end of the two story , the second story different introduction , themes , topic and character .
Thank you God Bless .
At the parties I go to , people start off laughing , but then they stop .

For decades , the panda has been an icon of the conservation movement , along with other majestic animals like the Siberian tiger , the mountain gorilla , the blue whale , and , most recently , the polar bear .
These conservation superstars have a few things in common :
They 're big , they 're mammals , and they 're pretty — earning them the label " charismatic megafauna .
" But they 're obviously not the only animals in danger of extinction .
About 22 percent of all mammals are listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , but the percentage is significantly higher for creepy , crawly , backbone - less invertebrates , which enrich the soil , filter water , recycle nutrients , pollinate plants , decompose animal carcasses and waste products , play a vital role in the food chain , and inspire biomimetic creations .
What are pandas good for ?
Why are invertebrates ( a group that includes the three most endangered groups of animals in the United States ) seemingly absent from conservation planning strategies , while the panda receives a great proportion of our efforts and our concern , not to mention tens of millions of dollars for captive breeding programs ?
The panda has been called " possibly one of the grossest wastes of conservation money in the last half century " by conservationist Chris Packham , president of Britain 's Bat Conservation Trust .
In fact , he insists that he " would eat the last panda " if the resources devoted to them could be transferred to " more sensible things . "
Save the Charismatic Megafauna !
At first glance , it may seem that the conservationists have let emotion win out over reason , ignoring the suffering of the masses ( and the vitality of the earth ) to save the cuddliest animals .
But a closer look reveals a different picture :
The charismatic megafauna may get all the glory , but they also bring in the bucks .
The conservation movement has been exploiting the panda 's earning power since the World Wildlife Fund — the most widely supported conservation organization in the world — made it their symbol in 1961 .
" Kids love them , parents love them , the Chinese government loves them , and yes , conservationists love them , " says Matt Durnin of The Nature Conservancy in China .
“ From a marketing perspective , they ’re a no-brainer . "
The panda 's ability to resonate so widely has earned it the role of " flagship species " for its natural habitat , the fertile Yangtze River Basin .
Flagship species act as representatives of a defined environmental cause ; they are selected for their ability to raise awareness and , more practically , money .
The idea is that support for the flagship species will also benefit the many other species that share the flagship animal ’s habitat but lack that sympathy - inspiring je ne sais quoi .
It may seem like bringing people 's attention to as many endangered species as possible would only help the cause .
But as psychology experiments have demonstrated over and over again , we 've evolved to act on our emotions , not logic .
A recent study showed that the general public was willing to give significantly more to save the charming Eurasian otter than to save the homely , but similarly threatened , watervole — and more for the otter alone than for the otter and the vole combined .
For the Yangtze Basin , the panda has proved an effective ambassador .
Because of panda - centered conservation , China — a country with an abysmal environmental record — is taking dramatic steps to protect their environment .
A logging ban has been in place for 10 years , former poachers now earn a living as trackers for panda tourists , and the local people are recognizing the value of the natural environment beyond its role as a source of meat and timber .
By preserving the panda 's forest home , conservationists hope to protect thousands of other species — including 100 mammals , 250 birds , thousands of insects — as well as the water supply for nearly 40 percent of China ’s people .
The Other 99.9 % of Life on Earth
But there is considerable debate concerning whether the use of flagship species as cash cows is the best way to reach broader conservation goals .
According to Durnin , flagship species work , but they ’re not perfect .
" Hypothetically , the strategy protects all inhabitants of the forest , but if the entire management plan is devoted to the panda , no one really pays attention to what happens to the other species .
The Siberian weasel might start disappearing , but it would be a while before anyone noticed . "
An alternative strategy for managing the environment — one favored by many academic conservation biologists — is to focus on preserving biodiversity and whole ecosystems , thereby protecting a substantially wider range of species .
Niles Eldredge , a curator in the Division of Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History , claims says that the current extinction rate — approximately three species every hour — reveals that we are , which puts us inthe middle of our planet 's sixth mass extinction .
( The fifth mass extinction , 65 million years ago , claimed the last dinosaurs as its most famous — and most charismatic — victims ) .
While the panda and its fellow charismatic megafauna are magnificent beasts , our preoccupation with them leaves little energy and concern for the greater biodiversity crisis .
But the general public 's participation and financial support are vital to the conservation movement , and it ’s difficult for the average member person to emotionally connect with the nebulous concept of biodiversity .
So the flagship species strategy may be our best option — for now .
But with the loss of species accelerated by a warming planet and a burgeoning human population , it 's unclear whether the panda 's earning power will be able to keep up .
Instead of using the panda to tug at heartstrings , perhaps conservationists should start a long - term project to tackle the greater problem — lack of funding , political and commercial indifference , and ignorance of the magnitude of the biodiversity crisis .

Imagine you ’re sitting in front of your computer , sweating and panicky .
No , the air conditioning is not broken .
And no , you did n’t forward an inappropriate e-mail to your boss .
Instead , you ’re in the final few minutes of bidding in an eBay auction .
As the clock ticks down , the tension mounts .
Will your last bid put you over the top ?
Can you defeat your opponents and claim the prize ?
Economists have known for years that people tend to overbid on items up for auction .
But experts did not know the reason behind our seemingly irrational behavior .
Economists and neuroscientists from New York University teamed up to study this classic economic problem , and they published their results Thursday in Science .
Using brain imaging along with carefully constructed games , the paper ’s authors discovered a “ fear of losing ” may lie behind our propensity to overbid .
Researchers began by giving 15 people opportunities to win money in auction and lottery games , each time competing against another person .
In the lottery games , participants decided whether to take part in different lottery rounds .
Auction competitors , on the other hand , chose their bid before each round .
During the games , scientists watched the responses of the subjects ' striata — the brain 's reward center — using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
The elation of winning was the same in both games , but the agony of defeat was crushing for losers of the auction .
After auction , brain activity in the loser 's reward centers decreased substantially .
But it hardly blipped when the person lost a lottery .
Decreased brain activity in losers of the auctions was also correlated with a propensity to overbid .
Intrigued , the studies authors constructed a series of games to further test the theory of fear - driven overbidding .
One was framed as a " bonus " game .
Participants started with no money , and the winner would receive 15 imaginary dollars .
The other game set players up for a " loss . "
Both players started with 15 imaginary dollars , and that amount would be deducted from the loser ’s coffers .
These two games had the same outcome–winners profited by the same amount — but the emphasis on each was different .
Not surprisingly , the bids in the " loss " game were consistently higher than in the " bonus " game , reinforcing the author ’s earlier hypothesis .
Scientists previously thought either risk aversion or the joy of winning drove overbidding , but the new study found the behavior was prompted by a " fear of losing . "
The results , the authors say , were not predicted by current economic theory .
Similar neuroscience studies , they added , may eventually help shape new advances in economic theory .

A feminist 's argument for McCain's VP
In the shadow of the blatant and truly stunning sexism launched against the Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential campaign , and as a pro-choice feminist , I was n't the only one thrilled to hear Republican John McCain announce Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate .
For the GOP , she bridges for conservatives and independents what I term " the enthusiasm gap " for the ticket .
For Democrats , she offers something even more compelling - a chance to vote for a someone who is her own woman , and who represents a party that , while we do n't agree on all the issues , at least respects women enough to take them seriously .
Whether we have a D , R or an " i for independent " after our names , women share a different life experience from men , and we bring that difference to the choices we make and the decisions we come to .
Having a woman in the White House , and not as The Spouse , is a change whose time has come , despite the fact that some Democratic Party leaders have decided otherwise .
But with the Palin nomination , maybe they 'll realize it 's not up to them any longer .
Clinton voters , in particular , have received a political wake - up call they never expected .
Having watched their candidate and their principles betrayed by the very people who are supposed to be the flame - holders for equal rights and fairness , they now look across the aisle and see a woman who represents everything the feminist movement claimed it stood for .
Women can have a family and a career .
We can be whatever we choose , on our own terms .
For some , that might mean shooting a moose .
For others , perhaps it 's about shooting a movie or shooting for a career as a teacher .
However diverse our passions , we will vote for a system that allows us to make the choices that best suit us .
It 's that simple .
The rank bullying of the Clinton candidacy during the primary season has the distinction of simply being the first revelation of how misogynistic the party has become .
The media led the assault , then the Obama campaign continued it .
Trailblazer Geraldine Ferraro , who was the first Democratic vice presidential candidate , was so taken aback by the attacks that she publicly decried nominee Barack Obama as " terribly sexist " and openly criticized party chairman Howard Dean for his remarkable silence on the obvious sexism .
Concerned feminists noted , among other thinly veiled sexist remarks during the campaign , Obama quipping , " I understand that Sen .
Clinton , periodically when she 's feeling down , launches attacks as a way of trying to boost her appeal , " and Democratic Rep .
Steve Cohen in a television interview comparing Clinton to a spurned lover - turned - stalker in the film , " Fatal Attraction , " noting , " Glenn Close should have stayed in that tub , and Sen. Clinton has had a remarkable career ... " .
These attitudes , and more , define the tenor of the party leadership , and sent a message to the grassroots and media that it was " Bros Before Hoes , " to quote a popular Obama - supporter T - shirt .
The campaign 's chauvinistic attitude was reflected in the even more condescending Democratic National Convention .
There , the Obama camp made it clear it thought a Super Special Women 's Night would be enough to quell the fervent support of the woman who had virtually tied him with votes and was on his heels with pledged delegates .
There was a lot of pandering and lip service to women 's rights , and evenings filled with anecdotes of how so many have been kept from achieving their dreams , or failed to be promoted , simply because they were women .
Clinton 's " 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling " were mentioned a heck of a lot .
More people began to wonder , though , how many cracks does it take to break the thing ?
Ironically , all this at an event that was negotiated and twisted at every turn in an astounding effort not to promote a woman .
Virtually moments after the GOP announcement of Palin for vice president , pundits on both sides of the aisle began to wonder if Clinton supporters - pro-choice women and gays to be specific - would be attracted to the McCain - Palin ticket .
The answer is , of course .
There is a point where all of our issues , including abortion rights , are made safer not only if the people we vote for agree with us - but when those people and our society embrace a respect for women and promote policies that increase our personal wealth , power and political influence .
Make no mistake - the Democratic Party and its nominee have created the powerhouse that is Sarah Palin , and the party 's increased attacks on her ( and even on her daughter ) reflect that panic .
The party has moved from taking the female vote for granted to outright contempt for women .
That 's why Palin represents the most serious conservative threat ever to the modern liberal claim on issues of cultural and social superiority .
Why ?
Because men and women who never before would have considered voting for a Republican have either decided , or are seriously considering , doing so .
They are deciding women 's rights must be more than a slogan and actually belong to every woman , not just the sort approved of by left - wing special interest groups .
Palin 's candidacy brings both figurative and literal feminist change .
The simple act of thinking outside the liberal box , which has insisted for generations that only liberals and Democrats can be trusted on issues of import to women , is the political equivalent of a nuclear explosion .
The idea of feminists willing to look to the right changes not only electoral politics , but will put more women in power at lightning speed as we move from being taken for granted to being pursued , nominated and appointed and ultimately , sworn in .
It should be no surprise that the Democratic response to the McCain - Palin ticket was to immediately attack by playing the liberal trump card that keeps Democrats in line - the abortion card - where the party daily tells restless feminists the other side is going to police their wombs .
The power of that accusation is interesting , coming from the Democrats - a group that just told the world that if you have ovaries , then you do n't count .
Yes , both McCain and Palin identify as anti-abortion , but neither has led a political life with that belief , or their other religious principles , as their signature issue .
Politicians act on their passions - the passion of McCain and Palin is reform .
In her time in office , Palin 's focus has not been to kick the gays and make abortion illegal ; it has been to kick the corrupt and make wasteful spending illegal .
The Republicans are now making direct appeals to Clinton supporters , knowingly crafting a political base that would include pro-choice voters .
On the day McCain announced her selection as his running mate , Palin thanked Clinton and Ferraro for blazing her trail .
A day later , Ferraro noted her shock at Palin 's comment .
You see , none of her peers , no one , had ever publicly thanked her in the 24 years since her historic run for the White House .
Ferraro has since refused to divulge for whom she 's voting .
Many more now are realizing that it does indeed take a woman - who happens to be a Republican named Sarah Palin .
Bush 's legacy may be at stake Will Bush become the new Hoover ?
President Bush has long assumed the outcome of the Iraq war would define his legacy .
But the catastrophic collapse of the housing bubble on his watch provides a new , perhaps more ominous , threat to how his stewardship will be ranked in history .
In a matter of weeks , an investment banking industry that survived the Civil War and the Great Depression virtually vanished from the scene , weighed down by faulty mortgages and other debts .

The Federal Reserve Board ’s role in the economy has been transformed in ways even economists say they ca n’t yet fully appreciate , save for one :
The government now has a dramatically bigger presence in the private market .
And the U.S. taxpayers are now likely to be put on the hook for hundreds of billions of dollars of faulty mortgages and already have become part - owners of a giant insurance house scheduled to be carved up and sold by the next administration .
“ Bush runs a real danger of going down as a Herbert Hoover in this scenario , ” said Beverly Gage , a presidential historian at Yale University .
“ He could be seen as the man held responsible for what is happening who stood by and did n’t forge a clear direction at a moment when a clear direction is what was needed . ”
Certainly , no president can control the course of history while in office .
Hoover was elected in a boom economy in 1928 that went bust a year later .
But it ’s those very moments of calamity and uncertainty that offer presidents an opportunity to show their true mettle .
Thus far , Bush has not received high marks for his management of the housing crisis , particularly since it appears that his Treasury secretary has been running the show for the last three weeks .
It ’s a sharp contrast to 2001 , when Bush ’s gravitas rose with his vigorous leadership after the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and Washington .
Among the most striking successes of his administration then was enabling the New York Stock Exchange to reopen in less than a week and send a signal that capitalism had n’t been beaten .
Bush used that fresh influx of political capital to launch the Iraq war even as U.S. troops were still hunting Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan .
But mismanagement , mistakes and the misinformation about the need to go to war sapped the administration of credibility .
That has left the White House to argue that historians must wait for the long - term look at post - war Iraq to truly assess the wisdom of his foreign policy and presidency .
Now , Bush ’s domestic policy will go under a microscope as well .
And , unlike in the foreign policy sphere , he was fully in control of his economic policies .
The sum of both is likely to be linked , says Gregory Hess , an economic expert at Claremont McKenna College .
Treasury ’s choice in recent days of which institutions to save and which to usher into bankruptcy showed a pattern :
Those organizations with the widest international impact were saved .
Why ?
Because the U.S. must rely on those foreign entities “ to continue to finance the U.S. deficit , ” which was run up to record levels in large measure because of the costs of the war in Iraq , said Hess .
Bob Bruner , business school dean at the University of Virginia , said the war deficits may also have reduced the number of options the government had to respond to the crisis .
“ Perhaps under other circumstances , government would have been more inclined toward a tough love attitude ” rather than a series of bailouts , said Bruner .
“ But , they could n’t chance it . ’
In perhaps a cruel twist of fate , the Dow Jones on Monday experienced its biggest decline since the day the New York Stock Exchange reopened after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
There are other ties between White House economic policy and the financial crisis .
One of the Bush administration ’s signature goals has been promoting an “ ownership society . ”
To achieve that end , the administration promoted a series of programs designed to encourage consumers to buy homes , stocks and other goods that would convert them into free market advocates .
The one - time plan to privatize Social Security benefits fit into that portfolio .
With the Fed holding down interest rates after the terrorist attacks , the housing market took off and investors became increasingly creative — and reckless — in finding ways to cash in on the boom .
In 2005 , subprime mortgages represented about 4 percentof the mortgage market .
A year later , they accounted for 26 percent of the market , said Robert Shapiro , a former Clinton economic adviser .
“ They knew the implications of this , the Fed and the Treasury , ” said Shapiro .
“ They saw what was happening to these securities . ”
Bush officials dispute that , arguing that the fast - moving transactions on Wall Street were difficult to assess since they were obtuse .
But the failure of the Bush administration to recognize the potential systemic risks in the rising home values and frantic selling seasons carries some ironies .
Bush took office from President Bill Clinton as the technology bubble was collapsing .
Now , he will depart amid the wreckage of the housing bubble .
This calamity is more politically damaging than the tech bust was to Clinton because “ this one hits much closer to the bone because it affects peoples ’ use of net wealth , ” said Hess .
“ We had a lot of new homeownership .
Now we have a lot of un-homeownership .
It makes it that much more personal and that much more biting than the Clinton challenge , ” he added .
The frantic effort by Treasury in recent weeks and months to contain the damage and stabilize the markets , has led to , as Bush said , “ extraordinary ” acts by the government .
It will take some time to sort out all of the ramifications of those acts , but it is clear that the next president will take over an economy transformed and changed in fundamental ways by Bush and his advisers .
The mortgage industry is likely to see new laws telling it how it can and cannot conduct business , a move that will insert government into the heart of the private market .
Financial institutions are certain to face a much tougher regulatory environment , which will mean higher business costs and bigger government — a striking result from an administration that came to power preaching the virtues of the free market and bent on diminishing the muscle of government regulators .
The distinctions between commercial and investment banks will end .
That ’s clear already as Merrill Lynch is absorbed by Bank of America and Morgan Stanley continues talks with Wachovia .
Barring congressional action , the Treasury secretary has gained enormous new powers , including the ability to essentially take over a private firm with only the slightest notice to the White House and Congress .
Economists will pour over those and other changes to assess the impact of the Bush presidency on the free market .
Historians will look at the practical implications of the crisis , too , but they will also examine the leadership exhibited by president .
In the head - spinning succession of frightening headlines , the administration ’s most public figures became Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke .
On Thursday , Bush made an unusual public appearance to offer brief remarks on the situation .
The American people “ are concerned ” about the situation , he said .
“ And I share their concerns . ”
But his comments seemed more notable for the assurance he chose not to give : that everything was going to be OK .
Bush made a second foray before the television lights on Friday , offering a more definitive and hopeful response .
He urged Congress to pass laws necessary for his administration to execute an enormous bailout of the financial industry .
It is one that will put the taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars in home loans and other debt .
It will also rid the New York financial houses of the rot and risk that their own investors seemed eager to accept not so long ago .
In the end , the taxpayer may come out ahead , as mortgages are reworked , home prices improve , and banks reopen their lending operations .
But , like the final outcome of the Iraq war , that wo n’t be evident by the time Bush leaves office and not , perhaps , for years to come .
In that sense , says historian Gage , Bush ’s management of the war and the economic may ultimately be linked “ in spirit , with each showing a certain recklessness , a lack of caution , and a rejection of the cautionary voices both within the administration and outside of it . ”
What 's the plan for Nov. 4 ?
Classes , work , a group meeting - oh , right , and voting for the next president .
Aaron Bacon , a 20 - year - old student at Emerson , says college students can get wrapped up in their everyday busy work , and voting may not be a priority .
That is why he , along with six friends , created a website , BeAbsentee.org , pushing absentee voting as the right way to vote .
Last spring , Bacon and his friends were talking about the upcoming election and about the reasons young people do n't go out to the polls as much in comparison with older people .
" So many times people register to vote , and Rock the Vote is good about registering people , but you can't expect them to show up at the polls .
It 's one day a year , and a narrow window of time for college students who still wake up at noon , " Bacon said .
After Google - searching about absentee voting , Bacon came to realize that the information was not readily accessible .
BeAbsentee.org has gathered all of the information needed and broken it down by state .
" We really push absentee voting .
Instead of telling people absentee voting is an alternative , we 're trying to tell them it's the way we all should be voting , " Bacon said .
" Through the website , we 're telling everyone , ' Here 's the form , fill it out , send it back . ' "
The website offers the top 10 reasons to vote absentee , including not having to stand in line , avoiding awkward conversations with neighbors , and the fact that it might rain on Election Day .
The website includes all the forms someone would need to be able to vote absentee in all 50 states and Washington , D.C.
This effort mainly targets young voters , especially the ones from swing states such as Florida and Ohio , which many times have a lower youth voting turnout than states like Minnesota .
" I think if this gets picked up in some of the battleground states , it would be very exciting for us , " Bacon said .
" I 'm interested to see if it 's going to make an impact , and if absentee voting will be big this year .
That 's what we 're going for . "

ST . PAUL ( Reuters ) - Can a woman governor who likes to hunt and opposes abortion rights woo enough American women to her side to help win the White House for John McCain ?
That is the question as first - term Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin prepares to accept the Republican Party ’s nomination on Wednesday as its first woman candidate for vice president .
Attractive to the Republican Party ’s conservative Christian base , Palin could help bring both men and women out to vote for McCain in the November 4 election .
Opinion polls show a tight race with Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama , who generally enjoys an advantage with women voters over McCain .
The women ’s vote in play falls into two categories : independent or undecided white women and those who supported Hillary Clinton in her failed and bitterly contested bid for the Democratic nomination .
Ideology -- especially on the divisive issue of abortion rights , which most U.S. women support -- would deter many Clinton supporters from voting Republican .
“ The vast majority of the women who supported Hillary Clinton are unlikely to find a strongly pro-life Republican woman to be an attractive alternative , ” said Scott Keeter , an analyst at the Pew Research Center .
Supporters of Republican U.S. vice presidential candidate Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin display their support at the 2008 Republican National Convention in St Paul , Minnesota September 1 , 2008 .

That point was echoed by former Clinton supporters interviewed outside the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minnesota , which runs through Thursday .
“ They are ideological opposites , ” said Kim Spotts , a 52 - year - old nurse , explaining why she supported Clinton but would not be swayed by Palin .
She said she would vote instead for Obama .
“ I would not vote for her ( Palin ) under any circumstance .
... I really dislike her strong , conservative religious views , ” said Clinton - turned - Obama supporter Barbara Patchen , a 47 - year - old homemaker , as she walked her dog in a park .
But at least two women Patchen knew were taking a look at the McCain ticket because of Palin , she said .
UNDECIDED
McCain ’s campaign hopes to win over undecided and independent women .
A Gallup daily tracking poll in August showed that among independent white registered voters , 51 percent of the men preferred McCain to 35 percent for Obama .
Among women , McCain ’s advantage narrowed to 42 percent to 41 percent .
“ McCain will hope to move some of these votes in his direction with Palin on the ticket , ” Keeter said , but he added that many women in this group also supported abortion rights and so could be turned off by Palin .
Analysts will be watching polls on this group and wider polls on women in weeks to come to see if they are being swayed by Palin .
“ For me it ’s more about the person and their stand on certain issues .
It ’s not about the gender , ” said 33 - year - old Amy Sawyer , a Minnesota account manager , who said she remained undecided but was taking a closer look at the McCain ticket because of Palin ’s inclusion .
Palin ’s personal narrative -- a working mother of five with an unmarried daughter facing a teenage pregnancy -- is also a compelling one for many U.S. women .
“ She ’s a superwoman to me .
I ’m a lawyer and I ’m working too , ” said 32 - year - old Teisha Powell , a Jamaican immigrant and Republican from Florida .
Oh , how quickly they forget .
While watching John McCain , and Sarah Palin decrying Obama for his “ socialist ” tendencies , I have found myself becoming increasingly amused .
One of the things that defined Sarah Palin ’s pre-VP candidate career in Alaska was the fact that nobody seemed to know what to make of her .
I refer you to my comments on this , back in the beginning of June , 2008 titled “ McCain ’s a Greenie .
Palin ’s a Socialist .
Hillary ’s the President . ”
I ’m holding my sides laughing about the Newsweek article that has Alaskan ’s all a - twitter , comparing Sarah Palin to Hugo Chavez .
Having claimed my staunch neutrality about Sarah Palin , I ’m enjoying standing in the middle of the swirling tornado that has become the Palin phenomenon and enjoying my popcorn .
Is she a crazy creationist wingnut ?
A big business - hating , free - gas - doling socialist ?
A maverick hockey mom ?
The next Vice President ?
No one seems to know .
Obviously to regular readers , my “ staunch neutrality ” about Palin has gone the way of the Steller ’s Sea Cow .
( For you non-Alaskans ; it ’s extinct ) .
I did not vote for Palin , but was willing to give her a shot .
I like to think I ’m open - minded .
So , knowing what I know , and all the recent “ socialist talk ” made me look up this old post , and I was amused .
I got my $ 1200 energy rebate check from Sarah Palin a couple weeks ago , and so did every other human being in Alaska .
This money , which came from the wealth of oil companies doing business in Alaska , got spread around by the Governor to help Alaskans defray the rising costs of energy that made the oil companies profitable enough to provide Alaska with the money for the rebate check that defrays the cost of energy …..( you get the circular idea ) .
At the Alaska Women Reject Palin rally here in Anchorage , a woman drove by as I was returning to my car .
She leaned out of her window and said , “ Are you going to get a $ 1200 check this year ? ”
“ You mean the rebate check ?
Yes , ” I said .
“ So how can you hate Sarah Palin ! ? ! ” she quipped , looking angry and smug at the same time .
“ Are you going to SPEND it ?? ? ” she spat .
I said the first thing that came to mind , “ Yes , I ’ll probably donate it to the Obama campaign . ”
She screeched away .
And I did n’t tell her the whole truth .
I ’ve actually spread my wealth around to lots of good progressive candidates , both in Alaska and outside .
It was an interesting exchange , though , and I ’ve thought about it many times .
I ’ve heard other people use this logic , although not quite as directly .
The basic question is “ How can you vote against someone who hands you cash ? ”
It ’s really very startling .
It presupposes not only that cash - in - hand is the ultimate goal we humans seek , but also that I am not making good on my end of this deal .
I ’ve been paid for my services , and now I ’m not willing to deliver .
Does this make anyone in Alaska who votes for Obama , a political prostitute who gets paid in advance , and then takes off with the cash without delivering the vote , thereby breaking some kind of implied , perverse , money - for - votes pact ?
To the woman in the red car , apparently it does .
I ’ve seen a few references in the mainstream media to Palin ’s socialist tendencies , which is good .
The fact that in a society that has public education , fire departments , public libraries , police service , Medicaire , and Social Security , it seems odd to be having the conversation at all .
But if Sarah Palin is going to use the term to cut down Barack Obama , she needs to be reminded that 12 weeks ago , she was being compared to Hugo Chavez by her own party , in her own state .
And anyone in Alaska who IS voting for Palin because of that $ 1200 for every man , woman and child in the state , needs to come to terms and make peace with their “ inner Socialist . ”
UNITED NATIONS  Mohamed ElBaradei , the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency , said in a speech on Monday that the number of reports of nuclear or radioactive material stolen around the world last year was “ disturbingly high . ”
Dr. ElBaradei , in his annual report to the General Assembly , said nearly 250 such thefts were reported in the year ending in June .
“ The possibility of terrorists obtaining nuclear or other radioactive material remains a grave threat , ” he said .
“ Equally troubling is the fact that much of this material is not subsequently recovered . ”
Members of Dr. ElBaradei ’s staff and outside experts cautioned that the amount of missing material remained relatively small .
If all the stolen material were lumped together , it would not be enough to build even one nuclear device , they said .
A top government scientist who helped the FBI analyze samples from the 2001 anthrax attacks has died in Maryland from an apparent suicide , just as the Justice Department was about to file criminal charges against him for the attacks , the Los Angeles Times has learned .
Bruce E. Ivins , 62 , who for the last 18 years worked at the government ’s elite biodefense research laboratories at Ft. Detrick , Md. , had been informed of his impending prosecution , said people familiar with Ivins , his suspicious death and the FBI investigation .
Ivins , whose name had not been disclosed publicly as a suspect in the case , played a central role in research to improve anthrax vaccines by preparing anthrax formulations used in experiments on animals .
Regarded as a skilled microbiologist , Ivins also helped the FBI analyze the powdery material recovered from one of the anthrax - tainted envelopes sent to a U.S. senator ’s office in Washington .

Ivins died Tuesday at Frederick Memorial Hospital after ingesting a massive dose of prescription Tylenol mixed with codeine , said a friend and colleague , who declined to be identified out of concern that he would be harassed by the FBI .
The death -- without any mention of suicide -- was announced to Ivins ’ colleagues at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases , or USAMRIID , through a staffwide e-mail .
“ People here are pretty shook up about it , ” said Caree Vander Linden , a spokeswoman for USAMRIID , who said she was not at liberty to discuss details surrounding the death .
The anthrax mailings killed five people , crippled national mail service , shut down a Senate office building and spread fear of further terrorism after the Sept. 11 attacks .

The extraordinary turn of events followed the government ’s payment in June of a settlement valued at $ 5.82 million to a former government scientist , Steven J. Hatfill , who was long targeted as the FBI ’s chief suspect despite a lack of any evidence that he had ever possessed anthrax .
The payout to Hatfill , a highly unusual development that all but exonerated him in the mailings , was an essential step to clear the way for prosecuting Ivins , according to lawyers familiar with the matter .
Federal investigators moved away from Hatfill -- for years the only publicly identified “ person of interest ” -- and ultimately concluded that Ivins was the culprit after FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III changed leadership of the investigation in late 2006 .
The FBI ’s new top investigators -- Vincent B. Lisi and Edward W. Montooth -- instructed agents to reexamine leads or potential suspects that may have received insufficient attention .
Moreover , significant progress was made in analyzing genetic properties of the anthrax powder recovered from letters addressed to two senators .
Advertisement
The renewed efforts led the FBI back to USAMRIID , where agents first questioned scientists in December 2001 , a few weeks after the fatal mailings .
By spring of this year , FBI agents were still contacting Ivins ’ present and former colleagues .
At USAMRIID and elsewhere , scientists acquainted with Ivins were asked to sign confidentiality agreements in order to prevent leaks of new investigative details .
Ivins , employed as a civilian at Ft. Detrick , earlier had attracted the attention of Army officials because of anthrax contaminations that Ivins failed to report for five months .
In sworn oral and written statements to an Army investigator , Ivins said that he had erred by keeping the episodes secret -- from December 2001 to late April 2002 .
He said he had swabbed and bleached more than 20 areas that he suspected were contaminated by a sloppy lab technician .
“ In retrospect , although my concern for biosafety was honest and my desire to refrain from crying ‘ Wolf ! ’ . . . was sincere , I should have notified my supervisor ahead of time of my worries about a possible breach in biocontainment , ” Ivins told the Army .
“ I thought that quietly and diligently cleaning the dirty desk area would both eliminate any possible [ anthrax ] contamination as well as prevent unintended anxiety at the institute . ”

The Army chose not to discipline Ivins regarding his failure to report the contamination .
Officials said that penalizing Ivins might discourage other employees from voluntarily reporting accidental spills of “ hot ” agents .
But Ivins ’ recollections should have raised serious questions about his veracity and his intentions , according to some of those familiar with the investigation .
For instance , although Ivins said that he swabbed areas near and within his personal office , and bleached surfaces to kill any spores , and that some of the swabs tested positive , he was vague about what should have been an essential next step :
Reswabbing to check whether any spores remained .
“ I honestly do not recall if follow - up swabs were taken of the area , ” Ivins said .
“ I may have done so , but I do not now remember reswabbing . ”
Advertisement
“ That ’s bull ---- , ” said one former senior USAMRIID official .
“ If there ’s contamination , you always reswab .
And you would remember doing it . ”
The former official told The Times that Ivins might have hedged regarding reswabbing out of fear that investigators would find more of the spores inside or near his office .
Ivins ’ statements were contained within a May 2002 Army report on the contamination at USAMRIID and was obtained by The Times under the Freedom of Information Act .
Soon after the government ’s settlement with Hatfill was announced June 27 , Ivins began showing signs of serious strain .

One of his longtime colleagues told The Times that Ivins , who was being treated for depression , indicated to a therapist that he was considering suicide .
Soon thereafter , family members and local police officers escorted Ivins from USAMRIID , where his access to sensitive areas was curtailed , the colleague said .
Ivins was committed to a facility in Frederick for treatment of his depression .
On July 24 , he was released from the facility , operated by Sheppard Pratt Health System .
A telephone call that same day by The Times verified that Ivins ’ government voice mail was still functioning at the bacteriology division of USAMRIID .
The scientist faced forced retirement , planned for September , said his longtime colleague , who described Ivins as emotionally fractured by the federal scrutiny .
Advertisement
“ He did n’t have any more money to spend on legal fees .
He was much more emotionally labile , in terms of sensitivity to things , than most scientists .
. . .
He was very thin -skinned . ”
FBI spokeswoman Debra J. Weierman said Thursday that the bureau would not comment on the death of Ivins .
Last week , FBI Director Mueller told CNN that “ in some sense , there have been breakthroughs ” in the case .
“ I ’ll tell you we made great progress in the investigation , ” Mueller added .
Advertisement
“ And it ’s in no way dormant . ”
Ivins , the son of a Princeton - educated pharmacist , was born and raised in Lebanon , Ohio , and received undergraduate and graduate degrees , including a doctorate in microbiology , from the University of Cincinnati .
The eldest of his two brothers , Thomas Ivins , said he was not surprised by the events that have unfolded .
“ He buckled under the pressure from the federal government , ” Thomas Ivins said , adding that FBI agents came to Ohio last year to question him about his brother .
Advertisement
“ I was questioned by the feds , and I sung like a canary ” about Bruce Ivins ’ personality and tendencies , Thomas Ivins said .
“ He had in his mind that he was omnipotent . ”
Ivins ’ widow declined to be interviewed when reached Thursday at her home in Frederick .
The couple raised twins , now 24 .
The family ’s home is 198 miles -- about a 3 1/2 - hour drive -- from a mailbox in Princeton , N.J. , where anthrax spores were found by investigators .

All of the recovered anthrax letters were postmarked in that vicinity .

The presidential campaign of Barack Obama engaged in a little bit of gamesmanship and expectation setting this morning ahead of tonight ’s second presidential debate .
Obama advisor said that they expect that McCain will launch his nastiest attacks yet , and lie about Obama ’s record .
The memo discussed McCain ’s desperation to change the subject away from the economy , “ John McCain is running out of time for a game - changing event .
In the latest sign of desperation , his campaign admitted just yesterday that if they “ keep talking about the economic crisis , they ’re going to lose . ”
It ’s our view that the American people are already worried about losing – their homes , their jobs and their health care – and it ’s up to the candidates at this debate to demonstrate who is best equipped to make sure that they can get ahead again . ”
The Obama camp brought up McCain ’s nasty attacks and the turn the page strategy , “ In order to change the dynamics of this race , we anticipate that McCain will launch his nastiest attacks and continue to lie about Barack Obama ’s record and his vision to fundamentally change our country .
We do n’t know if McCain will continue his refusal to even look at Obama on stage — like in their first debate — but we fully expect that his “ turn the page ” strategy to ignore the economy will be seen in full view for 90 minutes of character attacks against Barack Obama . ”
Advertisements
They also played the expectations game stressing that Obama is the underdog , and that this is McCain ’s favorite format , “ When it comes to sheer format , we enter today ’s debate the decided underdog .
John McCain does extremely well in town hall settings .
It ’s been his favorite format throughout his career and we think that he will of course do very well . ”
Here is what this memo is really saying , we hope that John McCain continues to attack us all night and ignore the issues , because this strategy makes him look like an angry old man who does n’t want to talk about the economy .
However , for those of you watching at home tonight , we want you to judge the candidates based on what they say about the economy .
McCain is strong in this format , but so is Obama .
Just in case though , we need to lower expectations in case our guy has an off night .
While this memo is fun to read , it is political spin .
Personally , I do n’t think McCain will bring much of the character attack strategy with him tonight .
I suspect that his focus will be on using his biography to connect with the audience and he will stress leadership in a time of crisis .
His campaign is n’t based on policy , so I doubt that there will be many specifics offered .
In contrast , Obama only needs to keep doing what he has been working .
If it ai n’t broke , do n’t fix it .

There have been further falls on the world 's stock exchanges , amid renewed fears of a global recession .
Richard Scott reports .
Maqbool Fida Husain , India 's most famous living artist , will not be able to return to India unless the hundreds of cases claiming he hurt " Hindu sentiment " are withdrawn , say experts despite a ruling from the country 's supreme court clearing him of the charges .
The artist has been in self - imposed exile since January 2006 , forced out by threats from Hindu groups enraged by his paintings of nude gods and goddesses .
On Monday three supreme court judges considered whether his painting , Bharat Mata ( Mother India ) , which depicts a nude woman on her knees creating the shape of a map of India , was sacrilegious .
The bench rejected the petition seeking prosecution for offending Hindus , saying it was a work of art and citing India 's tradition of graphic sexual iconography .
" Does the sentiment of the petitioner get scandalized by the large number of photographs of erotic sculptures which are in circulation ? " the judges asked .
" It is an art like the sculptures .
None get scandalized looking at the sculptures . "
The artist , known in India as MF Husain , told the Associated Press : " At last , the dignity of Indian contemporary art has been upheld by the supreme court as expected . "
He could not be contacted today .
MF Husain put Indian modern art on the world map .
By 2005 he was the highest paid painter in India with his work easily fetching $ 1 m ( £ 538,000 ) .
However claims that he would be able to return home to India were in doubt .
Last month MF Husain told the Guardian there were " 3,000 legal cases which have been lodged against me in the past eight years " .
Organisations that have long defended the painter said that rightwing Hindu groups could still keep " hounding Husain " .
" We welcome the court judgment , " said Rajan Prasad of Sahmat , which last month put on an exhibition of Husain 's work that was vandalised by Hindu activists .
" The problem is that this petition relates to just five cases quashed by the high court .
The other cases stand .
Even if you quash all the cases these guys can simply lodge more .
Unless the executive takes a decision and changes the law to defend freedom of expression [ MF Husain ] will be in exile for years to come . "
The hacked Yahoo account was one of two Ms Palin owned Details of how an e-mail account of US Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin was hacked have emerged .
Following the hack , screenshots of Mrs Palin 's messages , inbox , pictures and address book were posted to the Wikileaks whistle - blowing site .
It is thought the attackers exploited the password resetting system of Yahoo's e-mail service .
Details about Mrs Palin 's life pulled from public sources reportedly helped defeat security questions .
Formal investigation Information from Wikipedia and other online databases helped to establish Mrs Palin 's date of birth , zip code and other personal information .
Armed with this , the attackers convinced the Yahoo password re-setting system they warranted access and allowed them to re-set the password and then get at the account .
In an official statement Yahoo said : " Yahoo treats issues of security and privacy very seriously . "
It added : " To protect the privacy of our users , we are not able to comment on the details of a specific user account . "
" Generally , if Yahoo !
receives reports that an account has been compromised , we investigate for suspicious activity and take appropriate action , " the company said .
Mrs Palin is being investigated for her conduct as governor of Alaska
The attackers broke into Mrs Palin's gov.palin@yahoo.com e-mail account .
This account and another , gov.sarah@yahoo.com , owned by Mrs Palin have now been deleted .
The FBI and the US Secret Service have now begun a formal investigation into the attack and who may have been behind it .
The hackers used the CTunnel proxy service which routes web browsing through an intermediary to obscure where the attackers were based .
However , the screenshots for the attack reveal the original web address used by the proxy which may help investigators track down the miscreants .
It has been reported that records from the CTunnel proxy service are being sought by the FBI .
The attack on the e-mail account comes as questions are being asked about whether Mrs Palin used her personal e-mail accounts to carry out state business .
US law states that all e-mails relating to the official business of government must be archived and not destroyed .
However , it does allow for personal e-mails to be deleted .
Mrs Palin is being investigated in Alaska for alleged abuse of power while governor of the state .

Since the publication of " The Bell Curve , " many commentators have offered opinions about human intelligence that misstate current scientific evidence .
Some conclusions dismissed in the media as discredited are actually firmly supported .
This statement outlines conclusions regarded as mainstream among researchers on intelligence , in particular , on the nature , origins , and practical consequences of individual and group differences in intelligence .
Its aim is to promote more reasoned discussion of the vexing phenomenon that the research has revealed in recent decades .
The following conclusions are fully described in the major textbooks , professional journals and encyclopedias in intelligence .
1 .
Intelligence is a very general mental capability that , among other things , involves the ability to reason , plan , solve problems , think abstractly , comprehend complex ideas , learn quickly and learn from experience .
It is not merely book learning , a narrow academic skill , or test - taking smarts .
Rather , it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings --" catching on , " " making sense " of things , or " figuring out " what to do .2 .
Intelligence , so defined , can be measured , and intelligence tests measure it well .
They are among the most accurate ( in technical terms , reliable and valid ) of all psychological tests and assessments .
They do not measure creativity , character personality , or other important differences among individuals , nor are they intended to .3 .
While there are different types of intelligence tests , they all measure the same intelligence .
Some use words or numbers and require specific cultural knowledge ( like vocabulary ) .
Others do not , and instead use shapes or designs and require knowledge of only simple , universal concepts ( many / few , open / closed , up / down ) .
4 .
The spread of people along the IQ continuum , from low to high , can be represented well by the bell curve ( in statistical jargon , the " normal curve " ) .
Most people cluster around the average ( IQ 100 ) .
Few are either very bright or very dull : About 3 % of Americans score above IQ 130 ( often considered the threshold for " giftedness " ) , with about the same percentage below IQ 70 ( IQ 70 - 75 often being considered the threshold for mental retardation ) .
5 . Intelligence tests are not culturally biased against American blacks or other native - born , English - speaking peoples in the U.S. Rather , IQ scores predict equally accurately for all such Americans , regardless of race and social class .
Individuals who do not understand English well can be given either a nonverbal test or one in their native language .
6 .
The brain processes underlying intelligence are still little understood .
Current research looks , for example , at speed of neural transmission , glucose ( energy ) uptake , and electrical activity of the brain , uptake , and electrical activity of the brain .
7 . Members of all racial - ethnic groups can be found at every IQ level .
The bell curves of different groups overlap considerably , but groups often differ in where their members tend to cluster along the IQ line .
The bell curves for some groups ( Jews and East Asians ) are centered somewhat higher than for whites in general .
Other groups ( blacks and Hispanics ) are centered somewhat lower than non-Hispanic whites .
8 .
The bell curve for whites is centered roughly around IQ 100 ; the bell curve for American blacks roughly around 85 ; and those for different subgroups of Hispanics roughly midway between those for whites and blacks .
The evidence is less definitive for exactly where above IQ 100 the bell curves for Jews and Asians are centered .
9 . IQ is strongly related , probably more so than any other single measurable human trait , to many important educational , occupational , economic , and social outcomes .
Its relation to the welfare and performance of individuals is very strong in some arenas in life ( education , military training ) , moderate but robust in others ( social competence ) , and modest but consistent in others ( law - abidingness ) .
Whatever IQ tests measure , it is of great practical and social importance .
10 .
A high IQ is an advantage in life because virtually all activities require some reasoning and decision - making .
Conversely , a low IQ is often a disadvantage , especially in disorganized environments .
Of course , a high IQ no more guarantees success than a low IQ guarantees failure in life .
There are many exceptions , but the odds for success in our society greatly favor individuals with higher IQs.11 .
The practical advantages of having a higher IQ increase as life settings become more complex ( novel , ambiguous , changing , unpredictable , or multifaceted ) .
For example , a high IQ is generally necessary to perform well in highly complex or fluid jobs ( the professions , management ) : it is a considerable advantage in moderately complex jobs ( crafts , clerical and police work ) ; but it provides less advantage in settings that require only routine decision making or simple problem solving ( unskilled work ) .
12 . Differences in intelligence certainly are not the only factor affecting performance in education , training , and highly complex jobs ( no one claims they are ) , but intelligence is often the most important .
When individuals have already been selected for high ( or low ) intelligence and so do not differ as much in IQ , as in graduate school ( or special education ) , other influences on performance loom larger in comparison .
13 .
Certain personality traits , special talents , aptitudes , physical capabilities , experience , and the like are important ( sometimes essential ) for successful performance in many jobs , but they have narrower ( or unknown ) applicability or " transferability " across tasks and settings compared with general intelligence .
Some scholars choose to refer to these other human traits as other " intelligences . " 14 . Individuals differ in intelligence due to differences in both their environments and genetic heritage .
Heritability estimates range from 0.4 to 0.8 ( on a scale from 0 to 1 ) , most thereby indicating that genetics plays a bigger role than does environment in creating IQ differences among individuals .
( Heritability is the squared correlation of phenotype with genotype . )
If all environments were to become equal for everyone , heritability would rise to 100 % because all remaining differences in IQ would necessarily be genetic in origin.15 .
Members of the same family also tend to differ substantially in intelligence ( by an average of about 12 IQ points ) for both genetic and environmental reasons .
They differ genetically because biological brothers and sisters share exactly half their genes with each parent and , on the average , only half with each other .
They also differ in IQ because they experience different environments within the same family .
16 .
That IQ may be highly heritable does not mean that it is not affected by the environment .
Individuals are not born with fixed , unchangeable levels of intelligence ( no one claims they are ) .
IQs do gradually stabilize during childhood , however , and generally change little thereafter .
17 .
Although the environment is important in creating IQ differences , we do not know yet how to manipulate it to raise low IQs permanently .
Whether recent attempts show promise is still a matter of considerable scientific debate .
18 .
Genetically caused differences are not necessarily irremediable ( consider diabetes , poor vision , and phenalketonuria ) , nor are environmentally caused ones necessarily remediable ( consider injuries , poisons , severe neglect , and some diseases ) .
Both may be preventable to some extent .19 .
There is no persuasive evidence that the IQ bell curves for different racial - ethnic groups are converging .
Surveys in some years show that gaps in academic achievement have narrowed a bit for some races , ages , school subjects and skill levels , but this picture seems too mixed to reflect a general shift in IQ levels themselves .
20 .
Racial - ethnic differences in IQ bell curves are essentially the same when youngsters leave high school as when they enter first grade .
However , because bright youngsters learn faster than slow learners , these same IQ differences lead to growing disparities in amount learned as youngsters progress from grades one to 12 .
As large national surveys continue to show , black 17 - year - olds perform , on the average , more like white 13 - year - olds in reading , math , and science , with Hispanics in between .
21 .
The reasons that blacks differ among themselves in intelligence appear to be basically the same as those for why whites ( or Asians or Hispanics ) differ among themselves .
Both environment and genetic heredity are involved .
22 .
There is no definitive answer to why IQ bell curves differ across racial - ethnic groups .
The reasons for these IQ differences between groups may be markedly different from the reasons for why individuals differ among themselves within any particular group ( whites or blacks or Asians ) .
In fact , it is wrong to assume , as many do , that the reason why some individuals in a population have high IQs but others have low IQs must be the same reason why some populations contain more such high ( or low ) IQ individuals than others .
Most experts believe that environment is important in pushing the bell curves apart , but that genetics could be involved too .
23 .
Racial - ethnic differences are somewhat smaller but still substantial for individuals from the same socioeconomic backgrounds .
To illustrate , black students from prosperous families tend to score higher in IQ than blacks from poor families , but they score no higher , on average , than whites from poor families .
24 .
Almost all Americans who identify themselves as black have white ancestors - the white admixture is about 20 % , on average -- and many self - designated whites , Hispanics , and others likewise have mixed ancestry .
Because research on intelligence relies on self - classification into distinct racial categories , as does most other social - science research , its findings likewise relate to some unclear mixture of social and biological distinctions among groups ( no one claims otherwise ) .
25 .
The research findings neither dictate nor preclude any particular social policy , because they can never determine our goals .
They can , however , help us estimate the likely success and side - effects of pursuing those goals via different means .
Distributed Logging : Syslog - ng & Splunk
If you have n’t already , I encourage you to take Splunk for a test drive .
While there is no shortage of distributed log aggregators on the market , few if any come with as much flexibility and firepower when it comes to indexing and search when you need to find a needle in a haystack of log data .
After deploying it for a collection of Ruby applications using a simple UDP logger , I ’ve decided to push the ball even further and see if I could route the entire stack into Splunk : HAproxy , Nginx , Ruby , and others , all over the network .
After a few false starts ( and not wanting to go to an Enterprise license ) , I ’ve stumbled on a surprisingly easy solution : syslog -ng !
Routing Syslog - ng directly to Splunk
Syslog-ng was designed from the ground up to be a distributed logging application .
Unlike Splunk , it is not meant to be a log analysis package , which is perfect for us , since that is exactly what we ’re using Splunk for in the first place .
Let ’s take a look at a simple config file :
# custom configuration for haproxy and Nginx filter custom { program ( " haproxy " ) or program ( " nginx " ) ; } ; log { # syslog source ( s_sys ) ; # filter everything but .. filter ( custom ) ; # send to splunk , and local file destination ( splunk ) ; destination ( local_log ) ; } ; destination splunk { udp ( " 192.168.0.198 " port ( 9998 ) ) ; } ; destination local_log { file ( " /var/log/mylog.log " ) ; } ;
The configuration syntax for syslog - ng is a pleasure to work with : consume all messages from the syslog , apply a custom filter which we ’ve defined to accept HAProxy and Nginx , and send the messages to a remote Splunk server and a local log file !
Routing HAProxy and Nginx to Syslog-ng
With syslog - ng ready to go , we have to update HAProxy and Nginx to start logging to syslog .
The former is easy and requires a one line change ( see top of haproxy config file ) , but the latter ( Nginx ) requires applying a patch to the source ( no worries , it ’s stable - confirmed and in production ) .
All done ?
Let ’s open up Splunk and issue a request that gets routed through HAProxy and to our Nginx server :
That ’s it , now you can see live logs from your Ruby , Haproxy , and Nginx processes stream live into your Splunk database for easy debugging and profiling .
Of course , same procedures apply to any other process on a remote server - make it log to syslog , and you can route it to Splunk !
Fritz Kunze ( co- founder of Franz Incorporated ) gave a talk called “ Careening through Lisp mind fields . ”
He was very informal in his delivery and had lots of humorous anecdotes to go along with his recollections and “ armchair ” speculations .
Combined with the opening “ meta talk ” by Steel and Gabriel and also JonL ’s extremely informal “ meaning of life ” type talk , one gets the impression that many of the major players in the Lisp world are unable to go along with any sort of standard social convention .
Somehow , some way … they all have to find they own way of doing things and their own quirky personal inflections impact everything they do .
Early on in his talk he told a story about the creator of Eliza : Joseph Weizenbaum .
( Weizenbaum died earlier this year , by the way . )
The story goes that he walked into someones office and the guy in there says , hey– check out my program .
You ask it questions and it answers yes or no !
So they tried a few , and sure enough , the answers were right every single time .
Weizenbaum asked him if it answers questions that are in German .
The guy says , sure , but you have to do the typing .
So Weizenbaum types in a couple of questions in German and the answers were correct in both cases .
“ I have to think about this , ” he said , and he stomped off to his office .
Not too long later he had Eliza up and running .
And the program that inspired him ?
It just gave a “ yes ” if there were an odd number of characters in the question !
( Weizenbaum would later go through a slightly paranoid / Luddite type phase when he was shocked at how ordinary people ascribed ‘ real ’ intelligence to his Eliza program .
He criticized the role of artificial intelligence in society with his book , Computer Power and Human Reason . )
After showing some images created by an extremely unusual Lisp - based drawing program ( and talking about some Eliza spinoffs ) , he then delved into the link between aspergers , autism , emotional immaturity and programming ability .
He had a slide outlining some personality traits and a collective hush fell over the room as we all realized that we were part of some sort of incomprehensible evolutionary programmer - genius phenomenon .
Okay , okay …
I ’m exaggerating .
But the slide was interesting : it included stuff like “ uncomfortable at parties ” and “ dislikes travelling ” .
( Are you a misunderstood genius ?
Take this quiz ! )
He talked about some of the problems in managing Lisp guys : “ There ’s a limit to the number of smart people you can put in a room .
Things will break down and they wo n’t talk to each other . ”
After some more anecdotes and also some unscientific speculations , he concluded that therapy was the only solution … therapy , that is , for the normal people that have to work with the “ asperger ” guys !
After a while , the managers and salesmen begin to emulate the smart people , he explained .
If the company culture as whole absorbs too many “ aspergerisms ” , then the business ceases to be able to talk to its customers !
He concluded his talk with some ideas about the future of lisp .
He thought that it would be possible for Lisp to reposition itself as sort of the ultimate DSL for making web pages .
The problem , though , is that the Lisp community is made up of people who can neither compromise nor give up control .
He proposed that a non-profit Lisp foundation be set up with the goal of producing a new Lisp within 12 months .
“ If you study history , you repeat yourself over and over again , ” he said .
“ You ’ve got to do something brand new ! ”
JonL stood up immediately following the talk : “ As usual , I could n’t disagree more with everything you said ! ” JonL was clearly disgusted , and … uh … unwilling to compromise on any of the points what were presented .
“ Nothing we can do today can change Lisp ’s position in the market , ” he concluded .

In a month when the Dow had its worst single - day plunge in over twenty years , when Lehman imploded , AIG faltered , and WaMu failed , when the word crisis became an everyday staple in newspaper headlines and the presidential race pulled close , then pulled apart , when the Chicago Cubs kicked off a playoff quest to win their first championship in 100 years ( then got swept out in three straight games ) and , for good measure , some scientists in an underground lab near the Swiss Alps fired up a Large Hadron Collider that some serious observers warned might create a black hole that would swallow up the Earth , it was comforting to sit down and have lunch in midtown with a man who can see the future .
It ’s not that Nate Silver is psychic , or even that he ’s right all the time .
He ’s just proved very good , especially of late , at looking at what ’s already happened and using that information to predict what will happen next .
Silver , who ’s 30 , thin , and lives in Chicago , had been flown to New York at the invitation of a hedge fund to give a talk .
“ They just said , ‘ Why do n’t you come in , talk about your models , ’ ” he said with a shrug .
“ I ’ll probably just take a lot of questions . ”
Silver does n’t know all that much about high finance ; these days , he ’s spending most of his energy on his political Website , FiveThirty Eight ( the total number of Electoral College votes ) , where he uses data analysis to track and interpret political polls and project the outcome of November ’s election .
The site earned some national recognition back in May , during the Democratic primaries , when almost every other commentator was celebrating Hillary Clinton ’s resurgent momentum .
Reading the polls , most pundits predicted she ’d win Indiana by five points and noted she ’d narrowed the gap with Obama in North Carolina to just eight .
Silver , who was writing anonymously as “ Poblano ” and receiving about 800 visits a day , disagreed with this consensus .
He ’d broken the numbers down demographically and come up with a much less encouraging outcome for Clinton : a two - point squeaker in Indiana , and a seventeen - point drubbing in North Carolina .
On the night of the primaries , Clinton took Indiana by one and lost North Carolina by fifteen .
The national pundits were doubly shocked : one , because the results were so divergent from the polls , and two , because some guy named after a chili pepper had predicted the outcome better than anyone else .
Silver ’s site now gets about 600,000 visits daily .
And as more and more people started wondering who he was , in May , Silver decided to unmask himself .
To most people , the fact that Poblano turned out to be a guy named Nate Silver meant nothing .
But to anyone who follows baseball seriously , this was like finding out that a guy anonymously running a high - fashion Website turned out to be Howard Cosell .
At his day job , Silver works for Baseball Prospectus , a loosely organized think tank that , in the last ten years , has revolutionized the interpretation of baseball stats .
Furthermore , Silver himself invented a system called PECOTA , an algorithm for predicting future performance by baseball players and teams .
( It stands for “ player empirical comparison and optimization test algorithm , ” but is named , with a wink , after the mediocre Kansas City Royals infielder Bill Pecota . )
Baseball Prospectus has a reputation in sports - media circles for being unfailingly rigorous , occasionally arrogant , and almost always correct .
This season , for example , the PECOTA system predicted that the Tampa Bay Rays would win 90 games .
This seemed bold , even amusing , given that the Rays were arguably the worst team in baseball .
In 2007 , they ’d lost 96 games .
They ’d finished last in all but one season of their ten - year existence .
( In 2004 , they finished fourth . )
They had some young talent , sure , but most people , even those in the Rays ’ front office , thought that if the team simply managed to win more games than it lost , that would represent a quantum leap .
PECOTA , however , saw it differently .
PECOTA recognized that the past Rays were n’t a hopelessly bad team so much as a good team hampered by a few fixable problems — which , thanks to some key off - season changes , had been largely remedied .
Silver argued on the Baseball Prospectus Website that the long - suffering team had finally “ decided to transform themselves from a sort of hedge fund for undervalued assets into a real , functional baseball club . ”
PECOTA , as it turns out , was n’t exactly right .
The Rays did n’t win 90 games this year .
They won 97 games and are currently playing the Red Sox for the American League championship .
So , Nate Silver : What happens next ?
Sports and politics offer several obvious parallels .
Both involve a competition , essentially between two teams .
Both involve reams of statistical data available for devotees to sort through — or , more commonly , for intermediary experts to sort through , analyze , and then interpret for you .
In baseball , these stats track player performance — how many hits a player gets , and when , and against what kind of pitchers — while in politics , the data tracks voter preferences .
Who do you like and why ?
What kind of choice are you likely to make on Election Day ?
These stats , on their face , seem pretty straightforward .
If a hitter hits .300 , he ’s valuable .
If Obama opens up a six - point national lead , he ’s in good shape .
And yet in both sports and politics , there ’s an industry built around studying this data , making up stories about it , and then trying to sell those stories to you .
For example : A - Rod , for all his greatness , ca n’t deliver in the clutch .
Obama , for all his charisma , has struggled to connect with white working - class voters .
The Mets are a bunch of chokers .
This election , it ’s all about the hockey moms .
As a result , in baseball and , now , politics , there exists a small subculture of counterexperts :
People who argue against these conventional story lines using new interpretations of the raw data to make their case .
In baseball , this counterculture has been growing for roughly 30 years and can be traced , improbably , to one man : Bill James , a cranky Midwesterner who started writing articles about baseball while working the night shift as a security guard at a pork - and - beans factory in Lawrence , Kansas .
In 1977 , he published a photocopied newsletter called Baseball Abstract , which found a cult following that later blossomed into a national audience .
By the late eighties , he was hailed as the founder of “ sabermetrics ” — a new field dedicated to better analysis of baseball stats — and the father of a revolution .
Once considered a Unabomber - style outcast , James now consults for the Red Sox .
And in the nineties , the study of sabermetrics exploded .
For starters , the development of so - called fantasy baseball — a game in which fans draft a team of real players , then compete with each other based on the players ’ on - field success — created a huge new market for performance projections .
( If you want to win your fantasy league , you care a lot less about who hit 40 home runs last year than you do about who ’ll hit 40 next year . )
And the advent of the Internet allowed fans unprecedented access to stats , both raw and packaged by various experts .
Then , in 2003 , Michael Lewis wrote Moneyball , a best - selling book that valorized Billy Beane , the general manager of the Oakland A’s , for using some of these new insights to overcome the financial advantage of richer teams .
In the midst of all this , in 1996 , Baseball Prospectus was born .
Founded by five baseball fans who met each other online , the BP crew are like the bratty children of Bill James , adding a new level of analytical sophistication to his contrarian philosophy .
“ When he started , Bill James had to actually call up teams and ask for their information , ” says Joe Sheehan , one of BP ’s founders .
“ Now we ’re able to download databases .
We can do things with one - tenth the effort and a hundred times the available data . ”
Also , whereas James used stats to explain what a player had done , BP uses stats to predict what a player might do .
As a result , BP has built a small but successful empire of smarty - pants , with a Website , syndicated columns , and most prominently , a preseason annual full of player projections .
As an avid fantasy player , I ’ve spent long hours combing through the pages of the Baseball Prospectus book .
It arrives each season huge , heavy , and intimidatingly dense .
( “ It ’s longer than Moby - Dick and heavier than War and Peace , ” jokes Steven Goldman , one of the editors . )
Last year ’s edition weighed in at 605 oversize pages and offered essays like “ Expanding the Cannon : Quantifying the Impact of Outfield Throwing Arms . ”
The writing is lively and funny , nerd - nip for baseball obsessives .
But the book , with its extensive charts and graphs , its talk of VORP ( value over replacement player ) and SNLVAR ( support - neutral lineup adjusted value added above replacement ) , its SAC percent and EqH9 ( oh , never mind ) , can also make you feel like you ’re reading a Ph.D. dissertation in statistics or a book by Dr. Seuss — or both , at the same time .
In fact , the work of stat hounds in general , and of Baseball Prospectus in particular , is so obviously the product of high - wattage brainpower and creativity that you ca n’t help but occasionally wonder :
What if someone applied all this energy to something that actually mattered , like , I do n’t know , politics ?
Last year , at the start of an unusually unpredictable election season , Nate Silver began to wonder the same thing .
As stats are to baseball , polls are to politics ; i.e. , the basic numeric measurement of how things have gone in the past and how they might go in the future .
Ask any pollster , though , and he will tell you that polls are n’t meant to be used as predictive tools — they ’re simply a rough measure of where the electorate stands at a given moment .
As pollster John Zogby put it to me , “ We take snapshots .
And when you take many snapshots in a row , you get motion pictures . ”
But unlike baseball stats , polls are a notoriously imprecise measurement .
In baseball , at least , a hit is a hit .
With polls , a yes is n’t always a yes .
Sometimes it ’s more like a “ maybe , ” or a “ yes , until I change my mind , ” or an “ I do n’t know , but I ’ll say yes anyway to get you off the phone . ”
Poll results can vary dramatically based on what you ’re asking , who you ’re asking , how you ’re asking , and how many people decide to answer you .
Three different polls were conducted recently asking Americans how they felt about the federal $ 700 billion bailout .
They all asked the question in slightly different ways and the results were essentially useless :
One poll had people in favor of the bailout 57 to 30 percent , one had them against it 55 to 31 , and one was basically split down the middle .
In other words , polls are , at best , educated guesses .
But if there ’s one thing Nate Silver loves to make , it ’s an educated guess .
In this year ’s Democratic primary , for example , the polls were all over the place .
Before the Iowa caucuses on January 3 , one poll had Clinton winning by nine , one had Clinton by two , and one had Obama by one .
Obama won by seven .
In the New Hampshire primary , five days later , one poll had Obama by thirteen and most others had him winning by eight or nine .
Clinton won by three .
Primaries are notoriously difficult to poll , because unlike in a general election , turnout is very unpredictable and people are much more likely to switch their choice at the last minute .
As the primaries went on , however , Silver , who had been writing an anonymous diary for the liberal Website Daily Kos , made an observation about this year ’s voters :
While the polls were wobbling wildly state - to - state , the demographic groups supporting each candidate , and especially Clinton and Obama , were remarkably static .
He was n’t the only one who noticed this , of course — it was a major narrative theme of the campaign .
One pundit summed it up by saying that Clinton had “ the beer track ” — blue - collar whites , Latinos , and seniors — while Barack had African - Americans and “ the wine track ” : young voters and educated whites .
Every other pundit , though , was doing what they ’ve always done , i.e. , following the polls .
Silver decided to ignore the polls .
Instead , he used this observation about demographics to create a model that took voting patterns from previous primaries and applied them to upcoming contests .
No phone calls , no sample sizes , no guesswork .
His crucial assumption , of course , was that each demographic group would vote in the same way , in the same percentages , as they had in other states in the past .
Like many of the so - called Moneyball breakthroughs in baseball , this was both a fairly intuitive conclusion and a radical break from conventional thinking .
( In Moneyball , for example , the idea that players who get on base most often are the most valuable — which now seems kind of obvious — was a major breakthrough in strategy . )
After all , political pundits love to talk about states as voting blocs —
New Hampshire ’s leaning this way , North Carolinians care about this , etc. — as though residency is the single most important factor in someone ’s vote .
Silver ’s model more or less ignored residency .
But his hunch about demographics proved correct :
It ’s how he called the Indiana and North Carolina results so accurately when the polls got them so wrong .
In baseball , a hit is a hit .
With polls , a yes is n’t always a yes .
Sometimes it ’s more like “ I do n’t know , but I ’ll say yes anyway to get you off the phone . ”
The model did n’t always work throughout the primaries : Silver missed on Kentucky and South Dakota .
But the model proved that the kind of creative swashbuckling that exemplifies Baseball Prospectus — the institutional obsession with questioning assumptions , even your own , even ( or especially ) to the point of heresy — could work when applied to politics as well .
When I asked Joe Sheehan to sum up the Baseball Prospectus philosophy , he said simply , “ Back up your argument .
Because too many people are telling stories , as opposed to actually looking for the truth . ”
Meanwhile , even as his primary model attracted attention , Silver was cooking up another idea .
He figured there must be a better way to use the daily tracking polls to predict a candidate ’s future , just as he ’d once found a better way to use baseball stats to predict how many home runs a player might hit .
His simple goal , as he explained on Daily Kos in late February , was to “ assess state - by - state general - election polls in a probabilistic manner . ”
In other words , he wanted to find a way to use all those occasionally erratic , occasionally unreliable , occasionally misleading polls to tell him who would win the election in November , which at that point was over 250 days away .
It ’s a tough business , being an oracle .
Everyone cheers when you hit a bull ’s - eye , but no one ’s arrows fly true all the time .
“ Sometimes being more accurate means you ’re getting things right 52 percent of the time instead of 50 , ” says Silver .
“ PECOTA is the most accurate projection system in baseball , but it ’s the most accurate by half a percent . ”
That half - percent , though , makes all the difference .
Silver ’s work , in both baseball and politics , is about finding that slim advantage .
“ I hate the first 90 percent [ of a solution ] , ” he says .
“ What I want is that last 10 percent . ”
As a kid , Silver was not a dork in a plastic bubble , as you might expect , gobbling stats and spouting figures .
He grew up in East Lansing , Michigan , a typical baseball fan with a Tigers pennant on his bedroom wall .
In person , talking baseball , he hardly comes off as a human computer ; rather , he talks with the same bursts of enthusiasm familiar to any engaged fan in a sports bar .
( And it ’s been a rough year for Silver , fanwise :
His home team , the Tigers , were an underperforming disaster , and his two adopted teams , the Cubs and the White Sox , were both quickly and tragically dispatched from the playoffs this year . )
His approach to politics is similar — he ’s an engaged fan .
He unapologetically roots for Obama .
One of his early posts as a contributor to Daily Kos , titled “ I Got Dinner With Barack Obama , ” recounts with gee - whiz wonder a chance sighting of Obama during Silver ’s birthday outing at a Mexican restaurant .
( “ At first I was pissed off with my friend for not doing more to alert me , ” he wrote , “ but if I ’d had more advance warning , I ’d probably have done something stupid like scream ‘ Fired up ! , ’ which would have been embarrassing in retrospect . ” )
But he does n’t try to pummel you with numbers to prove his argument , like a typical hot - blooded partisan .
Instead , on his site , he exhibits the cool confidence of someone who ’s simply used to knowing his stuff better than anyone else in the room .
Not that he can’t pick , and win , a good fight .
In a post on Daily Kos last December titled “ Is a Bad Poll Better Than No Poll at All ? ”
Silver singled out a few pollsters , particularly American Research Group , to show that their consistently off - base numbers will skew polling averages so severely that they harm one ’s results .
Of ARG he wrote , “ They have a track record of rolling out some polls that are completely different from anybody else in the race , and when they do , they are almost always wrong . ”
Dick Bennett , the pollster for ARG , responded by posting items on his Website such as “ Nate Silver is Wrong Again , ” and mocking FiveThirty Eight ’s slogan ( “ Electoral Projections Done Right ” ) in a tone that echoed current political attack ads .
( “ So much for electoral projections done right . ” )
Then , in June , Silver posted an open letter to Bennett , which read , “ It has been a long and hard - fought primary campaign .
We ’ve both had our share of successes , and made our share of mistakes .
Granted , you made a few more than I did ” — and in that last sentence , every word but “ Granted ” was a separate link to an ARG polling misfire .
Then Silver challenged Bennett to a contest , in which each site would call the elections results , state - by - state , with a $ 1,000 bounty per state .
Bennett never took him up on it , and this is what he has to say about Silver now : “ What he does is different than what I do .
There ’s a market for that .
There ’s also a lady down the street who will read your palm . ”
As a high - schooler , Silver was a state - champion debater , though he claims to be only a so - so public speaker .
I asked if he ever thought of becoming a baseball G.M. , like the 34 - year - old boy wonder ( and sabermetrics proponent )
Theo Epstein , who took the Red Sox to two championships ( and counting ) .
Silver said , “ The people who do that are very talented .
They ’re very smart , very polished .
And I ’m not much of a schmoozer .
With Baseball Prospectus , you still have a voice and it ’s influential .
I prefer shaping public opinion , I suppose . ”
After earning a degree in economics from the University of Chicago , Silver took a corporate job at a consulting firm but found it boring .
He seems endlessly distractable ; for example , in 2007 , he started a Website , The Burrito Bracket , that rated Mexican restaurants in Wicker Park .
( “ Each week , I will be visiting two restaurants and having the same item of food [ carne asada burritos , for example ] at each one .
The restaurant that provides the superior experience advances to the next round of the bracket . ” )
For a while , he was supplementing his income playing online poker , and even earned six figures one year , but eventually he quit .
“ For a while , there was a lot of money to be made , but you kind of eliminate one sucker at a time , ” he says , “ until finally you ’re the sucker . ”
After he developed PECOTA and joined Baseball Prospectus , he turned his eye to political analyses , thus finding another field in which to identify suckers and eliminate them one at a time .
In concocting FiveThirtyEight , Silver decided the best way to read the polls was to put them all together , with the idea that averaging ten polls would give you a better result than trying to pick out the best one .
Again , he was n’t the first person to do this — other sites like RealClearPolitics and Pollster offer the same service .
But , as Silver told me , “ Sometimes the answer is in looking at other alternatives that exist in the market and saying , ‘ They have the right idea , but they ’re not doing it quite the right way . ’ ”
Silver wanted to average the polls , but he wanted the polls that were more accurate to count for more , while the bad polls would be discounted .
Other sites , like RealClearPolitics , treat every poll as equal .
Silver knows that some polls are simply better than others .
Yet it ’s hard to know how accurate a general - election poll is before the actual election .

So he came up with a system that predicts a pollster ’s future performance based on how good it ’s been in the past .
In finding his average , Silver weights each poll differently — ranking them according to his own statistic , PIE ( pollster - introduced error ) — based on a number of factors , including its track record and its methodology .
One advantage of this system is that , during the primaries , the system actually got smarter .
Because each time a poll performed well in a primary , its ranking improved .
For the general election , this gets trickier , since you have polls coming out every single day and you ca n’t know which ones are getting it right until Election Day .
You can , however , weigh these new polls based on the pollster ’s history , the poll ’s sample size , and how recently the poll was conducted .
You can also track trends over time and use these trend lines to forecast where things will end up on November 4 .
You can also , as Silver has done , analyze all the presidential polling data back to 1952 , looking for information as to what is likely to happen next .
( For example , how much the polls are likely to tighten in the last month of the race , which they traditionally do . )
You can also run 10,000 computer simulations of the election every day based on your poll projections .
( Think of this as sort of like that scene at the end of WarGames , where the computer blurs through every possible nuclear - war scenario . )
As of October 8 , the day after the town - hall debate , Silver ’s simulations had Obama winning the election 90 percent of the time .
“ Literally , the composition of the North Carolina electorate is different than it was six months ago . ”
All of which is very seductive ( and heartening to Obamaphiles ) , especially when you see it laid out on Silver ’s site , with its pleasing graphs , compelling charts , and graphically vibrant electoral maps .
But in essence , Silver ’s whole undertaking is premised on breaking the first rule of reading polls :
He ’s assuming — in his complex , elegant , partially proprietary and yet - to - be- entirely - validated way — that today ’s polls can predict tomorrow ’s election .
Rival statisticians , in particular Sam Wang at Princeton ( who runs his own poll - aggregation blog ) , have criticized Silver , arguing that polls can’t and should n’t be used as a crystal ball .
Other critics have argued that the idea of a projection model is inherently flawed because it ca n’t predict the unpredictable — for example , before the financial meltdown and McCain ’s campaign - suspension stunt , the polls were much tighter and Silver ’s electoral map had McCain on top .
Silver agrees , to a point , comparing daily polls , especially ones that come out months before the election , to “ a 162 - game baseball season , where one individual win or loss does n’t really tell you that much about the ultimate outcome . ”
But for him , you have to use polls to predict the future — that ’s the whole point .
Unlike other electoral projection maps , Silver calls each state for one candidate or the other — there are no undecideds — because the goal is to approximate what the map will look like after Election Day .
“ I think the entire value of the exercise is in predicting the outcome in November , ” Silver says , in a response to Wang .
“ What would happen in an election held today is a largely meaningless question . ”
And Silver is right .
The truth is that everyone reads polls this way .
When you pick up the paper and see McCain up by three or Obama up by six , you assume that means that candidate is on his way to a win .
Silver ’s goal with FiveThirtyEight , then , is to simply do what everyone does , but do it better — to read the polls in such a way that those assumptions we all naturally make will actually turn out to be true .
For all the numbers and nuance , the adjustments and algorithms , there ’s really only one stark , looming , unambiguous test for the political prognosticator .
“ Pretty soon , there ’s going to be an Election Day , ” says pollster J. Ann Selzer of Selzer & Co .
“ And you ’re either going to be golden or a goat . ”
( Selzer , this season , has consistently been golden , calling the Iowa caucus flawlessly , which is partly why Selzer & Co. is Silver ’s top - ranked pollster on FiveThirty Eight . )
Like everyone else calling this election , Silver ’s day of reckoning will come on November 4 .
In the meantime , he ’s become an increasingly confident commentator , growing into a national role as a calming anti-pundit among the white noise of partisan spin .
FiveThirty Eight not only tracks numbers , but features field reports from the 50 states by Silver ’s colleague , Sean Quinn , and the documentary photographer Brett Marty .
And Silver posts to his blog several times daily , spotting and dissecting surprising trends or aberrations , such as a recent poll in Minnesota that handed McCain a sudden one - point lead .
Normally , you ’d expect a liberal - leaning commentator to read such a result and blame bias , or error , or voodoo .
Silver , however , poked around and determined that McCain had been recently outspending Obama three - to - one in Minnesota , making it the only state in the country where he was out - advertising Obama .
“ So McCain may literally have bought his way into a competitive race , ” Silver wrote .
“ So , yes , you can beat a state into submission if you really want to … But whether it ’s been a good use of resources , we ’ll have to see . ”
I caught up with Silver on the phone recently , on a day when he ’d just arrived back in Chicago from New York , having appeared the night before on The Colbert Report .
We talked about Obama ’s widening lead over McCain , and the remaining undecideds — a group , he says , that ’s “ mostly older rather than younger , more religious than not , and a lot of Independents , which is typical ” — and how a lot of formerly solid red states now look like good bets to turn blue .
“ My pet theory is that these states along the Atlantic coast , like Virginia and North Carolina , are growing so fast that you have a lot of newly registered Democrats .
That universe now contains people that it did n’t a month ago .
Literally , the composition of the North Carolina electorate is different than it was six months ago .
They update their registration figures on a weekly basis , and last week the Democrats registered about 16,000 new voters — which would represent one percent of their turnout from 2004 . ”
And this year , at least , for all the surprises and Sturm und Drang , the electorate appears to be acting rationally .
“ The conventional punditry underestimates voters .
The voters are pretty smart .
They picked two very strong candidates .
Even if McCain ’s in trouble now , if it had been Fred Thompson , he might have conceded already . ”
Even as he updates his projections and runs his 10,000 simulations a day , Silver wonders if maybe we do n’t yet know what the narrative of this election will be .
In September , he wrote a post on Obama ’s extensive “ ground game ” — his efforts to set up outposts and register new voters , which have far outstripped McCain ’s — and suggested , “ Suppose that , because of their ground efforts , the Obama campaign is 5 percent more efficient at turning out its vote than the McCain campaign on Election Day …
The implications of this would be enormous — a net of two to three points in each and every swing state — but we know zip , zilch , nada at this stage about their ultimate effect . ”
This is the paradoxical spirit of the stat - heads :
They can be arrogant , sure , and even bullying as they charge forward , brandishing their spreadsheets .
But they are just as happy to prove themselves wrong as they are to debunk anyone else .
This , I think , is at the heart of Silver ’s appeal .
( From a recent random Facebook status update : “ I am an empiricist and I trust Nate Silver .
Read it and chill . ” )
“ Nate ’s medium - term goal is to accomplish what we ’ve accomplished at Prospectus — to change the conversation , ” says Sheehan .
“ And Nate ’s growth curve has been much sharper than ours ever was .
He ’s crammed about five years ’ of BP ’s growth into five months .
And if you get good enough arguments out there , if you do your work well enough , then other people have to do their work better .
Nate ’s watched that at Prospectus .
But FiveThirtyEight can do things for America that Baseball Prospectus never could . ”
FiveThirtyEight is the product of a movement , but also of a moment .
The political media is polarized .
Cable anchors choke on their own spin .
The red states and blue states act like the Jets versus the Sharks — they do n’t trust us and we do n’t trust them .
So we all rail against the enemy in the echo chambers of comment boards , retreating to the bomb - shelter safety of partisan blogs .
It ’s not that Silver is objective or impartial — he ’s not .
He ’s still that young guy who almost yelled “ Fired up ! ” across a crowded Mexican restaurant .
But his ultimate goal is simple and nonpartisan : to build a better expert .
Sure , he ’ll be disappointed if Obama loses .
But he also says , “ If Obama does lose , I think it ’s healthy to try and understand why , rather than just kicking and throwing things . ”
If he ever decides to run for office , that would n’t make for a bad slogan .
Nate Silver : More understanding .
Less kicking and throwing things .
WHAT is the single most important price in the world ?
Popular answers are the price of oil , American interest rates or the dollar .
Yet Chinese wages are , arguably , more important .
China has by far the world 's biggest labour force , of around 800 m — almost twice that of America , the European Union and Japan combined .
Thus recent claims that it is running short of cheap labour would , if true , have huge consequences not just for China , but also for the rest of the world .
A seemingly unlimited supply of cheap workers has been one of the main forces behind China 's rapid economic growth .
But over the past couple of years , factory owners have complained of labour shortages and wages have risen more rapidly , leading some to conclude that China 's “ surplus ” labour has been used up .
The country 's one - child policy , introduced in 1979 , has caused the growth in its labour supply to slow sharply ( see chart ) .
After rising by 1.3 % a year during the decade to 2005 , the population of working age is expected to increase at an annual rate of 0.7 % until 2015 , and then shrink by 0.1 % a year until 2025 .
At the same time , the shift of workers from agriculture to industry , which has been an important source of productivity gains , will also slow .
Jonathan Anderson , an economist at UBS , reckons that these two trends will reduce China 's sustainable growth rate from 9 - 9.5 % today to 7 - 7.5 % by 2025 .
But as well as boosting growth , the flow of workers from farms to factories has held down manufacturing wages — not only in China , but also throughout the world .
The theory behind this was first expounded by Sir Arthur Lewis , an economist from St Lucia , who won the Nobel prize for economics in 1979 .
He argued that a developing country with “ surplus ” ( ie , underemployed ) rural labour could expand industrial employment for many years without causing wage inflation , because employers enjoy such a large supply of labour .
During the first 50 years of Britain 's industrial revolution , real wages remained more or less flat while profits soared .
Likewise in China , as millions of migrants have quit the countryside for urban factories and construction sites , the real wages of low - skilled workers barely rose during the 1980s and 1990s , despite big productivity gains ; only recently have they increased rapidly .
This acceleration of wages has prompted some to conclude that China 's surplus labour in the countryside has been used up .
Last year Cai Fang , the director of the Institute of Population and Labour Economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , argued that China has reached the “ Lewis turning point ” .
By 2009 , he predicted , there would be a widespread shortage of workers , pushing up industrial wages .
Does this mean the death of China 's growth model ?
As so often in China , this debate is clouded by the poor data .
Until recently , most estimates of surplus labour varied between 150 m and 200 m people .
But the true figure is probably much smaller , because government figures for the rural labour force include millions of migrants who have already moved to cities and others who work in rural industry , not farming .
In addition the population is ageing : the number of workers aged between 20 and 29 fell from 233 m in 1990 to 165 m in 2005 .
Many textile and electronics firms hire only young women in their 20s , as they are thought to be less troublesome and more willing to work long hours .
Construction firms favour young single men .
Older people are not only less employable , but they are also typically less willing to migrate if they have children .
After taking account of this , Mr Cai estimates that China 's surplus labour has been virtually exhausted .
But Stephen Green , an economist at Standard Chartered , thinks that talk of China 's vanishing labour surplus is premature .
In a report this year he argued that the surplus would not run out for another decade .
Although the number aged between 20 and 29 fell over the past decade , their ranks are now rising again .
Using the 2005 census , Mr Green estimates that the 20 - something group will increase by a third in the ten years to 2015 , as baby - boomers ' children join the workforce ( see right - hand chart ) ; only then will it start shrinking sharply .
What is more , the recent spurt in urban wages is not necessarily proof that the surplus has gone .
Mr Green argues that to attract migrant workers , urban employers have to pay more than rural income , which has increased in recent years , thanks to government policies and higher food prices .
The temporary increase in the age group between 20 and 29 over the next few years will also ease the upward pressure on urban pay .
Go East , young women
The World Bank agrees that China 's labour surplus has not yet run out .
Even when the number of young people drops , the labour supply is determined by more than demographics .
Migrant workers are usually excluded from urban social - security schemes and have to pay more for education and health care .
The bank suggests that phasing out the household - registration system would encourage more people to move to the city .
Vocational training for rural residents aged over 30 would equip them better for jobs in industry .
And financial incentives to encourage workers to retire later could also boost the labour supply : only 60 % of men and 30 % of women aged over 50 have jobs .
Moreover , Mr Cai 's estimate of China 's labour surplus assumes that 180 m workers , or 24 % of total employment , are needed for farming .
But that is based on today 's agriculture .
Mechanisation and the consolidation of land plots will boost productivity , meaning that fewer farmers will be needed .
That will in turn release more workers for industry .
In developed countries only 3 % of workers till the land .
China 's surplus labour will eventually dry up , but it still seems some years away .
In any case , that moment should be cause for cheer not fear in China and elsewhere , because it will lead to bigger gains in income and consumption .
That , after all , is the whole point of development .
Being overweight can run in the family People are subconsciously influenced by the weight of those around them - so fat friends can cause someone to put on weight too , researchers suggest .
An international team , including University of Warwick experts , dubbed it " imitative obesity " - or " keeping up with the Joneses " on calories .
Their study , presented to a conference in the US , looked at data on 27,000 people from across Europe .
But one expert said the causes for the rise in obesity were much more complex .
Consumption of calories has gone up but that does not tell us why people are eating more
Professor Andrew Oswald , University of Warwick
The work , by scientists at the University of Warwick , Dartmouth College , and the University of Leuven , is being presented to an economics conference in Cambridge Massachusetts .
They suggest choices about appearance , on which decisions such as job offers or being deemed attractive are based , are determined by the choices others around you make .
So , if people around you are fat , it is permissible for you to be fat too .
It found nearly half of European women feel overweight , while just under a third of men felt the same .
' Cheeky ' Professor Andrew Oswald at the University of Warwick , who worked on the study , said : " Consumption of calories has gone up but that does not tell us why people are eating more .
" Some have argued that obesity has been produced by cheaper food , but if fatness is a response to greater purchasing power , why do we routinely observe that rich people are thinner than poor people ? "
He said : " A lot of research into obesity , which has emphasised sedentary lifestyles or human biology or fast - food , has missed the key point .
" Rising obesity needs to be thought of as a sociological phenomenon not a physiological one .
" People are influenced by relative comparisons , and norms have changed and are still changing . "
But Dr David Haslam , clinical director of the National Obesity Forum , said : " It 's a bit cheeky to pin it on sociological influences - there 's more to it than that .
" If you are surrounded by people , whether that 's friends or within the family home , who are overweight , you are sharing the same environment where there is likely to be an abundance of the wrong kind of foods . "

Hello world !

Perhaps it was the bondage trousers his mother was so famous for creating in the 1970s but photographer Ben Westwood has made a career of depicting what some might see as the more explicit end of soft pornography .
Now he is moving onto the political frontline by spearheading a campaign against anti-pornography legislation that is due to come into force some time next year .
He believes it will make possession of his own photography and other art illegal .
Westwood , 45 , eldest son of fashion designer Vivienne and her first husband , Derek Westwood , has joined the campaign Caan - the Consenting Adults Action Network - which claims he is the first of several artists and celebrities planning to lend their names to the battle to overturn section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 , which gained royal assent earlier this year .
It was intended to target people who view illegal hardcore pornography websites .
Under the new rules , criminal responsibility shifts from the producer - who is already responsible under the 1959 Obscene Publications
Act - to the consumer .
It makes it illegal to have pornographic material that depicts necrophilia , bestiality or violence that looks life - threatening or likely to result in serious injury to the breasts or genitals .
Campaigners fear the new law will criminalise thousands of people who use violent pornographic images as part of consensual sexual relationships .
' They say this is about violence but it 's distinctly about sex , ' said Westwood .
' I feel the stick is always pointed at pornography as this terrible corrupting influence , this idea that it makes people do things that they would n't have done otherwise .
' My work has always been a campaign against that view .
Now I find that someone is deciding to make owning my work a criminal offence .
I do n't think there should be laws , any laws , about sexuality .
There are plenty of laws against physically damaging a person . '
Westwood 's book of fetish - themed photography , F**K Fashion , published in 2005 , contains images of women bound and gagged .
' The women are all beautiful consenting models , ' said Westwood .
' Effectively , anyone who has a copy of my book could soon find they are breaking the law . '
The law means artists such as the Chapman brothers and Tracey Emin could find their work falling foul of the law .
The Home Office insists the act is meant to target only internet porn .
The outlawing of ' extreme pornography ' was itself the result of a three - year campaign by Liz Longhurst and MP Martin Salter who collected 50,000 signatures on a petition and won backing from police and the Home Office .
Longhurst 's 31 - year - old daughter , Jane , was brutally murdered in 2003 by Graham Coutts , who had been viewing extreme pornographic sites depicting scenes of strangulation and faked murder and rape before he killed .
He was jailed for at least 26 years .
Mrs Longhurst has said she is aware that many people see her as ' a horrible killjoy ' but believes that if Coutts , who was referred to a psychiatrist as a teenager because of his murderous fantasies , had not had access to the porn sites her daughter would still be alive .
Salter said the ban was not a moral crusade but just plugging a legal loophole .
' This is not widening the law on anything that is n't already illegal , these sites are illegal but we can't block them because they take place in cyberspace , outwith the UK , ' he said .
' People like Westwood need to understand we are not being prudish , we are not ratcheting up any bans on porn , just extending the law to cover people using it and trying to reduce the market for this stuff .
No one is trying to stop consenting adults doing whatever they want in the bedroom . '
One of the sites used by Coutts is still available and another has simply changed its name after a campaign by the Mail of Sunday to close it down .

Sarah Palin : ' Not Doing This For Naught ' ' 20/20 ' Co-Anchor Elizabeth Vargas speaks with Alaska Gov. on campaign trail .
Oct. 29 , 2008  --
Down in the polls but certainly not out , Gov. Sarah Palin remains in the fight as the campaign enters its final week .
In an interview with ABC News ' Elizabeth Vargas , the Republican vice - presidential nominee was asked about 2012 , whether she was discouraged by the daily attacks on the campaign trail , and would instead pack it in and return to her home state of Alaska .
" I think that , if I were to give up and wave a white flag of surrender against some of the political shots that we 've taken , that would bring this whole …
I 'm not doing this for naught , " Palin said .
Palin said she believed in the current GOP ticket and that she was " thinking that it 's going to go our way on Tuesday , Nov. 4 .
I truly believe that the wisdom of the people will be revealed on that day , " she said .
Some sources within the campaign have suggested that Palin 's series of public statements that differ from McCain and seem to come as a surprise to the campaign are evidence of her " going rogue . "
The Alaska governor has said publicly that the campaign should have continued to fight in Michigan after McCain pulled out of the race there and she condemned the use of negative robocalls , even when McCain publicly approved of them .
Palin surprised the campaign last week when she said her medical records would be released , even though the campaign had not authorized them to be made public .
Those records have yet to be made public .
When nominated in September at the Republican National Convention , Palin called herself a " pitbull " and quickly assumed the position of campaign attack dog , aggressively attacking Sen.
Barack Obama 's relationships and questioning his judgment .
Sarah Palin Says Obama Not Un - American
Those attacks have come under increased scrutiny , as Palin has routinely linked Obama with 1960s radical Bill Ayers and today linked Obama to Rashid Khalidi , a Columbia University professor and former PLO associate .
Palin has also accused the Democrat of promoting socialism .
Vargas asked Palin if she continued to reference Obama 's relationships in order to suggest he was " un-American , " an historically loaded term .
Palin said she was not calling Obama " un-American , " but was calling attention to his record .
" [ I 'm ] not calling him un-American .
There is nothing wrong , though , with calling someone out on their record , their associations …
The association issue here , it 's not mean spirited .
It 's not negative campaigning .
It 's important and fair to the electorate . "
In her interview with Vargas , Palin stepped back from comments she made Tuesday in Ohio in which she suggested that if elected , Obama would rewrite the Constitution to allow courts to confiscate private property .
" [ I am ] asking the question , what do his comments , from back there in 2001 , candid comments that are caught on tape , what do they suggest in terms of his idea for future Supreme Court Justices , and perhaps for being able to reach some of the goals that it seems that he has in terms of redistributing other people 's wealth …
But not an explicit allegation like that , " she said .
Palin was referring to a 2001 radio interview Obama gave regarding the Supreme Court when he said , " The Supreme Court never ventured into the issues of redistribution of wealth and sort of more basic issues of political and economic justice in this society .
And to that extent , as radical as I think people tried to characterize the Warren Court , it was n't that radical .
It did n't break free from the essential constraints that were placed by the founding fathers in the Constitution , as least as it's been interpreted . "
For many years , giving large amounts of money to charity , or affecting the moral choices of major companies , has mainly been the province of elite donors and the corporations themselves .
Changing this status quo seems difficult — there ’s simply a huge divide between those who have money to give away and the power to make decisions , and those who do not .
But a new San Francisco startup called Virgance thinks there ’s a way to use social networks to give the masses power over such decisions — with the willing participation of the business world , no less .
If the company ’s ideas take off , it could have a serious effect on the way both charity and corporations work , by directly reaching into companies ’ coffers .
The idea behind Virgance is n’t just setting a bunch of people loose on a social networking application and hoping they ’ll self - organize , which is often the pie - in - the - sky hopes held by the sort that talk about the “ power ” of social networks .
People need ease of use and amusement , while companies want clearly defined , predictable returns .
Virgance is gearing up to launch two activism campaigns that are structured to achieve those aims .
Those two are a social networking application called “ Lend Me Some Sugar ” , which will allow individuals to redistribute the money that big corporations give to charity , and CarrotMob , a sort of offline business competition that rewards corporations for making sustainable choices by organizing “ buycotts ” .
Yes , that ’s the opposite of a boycott .
CarrotMob has already had one success .
Started by Brent Schulkin , who joined Virgance as a co-founder , the idea had its first run in San Francisco in April of this year .
Schulkin asked over 20 local stores to bid on the business of his group , by promising to spend a portion of the profits on energy efficiency .
The store that won bid 22 percent , in return making over nine thousand dollars from the three - hour buying spree , or around four times the receipts from a normal day .
A video about that first event is here .
Schulkin hopes to kick off similar events around the country , bringing them up to an ever - larger size to convince businesses to get into the game .
And to prove it ’s not just an idea for San Francisco liberals , an upcoming event is being planned for Kansas City .
“ Lend Me Some Sugar ” takes a rather different tack .
Big corporations all have a philanthropy budget of some size , because a percentage of profit can be donated as a tax write - off .
Really big companies face a challenge in figuring out where and how to distribute the millions of dollars they have for charity , and have internal bureaucracies that determine how to spread it around .
So for Lend , Virgance ’s other founder , Steve Newcomb , wants to give companies a new way to benefit from their philanthropy .
Say you ’re on Facebook , and you go to the Lend application .
You ’ll be presented with a certain number of points , which represent corporate charity funds .
You can then decide which of several hundred charitable organizations to send those funds to .
And what ’s more fun than giving away someone else ’s money ?
The trick is that the funds you ’re distributing are branded , so you can see , for example , that Acme Inc. is the company that ’s donating .
Acme ends up looking great — after all , you ’re getting to use its money .
If you ’re active in giving out funds , you ’ll get access to more , and can also form groups or compete to distribute philanthropic money .
Newcomb , a former founder of semantic search company Powerset ( we profiled Newcomb early this year ) says finding interested donors is “ kind of like shooting fish in a bowl ” , because Lend would effectively give the companies access to a marketing channel they ’ve never had before , as well as doing away with the difficulty of running their own internal philanthropic apparatus .
Both CarrotMob and Lend are slated for official launch later this year .
And there ’s also a plan for Virgance itself , a for - profit company , to make money in the process .
The Lend application will have advertising — Virgance will not skim off any of the charity funds .
CarrotMob will also avoid tapping the funds of users or companies , instead tapping the team event concept to sell merchandise like t- shirts , as groups start up around the country .
Another recent Facebook application to give users power over companies is Village Green Energy , which pushed several wineries to switch to renewable power .
And there ’s the grandaddy of philanthropic applications , Causes , a highly successful app that helps rally users to raise funds for non-profits .
Email scott.murray@guardian.co.uk if you wish to moan about the staggeringly easy draw Manchester United are going to get
The fourth pot of today 's Champions League draw contains some genuinely interesting names , unlike the other three which are full of the same old , same old .
There are three clubs making their bow in the competition this season - Anorthosis of Cyprus , CFR Cluj of Romania , and the magnificently monickered Borisov Automobile and Tractor Electrical of Borisov in Belarus .
Meanwhile Atletico Madrid had not made the Champions League since 1997 , but did so this time after last night 's shellacking of fancied Germans Schalke .
Their dream draw might be Liverpool , for Fernando Torres - related reasons among other perhaps more cynical ones .
Meanwhile for other romantic old - boy match - up action , BATE Borisov really should be paired up with Barcelona , for whom their academy find Alexander Hleb now plays .
It is on .
Going Not Very Far Out On A Limb dept .
Manchester United are going to get a very easy draw indeed .
You know it , I know it , we all know it .
THE POTS ARE LIKE THIS ...
POT ONE : Chelsea , Liverpool , Barcelona , Arsenal , Manchester United , Lyon , Jose Mourinho 's Internazionale ( to give them their full official name ) , Real Madrid .
POT TWO : Bayern Munich , PSV Eindhoven , Villareal , Roma , Porto , Werder Bremen , Sporting Lisbon , Juventus .
POT THREE : Marseille , Zenit St Petersburg , Steaua Bucharest , Panathinaikos , Bordeaux , Celtic , Basel , Fenerbahce .
POT FOUR : Shakhtar Donetsk , Fiorentina , Atletico Madrid , Dynamo Kiev , CFR Cluj , AaB Aalborg , Anorthosis , Borisov Automobile and Tractor Electrical Equipment .
...AND THE RULES ARE LIKE THIS
I really do n't think it 's worth bothering with the details .
Suffice to say it's all skewed in favour of the big boys , down to the rule which ensures Manchester United and Liverpool can't play on the same night for television purposes .
The wonder of sport , right here .
Doing Down
The English , It 's What The English Do Best dept .
" Did you know that Robert Pires in his last - and - slightly - knackered season at Arsenal managed to score more league goals than Hleb did in his entire Arsenal career ? " asks Paul McElroy , who is presumably a fan of the aforementioned Gunners , for he continues thus : " Not that I 'm bitter .
Expect Arsenal to get one Dutch side they should cruise past ... but do n't . "
Meanwhile a final nod to the dismal rubbish Liverpool foisted on the nation last night , because this is beginning to kick folk when they 're down and this report is all about spreading the love .
" Is everyone praying to get Liverpool ? " asks Dave Douglas .
" After yesterday 's debacle , the likes of Anorthosis , CFR Cluj and Borisov must be hoping and praying they get the golden ticket . "
Seeing Liverpool have actually lost a qualifier in a previous season yet still gone on to win the entire competition , you could possibly be jumping the gun on that one .
The draw begins , by the way , at 5 pm .
" I was at the Basel v Guimaraes game last night and the home fans felt it was a special event , " says Mark Bennett .
Do n't worry , there is a healthy dose of cynicism coming up .
" It was great to see a team 's fans really enjoy their moment , and the chance to see Barcelona / Bayern or whoever .
I remember ( I think ) when Europe was special to me , as an Arsenal fan , when these games were unique and unusual .
Now they are humdrum and routine ( except the odd San Siro trip ) .
Just hope I can get tickets for Basel v Big Guns . "
Ray Wilkins , on Sky Sports News , keeps referring to Internazionale and their " M Factor " .
" They 've got a very good manager .
They have what I like to call the M Factor . "
Stop it .
Please stop talking about Internazionale 's M Factor .
And it 's over to the draw , live from the Grimaldi Something - or - other in Monaco !
Cue pompous caterwauling and tedious montages of players shouting in an aggressive fashion - where is the love , Frank ?
Then Melanie Winiger and Pedro Pinto , whoever these toasters are , bound onto the stage and start shouting at everyone .
By all accounts , according to Pedro , last year 's Champions League was " one of the most memorable in the history of the competition " .
Was it , though ?
Was it really ?
In 53 years of European competition ?
Manchester United fans may have enjoyed it , granted , but who 's going to remember that final in a few years ti ... ah hold on , there 's John Terry slipping over .
Yeah , it was a minor classic now I come to think about it .
Pedro is n't letting Melanie get a word in edgeways !
What a rude pig !
He 's handing out some tinpot awards at the moment .
Club Goalkeeper Of The Year ... is Petr Cech .
" During the penalty shootout what was going through your mind ? " asks Pedro .
Cech replies : " STOP WASTING MY TIME , STOP WASTING EVERYONE'S TIME .
GET ON WITH THE DRAW OR I AM GOING TO KILL YOU , PEDRO , I AM GOING TO KILL YOUUUUUUUUU . "
He does n't actually say that , babbling on about how difficult it is to play in a pressure blah platitude and so on , but you can tell something is going on behind Cech 's slowly narrowing eyes .
Andrew Darbyshire picks me up for being slack : " Come on Scott .
You 're six paragraphs in and still no mention of Uefa bigwigs tucking into copious amounts of buffet food . "
Oh. Sorry .
Some of them are quite fat , I can tell you that for nothing .
One of them has stopped sucking on his foie - gras - and - butter shake to start banging on about the rules .
I simply refuse to listen to him ; I know you 'll understand .
After 15 minutes of buggering around , they 've finally started to make the draw .
The first club out of the pot is Chelsea , who will be in ... hold on , some goon is taking about ten years to open the ball and unfold the piece of paper within ...
Group A . Inter are next out , and they 're in Group B .
This is all a bit sequential .
I do n't trust this draw .
I do n't trust anyone .
Where has my love gone ?
17.17 pm : Lyon are in Group Eff .
My trust in this draw , and in love , is restored .
17.20 pm : Arsenal are in Group G. Oh this is futile .
Right , I 'm drawing up a lovely grid which I 'm going to spend the next few minutes filling in .
I did n't think this through .
Real Madrid are in Group H .
THE GROUPS ( first pot )
A : CHELSEA
B : Internazionale
C : Barcelona
D : LIVERPOOL
E ( for Easiest ) : MANCHESTER UNITED
F : Lyon
G : ARSENAL
H : Real Madrid
They 're now holding the Club Defender of the Year award .
They 're wasting my time , I tells ya .
John
Terry wins it !
Hahahahahahahahaha .
Oddly , when he comes up to collect the award , Ricardo Carvalho is n't right by his side holding his hand and guiding him through it .
Another montage , more ear - bleeding music .
I 'm getting old .
Derrick Cameron has a question or two re BATE Borisov .
" Why are n't they just called Tractor Borisov , in the manner of Torpedo Moscow , Rotor Volgograd and Helicopter Gunship Tblisi ( okay , I made that last one up ) ?
And when will they ever get to play the Tractor Boys of Ipswich ? "
THE GROUPS ( second pot )
A : CHELSEA , Roma
B : Internazionale , Werder Bremen
C : Barcelona , Sporting Lisbon
D : LIVERPOOL , PSV Eindhoven
E ( for Easiest ) : MANCHESTER UNITED , Villarreal
F : Lyon , Bayern Munich
G : ARSENAL , Porto
H : Real Madrid , Juventus
Gag of the day , right here : " Tractor Borisov ?
It sounds like a Soviet - approved children 's story , " quips Paul McElroy .
Meanwhile this is who Pedro Pinto is ; thanks to Peter Walker , because I could n't be bothered to find out .
" He 's a bafflingly popular CNN sports anchor .
He is - I believe - Portuguese and demonstrates this by saying the names of Spanish and Portuguese players in an exaggerated Iberian accent when presenting on CNN .
He has never been known to have a hair out of place . "
The Uefa - sponsored satire continues apace : First John Terry , now Frank Lampard wins Club Midfielder of the Ye ... no , I can't bring myself to finish that .
THE GROUPS ( third pot )
A : CHELSEA , Roma , Bordeaux
B : Internazionale , Werder Bremen , Panathinaikos
C : Barcelona , Sporting Lisbon , Basel
D : LIVERPOOL , PSV Eindhoven , Marseille
E ( for Easiest ) : MANCHESTER UNITED , Villarreal , CELTIC
F : Lyon , Bayern Munich , Steaua Bucharest
G : ARSENAL , Porto , Fenerbahce
H : Real Madrid , Juventus , Zenit St Petersburg
It 's time for European Club Forward Of The This Means Nothing .
And of course the winner is Cristiano Ronaldo .
At least Uefa are n't persisting with the ludicrous line that Ronaldo scored 42 goals last season from midfield , tucked away on the wing .
He floated about all over the shop up front , as far as I could make out .
THE GROUPS ( final pot ; this is the way it is )
A : CHELSEA , Roma , Bordeaux , Cluj .
B : Internazionale , Werder Bremen , Panathinaikos , Anorthosis .
C : Barcelona , Sporting Lisbon , Basel , Shakhtar Donetsk .
D : LIVERPOOL , PSV Eindhoven , Marseille , Atletico Madrid .
E ( for Easiest ) : MANCHESTER UNITED , Villarreal , CELTIC , Aalborg .
F : Lyon , Bayern Munich , Steaua Bucharest , Fiorentina .
G : ARSENAL , Porto , Fenerbahce , Dynamo Kiev .
H : Real Madrid , Juventus , Zenit St Petersburg , Borisov Automobile and Tractor Electrical Equipment .
Well , that 's a hell of a draw for Liverpool .
You would fancy Arsenal , Chelsea and Manchester United to make it through their groups , though .
And I 'd say Celtic have a fair chance of progress , given they 've beaten Manchester United at Parkhead recently , plus given Barcelona a good old rattle .
The Torres matches will be great , though , and it's fantastic to see Borisov Automobile and Tractor Electrical Equipment playing against the grandest European Cup club of all in Real Madrid .
By 2012 , All Flights Arriving At Or Departing From An EU Airport Must Participate In The Emission Trading System .
On Friday , the European Council adopted a directive that demands aviation activities must be included in the EU ’s Emission Trading System ( ETS ) .
The ETS started operations back in 2005 in an effort to curb Global Warming , and is the largest multi-country Greenhouse Gas emission trading system world - wide .
The International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) strongly objected to the decision – duh !
The IATA accounts for over 200 airlines and 93 - percent of scheduled international air traffic .
How the EU ETS works is by permitting one carbon - dioxide - tonne / year from operators where the number of permits allocated is what actually limits overall emissions .
So operators must redeem allowances commensurate to the volume of their emissions .
Of course , they can trade for these permits – hence the name .
Under the new directive , all flights arriving at or departing from an EU airport must participate in the ETS regardless if their operations are EU - based or not .
So any US - based carriers flying to and from Europe will also have to play along .
And in an effort to continue pissing off the airlines , the EU says this is just the first step in reducing emissions that cause global warming from aviation .
I say w00t !
The new legislation also contains provisions that allow for its adjustment in case third countries adopt similar measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their aviation sectors .
Also , the Council said that this provision ensures that new aircraft operators with initially very low but increasing mobility rates are not penalized by the scheme .
By 2012 , emissions from the aviation sector will be capped at 97 - percent of the annual average from the years 2004 to 2006 .
From 2013 onwards , the cap will drop to 95 - percent of these emissions .
Of the total allowances , 15 - percent of them will be auctioned off whereas the remaining 85 - percent will be allocated free of charge .
That percentage split is subject to review by the EU ETS and could change .
Excluded from the directive are system flights related to search and rescue , fire - fighting , humanitarian aid , emergency medical services and checking aircraft as well as flights performed under public service obligations ( police , customs and military ) .
While I would put this in the progress column , I ’d say it ’s better to just take the train .

Philosophy is , however , ( like science ) a communal rather than an individual pursuit .
The individual philosopher makes his or her contribution to the discipline by presenting new ideas to the philosophical community as subjects for debate and criticism .
At the end of the day , a philosopher must depend upon his or her peers to evaluate a new idea , and it is the community of philosophers which will draw out its full implications .
( See the second article in my previous post .
My present article appears in Think : Philosophy for Everyone , issue 17/18 Spring 2008 , pp. 201- 2 . ) Consistency is a virtue for trains : what we want from a philosopher is insights , whether he comes by them consistently or not .
Stephen VizinczeyWould it be wrong for a philosopher to sometimes argue for one position while at other times arguing for another , contradictory thesis ?
What should we think of a philosopher who devotes one book to proving God ’s existence , and another to defending atheism ?
The notion that it is somehow valuable for a philosopher to strive for consistency is based on a false picture of how human knowledge progresses .
If it were up to each individual philosopher to single - handedly create a comprehensive and coherent grand system , then it would be important for all of a philosopher ’s publications to agree with each other .
Many people do believe that great individual geniuses are responsible for important intellectual breakthroughs , but that impression is just an artifact of a certain way of retelling the history of ideas .
Biography is a compelling literary genre , and as a result we have many books that concentrate upon a few outstanding thinkers , and very few that tease out the complicated processes by which new knowledge is produced by communities of researchers .
It would be enormously difficult – and not very entertaining – to describe how new ideas developed through the interaction of many different people , but that must not blind us to the existence of such processes .
Once we appreciate the communal nature of philosophy , it becomes immediately clear why it is counterproductive for individual philosophers to censor their own work out of fears of inconsistency .
If someone who has published theistically - oriented work in the past suddenly comes up with an interesting line of atheistic arguments , she has a duty to share those new ideas with her peers .
It would be both unfair as well as foolishly arrogant for an individual philosopher to decide not to develop and publish lines of thought just because they do not agree with her previous work .
Philosophers should let their minds take them were they may ; in any case , it will be the community of scholars who end up separating the wheat from the chaff .
So : let a thousand flowers bloom , and let each gardener plant a thousand flowers !
Debate flashback : Batman vs. Penguin
Some brilliant spin from the Penguin .
House Minority Whip Rep. Roy Blunt , R - Mo. , right , with Minority Leader Rep. John Boehner , R - Ohio , addresses the media on Capitol Hill Friday .

Historic bailout bill clears House
Treasury ’s $ 700 billion rescue plan for the financial markets cleared Congress and was quickly signed into law by President Bush Friday , capping a remarkable 14 days in which lawmakers were thrust onto the world stage and asked to cope with an unprecedented government intervention just a month before the November elections .
Final passage came on a 263 - 171 vote in the House , which only four days before had rejected the proposal , sending Wall Street into a tailspin and impacting markets around the globe .
Advertisement
Republican support grew from 65 votes Monday to 91 ; Democrats grew their numbers from 140 to 172 , with the party ’s presidential nominee , Barack Obama , playing an important role with calls to individual members .
“ The consequences of our not acting are overwhelming , ” said House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) in a final appeal to fellow conservatives who undercut passage Monday .
“ Let ’s not kid ourselves .
We ’re in the middle of a recession .
It ’s going to be a rough ride , but it will be a whole lot rougher ride if we do n’t pass this bill . ”
It was precisely two weeks ago that Treasury Secy .
Henry Paulson first outlined the administration ’s plan to inject hundreds of billions into the markets by buying up troubled mortgage - related assets to relieve the credit crunch threatening the larger U.S. economy .
Leading economists remain divided about the wisdom of the policy .
The huge cost triggered a populist anti-Wall Street fury among many taxpayers .
But with unemployment rising again and continued turmoil in equity and credit markets , even early critics concluded that the failure to act was more perilous to the American economy than following Paulson ’s course .
The changed tone Friday morning was readily apparent .
“ On Monday I cast a blue collar vote for the American people , shook the foundations of Wall Street , demanding more accountability , ” said Rep. Zach Wamp ( R - Tenn . ) in opening debate .
“ But today I ’m going to cast a red - white - and - blue collar vote , with my hand over my heart for this country because things are really bad and we do n’t have any choice . ”
Rep. John Lewis ( D - Ga. ) , a second “ no ” vote Monday , quickly followed in announcing his support , and after taking a sometimes “ hands - off ” approach Monday , Democrats showed a new determination to get the job done .
“ She ’s not going home without a bill , ” Rep. John Larson ( D - Conn . ) told Politico , pointing toward Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s office before the vote .
And Obama is estimated to have called close to 20 members , like Rep. Elijah Cummings ( D - Md. ) , one of an estimated 18 Democrats in the Black or Hispanic Caucuses who switched to vote for the bill .
Following Monday ’s defeat in the House , the Senate stepped into the power vacuum and was pivotal to saving the bill .
Unlike House Republican leaders , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) was never tepid in his support of Paulson .
And the Treasury secretary , a Dartmouth graduate , found a kindred soul in Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - N.H. ) , who was the lead negotiator for Senate Republicans and enjoys a good personal relationship with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev . ) .
When the bill came back before the Senate Wednesday , popular tax breaks and aid to rural schools had been added to broaden support .
To reassure middle - class families scared by bank failures , a provision was included to temporarily expand federal insurance for savings deposits , raising the cap from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 .
McConnell ’s stature as leader and Gregg ’s as a fiscal conservative and former Senate Budget Committee chairman brought Republicans together behind the package .
And the 74 - 25 Senate vote spilled over to the House Friday .
Among the Republicans who switched to “ ayes ” were six from Oklahoma and Texas , two states where otherwise conservative Republican senators had chosen to support the Treasury plan .
“ I felt it last night , ” said House Majority Whip James Clyburn ( D - S.C. )
“ I heard the president was on calls , and when the report went out that four of the no ’s in Texas were switching , I knew certainly that we were OK . ”
Going forward , Paulson will have immediate authority to $ 250 billion and little trouble getting a second installment of $ 100 billion .
But Treasury will be subjected to much greater oversight than he first proposed and a future Congress could potentially deny any funding beyond the first $ 350 billion authorized in the legislation .
Taxpayers are promised a greater chance to gain some equity interest in the companies benefiting from the government aid .
And new restrictions are imposed on executive pay and severance packages for those firms which sell more than $ 300 million in securities to the government .
Treasury officials admit that it will take several weeks before the first auctions and asset managers must be hired to put the program in effect .
Together with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , Paulson is exploring how best to use new auction mechanisms not only to guide the government ’s investments but also shed new light on the real value of assets suppressed to “ fire sale ” prices after the collapse of the U.S. housing bubble .
“ Americans should also expect that it will take some time for this legislation to have its full impact on our economy , ” Bush said in a Rose Garden statement .
“ Exercising the authorities in this bill in a responsible way will require a careful analysis and deliberation .
This will be done as expeditiously as possible , but it cannot be accomplished overnight .
We 'll take the time necessary to design an effective program that achieves its objectives -- and does not waste taxpayer dollars . ”
As a practical matter , Treasury will also have to sell bonds to raise the money .
In trying to tamp down concerns in Congress , officials have said Paulson ’s early investments may be limited to just $ 50 billion a month .
But given the crisis atmosphere — and pressure already for relief in other sectors such as the auto loan industry -- others predict that the secretary may move faster and the $ 50 billion per month rate may be soon outdated .
Nonetheless , the real future of the initiative could rest on whoever succeeds Bush in January .
This may explain part of Obama ’s clout , and just as the crisis has helped him open up a lead over Republican John McCain , Obama was also able to speak to wavering Democrats as someone who could very well be running the program in four months .
By contrast , the crisis has been an unpleasant “ October Surprise ” for many Republicans .
Having been burned Monday , Boehner and Minority Whip Roy Blunt ( R. , Mo. ) were well skittish about their vote count well into Friday morning , fearful of backsliding .
And try as he did , McCain was never a major player even after he agreed to support the bill .
In fact , the intense focus on the economy appears to have hurt him politically , and Boehner ’s own admission Friday of the recession around him was more candid than he has been in the past .
Within hours of passing the Treasury bill , the House quickly approved a measure to extend jobless payments for workers who will soon be exhausting their payments .
The bill would provide seven additional weeks of payments in most cases ; 13 in those states where the unemployment rate is above 6 percent .
The action came as the Labor Department announced Friday that payrolls fell by another 159,000 in September .
In contrast to similar votes this summer , only 28 Republicans opposed the measure , and the clerk ’s tally indicates Boehner did n’t vote .
( Without his shell , McCain is simply a nut that needs to be cracked , picked apart and exposed )
By Vincent L. Guarisco Back in April 2007 , I wrote a zinger about the foolish maverick John McCain after he returned from his triumphant walkabout on the brutal streets of Baghdad .
Johnny
Boy headed straight for the public airways , where he smirkingly gushed that the streets of Iraq are now ' safe . '
The foolish war pimp tried to sell the lie that everything was cozy and secure , even as he strutted around wearing his bulletproof vest , surrounded by a heavily armed military entourage buzzing in air and on the ground all around him .
Indeed , according to McCain , Baghdad was safe then , and it 's even safer today .
Gee , pass the prozac !
I guess we 're supposed to forget about the scores of GIs and civilians who have since met their brutal end in the very place McCain pranced around .
Funny how ABC , CBS , CNN , NBC , FOX and the rest of the sorry corporate media failed to do follow - up stories , to show those same streets marred with puddles of blood laced with intestinal tracks , brain matter -- clogged with body parts and various limbs scattered about on those same safe streets .
When McCain made his announcement , more than 3,200 of his fellow servicemen and women had been slaughtered in Iraq , millions of Iraqis had been displaced , forced to flee the country or killed outright .
Today , 4,147 Americans have been killed and we 'll never know how many Iraqis , because we do n't do body counts .
Moving right along ...
I am a long - time resident and ardent voter in McCain 's conservative home state of Arizona .
I have lived near the banks of the Colorado River for the better part of 40 years .
I'm a proud progressive liberal minority living among many hard - line Republicans in my local area , although I gladly admit the times are changing .
The economic hardship under Bush 's leadership is quickly changing the political landscape , moving my locals away from their once cherished right - wing stewardship .
Thank God for small miracles ...
For me , the McCain saga began years ago .
As a young boy , I still remember hearing stories about John McCain 's legacy as a hero .
He first caught my attention when his plane got shot down during the Vietnam war and he was captured by the Viet Cong and imprisoned as a POW in the jungles of Hanoi back in 1967 .
At the time , being a young faithful lad , I prayed daily , not only for McCain , but for the safe return of all our POWs .
Our teachers and parents , unlike those of today , were diligent in keeping us updated on what was happening over there during the war .
In 1969 , I was ten years old .
I was an impressionable school kid who was encouraged by my parents and teachers to write many letters to soldiers and POWs captured in Vietnam .
I did this with great reverence ; I was proud to show my support .
Looking back on it now , it seems like a million years ago .
When I first entered the political fray I was very naive -- just beginning to learn about the worldly tribulations of war and , with puberty factored in , I was also learning the value of family morals , love and commitment .
Heck , I had just barely held the hand of my first girl friend and soon afterwards received my very first kiss .
Ah yes ,
It was an exciting , innocent time mixed with love , war , hard knocks and many pleasurable moments .
And I will never deny I was an excited impressionable boy who deeply admired my war hero , John McCain !
He was an inspiration that guided my hand for many letters written to him personally , and to other GIs as well .
To be fair , I agree with those who maintain that McCain deserves our highest respect for his devoted service to our country , including what he went through during his captivity as a POW .
Sadly , however , my respect for him abruptly ended when the mud wore off the bottom of his combat boots soon after he returned in 1973 .
He soon shattered that youthful admiration , which was replaced with a real lesson in ' betrayal ' when I realized what he had done to his first wife , Carol Shepp , after he returned from Vietnam .
Having knowledgeable parents is indeed educational , but not always pleasant to say the least .
I was completely thrown back to learn that John had several extra-marital affairs and was often unfaithful to his loyal wife who had stood by his side through thick and thin .
For me , it was a shameful , dark lesson that ultimately shadowed my view of him as I watched him heartlessly divorce her in order to further his shameful political aspirations .
As an emerging student of current events and history , my admiration for him was always a duel package .
I sincerely admired Carol as much as him .
I took great pride and interest in her too .
To me , she was one of the most admired women of her day -- a sacrosanct patriot who deserved to be seated in the front row of Fourth of July parades next to Gold Star Mothers .
She was a heroine , widely admired and loved by all of us for her unwavering devotion to her husband who was held as POW .
Carol was a rare , lonely soul who had the strength to carry on and to faithfully await her husband 's return .
And she did this at a time when many other wives and girlfriends were writing ' Dear John ' letters to those still fighting in battle while learning they had no one to come home to .
She was my revered role model from Philadelphia .
I dreamed of meeting that special someone who might be just like her -- a precious angel .
Unfortunately , Carol was thrown through the windshield of her car in a terrible accident that changed her life forever , rendering her permanently scarred and hobbling on crutches .
As a result , Carol was a not - so - pleasant sight for her young unsympathetic husband who wanted to be seen on Capital Hill with a bathing beauty while stumping the halls for a new political career .
John McCain totally destroyed my respect for him with the uncaring , selfish , cold - hearted betrayal in how he dumped her .
Indeed , I will never forget nor forgive him for the cruel way he showed his true colors .
He quickly threw Carol aside and replaced her with Cindy Hensley , his new rich sugar mama , with whom he was having an affair .
Hensley is a spoiled home wrecker , worth approximately 100 million , bred from the loins of a staunch Republican father who conveniently helped elevate Johnny boy within the DC realm .
I 'm not into Freud , but it 's easy to wonder who came so ruthlessly after McCain -- Cindy ... or her father ?
And this self - righteous , self - serving animal wants my vote ?
Well , it will have to be a Hell 's - Kitchen - burning - white - hot - winter November day in Bullhead City , Arizona before I would even consider putting a checkmark next to his pathetic name in the 2008 Presidential Election .
Catch my meaning ?
Good .
As a final note , after Carol suffered her horrible car accident in 1969 , she unselfishly refused to allow her POW husband to be notified of her serious injuries for fear it would not be good for him while he was being held captive .
You know , out here in the Arizona desert we have an old saying -- if you put an expensive skirt on a fast moving rattlesnake , political horn - dogs like John McCain will chase it all the way to the Potomac River for a kiss , a hug and especially a vote ...
I could go on about the many neocon atrocities McCain has performed throughout his career as a Senator and war pimp for the Bush administration .
It 's an endless track record -- most of which is public record , easily found for those willing to take the time .
So , for all you undecided skeptics , by all means , review his voting record for it is unbridled proof of how he constantly sold us out to K - street lobbyists .
His record speaks for itself , the facts and figures are all there which prove he's not on the side of working - class America .
In fact , by his own admission , he does not even know how many homes he owns .
And keep in mind , McCain believes Americans are not ' rich ' unless they earn $ 5 million or more .
Well , I hate to burst his multi-mansion bubble but , take a quick pop-quiz and ask a few average citizens who are now struggling to make ends meet -- how tough it is to hold onto their ' one ' home that many are just one paycheck away from losing .
Yeah , I 'd say McCain is more than a little out of touch with our bottom - feeding needs to say the least .
Or ask a dozen or so jobless Americans who have already lost everything , including their homes .
No confusion there folks .
In fact , after living in their cars for awhile or , worse yet , after sleeping on concrete sidewalks , most of them would probably consider any cheap apartment to be the equivalent of one of McCain 's many mansions .
And , bear in mind that McCain 's veteran ' brothers in arms ' are at the top of the list of homeless .
B rother John , can you spare a dime ?
McCain has ' arrived . '
He 's a real Bush kinda guy -- a marriage profiteering elitist who seems content to suffer from mansion - memory - loss and wants to be our next President .
He is a pompous philanderer who dumped his crippled wife for a new pampered rich one whose daddy got him where he is today .
Amazing .
Bottom line , many of you may have some reservations in supporting Barack Obama or Joseph Biden but , compared to Baghdad ( neocon ) Johnny , they are fricking saints .
But at least no one can deny , they are both loyal and totally committed to those they love .
Is it really that hard to believe they may actually share some of that proven compassion with us in their new leadership ?
Well , if not , consider the alternative choice .
Yes , consider the harsh implications of placing another known war hawk into the Oval office for four more grueling years .
An old stale nut who says he wants to keep us in ' safe ' Iraq for another hundred years .
A musical maniac who loves to sing : ' Bomb , bomb , bomb ... bomb Iran . '
And , oh yes -- while you 're at it , tell ' Johnny Rich ' how many mansions and condos he really owns .
But most importantly , and this is crucial , let 's remove this nut from his media protected shell , for all the world to see .
Thanks .
God speed to the polls .

Michael Phelps is n’t the only person hoping to make waves on the season premiere of Saturday Night Live this weekend .
He will be joined by Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama , who ’ll be jetting in from New Hampshire , PEOPLE has learned , but whose role in the show is like many of the voters he covets : undecided .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
“ The details of the sketch are still being worked out , ” an Obama campaign spokesperson tells PEOPLE .
This is not Obama ’s first appearance on SNL .
During the primary , he appeared opposite Amy Poehler ’s Hillary Clinton in a skit about a Halloween costume party in which Obama came dressed as … Barack Obama .
A catastrophic event 72.5 million years ago left a herd of giant , horned dinosaurs buried to become fossils .
Now scientists have identified the extinct creatures as a new species .
The fossils , found in Northwest Alberta , Canada , revealed a herd of so - called ceratopsian dinosaurs that perished together .
The animals are characterized by a bony frill on the back of the skull ornamented with smaller horns .
Parts of at least 27 individual animals were recovered at the site .
These dinosaurs also had large bony structures above their nose and eyes , which lends them their name : Pachyrhinosaurus ( thick - nosed lizard ) .
These structures probably supported horns of keratin , said researcher Philip Currie , Canada research chair of dinosaur paleobiology at the University of Alberta , who was involved in the excavations .
The new species of Pachyrhinosaurus is closely related to Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis , which is known from younger rocks near Drumheller and Lethbridge in southern Alberta , Currie said .
The newfound species is a smaller animal with many differences in the ornamental spikes and bumps on the skull .
The adults of both species have massive bosses , or protuberances , of bone in the positions where other horned dinosaurs ( like Centrosaurus and Triceratops ) have horns .
However , juveniles of the new species resemble juveniles of Centrosaurus in having horns rather than bosses .
Northwest Alberta was not previously known for dinosaur material .
In the 1970s , the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Alberta began to lead excavations and studies of the Pipestone Creek bone bed there .
The naming of the new species , Pachyrhinosaur lakustai , honors Al Lakusta , a now retired science teacher in Grande Prairie , Alberta .
" The density of the Pipestone Creek bonebed is exceptional and surpasses many of Alberta 's other ceratopsian bonebed sites , " Currie said .
" The preservation of the material is outstanding and was easy to collect .
The number of bones , from all age groups , made complex investigations possible regarding behavior and growth patterns . "
The site contains fossils from young and old individuals , allowing researchers to describe individual variations and growth patterns , investigate the possibility of sexual dimorphism , and hypothesize on a herding lifestyle .
With this new species , researchers will now have more data to give a better understanding of the ancient life and ecosystems in northwestern Alberta in the Cretaceous period , Currie said .
The study of the Pachyrhinosaurs is detailed in a book , " A New Horned Dinosaur from an Upper Cretaceous Bone Bed in Alberta , " by Currie , Wann Langston , Jr. and Darren H. Tanke ( NRC Press , 2008 ) .
" Ongoing cooperation between Grande Prairie Regional College , the Royal Tyrrell Museum and the University of Alberta has uncovered many additional sites and fossils in our region , " said Jack O'Toole , chair of the Pipestone Creek Dinosaur Project .
Andrew Neuman , executive director of the Royal Tyrrell Museum , explained the importance of the Pipestone Creek site .
" Working on a previously unknown site that is abundant in dinosaur material shows how rich the entire province of Alberta is in paleontological resources , " he said .

In the most recent case , he first sought to explain away his remarks about the economy ’s fundamental soundness by saying he had been referring to the American people , almost daring his Democratic rival , Senator Barack Obama , to contradict him on that score .
But within hours his aides were scheduling appearances for him Tuesday on all the morning television news shows so that he could try to erase the notion , being promoted aggressively by Democrats , that he was out of touch .
His campaign also sent to reporters the text of a speech he was delivering later Monday that included much starker language about the nation ’s financial troubles , and by Tuesday had produced a new advertisement asserting that his experience and leadership were necessary in a “ time of crisis . ”
Aides and advisers repeated to anyone who would listen the words that Mr. McCain has frequently spoken following his comments about the economy ’s fundamental strengths : that “ these are very , very difficult times . ”
Beyond striking a more populist tone and more explicitly acknowledging the nation ’s economic problems , his campaign also began an effort Tuesday to cast him as a strong leader with profound experience on economic issues , given his service on the Senate Commerce Committee , where he was chairman for six years .
That effort quickly hit a pothole when one of his economic advisers suggested that he had helped to create the BlackBerry , by virtue of his role in brokering telecommunications legislation ; the McCain campaign later disavowed that , calling the suggestion “ boneheaded . ”
For much of this year , Mr. McCain has seemed to struggle to strike a balance between conveying the optimism that many voters want in their leaders , and the I - feel - your - pain empathy that they crave during hard times .
His task is complicated by the tension between his plans to continue many of the economic policies of the unpopular incumbent Republican president he hopes to succeed , and his pledges to improve the American economy and shake up Washington .
As recently as January , Mr. McCain argued at a Republican debate that Americans were better off than they were eight years ago ; by this summer he had released an advertisement that said “ we ’re worse off than we were four years ago . ”
TOKYO – I do n't think Sony should go passing out this pamphlet about Game Archives , the service that lets PlayStation 3 and PSP owners download classic PSone games , to foreigners .
It only makes us feel terrible about ourselves .
I mean , seriously .
Gaze and weep upon the 239 different PSone games – from Metal Gear Solid to * Resident Evil * and even crazier games like Einhander and Policenauts – that you can download to your Sony platform of choice if you live in Japan .
In the United States there are ... a dozen ?
If that .
( I do feel kind of compelled to point out that not even Japan has Riiiidge Racerrrrr yet . )

Words can’t describe the feeling of watching Republicans madly stabbing each other in the back while their party goes down in a tidal wave election .
It ’s like the last scene of a crappy cartoon like Thundercats where the stupid villians spend their last miserable moments pointlessly attacking each other .
Apparently a six year old can’t feel as good about hating the designated bad guys if they show some dignity at the end .
To put it another way , victory + schadenfreude = win .
“ Lashing out at past Republican Congresses instead of Pelosi and Reid , and echoing your opponent ’s attacks on you instead of attacking your opponent , and spending 150,000 hard dollars on designer clothes when congressional Republicans are struggling for money , and when your senior campaign staff are blaming each other for the loss in The New York Times [ Magazine ] 10 days before the election , you ’re not doing much to energize your supporters .
The fact is , when you ’re the party standard - bearer , you have an obligation to fight to the finish .
I think they can still win .
But if they do n’t think that , they need to look at how Bob Dole finished out his campaign in 1996 and not try to take down as many Republicans with them as they can .
Instead of campaigning in Electoral College states , Dole was campaigning in places he knew he did n’t have a chance to beat Clinton , but where he could energize key House and Senate races .
I think you ’ll find these sentiments shared by MANY of my fellow Republican strategists . ”
It wo n’t last .
President Obama will give the rightwing a focus for their hate and fear .
Even better , unlike us they wo n’t have to defend anything the government does .
Every housefire and treed cat will be more evidence of Democrat perfidy .
It will be , and I ’m dead serious about this , wingnut blogger heaven .
When stupid people to have their ideas put into practice , they have to explain why it failed ( see vouchers , invading Iraq , privatizing government ) .
In the future , with the Dems in charge of everything but the Idaho State Senate there wo n’t be much danger of that .
Meanwhile we liberals will discover that do n’t all want the same thing .
Your priority list wo n’t look like mine .
Some people whose priorities conflict with some other people will declare that the other guys are as bad as the Republicans !
1!1!one !.
Some bloggers will defend Obama ’s inevitable bonehead moves , some of us wo n’t .
Thank god for the prospect of a very busy Obama DoJ .
Freddie Mac ’s roughly $ 500,000 in payments to Davis & Manafort began immediately after Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae in late 2005 disbanded an advocacy coalition that they had set up and hired Mr. Davis to run , the people familiar with the arrangement said .
From 2000 to the end of 2005 , Mr. Davis had received nearly $ 2 million as president of the coalition , the Homeownership Alliance , which the companies created to help them oppose new regulations and protect their status as federally chartered companies with implicit government backing .
That status let them borrow cheaply , helping to fuel rapid growth but also their increased purchases of the risky mortgage securities that were their downfall .

On Sunday , in an interview with CNBC and The New York Times , Mr. McCain responded to a question about Mr. Davis ’s role in the advocacy group through 2005 by saying that his campaign manager “ has had nothing to do with it since , and I ’ll be glad to have his record examined by anybody who wants to look at it . ”
Such assertions , along with McCain campaign television ads tying Mr. Obama to former Fannie Mae chiefs , have riled current and former officials of the two companies and provoked them to volunteer rebuttals .
The two officials with direct knowledge of Freddie Mac ’s post -2005 contract with Mr. Davis spoke on condition of anonymity .
Four other outside consultants , three Democrats and a Republican also speaking on condition of anonymity , said the arrangement was widely known among people involved in Freddie Mac ’s lobbying efforts .
As president of the Homeownership Alliance , Mr. Davis got $ 30,000 to $ 35,000 a month .
Mr. Davis , along with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , have characterized the alliance as a coalition of many housing industry and consumer groups to promote homeownership , but numerous current and former officials at both companies say the two mortgage companies created and bankrolled the operation to combat efforts by competitors to rein in their business .
They dissolved the group at the end of 2005 as part of cost - cutting in the wake of accounting scandals and , at Freddie Mac , a lobbying scandal that forced out its former top Republican lobbyist .
On Monday , the McCain campaign accused The New York Times of bias for reporting the payments to Mr. Davis for the alliance work from the mortgage giants .
Mr. Davis said that he had worked not for the two companies but for the advocacy group , which included other nonprofit organization as well , and was focused only on promoting homeownership .

6 Prince Assaults Sinead O'Connor ... For Cursing
In the early 90s , Sinead O'Connor scored a massive hit with her cover of the Prince - penned " Nothing Compares To You . "
Sorry , that should probably read " Nothing Compares 2 U . "
We are talking about Prince after all .
At any rate , according to O'Connor , His Purpleness was less than thrilled with her decision to cover the song since he was already planning to give it to a female protege of his , perhaps in exchange for a series of unthinkable sex acts .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
When he met with Sinead to discuss the situation , things got a bit out of hand .
And by " out of hand " we mean " they got in a goddamned fistfight . "
It started with Prince berating the shorn - locked singer for , of all things , cursing in interviews .
She replied with a diplomatic and sympathetic " go fuck yourself . "
At that point , O'Connor claims Prince became physically threatening , or at least to the extent Prince can physically threaten anyone .
At that point the two went at it , in what was probably the most effeminate fistfight of all time .
Prince used his fists , O'Connor used loogies .
" All I could do was spit .
I spat on him quite a bit , " she said .
Classy !
Not that beating women is any classier , but seriously , how would you feel if you were robbed of the chance to pass one of your most enduring tunes onto one of your talented proteges ?
Imagine the possibilities !

Oh , shit !
On a recent sunny afternoon Bob Loebelenz pauses to gaze 72 feet into the air at the spinning blades of his wind turbine , a small " clean , free electricity " smile creasing the corners of his mouth .
While giant wind turbines that supply power to utilities sprout along ridgelines across the United States , far smaller residential wind generators , like the one Mr. Loebelenz erected in 2003 to power his suburban Boston home , are still unusual in densely populated places .
That may be changing .
Across the country signs are growing that " small wind " ( a category that includes wind generators geared to supply a single home ) is catching on in suburban and even urban settings .
" My phone has been ringing off the hook , " says Mark Durrenberger , president and founder of New England Breeze , a Hudson , Mass . , wind and solar power installer .
Improved generator technology , more financial incentives , rising electric rates , and energy - security concerns have opened the way for small - wind power to bloom in unlikely places .
" Small wind really seems to be taking off for residential , small business , and farm use , " says Trudy Forsyth , leader of the distributed wind program at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden , Colo .
The installed capacity of " on grid " small - wind residential generators has almost tripled , from 1,300 kilowatts nationwide in 2006 to 3,000 kilowatts last year , says the American Wind En­­­ergy Association ( AWEA ) , a Washington - based trade organization .
The number of residential installations rose from 400 to 1,200 units in the same period .
Supplying that tiny but red - hot market are dozens of new companies that have popped up since 2000 .
Though a half - dozen companies dominate the market , AWEA tracks about 45 US manufacturers .
With demand strong overseas , too , the US is the world leader in small - wind power , exporting more than half of what it sells .
" The growth we 're now seeing in small - wind residential in the US is impressive , " says Ron Stimmel , who tracks the small - wind market for AWEA .
" Advanced technology and electronics have made these units more reliable , and more states are now offering incentives to build them . "
At least 26 states have tax or productivity incentives or other subsidies to support wind energy , Ms. Forsyth says .
But strong growth is happening even without the federal tax incentives enjoyed by solar panels and big utility - scale wind turbines , she notes .
Countervailing breezes are blowing .
Long held down by high up - front costs , lack of federal subsidies , and neighborhood opposition on aesthetic and noise grounds , small residential wind - power use continues to grow far more slowly than solar photovoltaic " panels , " experts say .
Some also oppose small - wind units claiming they are " bird Cuisinarts , " Loebelenz says , though he has never found dead birds by his unit .
Another major hurdle is zoning laws .
While few states or the 25,000 local zoning authorities have laws specific to wind power , that 's changing , Mr. Stimmel says .
Five states – Wisconsin , California , Michigan , Vermont , and New York – now prohibit local zoning laws from blanket small - wind prohibitions .
" Zoning is always an issue , it 's something we understand now and we go in prepared to show the benefits , " says Don Mosher , president of Southern New England Wind Power , based in Portsmouth , R.I .
Even so , zoning battles over wind power are increasing .
Loebelenz had to hire a lawyer .
Even then , he might have lost the fight had not an octogenarian neighbor , Beverly Ryburn , not come to his rescue by rallying others to help .
Pointing to a plaque on his tower that reads : " The Beverly , " Loebelenz notes : " I named my wind generator after her because , without her , it probably would not have been built . "
Wind power can be expensive .
Small wind turbines for homes run in the 2 - to 10 - kilowatt range .
A smaller machine can cost from $ 12,000 to $ 60,000 , installed .
A rule of thumb : Turbine systems cost about $ 6 to $ 8 per watt ( 1 kilowatt = 1,000 watts ) , installed .
Loebelenz also has a big solar array on his barn roof next to the wind turbine .
On many days , when the wind generator is humming and solar panels are cooking , he 's generating far more energy than he uses , so he sells the overage to the power company .
It 's that link to the power grid that 's been key to small - wind growth .
While wind power has long been popular for " off the grid " homes miles from power lines , growth in residential " grid tied " homes lagged until " net metering " laws were passed .
Net metering means a utility must buy back extra power .
Better wind technology has helped , too .
Lighter magnets in the generators , blades that adjust to wind conditions , and units that wirelessly report how much power they 're making – along with global - warming concerns – are creating a " perfect storm " of interest in suburban , even urban residential wind power .
" Everything we had done historically was off - grid and international , but ... about six , seven years ago really , things started percolating , " says Andy Kruse , vice president of Southwest Windpower , the nation 's largest small - wind manufacturer , in Flagstaff , Ariz .
The company 's newest small turbine – the 1.8 - kilowatt " Skystream " – is aimed at the residential market .
In February , the company said a Skystream would be erected at the Maine home of former President George H.W. Bush .
But Robin Wilson already has a Skystream wind generator atop a 45 - foot pole sticking out of her new zero-energy home in San Francisco 's Mission District .
Hers may be the first such " urban residential turbine , " though she can't be quite sure .
Ms. Wilson may have started something because San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom visited her home recently and says he 's forming a group to study the idea of expanding residential wind throughout the city .
" I love the idea of being a zero-energy home and wind is helping me get there , " says Wilson , whose neighbors " just love it " she says .
The " scimitar - style " high - tech blades emit little noise , she says , " just a little hum . "
8:22 CT : John McCain just referenced his support for the destruction of Ethanol .
Is he aware that his support is dropping in Missouri ?
Does McCain realize that he may be able to compete in Minnesota , perhaps Wisconsin maybe even Iowa .
Not anymore .
Any farmer on the fence just jumped off the McCain train .
8:32 CT : John wants a spending freeze on everything but Veteran Affairs , National Security and other important problems .
That 's a lot like saying we should only spend money on what matters .
The USA should be doing that anyway .
What about Health care ?
McCain seemed pretty concerned about Ted Kennedy in his intro , even though Ted 's at home and fine ( although he was hospitalized earlier due to the side effect of his cancer medication ) , maybe McCain should put his money where is mouth is and support universal health care if hes going to play the sympathy card .
8:34 CT : What a segue , right into health care .
John McCain said , " Obama 's plan would make health care part of the Federal Government . "
John , that 's the idea .
People pay their taxes , Obama is arguing that health care is a fundamental right of all citizens , thus it should be part of the Federal Government .
8:39 CT : How many times is John McCain going to say " I was not elected Ms. Congeniality of the United States Senate ? "
That is correct John , you were elected as a Senator .
8:46 CT : If the USA was n't in Iraq would the Administration care if there was sectarian violence ?
My guess is no , because they clearly do n't care about the violence in Sudan or Burma .
8:47 CT : Obama just attributed numerous Bush quotes to McCain ; McCain did n't fight back .
Instead he went into story time about how he toured an Iraqi market in a flack jacket .
8:55 CT : McCain just indirectly compared Iraq to Afghanistan saying we do n't need more troops , we need a diplomatic solution .
Sounds an awful lot like Obama 's stance on the surge .
8:58 CT : John McCain has taken a magical ride back to 1983 in which he opposed the Lebanon incident position of Ronald Reagan .
He then jumped forward to the First Gulf War .
I think he might be forgetting something : Keating Five .
8:59 CT : " I will wear this bracelet with honor , " John McCain says of a bracelet he is not wearing .
Maybe he should have planned ahead , to bad he was to busy disrupting the financial fix .
9:01 CT : " I have a bracelet too , " Barack Obama responds , " its from a mother who does n't want another son to die . "
9:02 CT : Obama just challenged McCain on national security .
" You do n't muddle through the central front on terror . "
9:04 CT : If Gen .
Petraeus predicts we will lose Iraq , why is he in command , that just does n't make since John .
9:04 CT : The League of Democracies ?
I think there is already something like that : The United Nations .
9:08 CT : Here comes the " without preconditions " rebuttal .
Does talking equate to legitimization ?
Last time I checked nobody legitimately died at a discussion .
9:11 CT : I consider the Iran meeting issue over .
McCain has no ground to stand on .
Henry Kissinger doomed his arguement , amongst other strong points .
Obama then played the " you do n't know where Spain is " card .
9:14 CT : " Its dangerous [ to meet without preconditions ] ... its just dangerous , " really John , why ?
He can not come up with a decent arguement .
9:18 CT : Obama can pronounce all the weird foreign names and countries while McCain struggles to pronounce " Ahmadinejad . "
9:19 CT : Where is McCain going with this , he just listed every country that used to be a Soviet satellite .
9:25 CT : Obama just pivoted away from the Russia issue into alternative energy ; he then dropped a " McCain voted against alternative energy 23 times . "
John claims that off shore drilling is a " bridge to the future . "
9:26 CT : McCain blinked on the , " will there be another 9/11 . "
He should have just said no .
9:28 CT : McCain : " I know our allies , I can work more closely with them . "
I know our allies too : Germany , England , Canada , etc .
You can look it up on Wikipedia .
9:30 CT : Obama got the first word , will McCain get the last ?
9:31 CT : SDI , never happened John .
They made that corny " Star Wars " video and it died ; mainly because it was never proven .
9:33 CT : Obama looking to end on the economy .
9:35 CT : McCain goes back to his experience , tries to link Obama to Bush ?
Do n't really understand this approach .
9:35 CT : John McCain
" I will take care of [ veterans ] , that will be my job . "
That job gets a lot easier by not fighting wars that produce veterans , or American casualties .
9:37 CT : McCain ends by stating that Vietnam Veterans were not treated properly .
Philosophy , culture , philosophy of culture , and other stuff as needed
Evo Morales

NOW with audio : Listen to Federico Fuentes ' assessment after just returning from Bolivia .
Morales seems to have outmanouevred the ultra - right 's attempts to unseat him and to have made his position stronger , while his enemies are in disarray .
He is so confident of his support in the popular social movements now that he is holding another referendum next month .

La Paz , Bolivia -- October 28 , 2008 --
After three months of intense class struggle , there can be no doubt that the US - backed right - wing opposition to the government of President Evo Morales has suffered three important defeats .
The right ’s offensive to topple Morales , which climaxed with the September 11 - 12 “ civic coup ” attempt , has been decisively rolled back by the combined action of the government and social movements .
The government secured a historic vote in its favour with more than 67 % endorsing Morales ’ mandate in a referendum in August that also revoked the mandate of two opposition prefects .
Another opposition prefect was arrested for his role in the coup .
And now Morales has secured a referendum for the new draft constitution to “ refound Bolivia ” on the basis of justice for the indigenous majority .
More importantly , a strengthened Morales government now counts on an unprecedented alliance of indigenous , peasants ’ and workers ’ organisations determined to defend their government and the Morales - led “ democratic and cultural revolution ” .
Third wave of struggle
With the turn of the century , Bolivia ’s social movements — united behind Bolivia ’s powerful indigenous peasant movement — began to rise up in opposition to neoliberalism and indigenous oppression , overthrowing two presidents and paving the way for the victory of the Morales - led Movement Towards Socialism ( MAS ) in early general elections in 2005 .
On assuming the presidency , Morales moved to nationalise Bolivia ’s gas reserves and convoke a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution — the two central demands of the mass movement .
A concerted campaign led by reactionary forces grouped around the prefects of the “ half moon ” — the eastern departments ( or provinces ) of Pando , Beni , Santa Cruz and Tarija — to wear down government support in order to pave the way for Morales ’ downfall , succeeded in stopping the advance of this process for most of 2007 .
Mistakes by the government and a relative demobilisation of the movements also contributed .
With their ability to mobilise an important social base against the government in the east around defence of “ regional autonomy ” and to stall the constituent assembly around the demand for a two - thirds majority vote on the new constitution , these forces spread their support outside of the half moon to the central departments of Cochabamba , where violent clashes occurred in January 2007 , and then Chuquisaca .
Racist attacks against indigenous people and the assembly delegates in Chiquisaca ’s capital Sucre forced the assembly to reconvene , first in a military barrack and afterwards in a different state — without the opposition — to approve the final text .
Bolivia appeared to be approaching the abyss , as regional and ethnic tensions deeply divided the country .
Victory at the ballot box
Believing that the time was right to move to get rid of Morales , the right - wing Podemos party ( which controls the Senate ) approved a law for recall referendums on Morales and the prefects .
This was also partly an attempt by Podemos to seize the initiative within the opposition from the half moon opposition prefects .
The opposition prefects , now grouped together in the National Democratic Coalition ( CONALDE ) , initially opposed the referendums .
However , following a series of meetings with US ambassador Phillip Goldberg , they agreed to accept the challenge .
A June by - election resulted in an anti-MAS prefect replacing the MAS predecessor in Chuquisaca , further lifting the right ’s hopes .
But the results of the August 10 vote demonstrated a totally different reality .
Morales ’ mandate was endorsed with an historic 67.4 % of the vote .
Morales also won in Pando , tied in Tarija and got more than 40 % in Beni and Santa Cruz , with the opposition ’s support base isolated to the main cities , encircled by MAS - aligned rural areas .
In the majority of rural electorates Morales scored over 90 % , while in poor urban areas like El Alto in the west and Plan 3000 in Santa Cruz his support was above 80 % .
Opposition prefects were also recalled in Cochabamba and La Paz .
Together with social programs that had begun to change the lives of millions , the deep connection felt with a president “ just like us ” that exists among the indigenous and poor urban sectors helps explain this result .
A coup by any other name
Fearing the government would use this victory to push ahead with a referendum on the draft Constitution , the right wing went to Plan B .
After a series of meetings between the US ambassador , US congresspeople and the half moon prefects , it was agreed to enact a plan to destabilise the east , stirring up violence to the point where either the military would be forced to react , causing deaths and Morales ’ resignation , or creating the justification for some kind of United Nations intervention to “ restore stability ” .

Small groups of balaclava - wearing thugs took over airports to create an image of a president that could not set foot in half the country , while the prefects openly talked about regional independence .
With violent attacks on indigenous people escalating , fascist youths began to target police officers and soldiers .
The aim was to stir up discontent within these institutions .
The plan was ratcheted up as paramilitaries began to appear openly together with armed youths and to take over and loot state institutions , stating that they would now come under the jurisdiction of the prefectures .
Uncertain as to the potential reaction from the people and soldiers , the government wavered on whether to send in troops .
At the same time , the right began to seek out support among high - ranking military officials .
On September 5 , a meeting was held between US embassy representatives and military figures , including the Santa Cruz - based commander of the army ’s eighth division , General Marcos Bracamonte .
Bracamonte agreed to not act against the coup plot .
The government finally decided to order the top commander of the armed forces Luis Trigo , known to have links with the Santa Cruz oligarchy , to move into Pando to take control of the situation .
He responded that he would do nothing until a presidential decree had been signed to ensure that full responsibility for any blood spilt lay with Morales .
Once in Pando , he ordered troops to remain in their barracks and turned off his phone .
According to sources in the government , Morales could not communicate with Trigo for four days .
Others in the military high command did the same .
An emergency meeting of social movements was held in Cochabamba on September 10 where they resolved to march on Santa Cruz and crush the coup - plotting offensive .
Pando massacre
In order to distract the attention of the social movements focused on Santa Cruz , the coup plotters agreed to create a crisis in Pando .
Paramilitaries ambushed and fired upon unarmed peasants travelling to a meeting of their departmental union federation .
At least 20 men , women and children were massacred , with more than 60 still missing .
A wave of revulsion spread throughout society , including among middle - class sectors in the east that the opposition had hoped to mobilise .
The social movements stepped up plans to encircle Santa Cruz .
Peasants in the rural areas of Santa Cruz cut off all access to the city .
Amidst generalised revulsion against the actions of the right , and with the social movements on the march , Morales — and the entire ministerial cabinet according to one source — signed the decree to implement martial law in Pando .
Desire for action also swept through the military , as soldiers demanded to be allowed to go and defend their indigenous brothers .
Under direct orders from Morales , new troops were sent to Pando .
After fighting off armed paramilitaries in the airport , they moved in to restore order in the capital Cobija .
Three days later , at an emergency summit of the Union of South American Nations ( Unasur ) , nine countries in the region came out strongly in defence of the Morales government and against any attempt to break up Bolivia .
Lacking international support , and with their plan unravelling , the prefects quickly called for a return to dialogue .
The right - wing gangs began to lift their roadblocks and the government regained control of public buildings .
Although many of the social movement marchers wanted to continue until they reached the central plaza of Santa Cruz , on September 23 a decision was taken to end the protest and avoid a potential confrontation and bloodbath , as there were no guarantees for the security of protesters and snipers were rumoured to be present .
Dialogue
The government stated that the dialogue would focus on two controversial issues : regional autonomy and the level of funding to the departments from the direct tax on hydrocarbons .
Meanwhile , the government stepped up its campaign to hunt down those responsible for the Pando massacre and the destruction of state property .
Pando prefect Leopoldo Fernandez , accused of ordering the massacre , had gone into hiding .
He was found and arrested .
Numerous opposition “ civic leaders ” find themselves in the same situation .
With no overall agreement reached , dialogue shifted to Congress .
Even with the votes of the other two opposition parties , MAS did not have the numbers without support from at least some Podemos deputies to achieve the required two - thirds vote of approval for a referendum on the Constitution .
The National Coalition for Change ( CONCALCAM ) , which unites more than 30 peasant , indigenous , workers ' and social organisations , together with the Bolivian Workers Central ( COB ) in a historic unity pact , decided to organise a march on Congress to ensure the approval of the law .
As a result of negotiations , the mobilisation of the social movements and the overwhelming public support for the law ’s approval , Congress voted on October 20 to hold a referendum in January .
As well as agreeing to minor modifications to around 100 of the 411 articles in the draft , the government agreed to take Morales ’ current presidential term into account under the new constitution .
This means Morales will not be able to stand for re-election in 2014 if he wins the proposed December 2009 presidential elections .
The new constitution will limit presidents to a maximum of two terms in office .
A separate referendum will be held to determine whether large landholdings will be limited to 5000 or 10,000 hectares .
The land reform proposed in the constitution will not be retroactive , but continued ownership of land will depend on landowners using the land productively .
The CONALCAM supported the decisions , arguing that they demonstrated the willingness of the government to negotiate , and announced that it will immediately begin to campaign for a “ yes ” vote .
On the other hand , while the parliamentary right have stated they will also campaign in favour of the new constitution that until recently they described as approved by a “ constituent assembly stained in blood ” , the opposition prefects have announced they will campaign for a “ no ” vote .
An important political space has opened up in the east , where broad parts of society that until now have not felt part of MAS ’s project , now openly reject the right - wing prefects who hoped to drag them into a civil war .
How MAS can reach out to these sections and consolidate its national hegemony is a crucial question in the next period .
MAS is attempting to use the issue of regional autonomy , previously used by the right , to win these sections over to an autonomy based on solidarity and national unity .
Importantly , the Morales government now also counts on the revitalised social movements , which , together with their government , successfully neutralised the fascist coup attempt .
‘ The people will decide ’
By Federico Fuentes
La Paz , Bolivia --
“ For the social movements and the Bolivian people , the approval of the new constitution is key to reversing the centuries of discrimination ” , Julio Salazar , executive secretary of the Six Federations of Coca Growers from the Tropics of Cochabamba , told Green Left Weekly .
Sitting in his office , the walls covered with posters of Bolivian President Evo Morales , who also presides over the six federations , Salazar explained that “ no matter what happens , no matter what they say , no matter what it costs , the new constitution has to be approved ” .
“ The social movements are going to mobilise in order to ensure this happens . ”
Together with a busload of cocaleros , we arrived in Caracollo on October 13 to begin the 200 - kilometre march on Congress to force that body to agree to a referendum on the new constitution that was drafted by an elected constituent assembly .
At 2 am in the morning of October 21 , Morales signed the historic law of convocation for the referendum , while more than 100,000 protesters — with whom he had spent the last 11 hours awaiting Congress ’s decision — cheered and shouted for joy .
Bolivians will now go to the polls on January 25 to vote on the draft constitution — demanded since the peasant mobilisations of the early 1990s — that will dramatically increase the rights of the historically excluded indigenous majority , expand state control over natural resources and land , and give a measure of autonomy to departments , municipalities and indigenous peoples within the framework of a united plurinational state .
Once approved , new elections will be held in December 2009 for president , vice - president , the Congress and departmental prefects .
Conversing at the start of the march , Salazar pointed to the crowd and explained : “ Before they used to say it 's just the peasants , the cocaleros , that are marching .
This time , other sectors are uniting with us : health workers , teachers , university students , neighbourhood committees , professionals are all participating in the march . ”
Pedro Montes , head of the Bolivian Workers Central ( COB ) , which joined forces with the National Coalition for Change ( CONALCAM ) to organise the march , told Green Left Weekly that the protest was a demonstration of the type of unity that was required to ensure “ the refounding of Bolivia ” .
“ Our recent national gathering voted to be part of this march .
All our regional centrals and affiliated unions will be participating ” .
Asked what would happen if some union leaders decided not to participate , Montes replied that “ the rank and file will go over the top of them ” .
“ The people have wakened up ” , said Leonilda Zurita , leader of the National Federation of Peasant Women of Bolivia–Bartolina Sisa ( FNMCB - BS ) .
“ Today , our president comes from the people , a people that have become the government .
With or without Evo , this process will continue .
“ It is the people that will decide , at the ballot box and not with arms as the oligarchs wanted …
The choice is clear : continue the process of change or return to neoliberalism . ”

Prior to the 9/11 attacks , insider trading " put options ” were placed on United and American Airlines stocks .
The speculative options on United were placed between September 6 and 7 , 2001 and on American on September 10 at the Chicago Board of Options Exchange .
A classified CIA document on the Mossad captured by Iranian militants who took over the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979 and later published in full , outlined Mossad ’s activities around the world , including " false flag " tactics and the blackmailing of U.S. officials .
Put options are bets that a stock will fall in value and the owner has the option of buing the stock at a lower rate and sell them at the highest rate , thus earning a quick windfall profit .
The put options on the two airlines ’ stock was reportedly six times higher than normal .
Other unusual " put option " activity was registered with three European reinsurance firms , Germany Re , Swiss Re , AXA of France , in addition to World Trade Center occupant Morgan Stanley Dean Witter .
There was a previous attempt to use a " false flag " terrorist attack to manipulate international markets to earn a quick profit .
According to The Washington Post , two individuals , Jay Aubrey Elliott and Rolf Dunbier , were once arrested in New York for planning to blow up the Kafue River bridge in Zambia , the only bridge servicing Zambia ’s Copperbelt Province .
At the same time , Violet Elliott , Elliott ’s wife ; Efraim Ronen , Benjamin Edoui , Yitzhak Markovitch , and Raphael Tseriano were arrested in Tel Aviv by Israeli police after the Shin Bet , Israel ’s security service , and the FBI discovered the plan to blow up the Zambian bridge in order to drive up the world ’s copper prices .
Jay Elliott had earlier visited Tel Aviv to sign up explosive experts to blow up the Zambian bridge .
Law enforcement authorities in Zambia and the United States were tipped off about the plan .
Jay Elliott and Dunbier were charged with violating the federal Neutrality Act , which forbids American citizens and foreigners in the United States from waging war against nations with which the United States is at peace .
The act has been used only rarely by the federal government , having in the past charged U.S. citizens and nationals with conspiring to commit acts of war against Haiti and Laos .
No action was taken against right - wing conspirators who used U.S. soil to plan and carry out military action against Cuba and Nicaragua .
Although the conspiracy by Israeli and American nationals against Zambia ’s railway bridge appear to have come from recent headlines , the story was published in The Washington Post on November 9 , 1966 .
The Mossad was never officially implicated in the planned attack on Zambia but the Israeli intelligence agency conducted a number of " false flag " attacks before and after 1966 .
In 1954 , Israeli Defense Minister Pinhas Lavon secretly organized a terrorist attack on the U.S. Information Service library in Cairo , Egypt , that would be conducted so the Americans would blame the Egyptian government of Gamal Abdel Nasser .
In November 1968 , King Hussein of Jordan discovered that Israel was behind the Kateb al Nasr commando group that attacked the U.S. embassy in Amman with the deaths of 29 civilians and security personnel .
Israel was hoping to cause the United States to blame Jordan for the attack .
Ilich Ramirez Sanchez , also known as " Carlos the Jackal , " maintained that it was the Mossad that killed two French police agents and a Lebanese informant in 1975 .
The two policemen , Raymond Dous and Jean Donatini , and the Lebanese informant , Michel Moukharbal , were investigating a terrorist attack on El Al Airlines at Orly Airport .
" Carlos " said Mossad was trying to frame him for the murders .

Internet radio got a boost Tuesday when the Senate approved a bill that says Congress must honor any royalty rate agreement reached between online radio stations and copyright holders .
Senators approved the Webcaster Settlement Act of 2008 , which allows stakeholders to broker a deal over royalty payments without the threat of government intervention .
The House approved the bill on Saturday , and it now heads to President Bush for his signature .
Internet radio stations are fighting a March 2007 Copyright Royalty Board decision that set royalty rates for Internet radio streaming at a price Web radio stations considered financially ruinous .
Internet radio royalties operate under a government license , so Congress would typically need to approve any deal reached by webcasters and copyright holders .
The bill approved Tuesday allows them to negotiate without that government intervention .
The two sides have until February 15 to come up with a deal on their own .
Whether the two sides are able to reach a deal remains to be seen , but Tim Westergren , founder of Internet radio station Pandora , was hopeful .
" We still have to finish up the negotiations , but now the table is set , " he wrote in a Tuesday blog post .
" Thanks to everyone for your incredible support over the past few days .
It was just extraordinary . "
Westergren issued a call to supporters on Friday to contact their representatives and senators about the issue , and those calls and e-mails reportedly helped move the legislation along .
That support " was a constant reminder to everyone involved in this process about the importance of Internet radio to music lovers and musicians alike , " he said .
" Your level of involvement was unprecedented . "
Westergren told Congress in July that current royalty rates would cost Pandora $ 18 million of its estimated $ 25 million in revenue for 2008 .
" This legislation is not the final answer but it is an essential step toward a lasting and much - needed solution , " said Jake Ward , a spokesman for Web radio coalition SaveNetRadio , of which Pandora is a member .
" Today 's approval of the Webcaster Settlement Act has cleared the way for private negotiations that hopefully will confirm Internet radio's future . "
UPDATE : President Bush signed this bill into law on October 16 .
I serve on the budget committee in the US Senate , and prior to that served as a member of the banking committee of the House of Representatives .
For the past seven years I have heard President George Bush and his administration tell us how " robust " the American economy was , and how all of its " fundamentals " were strong .
That was until a few days ago .
Now , suddenly , the American Congress – and the American nation – are being told that if Congress does not act immediately and approve a $ 700 bn Wall Street bailout proposal that the Bush " free marketeers " have written up , there will be an unprecedented economic meltdown in the United States and an unraveling of the global economy .
This proposal as presented is an unacceptable attempt to force the middle - income families of the United States to pick up the cost of fixing the horrendous economic mess that is the product of the Bush administration 's deregulatory fever and Wall Street 's insatiable greed .
If the potential danger to the American economy was not so dire , this blatant effort to essentially transfer $ 700bn up the income ladder to those at the top would be laughable .
Let me be clear .
If the economy is on the edge of collapse , we need to act .
But rescuing the American economy does not mean we have to just give away $ 700bn of taxpayer money to the banks .
Unlike the Bush administration , I believe any proposal must protect middle - income and working families from bearing the burden of this bail - out .
We must not redistribute wealth upward , to the financial houses and banks and the wealthy investors who control them .
I have proposed to my colleagues in the US Senate a four - part plan to fund responsibly whatever bail - out is necessary .
The first part is a progressive and reasonable distribution of fiscal responsibility : a five - year , 10 % surtax on the income of individuals above $ 500,000 a year , and $ 1 m a year for couples ; a requirement that the price the government pays for any mortgage assets are discounted appropriately so that government can recover the amount it paid for them ; and , finally , a programme to enable the US government to receive equity in the companies it bails out so that when the stock of these companies rises after the bailout , taxpayers have the opportunity to share in the resulting windfall .
Taken together , these measures will provide the best guarantee that at the end of five years , the government will have gotten back the money it puts into the bail - out .
Second , in addition to protecting the average American from being saddled with the cost , any serious proposal has to include reforms so that we end the type of behaviour that led to this crisis in the first place , a crisis that has endangered not only the American economy but the world economy .
Much of what has gone wrong in the US can be traced to specific legislation that broke down regulatory safety walls in the financial sector , allowing banks and others to engage in new types of risky transactions that are at the heart of this crisis .
That era of deregulation needs to be ended .
Wall Street has shown it can not be trusted to police itself .
America needs to reinstate a strong regulatory system that protects our economy , and the economies of other nations that invest in American financial instruments .
Third , the US needs to adopt some of the worker - oriented priorities of other nations so that it can address the needs of working families in our nation who are today facing very difficult times – and not just bankers and their partners in fiscal speculation .
If we can bail out Wall Street , we need to respond with equal vigour to the plight of American workers and their families .
That means , for example , creating millions of jobs through major investments in rebuilding the crumbling infrastructure of the US and in creating a new renewable energy system to address global warming .
We must also make certain that we protect more than banks : we must make sure the most vulnerable Americans do n't freeze in the winter or die because they lack access to primary healthcare .
Finally , we need to protect the international financial system from being at the mercy of giant companies that are " too big to fail , " companies which are so large that their failure would cause systemic harm to either the American or the world economy .
We need to assess which companies fall into this category and insist they are broken up .
Otherwise , the American taxpayer will continue to be on the financial hook for the risky behaviour , the mismanagement , and even the illegal conduct of these companies ' executives .
Likewise , those who work in economies interlinked with the US economy – which in our 21st century global economy is every nation – must be protected from disruption because of irresponsible or wrong decisions by corporate executives in a place far from their own .
These are the last days of the Bush administration , the most dishonest and incompetent presidency in modern American history .
I believe that is imperative that , at this important moment , the US Congress stand up for the American middle class and for fiscal integrity .
The future of the United States , and that of the global economy , is at stake .
Guerrilla artist Banksy has opened his first official exhibition in New York .
The fake pet shop aims to question " our relationship with animals and the ethics and sustainability of factory farming " .
His exhibition , at The Village Pet Store and Charcoal Grill , in Manhattan , features chicken nuggets with legs , busily dipping themselves in sauce .
The exhibition also features a fake rabbit wearing a pearl necklace , a robot monkey wearing headphones and watching TV in a cage , and a caged bird which has lost all of its feathers .
Banksy said : " New Yorkers do n't care about art , they care about pets .
So I 'm exhibiting them instead . "
Banksy 's animatronic hot - dogs have sparked complaints from people " unhappy about seeing two hot - dogs performing a sex act " , he said .
The New York Times said : " Banksy 's statements , like much of his pranksterish oeuvre , should be taken with a grain of salt .
But there 's no denying the show 's attention to comically pointed detail . "

Crawling south in the dank metre - high passage , you have to hope the crude wooden supports will keep the thick layers of clay and sand above your head from crashing down on to you .
Anyone who has been in a narrow - seam coal mine can relate to the mild sense of claustrophobia induced by a visit to Gaza 's smugglers ' tunnels , in which workers were killed at roughly the rate of three a week last month .
To get to this one , you have to lower yourself down the shaft like an ungainly monkey , gingerly placing your hands and feet on the frustratingly narrow ledges embedded in its also wooden walls .
Given the awkward access and the cramped conditions , it 's a surprise to see the lights on when you reach your destination .
Welcome to the subterranean world below Gaza 's border with Egypt .
The light bulbs are run off long cables from Rafah 's municipal power supply and in their glow , " Felix " , a cheerful 27 - year - old black Palestinian , has been using his intercom phone to talk to his Egyptian counterpart at the other end of the tunnel a kilometre away .
Beside him , the whirring electric motor is turning the long steel cables , which are hauling canisters of Egyptian - made cooking gas into Gaza .
Two hundred have arrived this morning alone .
" I spent two years doing a diploma in decoration , " Felix says .
" But I have five children to support and this is the only work I can find " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Every merchant who buys one of the prized blue canisters will pay a $ 40 ( £ 25 ) premium for the difficult and dangerous task of just transporting them , says his boss , Ahmed .
But in Gaza , where cooking gas has been virtually unobtainable , the merchants recoup that outlay , selling them on for more than $ 100 .
" Everything people lack in Gaza comes through the tunnels , " he explains .
The hundreds of tunnels ferry every possible commodity – from diesel fuel , clothing , chocolate , cigarettes and potato chips to cattle and Chinese - made motorcycles .
And reportedly even the occasional hospital patient who has been to Egypt for treatment and is then shipped on a trolley and drugged to prevent panic attacks underground .
It 's a thought - provoking irony that the tunnel network , which a United Nations report this month said was a " vital lifeline " and the " direct result " of a siege designed to weaken Hamas , is actually now putting money into the Islamic faction 's coffers .
A few hundred metres along what is left of the steel wall blown up by Hamas last January , Karim and Eyad are supervising the digging of a new , and deeper , stone and cement shaft .
Like the others , it is protected from the weather by a large tent .
The two men , both 35 , have paid the Hamas - controlled Rafah municipality 10,000 shekels ( £ 1,665 ) for permission to dig their tunnel , under new regulations .
A lean and patient dun horse repeatedly hauls a decrepit leather bucket of mud from the bottom 20 metres , right under the watchful eyes of Egyptian soldiers in a watchtower just across the border .
Eyad explains the difficulties of routing tunnels so that at the other end they will escape the attention of Egyptian forces , who have pledged to destroy them .
" We use Google Earth to plan the tunnel , " he says .
" We have to find a hidden place , a deserted house or something like that . "
In constant touch by mobile phone with an Egyptian worker – well paid for risking a prison sentence if he is discovered – and using a long pole , which can protrude above the ground , " we make a sign of where we 've got to .
Then he tells us , yes that 's the right place or move to the left or right , or go another 50 metres . "
Rafah 's Mayor , Issa al - Nashar , says the new tunnel rules drawn up by Hamas have already resulted in the " registration " of – and levies on – about half of the 400 tunnels here , thought to employ more than 6,000 workers .
Hamas officials started inspecting the tunnels last month and have drawn up an agreement under which the owners are required to pay compensation for those injured or killed in them .
The tunnels are a painful inevitability imposed by the siege , Mr Nashar says , adding : " As soon as the crossings are opened , they will be dismantled . "
The smuggled goods themselves are not being taxed by the Hamas de facto government , he insists , but acknowledges : " This is possible in the future . "
For the tunnels are now big business .
Karim , who used to work in construction in Israel , says the cost of building his tunnel is about $ 70,000 .
" I sold my car , my wife 's gold , everything to pay for it . "
But he hopes to make between $ 10,000 and $ 50,000 a month once it is fully working , 24 hours a day , seven days a week , out of which he will have to pay the 20 workers he expects to employ .
Ahmed , the boss of the other tunnel , says tunnels that are already operational are now being bought and sold at prices up to $ 150,000 .
While , on the Palestinian side , the tunnels may be operating openly , none of the operators would give their full names .
" If we want to go Egypt , we could be arrested , " explains Karim .
Israel is convinced that Hamas – through more discreet tunnels controlled by the faction – has been bringing weaponry into Gaza , but Karim says he does not to expect to be asked to smuggle arms .
" There is no market for them , " he insists .
" There is a truce with Israel , there is n't fighting between Hamas and Fatah , and there are enough weapons in Gaza already . "
Karim , who started to train in Romania as a doctor before the second intifada until he ran out of money , reflects that he would rather be doing something else than a job which has already cost 40 lives this year .
Looking down the shaft , he adds : " I may be digging my own grave . "
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was feted here Friday with what are emerging as the trademark tokens of Russian favor : oil and gas deals ; the promise of nuclear cooperation ; and , most significant , a $ 1 - billion loan to buy weapons .
Moscow agreed to lend Venezuela money to buy a wide variety of Russian weaponry and hardware , said a source in the Kremlin who spoke on condition of anonymity .
Reminiscent of Soviet loans to its Cold War allies , the deal is among a number gradually binding the two oil - rich governments , whose ties with the U.S. are strained , into tight cooperation .
Russia has gone out of its way to show off its burgeoning friendship with Chavez .
Analysts suggest that Moscow prizes Venezuela almost solely for its proximity to , and its leader ’s hostility toward , the United States .
Russia has been enraged by U.S. support of NATO membership for former Soviet states such as Ukraine and Georgia , as well as U.S. plans for an antimissile program in Poland and the Czech Republic .
If Washington pressures Moscow in the former Soviet bloc , the Russian elite has long argued , then why should n’t Russia exert its influence closer to U.S. borders ?

“ Latin America is becoming a noticeable link in the whole chain of the emerging multipolar world , ” Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said in meetings with Chavez .
“ This is obvious , and we will pay more and more attention to this area . ”
Russia sent a pair of strategic bombers to Venezuela this month for training exercises .
“ Russian soldiers , officers and generals made the best impression on our people , ” Chavez enthused during his meeting with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , Interfax news agency reported .
“ We were filled with admiration . ”
In November , Russia is expected to dispatch warships for exercises in Venezuelan waters .

Some analysts have dismissed Russia ’s interest in Venezuela as little more than an effort to battle a perception of international isolation .
“ This reflects a desperate search for partners and a desperate search for allies , ” said Lilia Shevtsova , a senior associate at the Carnegie Moscow Center .
“ Unfortunately , it ’s not only Chavez but Belarus , Hamas and Hezbollah . ”
Russia ’s crushing military intervention in Georgia last month was criticized by the West as disproportionate .
And even nations that seemed neutral or supportive of Russia ’s actions have largely balked at joining Moscow in recognizing the independence of Georgia ’s two separatist regions , South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Chavez , too , carefully avoided recognizing the regions .

“ We know well what caused the conflict , ” he said .
“ We once again express our complete and firm support for your actions . ”
In recent years , his country has ordered more than $ 3 billion of Russian weapons and military hardware , including helicopters , missile defense systems and dozens of fighter jets .
Russia also has sold Venezuela about 100,000 assault rifles and started work on two Kalashnikov plants in Venezuela , Interfax reported .
During Friday ’s meetings , Putin also said that Russia was ready to cooperate with Venezuela on nuclear energy .
Their ministries signed a memorandum of understanding that sets out plans for an energy consortium .
The deal would give Russian companies greater access to fields in Venezuela , which would reap billions of dollars in Russian investments .

WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
Lucas and McGee 's split has been formally recognised by the courts Comedian Matt Lucas and his partner Kevin McGee are splitting up , in what has been described as the first " gay divorce " .
So what 's different about the break - up of a civil partnership ?
With the news hitting the headlines of the first celebrity " gay divorce " of Matt Lucas and Kevin McGee , following within days of Madonna and Guy 's much publicised separation , certain important questions arise .
Is gay divorce any different to straight divorce ?
Will divorcing gay couples receive the same sort of hefty divorce settlements that have given London the title " Divorce Capital of the World " ?
Despite the fact that the courts have been carving up the assets of husbands and wives for years , it is still quite difficult to accurately predict what someone like Guy Ritchie will receive .
It is even less clear in relation to gay couples since there have been so few cases to draw upon .
Civil partnerships only began in 2005 .
Matt and Kevin entered their civil partnership in December 2006 , making their marriage only 22 months long .
THE ANSWER
It 's a dissolution , not a divorce
In most aspects it is the same as a divorce
But adultery cannot be cited as a reason
And maintenance is less likely to be an issue
So are the rules the same for gay couples getting divorced ?
Yes , virtually all of the same rules apply .
As with straight couples , gay couples must have been married for at least 12 months before they can file for a divorce ( or " dissolution " as it is known ) .
Although Lucas and McGee announced in June that they would split , this week a decree nisi was ruled by London 's family court , in the same way that it would for a married couple .
All the same grounds apply for a gay couple , save that " adultery " cannot be used since it is technically only possible to commit adultery within a relationship between two people of opposite sexes .
Consequently , in same - sex unions , it is not applicable , although would probably be described as " unreasonable behaviour " .
Splitting the assets
On the issue of whether money would be divided up in the same way as for straight couples , the courts have been at pains to emphasise that there should be no discrimination and that exactly the same principles apply .
This means that they can each claim for a share of the capital assets , for properties to be transferred to each other , for their pensions to be shared and for ongoing maintenance payments .
It is most unlikely that Kevin McGee will get half of Matt Lucas 's wealth , for the same reasons that Guy Ritchie will not get half of Madonna 's wealth
Divorce solicitor Anne Kay
The fact that the same claims are theoretically available does not mean that they will be appropriate in every case .
Gay unions are statistically less likely to produce children and therefore it is likely that less maintenance orders will be made .
That is because such orders often arise because a spouse has given up work to care for children , making that spouse financially dependent on the other and therefore in need of maintenance after a split .
It is most unlikely that Kevin McGee will get half of Matt Lucas 's wealth , for the same reasons that Guy Ritchie will not get half of Madonna 's wealth .
Both Madonna and Lucas were well - known and wealthy prior to getting married and their relationships have been fairly short , particularly so in relation to Matt and Kevin .
The court takes into account a number of factors when deciding on the right award to make .
These include : • the length of the marriage / civil partnership • their ages • whether there are children • how much money each had before the marriage / civil partnership • how much they have each contributed both in monetary and non-monetary terms to the relationship
There is no easy answer to what Guy Ritchie or Kevin McGee will receive as the manner in which courts treat the division of assets on divorce depends very much on the individual facts of the case .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular feature in the BBC News Magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
This is why Heather Mills - McCartney only received what amounted to 6 % of Sir Paul 's assets whilst Beverley Charman ( in one of the largest reported British divorces ) walked away with 37 % of the assets ( just under £ 48 million ) .
It will , however , be important for the courts to demonstrate that what Kevin McGee receives is the same award that a wife in his situation would have received .
Unless the courts can show there is an even playing field , there will inevitably follow a number of human rights act cases initiated by gay divorcees complaining that the treatment they have received amounts to discrimination .

The mood over Sarah Palin is changing .
Her political naysayers used to delight in her floundering her way through interviews ( okay , that one interview with Charlie Gibson ) .
They enjoyed pointing out her lack of credentials .
But her interview with Katie Couric over the past two nights has elicited a different response — like cringing .
No longer is there joy in Palin ’s struggles .
Watching her has become like watching one of those hopeless singers trying out for American Idol : First you laugh .
Then you laugh some more .
Maybe after that you laugh a little bit more .
And as the talentless contestant soldiers on , despite the judges ’ derision , it hits you that this person , despite their best efforts , does n’t even realize that they do n’t have what it takes .
And that makes you kind of sad .
• Alessandra Stanley writes that “ in some ways it was the worst ” interview Palin has done .
The exchange on Russia was “ startling , ” her answer “ surprisingly wobbly . ”
While it ’s “ perhaps understandable ” that Palin “ felt nervous , ” it still “ was n’t a reassuring performance . ” [ NYT ]
• Howard Kurtz says Palin “ struggled at times and appeared less comfortable than ” in her interview with Charlie Gibson . [ WP ]
• James Rainey calls Palin “ rambling , marginally responsive and even more adrift than during her network debut with ABC ’s Charles Gibson . ”
On the bailout , Palin meandered “ off in fruitless pursuit of coherence ” ; on Russia , she did n’t have an answer even though “ anyone south of the Arctic Circle would have seen [ the ] question coming . ” [ LAT ]
• Steve Benen tries to watch the interview from “ the perspective of an earnest Republican observer , who cares about the country , and who takes policy issues seriously . ”
The conclusion is that , regardless of how Palin got here , “ reasonable people should agree that the Republican vice presidential nominee is way out of her depth , and has no business seeking national office . ” [ Political Animal / Washington Monthly ]
• Earnest Republican observer Ross Douthat can’t link to video of the interview because it ’s “ too painful , ” but seems to admit he was wrong in his earlier advocacy for Palin .
Of course , it ’s always possible that it ’s all “ just effing brilliant rope - a - dope for the Biden debate . ” [ Atlantic ]
• Another earnest Republican observer , Kathleen Parker , thinks that Palin has been revealed as someone “ Who Is Clearly Out Of Her League . ”
Because Palin is a woman , “ we are reluctant to say what is painfully true . ”
But it is true : “ If BS were currency , Palin could bail out Wall Street herself . ” [ Corner / National Review ]
• Michael Crowley says the “ real story ” may be “ percolating fear at McCain HQ that Palin ’s stock may be headed the way of Lehman Brothers . ”
Why else did McCain do an interview with CBS on the same day as Palin unless to overshadow her ?
[ Stump / New Republic ]
• Andrew Romano notes that Palin has “ certainly benefited from the fact that the bailout brouhaha prevented a pair of less - than - flattering exchanges with Couric from making the sort of impact they would have made had Mr. McCain not , in fact , gone to Washington . ” [ Stumper / Newsweek ]
• Chuck Todd and friends concur that without “ McCain ’s debate gambit , Palin ’s near - disastrous two - part interview with Katie Couric would be dominating the political discussion right now . ”
The only upside is that Palin “ has moved her debate expectations to an all - time low . ” [ First Read / MSNBC ]
• Kevin Drum claims “ you ca n’t watch this clip from Sarah Palin ’s interview with Katie Couric without wondering if she ’s completely cracked under the pressure of running for vice president . ”
It ’s gotten to the point where Drum does n’t “ even feel right making snarky jokes about this stuff anymore . ” [ Mother Jones ]
• That ’s not an issue for Karen Tumulty , who wonders if the Russian invasion scenario described by Palin is cribbed from Red Dawn .
[ Swampland / Time ]
• Marc Ambinder notes that in “ another tough interview , ” Palin answered “ a question about how she would spread democracy by agreeing that , indeed , one should spread democracy . ” [ Atlantic ]
• Alex Koppelman and Mark Schone write that the interview “ was memorable for how badly Palin performed . ”
As her voice shook , Palin “ was once again Miss South Carolina Teen USA . ” [ War Room / Salon ]
• Greg Sargent writes that “ it ’s pretty close to impossible to work out exactly what ” Palin was saying in her answer on U.S. - Israeli relations .
[ Election Central / TPM ]
• Rod Dreher is “ well and truly embarrassed ” for Palin .
She ’s “ a good woman who might well be a great governor of Alaska , ” but this was a “ train wreck . ” [ Crunchy Con/ Beliefnet ]
• Christopher Beam brings together some “ professional media trainers ” to offer suggestions for how Palin can improve her interviews , such as giving more details , not repeating yourself ten times , and avoiding a dependency on catchphrases .

Brokaw : Rove revealed how Bush would win in Ohio David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday October 23 , 2008
Print This Email This Veteran jounalist Tom Brokaw reminisced on Wednesday about President Bush 's unexpected reelection victory in 2004 and how Karl Rove had confidently explained to him the preceding weekend just where they would pull it out .
Brokaw told the Daily Show's Jon Stewart that both the Obama and the McCain campaigns are currently well aware that Obama holds a substantial lead .
" But I remember , " Brokaw cautioned , " four years ago , John Kerry on a Wednesday night before the election said to me , ' Tom , no incumbent president who is under 50 % at this stage has ever been re-elected . ' "
" And on Friday , Osama bin Laden came out with a tape , " continued Brokaw .
" On the weekend I went down to interview the president , and Karl Rove and company took me through the map , how they were going to win in the southeastern corner of Ohio and how they were going to be competitive in other areas .
And I came back and I , uh , ' I think they 're going to pull this one off . ' "
Southeastern Ohio is the section bordering West Virginia that has recently drawn unfavorable attention for the overt racism of its Palin supporters .
It was these rural areas of Ohio that were crucial to Bush 's 2004 victory in that state , and thus in the nation as a whole .
As described by the National Journal , " On Election Night 2004 , as returns from Ohio began pouring in , Democrats turned giddy .
... The Democrats ' euphoria was prompted by reports that their Ohio strategy of maximizing voter turnout in their urban strongholds had swamped President Bush and would enable Democratic challenger John Kerry to win the state 's 20 electoral votes .
... But the Democrats ' glee proved short - lived .
Bush 's re-election campaign , using sophisticated voter identification and turnout techniques in suburban and exurban Ohio , had greatly boosted the GOP 's own numbers at the polls .
...
Bush went on to carry Ohio by fewer than 120,000 votes out of more than 5.6 million cast . "
Voting activist Bob Fitrakis has described the events in Ohio more skeptically , writing , " In investigating the 2004 election in Ohio  examining pollbooks , talking to pollworkers and election officials , as well as reading local newspaper accounts  we could find no data of a late surge to the polls by born - again Christians .
What we did find is certified voting totals in areas favoring Bush that didnt match the number of voters who officially signed - in on the poll sign - in sheets . "
It is clear that Brokaw 's offhand remark will give election activists like Fitrakis much to ponder .

Is there enough married sex shown or talked about on television ?
That intrepid defender of the nation 's video morals , the Parents Television Council , says no .
" Sex in the context of marriage is either nonexistent on prime - time broadcast television , or is depicted as a burdensome rather than as an expression of love and commitment , " a new PTC report concludes .
" By contrast , extramarital or adulterous sexual relationships are depicted with greater frequency and overwhelmingly , as a positive experience . "
Now I 'm sure that plenty of couch potatoes would n't mind seeing Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie get connubial on the telly .
That , of course , is not what the PTC wants .
Its new report , Happily Never After : How Hollywood Favors Adultery and Promiscuity Over Marital Intimacy on Prime Time Broadcast Television , laments that scripted references to out - of - wedlock sex outnumber the married kind by three to one .
As for scenes " depicting or implying sex between non-married partners " — well , as you might guess , they stomp the married scenes by a ratio of four to one .
Outré takes
Even worse , however , is TV 's focus on " outré sexual expression " — a term that makes me want to shave my head and sit in a cafe reading a leather - bound edition of the works of Michel Foucault .
" Today more than ever teens are exposed to a host of once - taboo sexual behaviors , " the PTC report warns , " including threesomes , partner swapping , pedophilia , necrophilia , bestiality , and sex with prostitutes , to say nothing of the now - common depictions of strippers , references to masturbation , pornography , sex toys , and kinky or fetishistic behaviors . "
I hope that my students do n't read this survey ( I teach history at UC - Santa Cruz ) , because many of them cultivate the good habit of not watching TV .
These revelations might make them get started .
The PTC folks , on the other hand , have definitely had their eyes glued to the set .
For this report they audited every single scripted prime time entertainment show on ABC , CBS , CW , Fox , and NBC for the first four weeks of the 2007 - 2008 TV season .
That 's 207.5 programming hours .
Here 's some more socially destabilizing stuff that the PTC found :
References to cheating on a spouse outnumbered references to married sex by 2:1 across all the broadcast networks .
It 's really bad during The Family Hour .
The study does n't say when exactly that hour is time - wise , but it 's the sixty minutes when kids watch the most .
During that time slot , nonmarried nookie apparently stomps the married kind by 3.9:1 .
Visual depictions of some third - party taping or watching while sex happens outnumbered visual references to married sex by 2.7:1 .
" Wait for it . . . "
The ABC Network wins the prize for references to married sex , PTC says , but a lot of them were negative .
Apparently the group thinks you wo n't laugh when you read some of the scripts they excerpted .
Here 's one from a marriage therapy scene in the Carpoolers .
Woman :
He told me he would rather have sex with a catcher 's mitt .
Man :
No , what I said was I 'd rather have sex with a mailbox .
Therapist :
On top of being a very hurtful comment , I think that 's a federal crime .
Admit it , you 'd like another .
Ok .
Here 's one from How I Met Your Mother .
Marshall :
If Lily and I have sex twice a week , which , let 's be honest , we all know is being conservative , and we 've been together 10 years , plus 17 more times on the honeymoon , minus the two - week drought when I said the checker at the grocery store looked like a young Lily , then , we have had sex a total of , wait for it , 1,053 - 1/2 times .
While you 're trying to figure out why you should disapprove of that last quote , read this nonmarried sexual reference that the PTC does n't like from ABC's Dirty Sexy Money .
Jeremy : Someone just came in .
Natalie :
So we 'll have a three - way !
Somebody actually got paid to write that ?
There 's the scandal here .
But the report does n't just focus on ABC 's crimes .
Here 's a hot tip :
At NBC , references to " incest , pedophilia , partner swapping , prostitution , threesomes , transsexuals / transvestites , bestiality , and necrophilia combined outnumbered references to sex in marriage by a ratio of 27:1 . "
In fact , in the 46 hours of programming that PTC surveyed , its auditors found but a single reference to marital sex .
Now you know which network to watch .
CW and Fox have less extreme ratios , but the PTC does n't approve of them either .
ABC rules the commercial airwaves when it comes to fornication
Diddling for dollars
What does the Parents Television Council conclude from these findings ?
It notes that the Federal Communications Commission has of late stepped up its enforcement of its decency rules , " but clearly the FCC 's enforcement actions to date have done little or nothing to deter broadcasters from exploring once - taboo subject matter . "
More recently " FCC enforcement has stalled in the face of court challenges from the networks . "
This will suggest to many , if not the PTC , that the FCC 's recent indecency rampage has been futile — not to mention unlawful .
But the survey does hint that the Council is now looking elsewhere to wield its might , namely at advertisers .
They too " must be held accountable for the messages they underwrite with their advertising dollars , " the PTC notes .
" Only when corporate sponsors band together in the name of responsible entertainment can we expect to see meaningful change from the broadcast industry . "
Further reading :
A recent enquiry on the ACCU mailing list asked which programming language would be most suitable for a beginner .
The general response favoured Python .
This should come as no surprise : elsewhere , Python ’s benevolent dictator for life explains :
how his funky title came about , and how ( somewhat to his surprise ) Python has become increasingly popular for teaching and as a first language .
Hang on though !
Back on the mailing list Mike Small voiced his dissent and spoke up for Perl .
… I also think the online Perl documentation blows away the online Python docs .
One I can read for entertainment .
The other has just the bare facts and is dull , although not as bad as the run of the mill doxygen - type tool generated , fill in the required fields docs you get for mainstream stuff like Java or .
NET .
Compare … http://perldoc.perl.org/perlbot.html … with …
http://docs.python.org/ref/types.html
( if that ’s an unfair comparison someone feel free to find me an excerpt from the standard python docs that is n’t a complete snore - fest ) .
Well , this did surprise me , primarily because it seemed such an unusual charge .
It ’s hard — harder than generally acknowledged , I think — to write good documentation .
In the case of a language reference manual or a standard library user guide , “ good ” would mean accurate , accessible and written as simply as possible .
Surely entertainment value does n’t get a look in ?
What ’s more , for a language up there with Perl and Python , many readers face text written by an author from a different culture and in a language which may not be their first .
Irony and wit easily get mistranslated .
Most jokes in software and its documentation fall flat .
If it ’s hard to write clearly , it ’s almost impossible to write clearly and entertainingly .
Guido van Rossum may be a fan of Monty Python , but I imagine he ’s happy leave the humour up to experts like Cleese et al .
Maybe .
On the other hand , even the driest reference in computer programming makes space for an amusing — and informative — limerick .
I happen to think the standard Python documentation is generally very good .
I would n’t recommend Python as a language for learners if this was n’t the case .
But perhaps Mike Small has a point .
The very best software writers can entertain and amuse as well as inform — Donald Knuth being the outstanding example .
“ The Art of Computer Programming ” manages to be academic without being dry , a readable reference .
Classics like Jon Bentley ’s “ Programming Pearls ” and Abelson and Sussman ’s “ Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ” also show what can be achieved .
From what I ’ve read of his , Larry Wall is up there too , and his wit and linguistic energy shine through Perl , even if he did n’t personally document all of it .
We must n’t equate “ entertaining ” with “ funny ” .
The Unix documentation ( available at terminal near you via man or info ) is hardly a chuckle - fest , but its vigour and clarity make it a fine read .
Although it never aims to amuse , sometimes its deadpan delivery makes me laugh .
Here ’s the BSD documentation for a handy but non-standard C string function :
Note that because strlcpy ( 3 ) is not defined in any standards , it should only be used when portability is not a concern .
Typing man gamma on a nearby Linux box generates the painfully funny story of the confusion surrounding the naming and usage of the Gamma function .
HISTORY 4.2BSD had a gamma( ) that computed ln( |Gamma ( |x| ) | ) , leaving the sign of Gamma ( |x| ) in the external integer signgam .
In 4.3BSD the name was changed to lgamma( ) , and the man page promises “ At some time in the future the name gamma will be rehabilitated and used for the Gamma function ”
This did indeed happen in 4.4BSD , where gamma ( ) computes the Gamma function ( with no effect on signgam ) .
However , this came too late , and we now have tgamma( ) , the “ true gamma ” function .
CONFORMING TO 4.2BSD .
Compatible with previous mistakes .
In the main , though , the Unix documentation is plain , understated and accurate .
It sets the standard for written software reference documentation .
Maybe this is why Mike enjoys the Perl documentation ?
I ’ve heard Perl described as “ shell on steroids ” ; and while the Perl documentation does have the look and feel of a man page , there ’s also something a bit more pumped up and manic about it .
What about the standard Python documentation ?
Certainly , it aims for a friendly , informal tone .
Here ’s an excerpt from the tutorial introduction :
By the way , the language is named after the BBC show “ Monty Python ’s Flying Circus ” and has nothing to do with nasty reptiles .
Making references to Monty Python skits in documentation is not only allowed , it is encouraged !
Later , this same tutorial makes good on that promise , taking us through the subtleties of keyword arguments with reference to the famous dead parrot sketch .
Functions can also be called using keyword arguments of the form “ keyword = value ” .
For instance , the following function : def parrot ( voltage , state= ' a stiff ' , action= ' voom ' , type= ' Norwegian Blue ' ) : print " -- This parrot would n't " , action , print " if you put " , voltage , " volts through it . " print " -- Lovely plumage , the " , type print " -- It 's " , state , " ! " could be called in any of the following ways : parrot ( 1000 ) parrot ( action = ' VOOOOOM ' , voltage = 1000000 ) parrot ( ' a thousand ' , state = ' pushing up the daisies ' ) parrot ( ' a million ' , ' bereft of life ' , ' jump ' )
Well , I guess it beats the weary employee database examples found in so many programming texts .
Sadly , though , the parrot sketch has been repeated too often , and in this case the “ snore - fest ” epithet sticks .
Mike talks explicitly about “ online documentation ” , and these days online ( for programmers , at least ) implies :
a decent browser
plenty of pixels
a high bandwidth connection
javascript
excellent graphics
a means to collaborate and contribute
These factors , in combination , enable some novel possibilities for documentation .
Hyperlinks provide basic navigation ; mix in folding documentation and search facilities , and readers quickly find what they ’re looking for .
There ’s ample space for examples and comments , for contributions , for diagrams , for audio and video content .
Why bother reading how to create a graphical user interface using wxPython , for example , when you can effectively look over someone ’s shoulder while they walk through its features ?
I said earlier that the Unix documentation set the standard for written documentation .
If you ’re reading at a terminal 40 rows deep and 72 columns wide , with limited font rendering and graphical capabilities , you could n’t do better .
If you have a larger screen and more than one monitor , maybe you can .
Returning to Mike Small ’s challenge :
… someone feel free to find me an excerpt from the standard python docs that is n’t a complete snore - fest .
I can see where he ’s coming from , but I disagree .
In my opinion the Python documentation is well - organised , accessible and accurate .
The documentation for some modules may be rather thin , but that ’s the strongest criticism I would make .
I do struggle to single out an entertaining excerpt , though : the documentation aims to inform , and at that it does well .
If you ’re prepared to venture away from docs .
python.org , you ’ll find the Python community is served by some talented and entertaining writers .
I ’ve mentioned the Python Cookbook before : the entire text can now be found online , but I recommend getting hold of hard - copy so you can sit down and read it from cover to cover — definite armchair material .
Many programmers contributed recipes to the book but it ’s pulled together by some skillful editing and by the fine essays which introduce each chapter .
Tim Peters introduces the chapter on Searching and Sorting and if you scratch at Python a little harder you ’ll find plenty more written by him .
Here are his notes on Python ’s hybrid sort algorithm .
Here ’s the implementation .
Enjoy !

Remember when Bill Clinton insisted that " I am still relevant " ?
I wonder if Congress is relevant any more .
Yesterday , when Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke advocated legislation that divests Congress of most of its constitutional powers regarding the economy , members of Congress meekly sat there , instead of calling the Sergeant at Arms and having Paulson and Bernanke arrested .
Now Bruce Fein , a careful constitutional scholar and Reagan Administration legal advisor , calls on Congress to exercise another of its powers — to hold impeachment hearings regarding the lies that Dick Cheney told Dick Armey in his effort to get Armey ’s support for the Iraq War .
Will the majority Democrat Congress do its duty ?
Or will it merely coast to victory without rocking the boat ?
Perhaps candidate McCain should attack this Congress head on : " why do you complain about Bush - Cheney ’s power grabs , when you fail to use the constitutional power that you already have ? "
Or , perhaps not .

Peter Cook is Not A Pervert or So He Says ...
A few month 's backandplayed out their messy divorce battle in front of the world .
The model left her husband because he had an affair with his 18 year old assistant .
Now Cook is looking to clear up our misconceptions about his tarnished image and clue us in on why this happened .
Peter sat down with Barbara Walters to set the record straight and the interview will air this Friday on ABC 's 20/20 .
Peter , who readily admitted to the affair , said that there was a lot of " misinformation in the courtroom . "
Giving Barbara a little insight into his married life with Christie , he said :
" I wanted a little acknowledgment , a little attention , a little thank you every now and then for my efforts , for the amount of time it took to care for her and my family , for the wealth I was building .
Just the tremendous amount of work I was putting into my family .... my world became her world .
It had to be that way . "
Is he kidding with a statement like that ?
He wanted to be showered with thank you 's - and so does every other married person in America .
That constant feedback just does n't happen in the average marriage - at least not with the kind of regularity that he seems to have been craving .
It is more likely that this guy needed to be the center of the universe and picked the teenager to puff up his ego .
Brinkley 's attorney said he may face legal action for speaking out about the divorce and breaking the confidentiality agreement .
Check out Barbara WaWa on Friday to see what else the joker has to say .
From the show promos , about the only thing that he cleared up for us is that he really is a loser .

Police smash mile - long VODKA pipeline running from Russia into Europe
Police have intercepted an illegal vodka pipeline between Russia and Estonia .
Officials in the former Soviet state , now an EU member , revealed details of their four - year investigation into the illicit supply channel .
Eleven suspects have been charged over the one - mile pipe , submerged in a reservoir near the town of Narva , which pumped the alcohol across the border .
Vodka plot :
The pipeline was allegedly used to pump illegal booze to the Estonian city of Narva , above
Connection : Vodka is a third more expensive in Estonia
They face five years in prison if convicted .
Complex negotiations with Russia resulted in lengthy delays in bringing charges .
' It might sound weird and unbelievable but it's a very real criminal case , ' said prosecution spokesman Mari Luuk .
The pipeline was discovered after customs officers in the Estonian capital Tallinn seized 1,159 litres of vodka which they allege came through it .
Vodka is a third cheaper in Russia than Estonia .
Four Russian men are the alleged ring leaders .
According to prosecutors , the men had pumped at least 6,200 litres of illegal spirit to Estonia , avoiding paying £ 46,000 in excise duty .
Price war :
An elderly woman sells vodka in Moscow .
The spirit is one third cheaper in Russia
Ms Luuk said : ' The investigation also revealed that the men had tried to sell some of the alcohol in Tallinn in early November 2004 , but the quality of the spirit was too bad and no buyers were found .
' They then transported their cargo back to Narva and later managed to sell it in Tartu , the second - largest town in Estonia .
A similar vodka pipeline between Russia and Estonia was discovered in the Narva River by Estonian border guards in 2006 .
' That time the pipeline was discovered before it was in use , ' Ms. Luuk added .
The long forgotten ' oil crisis ' of just a few months ago has been replaced by a full blown ' credit crisis ' - related events that represent the unravelling of half a century of unsustainable trends in oil consumption and debt .
These two ingredients have been used in a special ' compound growth formula ' to finance the construction of suburbia and fuel the ( un ) happy residents on their long journey to work and home again via the shopping mall , so they could spend more than their earnings on stuff to put beside the TV and inside the microwave oven .
Environmentalists have tried to teach economists a thing or two about sustainability over recent years , largely without success .
However , even within the narrow world view of economists , the trends in credit growth could be clearly seen to be unsustainable ( unless your name is Alan ' I made a mistake ' Greenspan ) .
That oil consumption could not grow forever comes as no surprise to a global community aware of ' peak oil ' , but the inevitability of oil depletion will remain hidden from economists ; lost as it will be in a crisis of their own making .
The Growing Gap : Oil Imports
This is a global crisis , but the US dollar is our global currency , so the story centers on that country .
Exhibit A is the growing gap since 1950 between domestic oil production in the United States and oil consumption .
In theory of course , it is possible to produce many other ' real things ' to export to the rest of the world to earn those oil imports .
For three decades , the United States did that quite successfully .
Oil was relatively cheap and booming domestic industries had lots to export .
Eventually though , manufacturing moved overseas to developing nations where it could be done more ' efficiently ' .
Instead of developing other ' real things ' , the United States turned to credit and the power of its US dollar hegemony to keep the consumer economy ticking .
Based on this next chart , I suggest that the descent into a ' fake things ' economy began around 1990 when household net worth started to decline .
Credit : The Long Term View
Exhibit B is an even more remarkable and longer term view of the role of credit in the economy of the United States , Britain and Australia .
The world has been on an incredible credit ride since as far back as 1950 .
The steep climb over the last ten years screams ' jump ' and indeed that is what we have just done .
Source : Steve Keen at www.debtdeflation.com
For those of you asking the obvious question about what happened in Australia back in 1890 , there is this paper from the Reserve Bank of Australia : Two Depressions , One Banking Collapse .
The current crisis looks far more like the 1890's than the 1930's , although I find such distant historical parallels hard to comprehend at the best of times .
The end of the gold standard in 1971 is also an important part of this story - a monetary system backed by gold could not have permitted such a rapid rise in fake wealth .
An even more fundamental change to our system of currency may be needed to get us out of this mess and reach a true state of enlightenment and sustainability .
The link between Oil and Credit
The explanation below for how trends in oil consumption and credit are linked is taken from the ASPO USA Peak Oil Review : 20 October 2008 .

Commentary : Peak Oil and the Current Economic Opportunity
Richard E Vodra , CFP
The run-up to Peak Oil was a major factor in the current economic crisis , and the changes emerging from the crisis may help us deal better with the challenges of the coming decade .
The financial problems that emerged in the summer of 2007 led to the collapse of Bear Stearns in March , the nationalization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and a cascade of subsequent events , policies , and impacts that continues as this is being written .
The nature of the crisis started from the fact that the large financial institutions – banks , hedge funds , pension funds , and such – have created and used a lot of securities that are either mispriced or hard to value .
They ’ve taken a lot of home loans that are “ sub - prime ” ( the borrowers had little income or wealth compared to the loan size ; there was too much loan - to - value ; future payments would be beyond the borrowers ’ ability to pay , etc ) , put them together into large packages ( mortgage - backed securities , or MBS ) , secured high ratings for the bonds ( higher than the component loans justified ) , and sold them to domestic and foreign lenders / investors looking for high , secure yields .
At the same time , another industry was created selling “ insurance ” on whether these or other loans might default , and the resulting “ credit default swaps ” were unregulated .
As long as the system worked , it worked well – as long as we kept clapping , Tinkerbell lived .
The models used by the regulators , the rating agencies , and the borrowers and lenders assumed that the past records of defaults would continue .
The old patterns failed , and now no one knows how much anything is worth or how big the losses will be .
I attempted to link high oil prices with the housing finance craze and early stockmarket wobbles back in August 2007 .
However , the links go back much further than just the last few years .
Yet while all these financial instruments were being created , there were plenty of voices pointing out that American home prices would peak in 2005 or so , and that the quality of loans was declining rapidly .
According to the October 15 , 2008 , Washington Post , sub - prime mortgages made up 8.0 to 8.6 % of all mortgages from 2001 to 2003 , but 18.5 to 20.1 % from 2004 to 2006 .
The dollar value of subprime MBS rose from $ 121 billion in 2002 to $ 401 billion in 2004 and about $ 500 billion in 2005 and 2006 .
Why the big jump in junk ?
The US balance of payments deficit has grown rapidly during this decade , and one of the big drivers of that has been the rising cost of imported oil and other petroleum products .
In 2002 we spent $ 102 billion importing oil , but that figure rose to $ 300 billion in 2006 , and to $ 328 billion last year .
Those imports ( along with Jim Kunstler ’s salad shooters and all the other things we buy ) had to be financed , to the tune of $ 2 billion a day by last year .
We convinced the Chinese , Japanese , and many others that our MBS were safe because they were sorta guaranteed ( wink , wink ) by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae .
We needed the oil , so we needed product to sell to finance our “ addiction . ”
Our suppliers wanted bonds , the government deficit was n’t large enough , so we created an endless supply of MBS to sell .
After reading this , I had to try and plot the relative scale of the growth in credit against the oil import bill ( import volume times average price for each year ) .
The resulting chart shows that the pace of credit growth has two broad periods which match the corresponding change in the oil import bill .
Moderate credit growth in the 1950's and 60's matched the early days of slowly expanding oil imports into the United States .
The twin oil crises of the 1970s made for a volatile oil import bill , but credit growth slowed as the economy was hit by the supply shock .
After a recovery in the late 80's , both trends then declined during the recession of the early 1990's .
Demonstrating the link that Richard describes above , both the U.S. oil import bill and debt ( credit ) have grown explosively over the last ten years .
There 's little doubt that the credit curve is going to nosedive now , and for a short while at least the oil import bill may do the same .
Historically though , credit cycles change much more slowly than oil prices , the volatility of which shows up in the oil import bill particularly in the 1970 's but also in the short price slump of 2000 / 2001 .
In that sense , credit growth is a heavily smoothed trend of the oil import bill - relatively steady for several decades but rising sharply over the last ten years to fund an increasing volume of increasingly expensive oil imports .
Credit growth is actually more closely correlated with the volume of oil imports , rather than the oil bill .
This presumably reflects the fact that credit is expanding to match the growth in the total economy , rather than just oil prices .
So oil imports are here a proxy for economic growth , which has been substantially funded by credit ( debt ) .
Both lines are zero scaled , so the proportional change in credit and oil imports has been very similar over the period since 1980 .
Is the Economy Less Sensitive to an Oil Shock ?
As the oil price hit $ 40 all the way back in 2004 , warnings were sounded of economic trouble ahead .
Instead , measures of GDP continued to increase leading Alan Greenspan and other ' enlightened ' economists to the conclusion that our economies were less dependent on oil than they used to be and thus less vulnerable to another oil shock .
Stuart Staniford debated that point here on The Oil Drum back in 2005 .
His conclusion at the time was that " The only reason current events have had far less impact on the economy than the events of the 1970s is that there has been no reduction in supply !.
By contrast , past oil shocks involved real 7 % - 10 % reductions in oil supply .
However , if the current tightness persists [..] the economy will be no more oil proof now than it was in the 70s " .
Score 1 ( of many ) to Stuart .
Score 0 ( again ) to Alan " I'm Shocked " Greenspan .
Far from being less dependent on oil now , the economy actually suffers the same disease affecting the rest of the financial sector - it is heavily leveraged .
We can now turn 1 unit of oil into 2 units of economic growth , which is great on the way up .
The trouble is that when oil production declines , the leverage unwinds and we get two units of economic pain for each unit of oil production decline .
Richard concludes ..
Nobody – the government , the American people , the Wall Street crowd , mortgage brokers , home builders – wanted to take away the punch bowl , or look too closely at what was being produced .
Rising oil import volumes multiplied by rising prices contributed to the crisis we are now experiencing .
So the housing bubble was being used to create securities ( Collateralized Debt Obligations ) which could be sold overseas to finance the oil import bill to keep building more houses .
On the back of this , credit was expanding everywhere .
The private equity boom pushing sharemarket prices further up was just another side effect of cheap credit .
The risks were seen as low and just to be sure the losses were insured as well ( with ' good as gold ' AAA ratings to prove it ) .
It all worked fine until it did n't .
Is n't that the economic definition of sustainable ?
As oil prices started to bite , the new housing being built in distant suburbs and even more remote ' exurbs ' became less viable for commuters .
Once house prices started to unwind ( who would have thought it could happen everywhere at once ? ) the game was up , but it was always only a matter of time .
The United States ( and now the rest of the world ) could no longer find willing buyers for their ' assets ' and so the global financial system could no longer expand credit to the world 's consumers .
Global oil supplies have been all but flat for the last three years .
With China and the oil producing countries still increasing their share of the pie , first the poorest and then even OECD nations were forced to reduce their consumption the only way the market knows - higher prices .
So consumers started driving less because global oil supply simply could not meet everyone 's expectations .
Next the value of their house fell .
Finally they found the bank would n't ( couldn't ) lend them anymore money , so they stopped shopping as well .
That was the last straw , as there is nothing that strikes fear into the heart of an economist more than the sight of a consumer who has stopped shopping .
Oil , House Prices , Credit ?
It 's all part of the same story .

Some ardent defenders of the Fallout series - let 's call them Fallout traditionalists - have a beef with Fallout 3 and the RPG they fear it will be : non-isometric , non - turn - based , sans dialogue trees , simplified ( i.e. dumbed down ) SPECIAL system , and a distinct lack of the offbeat , self - referential Fallout vibe .
Such a game , say the traditionalists , may be perfectly suitable for gamers who prefer 3 - D action RPGs like Oblivion .
But it 's just not Fallout .
So do n't call it Fallout .
My students have been playing Fallout 1 and 2 for a couple of weeks , preparing for the release of Fallout 3 .
They are an unexpected mix of gamers : a small handful of RPG veterans , a large majority of relatively casual gamers ( mostly sports games and shooters ) , and a few with almost no experience playing video games at all .
Quite a challenge for a teacher who expected to be met by a small legion of hardcore D&Ders with a possible cosplayer or LARPer thrown in .
Fortunately , they 're all terrific guys willing to try anything I throw at them .
So when I handed them Fallout ( half played the original , half the sequel ) with no instructions or special preparation , they struggled .
A lot .
They had the original manuals , but almost nobody read them .
After exiting the vault , they had no idea where to go or what to do .
Their movements were limited for no apparent reason ; " action points " made no sense ; and they died within minutes nearly everywhere they went .
A few early posts from our online forum :
Idk if anyone else has this problem but I am having a hard time getting anything done ...
I started as Max Stone hopin to kill some things and level up ... but there is n't much 2 kill ... the redscorpians are owning me ...
Any way to move like a little bit quicker ?
I kept walking back and forth between 15 and 13 and get stopped by travelers ... they took me to a town where I forgot to save and got dominated and lost all my experience and time ...
i have enough to fire a gun and kill a scorpion , but then i'm only 1 action point short to use a weapon and i get screwed because i can't fight back ... how do i gain more action points and why do they randomly go away when i'm fighting ?
I 'm terrible about reading manuals and whatnot , so it took me forever to find out how to rest because the pipboy does n't work originally and I did n't try it again until I clicked it by accident .
So far , I appreciated being left to my own devices , but because the game is so old , with the graphics it has and whatnot , it sometimes is hard to recognize what needs to be done .
Like it 's only after you play a game like this that you realize how much easier having glowing objects of interest is .
Our first Fallout conversation was a disaster .
Few students had posted on the forum as I had asked them to , and it was obvious that almost no one had devoted much time to playing .
They basically tried the game , got frustrated , threw up their hands , and walked away .
Our midterm break began the following day , so I told them I expected them to continue playing over the break , be resourceful , roll up their sleeves , and figure it out .
" Somewhere in there , " I assured them , " is the best RPG you will play this semester .
If you dig harder to find it , I promise you will thank me . "
A bit of hyperbole , perhaps , but I meant it .
All of these students have seen the trailers for Fallout 3 .
When I told them we would play the game immediately after release , they burst into spontaneous fits of delight .
I should mention that I made this announcement at the conclusion of our Planetfall discussion , a text adventure they gamely tried to enjoy because I told them they should - but which they mostly detested .
In this setting , Fallout 3 was received like mana from RPG heaven .
Subsequently , Fallout 1 and 2 were seen as trials to be endured while awaiting the modern gameplay savior of 3 .
Then , during the break , something broke .
I began to notice increased activity in the discussion forum , which soon turned into a small flurry of posts .
A sampling :
What is interesting about the random encounters in the game is that not all of them are hostile encounters .
The kind of encounter that is very rare in games is the neutral encounter where you encounter people fighting .
You can help either side but even then sometimes they will just turn around and attack you when they beat whoever they were fighting .
My favorite way to deal with these encounters is to wait till a few of them die , and then it 's looting corpses time .
It ’s amazing what kind of nice loot you can find on them .
It ’s also where I got my first gun .
Think about it , they have almost myths of what we know about these people and things .
They do n't know everything and have to rely on what they do know .
I 'm really interested in seeing how much information is lost because of the isolation caused by the vaults .
That 's an interesting idea .
What effect would the isolation of the vaults have on the society ?
And what would changed based on the nuclear apocalypse ?
It would be like taking all the data in the world and deleting random parts .
It would cause mass chaos , especially once the original humans ( from pre-nuking ) die out .
Or , alternatively , there could be a safe - haven somewhere .
From a developing standpoint , how could that effect the game ?
Could it ?
I just found out that the greeter at the Den tells you to be vewy vewy quiet he is hunting rabbits , and i just stopped and laughed for about fifteen mins .
Suddenly , they got Fallout .
They grokked the mechanics and embraced the non-linear gameplay .
They made peace with uncertainty .
But more importantly , they built a relationship with the character and the offbeat but perilous world .
As Iroquois Pliskin points out in an essay I shared with my students :
And so this feeling of vulnerability that Fallout inspires is apt , because it does what good games do : it uses mechanics and gameplay rules to create a sense of character .
All the aimlessness and danger make you feel dislocated , out of your element , and this is exactly how your protagonist must feel after emerging from a life of tight - knit isolation from the outside world .
You feel like you share an experience with your character , this experience of being thrust into a world you barely understand , one that is unpredictable and promising at once ; and sharing an experience is the beginning of a relationship .
But this takes time .
Fallout does n't greet you with a getting - to - know - you opening level or a hand - holding tutorial .
My students were willing - granted , at my insistence - to keep plugging away , and they were richly rewarded for their efforts .
It 's nice to be right .
I may have even gained back the credibility I lost with Planetfall ( which is a great game no matter what they say ! )

“ It is not too much to say that governments are now superseded by financial institutions ... the efforts of those in control of financial policy are , primarily , if not entirely , concerned with making the world safe for bankers , rather than making the world safe .... the world cannot be made safe without removing the banker , painlessly or otherwise , form the commanding position which he now occupies . ”
C.H. Douglas , The Monopoly Of Credit , 1932
One overlooked reason for today ’s bailout mess and economic - financial crisis stems from the private control of credit and money creation , as well as the more recent creation of unregulated , unbacked , quasi- money instruments called derivatives and credit swaps - also created for profit by the big bank owners of the Federal Reserve .
A private “ Federal ” Reserve and its big bank owners are the main culprits and the root cause in the creation of inflation and depression - via expansion and contraction of money supplies .
The business cycle , and its magnified boom - bust periods , is then largely a creature of monetary policies geared to private interests , with little or no public interest imput .
Who lends , to whom , for what purpose , at what cost , and who has a say in the process ?
Private banks are in the business of creating debt - money and interest and fee income .
There is no public interest per se in this process .
In any case , for years before securitization emerged loans were more local and held by community - based lending institutions .
As a consequence , more oversight and concern for these loans and their security were in play .
With the advent of securitization of bank loans , and their sale to pension funds and foreign investors , a process was created whereby the banks could continually exceed their traditional capital and fractional reserve requirements by selling loans to Wall Street .
For this reason , banks became less concerned with the quality of loans given that they could be packaged and sold – often with bogus and bought credit ratings provided by Wall Street .
In this way lending expanded beyond reason and the quality of loans and their security continued to drop .
This applied in spades to the home loan market , where securitization and implicit taxpayer guarantees made it possible for banks to get loans off their books and continue to make loans , fees , and interest beyond reasonable limits .
Add to this all the utterly parasitic loans made to speculators , hedge funds , and vulture capitalists busy wreaking havoc in the economy .
What else could we expect in a thoroughly privatized process in an era of deregulation ?
Also , the very process of debt - money involves the “ magic ” creation of loan money “ out of thin air ” via credits to customer accounts .
At the same time , the total sum of interest which will become due is not created .
For this reason , private debt - money creation and interest - rate setting powers mean that , eventually , our assets flow to the big bank owners of the Fed as the economy cannot then generate enough profit to pay the interest costs .
Debt then piles up and is either refinanced and loans extended ( in perpetuity as with our goverment debt ) or defaults begin to multiply and assets go back to the banks – in particular , those money center big banks who not only own the federal reserve but access its money at will .
Whither the public ?
The absence of public interests in private money creation powers means , in this profit - seeking system , that lending and debt money creation continue until no more loans can be sold and banks retrench and a collapse follows .
Exactly this dismal boom - bust depression dynamic , serving to exacerbate normal business cycles , is then built - in to the system as we know it .
We can safely say , its the structure , stupid !
“ This boom - bust economic cycle is totally unnecessary and is the fundamental cause of the inherent instability in our economy .
It is due to too - rapid increases in the money supply due to deficit spending and then the multiplier effect of fractional reserve banking ( described above ) and to lenders greedy to take advantage of such a system that rewards lending with more and more interest revenue ; followed by a too - rapid contraction of the money supply ( such as we are experiencing now ) , necessary to combat the inflationary effects of the former phase , both the direct result of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 .
We urgently need to reform this system that rewards greed and results in ever - increasing swings from boom - to - bust - destroying ordinary businesses and farms in the process .
We need to repeal or fundamentally reform the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , and to replace it with a system that eliminates the ability of private banks to " create " and multiply money as loans . ”
Patrick Carmack , The Money Masters
The real question is when , amidst these awful episodes in which the public is badly fleeced and made destitute , does the power of monetary policy shift to the public .
When will the people regain the ownership of their central bank and monetary policy – if for nothing else then that being the price of today ’s taxpayer bailout ?

In the article , Modern Forth , I focused on the impact of modern Forth compiler design on current register - oriented CPUs .
In this article , I examine the relationship between software and silicon , and discuss a search for simplicity to improve performance and reduce chip size and power consumption .
For those of you whose software life is based around C and other " Pasgol " languages , shift your perspective of Forth and start thinking of it as a two - stack silicon machine .
Forth compilers for conventional CPUs just map this model onto a register - oriented model .
We will also see how to map the C virtual machine ( VM ) onto a two - stack VM .
Chips designed to run Forth well have been produced for more than 20 years , including the Novix NC4000 , the Harris / Intersil RTX2000 , and Silicon Composers SC32 .
There has been a flurry of cores for implementation in FPGAs , including MicroCore .
Today , the state of the art is the 40 - core SEAforth processor from IntellaSys .
( Later in this article , I look at the C18 core and interconnects used in the SEAforth chips . )
But first , I examine changes to the canonical Forth VM to achieve the goals of performance and code size .
Revisiting the Forth Virtual Machine
We will look again at the Forth and C VMs , see where the Forth VM is weak , and discover how to adjust it to improve execution of both languages .
This leads to some understanding of why the IntellaSys C18 core is as it is .
[ Click image to view at full size ]
The canonical Forth virtual machine is weak in several areas :
It does not execute C well , which is important for commercial exploitation of general - purpose silicon stack machines .
C requires a frame pointer for access to local variables and buffers in main memory .
The two stacks are not in addressable memory .
It is weak for DSP operations , which restricts performance in embedded applications without changes to the VM or increased compiler complexity .
Without index operations , dealing with complex data structures is cumbersome , especially when a base address is passed as an argument to a word / function .
DSP operations often require three or four parameters to be manipulated .
For example :
source address , destination address and length ,
first source address , second source address , destination address and length .
Canonical Forth requires ugly source code to deal with these situations .
Several silicon implementations provide index and scratch registers , and others have provided more access to the top of the return stack .
Using the top of the return stack as a loop counter has been common for a long time ; for example , the FOR ... NEXT loop structure .
The Forth community has long talked about TOS ( top of data stack ) , NOS ( next / second on data stack ) and TOR ( top or return stack ) .
These are not quite enough for DSP operations .
Chuck Moore 's current silicon includes A and B registers which are used both as index registers and for scratch storage .
Efficient execution of C requires a frame pointer , and a spare index register is always useful .
We end up with the model in Figure 2 .
[ Click image to view at full size ]
The A and B registers are used as scratch locations and for stepping through memory using auto - increment and auto - decrement addressing modes .
The X and Y index registers have base + index addressing and can be used as frame and thread - local storage pointers .
The X and Y registers are important for general - purpose CPUs , and are not implemented in the IntellaSys C18 core .
The impact of the A and B registers can be seen in this biquad filter implementation by Gary Bergstrom for a 16 - bit embedded system .
Gary commented on the previous article about Forth 's return stack not getting in the way of parameters :
This has to be one of the most underrated points in Forth .
Factoring words in Forth is natural and the lack of return addresses interspersed with the data allows this to be very efficient .
In most languages you can't factor to the degree that you can in Forth without having severe run-time speed consequences .
You can't keep passing data to lower and lower layers without building new stack frames , with the same data repeated in them , again and again .
$ 4000 constant +1 . \ -- n \ Integer +1 in 2.14 fractional arithmetic format . : *. \ fr1 fr2 -- fr3 \ Fractional multiply .
+1 . */ ; : 1STEP + \ sum -- sum ' \
Perform a multiply / accumulate step , incrementing both \ pointers .

Perform a multiply / accumulate step , incrementing the \ coefficient pointer and decrementing the data pointer .
[ email protected ] + [ email protected ] *. + ; : SHIFT2 \ fr -- \
The last step of the filter .
The current data item \ is shifted into the next data slot and replaced by fr. [ email protected ]
SWAP A !+ A !+ ; : ( BIQUAD ) \ frx -- fry \
The core of the biquad filter operation .
DUP >R [ email protected ] + *. \ initial sum = B0 * input 1STEP + 1STEP - R> SHIFT2 1STEP + 1STEP - ; : BIQUAD \ fx addr - filt addr-coef -- fry \ A single order biquad filter .
>B >A ( BIQUAD ) DUP SHIFT2 ; : 2xBIQUAD \ fx addr - filt addr-coef -- fry \ A second order biquad filter .
>B >A ( BIQUAD ) ( BIQUAD ) DUP SHIFT2 ;
In this example , the A and B registers are set up by the words A and B in BIQUAD .
These registers are now parameters to the lower layers with no parameter passing overhead .
Use of these registers has removed the need for local variables while permitting additional factorisation .
They have also considerably reduced stack manipulation in both the source code and the compiled code .
Because parameter passing is efficient , what would be inline code in other languages is encapsulated as factors , which in turn reduces code size .
The importance of code density will become apparent in the next section .
The X and Y registers above show their worth in larger systems for indexed addressing into structures in memory .
They will be used in a conventional Forth system to access local variables and buffers , and to provide a pointer to thread - local storage .
One of them will be used as a frame pointer by a C compiler .
These changes to the Forth VM improve code density and performance in Forth .
They also permit two - stack machines to run C efficiently .
A more in - depth look at this VM will appear in the EuroForth 2008 conference proceedings and on the EuroForth conference website in October 2008 .
NVIDIA was hit with a class - action lawsuit filed in the US District Court , Northern District of California on Tuesday .
The class action lawsuit ( PDF ) alleges that NVIDIA violated Federal securities laws by not disclosing to shareholders that certain of its notebook GPUs were failing at higher - than - average rates .
The suit seeks class - action status for all NVIDIA stockholders who purchased or acquired common stock between November 8 , 2007 and July 2 , 2008 and pursues legal remedies under the Securities Exchange Act .
On July 2 , 2008 NVIDIA filed a report with the SEC that stated it would take a $ 150 million to $ 200 million one - time charge to cover anticipated customer warranty , repair and replacement and other costs relating to a higher than average percentage of failures in some NVIDIA GPUs used in notebook computers .
The company clarified the size of that charge — $ 196 million — at its last quarterly meeting .
NVIDIA stated at the time that it was not able to determine the root cause for the failures of the GPUs and that the chance of failure was very slight .
The company has maintained its claims regarding both the chance of failure and the number of customers likely to be affected , and has not noticeably changed its position since the initial announcement .
The closest NVIDIA has come to offering an explanation for the higher - than - average failure rates is to say , " testing suggests a weak material set of die / package combination , system thermal management designs , and customer use patters all contribute . "
Several different OEMs have been affected by the problem , but again , NVIDIA maintains that the total number of impacted users is small .
According to the suit , some market participants have questioned whether the reserve set aside is enough .
Sources close to NVIDIA maintain that the $ 200 million number is adequate for the rate of failure .
The suit documents note that the day after the announcement was made regarding the one - time charge ; NVIDIA 's stock price plummeted to $ 12.98 from the $ 18.78 it was trading out the day before .
The drop in stock price cut NVIDIA 's market capitalization by more than $ 3 billion , and the stock has not substantially recovered .
In the two months since its announcement , NVIDIA 's stock has hovered mostly between $ 10 and $ 11 dollars , with a brief peak at just over $ 14 in the later weeks of August .
As of today , NVDA stock was valued at $ 10.92 per share .
It 's only fair to note , however , that there are several other factors that may have played a part in keeping NVIDIA 's stock price low .
These include a drop in desktop GPU shipments during the second quarter , losing the top GPU spot to ATI , and the Intel marketing machine praising the glories of Larrabee .
As for the lawsuit , it relies on a key statement attributed to NVIDIA 's VP for Investor Relations , Michael Hara .
On September 4 , 2008 at a Citigroup Technology Conference , Hara stated " We 've ... been working on this problem with the customers for well over a year , going all the way back to August of last year . "
In an effort to address the potential issue with the GPU , both HP and Dell released updates that were intended to circumvent the issue by changing the way the cooling system of the notebooks operated .
The updates addressed things like fan speeds and runtimes along with how the system throttled the CPU and GPU for thermal control .
The suit alleges that the firmware updates are merely an attempt to postpone the GPU failure until after the warranty period and cites a ZDNet story that reported , " a BIOS update is little more than a band - aid and is n’t going to fix the underlying problem . "
Several statements posted to public message boards by owners of potentially affected notebooks are used as part of the documentation for the suit .
Exactly how speculation and hearsay from owners of notebooks made in forum posts , not familiar with the technical aspects of the system or the issues at the core of the suit , have bearing on the outcome of the suit are unclear .
How long has NVIDIA known ?
The central allegation made in the suit is that NVIDIA has known about the potential defects in the GPUs since November of 2007 and kept the possible defect and the effect the defect could have the NVIDIA 's financial future a secret by issuing a series of false and misleading statements to the investing public .
The question regarding the delay in the announcement of the potential GPU defect in many minds has to be : how long does it take from an HP or Dell coming to NVIDIA with an issue being seen on a GPU to be studied in enough depth to find which side the problem is on .
There has to be a process that looks at the abnormal failure rate to determine if the issue causing the failures is from a problem with the cooling design of the notebook in question -- failing on the shoulders of HP or Dell - - or if the problem is in the actual manufacturing process .
The suit claims that NVIDIA knew the answer to that question in November of 2007 .
Could it be that NVIDIA knew in November of 2007 that there was a potential issue with the part , and it took until the announcement in early July to determine that the issue was with the GPU manufacturing process , as opposed to a notebook design flaw , a cooling solution issue , or a particular batch of bad parts as opposed to an ongoing problem ?
half a million people
Unfortunately , few in the media or in government appear to want to draw attention to the deaths that have so severely altered the lives of so many .
In 2004 , Roberts and colleagues sneaked into Iraq with dyed beards and dressed in robes to conduct a series of mortality " cluster point " surveys in various communities .
His team initially estimated the civilian death toll as at least 100,000 ( two to three times the official estimate ) but later analysis prompted him to raise the estimate .
The findings were reported in the British medical journal , the Lancet in 2006 .
" To help people understand this , given the population of Iraq , it would be like New York City having two 9/11 attacks every week over a period of three years , " Roberts said .
Another report , issued in January , estimated that 151,000 Iraqis died from violence between March 2003 and June 2006 .
The estimate was based on projections by the Iraqi government and the World Health Organization .
" General David Petraeus testified earlier this year about the fewer deaths we 're seeing in Iraq , but his numbers suggested that life in Baltimore was more violent than in Iraq . "
Before a Congressional Hearing , Dr. Roberts wrote Senators asking them to challenge the statistics , but nobody uttered a word .
News reporters stayed silent as well .
" Everybody wants to believe things are getting better because Republicans want to declare victory and Democrats want an excuse to get out .
Meanwhile , the media continue to ignore the issue .
My professional life and purpose is based on the belief that most of the time , valid data leads towards truth and that truth ... can lead toward justice , "
- Tom Paulson ( Excerpt : " Doctor Laments Brush - Off of Iraqi War Dead , " Seattle Post - Intelligencer , 10.24.08 .
Image : - American Colony , " Iraqis In The Streets , " Library of Congress , Iraq , 1932 ) .
" Dr. Les Roberts risked his life a few years ago to get some numbers that some people fiercely attack as inaccurate , misleading and that many others pay little or no attention to .
Dr. Roberts , a physician and prominent public health scientist at Columbia University believes there is solid evidence that close to , mostly civilians , have been killed in the Iraq war .
His statistics are about 10 times higher than the estimates put forth by the Bush administration and the Pentagon. says Roberts .
CHAPEL HILL - Many people think beer tastes bad all the time , while others , who enjoy the alcoholic malt beverage , believe it turns " skunky " only when it is n't handled properly .
Now chemists at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill say they have figured out precisely what goes wrong with beer to give it that offensive " light - struck " flavor .
" Historically , beer has been stored in brown or green bottles to protect hop - derived compounds from light in a process we call photodegradation , " said Dr. Malcolm D. Forbes , professor of chemistry .
" Hops help flavor beer , inhibit bacterial growth and are largely responsible for the stability of the foam in the head , " Forbes said .
" Hops , however , are light - sensitive , and the three main compounds in them identified as being light - sensitive are called isohumulones .
When attacked by either visible or ultraviolet light , these break down to make reactive intermediates known as free radicals that lead to the offensive taste and skunky odor . "
Using isohumulones supplied by brewing companies and a sophisticated technique called time - resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy , the UNC scientists and colleagues determined what happens chemically during photo degradation .
Lasers served as the light source for producing the chemical reactions they studied .
" This light problem is a phenomenon that was reported in the literature as early as 1875 , but until now the detailed mechanism has not been unraveled , " Forbes said .
" The final product of the reaction turns out to be what we call " skunky thiol , " an analog of a compound found in skunk glands that produces a very bad taste and smell .
This molecule has an extremely low taste and smell threshold in humans , just a few parts per trillion . "
A report on the findings will appear in the Nov. 5 issue of a publication called Chemistry - A European Journal and appeared online this weeek .
Besides Forbes , authors are UNC chemistry doctoral student Colin S. Burns and Dr. Denis De Keukeleire and his doctoral student Arne Heyerick of the University of Gent in Belgium .
The new paper describes how the team succeeded in creating the free radicals , working out their structure , explaining reactions that made them and learning precisely where in the isohumulone compounds photo breakdown takes place .
" Understanding mechanisms behind changes in beer tastes is important because the world beer industry is hoping to save money by storing , shipping and selling beer in less expensive clear glass , " Forbes said .
" Producers of Miller Genuine Draft , for example , already do that by adding a chemically modified hop compound to the beer .
We have found evidence that Miller beer is still photochemically active , but it does n't make the same free radicals , and so those can't lead to bad - tasting skunky thiols as quickly . "
Corona beer also is sold in clear bottles , but manufacturers do not used a modified hop product , he said .
Instead , they usually keep their bottles boxed to exclude light and encourage drinkers to add a slice of lime to improve the odor .
" Corona is marketed extremely cleverly , " the chemist said .
Forbes ' laboratory is one of the most sophisticated in the world for studying super - fast radical reactions that take place in billionths of seconds .
His Belgian collaborators have applied for a patent on a process that will alter and retard the photochemistry of beer to make the beverage easier to store and give it a longer shelf life .
###
The National Science Foundation , the Interbrew - Baillet Latour Foundation of Leuven , Belgium , and the UNC chemistry department supported the research .

` I 've been saying it for a while now that Republican Depression # 2 is marching on ... just wait and see what happens next .
This is a tragedy or as Naomi says , " a disaster " .
Stand by for more privatization of Government services , this time we have no FDR to help bail us out .

Do the math .
This is not about bad mortgages .
It 's far too big .
One trillion dollars is equal to one million mortgages worth $ 100 K each .
So that means that in your average state , 20,000 borrowers have defaulted .
Really ?
Where are all these homeowners in my state hiding ?
Why do n't I see foreclosure signs and boarded up houses everywhere ?
I do n't .
And you do n't either -- at least not enough of them .
What 's really going on ?
It has always been the Republican dream , going back to Reagan , and David Stockman , his economic advisor , to somehow put the country so far into debt that we would simply HAVE to default on our obligations , and fold up business as a country , and declare bankruptcy , tear up the constitution , and just start all over again , making a new contract , forget about the ole U.S. of A. and social security and so on because that 's all bankrupt .
And instead , we 'll start operating under a new set of rules .
You can look it up in David Stockman 's book .
He says as much .
It looks to me like that 's where we 're going , if we do this deal .

Oops .
Let 's do that math over again .
I was off by a factor of 10 .
One trillion is worth one million times one million .
So that would by one million mansions , each worth one million dollars .
Or 10 million NICE houses if each is worth $ 100 K .
And that works out be not 20 K homes per state , but 200 K homes in each state .
And I think that my guess of $ 100 K per mortgage is really rather high , because a relative of mine bought a nice house for $ 50 K .
So that 's another factor of 2 , or 400,000 potentially foreclosed homes in each state ...
See what I mean about the math not working ?
Where are all these homes ?
We would see them everywhere and we do n't .
They would get burned down for the insurance money , and the volume of smoke would have brought on the next ice age already .
It 's off by an order of magnitude .
We 're being lied to here .

It 's enough money to run another Iraq war .
Bush has been trying to lock us into some kind of ridiculous thing to tie up our money and government , so we can't get out of that bathtub they keep trying to drown it in .
What 's he care whether it 's mortgages or war with Iraq or war with Russia or war with Pakistan ?
It 's all the same financially .
We can solve whatever mortgage problems we have with much simpler changes to law .
Heck Gramm got us into this with just a few pieces of paper .
Should n't cost much to rip 'em out .
Would n't we all pay good money for a ticket to see a bunch of CEOs of bankrupt companies spanked .
Would they cry if we ripped away their golden parachute to reveal they 're just stupid ?

OCTOBER 28 -- Angered that two neighborhood teenagers knocked over a John McCain sign on his lawn , an Ohio man allegedly grabbed a rifle and fired three times at the duo as they sought to drive away from his Warren Township home .
Kenneth Rowles , 50 , was charged with felonious assault in connection with the Saturday afternoon incident , which resulted in one boy suffering a minor bullet wound .
According to a Warren Township Police Department report , Patrick Wise , 16 , yelled , " This is for Obama " as he knocked over the McCain sign .
Wise 's cousin , Kyree Flowers , 17 , was waiting in the passenger seat of the SUV , which was struck by three bullets fired by Rowles .
One bullet hit Flowers in the arm , while another shattered the passenger 's and driver 's side windows .
Rowles , pictured in the above mug shot , claimed in a police interview that he " shot three times attempting to scare the subjects . "
Shortly after the October 25 confrontation , Rowles called police to complain about two instances in which his McCain signs had been vandalized , but never bothered to mention that he had , minutes earlier , fired at a vehicle carrying Wise and Flowers .
As Officer Daniel Peterson was getting into his squad car to leave , Rowles stopped him to ask about a new Ohio law allowing homeowners to protect their property .
" I told him that it would be stupid for someone to get shot or injured over an election sign and he agreed , " Peterson wrote in his report , which you 'll find here .
Police seized 11 long guns and four pistols from Rowles 's home , and recovered two spent . 22 - caliber shell casings from his driveway .
If convicted of the assault charge , Rowles faces up to eight years in prison .

DAYTONA BEACH , Florida ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama accused Republican presidential rival John McCain on Saturday of wanting to gamble with the retirement savings and health care of Americans by subjecting them to the uncertainty of open markets .
As the government prepared another costly bailout of the reeling U.S. financial system , Obama said McCain ’s support for privatizing Social Security and opening up the health care system to market forces would put Americans at financial risk .
He attacked McCain for supporting some privatization of Social Security retirement funds , a proposal President George W. Bush made a centerpiece of his 2004 White House campaign but was unable to push through Congress .
“ I know Senator McCain is talking about a ‘ casino culture ’ on Wall Street -- but the fact is , he ’s the one who wants to gamble with your life savings , ” Obama said at a rally in Daytona Beach in Florida , a state with a large population of seniors and retired workers .
“ That is not going to happen when I ’m president , ” the Illinois senator said , asking the crowd to imagine the fears of retirees who found their Social Security funds tied to the current market .
“ We ’re not going to gamble with your ability to retire with dignity after a lifetime of hard work .
We ’re going to strengthen and protect Social Security so it ’s a safety net our families can count on -- today , tomorrow and always , ” he said .
The latest political skirmishing came as the Bush administration readied a $ 700 billion financial markets rescue plan for Congress that would almost certainly restrict the agenda and limit the number of costly programs advocated by whoever becomes the next president .

The turmoil on Wall Street recently has dominated the campaign for the November 4 presidential election , with McCain and Obama trading attacks over who offered the best economic approach .
‘ SCARE TACTICS ’
The McCain campaign said Obama was trying to scare Florida ’s senior citizens about their retirement accounts .
“ John McCain is 100 percent committed to preserving Social Security benefits for seniors , and Barack Obama knows it -- this is a desperate attempt to gain political advantage using scare tactics and deceit , ” said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds .
McCain has generally taken an anti-regulatory stance , and has decried the Wall Street greed he says led to the financial meltdown .
But Obama dismissed the Arizona senator ’s attempts to recast himself as a proponent of regulating financial markets .
“ There ’s only one candidate who ’s called himself ‘ fundamentally a deregulator ’ when deregulation is part of the problem , ” Obama said .
Slideshow ( 7 images )
He criticized McCain for writing in a magazine that his health care plan would do for that industry what deregulation had done for banking .
He said McCain wanted to run health care the way Wall Street has been run .
“ Well , Senator , I know some folks on Main Street who are n’t going to think that ’s such a good idea , ” he said .
McCain ’s health care plan would use tax credits to help shift from employer - based insurance coverage to an open market system where people can choose from competing policies .
In the current issue of “ Contingencies , ” the magazine of the American Academy of Actuaries , McCain touts his approach .
“ Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition , as we have done over the last decade in banking , would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state - based regulation , ” McCain wrote .
The McCain campaign said he was specifically talking about a proposal to allow consumers to purchase health insurance across state lines , which would create more options and drive down costs .
Obama ’s health - care plan would keep the existing job - based insurance system but expand government involvement in a public - private system aimed at eventually covering 47 million uninsured Americans .
If you ’ve messed around with HTTP push / Comet solutions you ’ve probably discovered are a fair amount of free and commercial choices , most solutions a lot to be desired .
For Ruby and Rails specific solutions I tried juggernaut and shooting_star .
The client component in both projects frequently did n’t know when they were disconnected from the server and consequently never tried to reestablish the connection .
Meh …..
After a few weeks of frustration I discovered Orbited , a really good push server .
It ’s built with Python , but that matters little .
It ’s an agnostic daemon that integrates with whatever you like .
Orbited ships with support for many protocols out of the box , including IRC , XMPP , and STOMP .
My needs were simple for the time being , so I went with STOMP .
So if you want replicate my setup you ’ll need to have Orbited + dependencies , a STOMP server and the stomp gem .
Before you dive in , this example is not a guide to proper architecture .
It ’s purpose is to show you how all the moving parts fit together .
I ’m on Ubuntu 8.04 , so lets rock n’ roll !!!!!
Orbited + dependencies
sudo apt - get install python2.5-dev
sudo apt - get install python2.5 - twisted
Now follow these instructions :
http://orbited.org/wiki/Installation
On the last step I went with simplejson
STOMP Server
easy_install morbid
You can use any STOMP server you like though
Orbited Config
# Example Orbited Configuration file [ global ] reactor=select # reactor=kqueue # reactor=epoll proxy.enabled = 1 proxy.keepalive = 0 session.ping_interval = 40 session.ping_timeout = 30 [ listen ] http://:8500
# uncomment to enable ssl on port 8043 using given .key and .crt files # https://:8043 # # [ssl ] # key=orbited.key # crt=orbited.crt [ static ] [ access ] * -> localhost : 61613 * -> your.public.ip.or.domain.com:61613 #localhost:8000 -> irc.freenode.net:6667 [ logging ] debug=STDERR,debug.log info=STDERR , info.log access=STDERR , info.log warn=STDERR,error.log error=STDERR,error.log
# Do n't enable debug by default enabled .
default=info , access , warn , error #
Turn debug on for the " Proxy " logger [ loggers ]
# Proxy=debug , info , access , warn, error
Star ‘ Em up !
sudo orbited –config= / path/to/your/orbited.cfg
sudo morbid
NOTE – you ’ll have to find your own way to run these in the background in production .
I use screen .
There are better options and I plan to change that soon .
The Gem
sudo gem install stomp
Ok .. that should be all the requirements ….. I make no promises .
This is all from memory
Rails Integration
This is quick and dirty .
Take care in your integration .
In a controller … .
require ' stomp ' class ChatController < ApplicationController

javascript = render_to_string : update do |page| page.insert_html : top , ' chat_data ' , " MESSAGE : # {h params [ : chat_input ]} " page [ :chat_input].clear page[:chat_input].focus s = Stomp:: Client.new s.send ( params [ : channel ] , javascript ) s.close end end
render : nothing => true end end
Global Rails App Settings
( However you prefer to handle them )
APP_SETTINGS [:orbited_host ] = ‘ localhost ’
APP_SETTINGS [:orbited_port ] = ‘ 8500 ’
APP_SETTINGS [: site_address ] = ‘ localhost :3000 ’
In your app_helper.rb
def orbited_javascript [ " < script src= \ " http://#{APP_SETTINGS[:orbited_host]}:#{APP_SETTINGS[:orbited_port]}/static/Orbited.js\ "></script > " , '< script > ' , ' document.domain = document.domain ; ' , " Orbited.settings.port = #{APP_SETTINGS[:orbited_port]} ; " , " Orbited.settings.hostname = '# {APP_SETTINGS[:orbited_host ]} ' ; " , ' TCPSocket = Orbited .

In a view …
< html > < head > <%= javascript_include_tag : defaults %> <%= orbited_javascript %> < script > onload = function ( ) { // set up shell .

This just in as Brad is headed over to the FOX News studios .
Yesterday the Los Angeles Times reported on the Republican voter registration outfit who had allegedly been illegally changing thousands of registrations from Democratic to Republican .
Last night the head of that GOP backed group , Mark Anthony Jacoby of Young Political Majors ( YPM ) , was arrested by the California State Election Fraud Taskforce and Oxnard , CA Police .
According to CA SoS Debra Bowen 's press release , Jacoby himself had committed voter registration fraud and perjury by lying on his own voter registration form .
( That 's similar to what Ann Coulter did , though she not only committed felony voter registration fraud , she also committed actual voter fraud , as well , even though such fraud is exceedingly rare . )
UPDATE FROM BRAD :
It was my pleasure to break this story today on Fox " News " of all places !
Thanks to John Gideon for getting it posted as I was on the roll towards the studio .
I 'll have the video up of my appearance on Fox , and the " Fox News Alert " I was able to do , later tonight ( it 's now posted here ) .
Please note , this is n't the first time there have been serious problems with GOP - gathered voter registrations in CA , as outlined recently at Alternet .
Looks like the GOP 's voter registration record for errors far outpaced ACORN !
Whaddaya know ?
( Our special coverage of the GOP 's ACORN " Voter Fraud " Hoax is right here . )
More updates now at bottom of article .
Bowen 's press release , just out , on Jacoby 's arrest is posted in full below , along with a number of additional updates after it ...
CONTACT : Kate Folmar ( 916 ) 208-6521 FOR
IMMEDIATE RELEASE : October 19 , 2008CONTACT : Kate Folmar ( 916 ) 208-6521 Secretary of State Debra Bowen Announces Arrest
of Man Charged with Voter Registration Fraud SACRAMENTO –
The owner of a signature - gathering firm that works across California was arrested in Ontario today on suspicion of committing voter registration fraud , Secretary of State Debra Bowen announced .
Mark Anthony Jacoby , who owns the firm known as Young Political Majors ( YPM ) , was arrested after allegedly registering himself to vote , once in 2006 and again in 2007 , at an address where did not live .
An investigation by the Secretary of State ’s Election Fraud Investigation Unit revealed that Jacoby twice registered to vote at the address of a childhood home in Los Angeles although he no longer lived there .
The Secretary of State ’s fraud unit and the Ontario Police Department arrested Jacoby near an Ontario hotel just before midnight Saturday .
An arraignment date has not been scheduled yet .
“ Voter registration fraud is a serious issue , which is why I vigorously investigate all allegations of elections fraud , ” said Secretary Bowen , California ’s chief elections officer .
“ Where there ’s a case to be made , I will forward it to law enforcement for criminal prosecution . ”
For his business , Jacoby traveled California and a number of other states collecting petition signatures and registering voters .
Under state law , signature - gatherers must sign a declaration stating that they are either registered to vote in California or that they are eligible to do so .
Jacoby allegedly registered to vote at his childhood address to meet this legal requirement .
Under California law , it is a felony punishable by up to three years in prison to register yourself when you are not entitled to vote and it is perjury to provide false information on a voter registration card .
On October 3 , the Public Integrity Unit of the Los Angeles County District Attorney ’s office charged Jacoby with four felonies : two counts of voter registration fraud and two counts of perjury .
A warrant was issued for his arrest and bail was set at $ 50,000 .
“ This arrest would n’t have been possible without the hard work of the Ontario Police Department and Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley ’s office , ” Secretary Bowen said .
“ I thank them both . ”
The Secretary of State ’s Election Fraud Investigation Unit helps maintain the integrity of the electoral process by investigating allegations of election and voter fraud in California .
Potential Elections
Code violations brought to the unit ’s attention are thoroughly investigated and referred to law enforcement officials for prosecution when there is sufficient evidence of wrongdoing .
The Secretary of State ’s office does not disclose information about the status of ongoing criminal investigations , but the information from a case that results in a criminal complaint filed by a county or state prosecutor is a public record .
Anyone who has witnessed a violation of the California Elections Code is encouraged to contact the Secretary of State ’s Election Fraud Investigation Unit at ( 800 ) 345-VOTE or http://www.sos.ca.gov/el...ions/elections_fraud.htm.

More updates from Brad ...
UPDATE : Los Angeles
Times covers the arrest here , and notes :
Jacoby 's arrest by state investigators and the Ontario Police Department comes after dozens of voters said they were duped into registering as Republicans by his firm , Young Political Majors , or YPM .
The voters said YPM tricked them by saying they were signing a petition to toughen penalties against child molesters .
The firm was paid $ 7 to $ 12 for every Californian it registered as a member of the GOP .
The YPM firm has been under investigation for similar unlawful activities in a number of states .
Nobody who runs ACORN , despite the nonsense you 've heard on Fox , CNN , MSNBC , etc. has ever been arrested , to our knowledge .
UPDATE 10:24 pm PT
I 've been able to learn from a source that Jacoby is free on bail tonight , and apparently staying at a La Quinta ( instead of his " home " , which is actually his mother 's home , where he is alleged to have registered illegally to vote ) .
Also , " Mrs. Panstreppon " at dKos notes :
Mark A Jacoby got into hot water with Florida authorities almost immediately after registering YPM LLC in August 2004 , according to a 10/04 St Petersburg Times story about him .
Read the story here An 8/21/2008 Phoenix New Times covered YPM 's nefarious activities in Arizona where charges were made that YPM tossed thousands of voter registration forms in the trash .
Read the story here .
I seem to recall another GOP outfit being accused of filing phony voter registration forms in Nevada in 2006 but I do n't have the name at the moment .
Anyone recall the case ?
She 's likely referring to Sproul & Associates , the GOP outfit led by Nathan Sproul , that was charged with shredding Democratic voter registration forms in a number of states .
They were paid more than $ 8 million dollars by the RNC , who tried to hide the expenditures in 2004 .
Details here .
And here are a number of BRAD BLOG reports on Sproul & Associates .
UPDATE 10/20/08 , 2:28 am PT : As I 've been poking around , trying to learn a bit more about this Jacoby fellow , I came across a posting from someone who claims to be a friend of a friend of his at this website .
I cannot verify the authenticity of either the comment , or the video , but it seems to be well informed , and matches up with several descriptions of the way Jacoby 's outfit has reportedly operated in a number of states .
The poster , " foadi " says his / her friend is owed money by Jacoby , and he'd recently sent the friend an email " calling him an idiot for not working on this republican registration drive , saying that this was the cleanest campaign he 's ever done with the GOP and denying that he is under investigation , despite being driven out of san bernardino county a few weeks ago . "
" foadi " also calls Jacoby a few more names than I feel comfortable posting here for the moment .
Again , I can't verify the authenticity of these comments , or the video , as I 've not been able to find an photos of Jacoby yet [ Ed note :
We 've now seen a photo of him , see next update , this appears to be Jacoby after all --- BF ] .
So proceed with the following at your own risk , and with those caveats .
Here 's the most notable details from " foadi's " comments :
his strategy for getting republican registrations is genius , although i can see how it might be illegal .
here 's what his guys do : * they make a fake petition , usually something involving tougher laws on sex offenders .
* they use these petitions to stop people , setting up in front of big box stores , on college campuses , etc
* once they have a person signing their petition , they start asking them questions on the voter registration form ( what 's your date of birth , which state / country were you born in , what 's your drivers license / state ID number , etc ) .
* by the time they get done with these basic questions the person is usually done signing the petition .
they then hand the voter registration form to the person , telling them to fill out their name and address and signature at the bottom .
* last step , they either ask them to mark ' republican ' because it ensures future funding for their petition , or they do n't tell the person anything and mark in republican themselves once the signer leaves .
using this strategy you can easily get over 100 republican registrations in a day .
pay ranges from $ 5 - 10 per registration , so the people doing it definitely have the incentive to get as many registrations as possible .
And here 's the video which " foadi " claims to be of Jacoby , threatening someone who says he owes him $ 5000 ...
UPDATE 10/20/08 , 12:21 pm : RAW STORY rounds up some of the coverage , including videos of MSNBC and local Southern California 's CBS 2 News both on the story .
MSNBC interviews legal analyst Susan Filan who notes " This is really serious ... This is a very specific , deliberate intent to mislead , " unlike the " Mickey Mouse " voter registration forms turned over to officials ( as they are required to by law ) and flagged as " problematic " by ACORN .
They also mention that some voters had their registration records changed to " absentee " , so they could lose their vote this November , if their address was changed and they fail to bring in their absentee ballots on Election Day .
CBS 2 offers a photo of Jacoby in their report ( photo posted at right ) which confirms that the man seen in the video we posted above , does appear to be Jacoby .
Both videos are posted here at RAW ...
UPDATE : 10/20/08 , 4:39 pm PT : Speaking of Sproul & Associates , the group accused of destroying Democratic registrations in several states ( see the 10:24 pm update above from last night ) , it looks like the McCain - Palin campaign and RNC has hired that frauster as well this year , despite his recent activities ...
John McCain 's campaign has directed $ 175,000 to the firm of a Republican operative accused of massive voter registration fraud in several states .
According to campaign finance records , a joint committee of the McCain - Palin campaign , the RNC and the the California Republican Party , made a $ 175,000 payment to the group Lincoln Strategy in June for purposes of " registering voters . "
The managing partner of that firm is Nathan Sproul , a renowned GOP operative who has been investigated on multiple occasions for suppressing Democratic voter turnout , throwing away registration forms and even spearheading efforts to get Ralph Nader on ballots to hinder the Democratic ticket .
...
That Sproul would come under the employment umbrella of the McCain campaign --- the Republican National Committee has also separately paid Lincoln Strategy at least $ 37,000 for voter registration efforts this cycle --- is not terribly surprising .
Sproul , who has donated nearly $ 30,000 to McCain 's campaign , has been in the good graces of GOP officials for the past decade despite charges of ethical and potentially legal wrongdoing .

Here ’s one for the Holden Caulfields of the world :
If you ’re good at spotting fake smiles , you ’ve probably been given the cold shoulder a lot in the past .
Scientists at Miami University in Ohio found that the memory of social rejection makes a person more wary of phony goodwill .
The researchers enlisted 32 people and asked some to write down a situation in which they ’d felt accepted , while others were asked to note a situation in which they ’d felt excluded .
A football player , for example , wrote about an injury that prevented him from playing , and the subsequent rejection he felt from his football buddies .
The subjects , now primed with either fuzzy feelings of acceptance or chilly feelings of rejection , were shown video clips of “ happy ” people .
The acceptance group spotted fake smiles about 60 percent of the time , while the rejection group spotted them about 80 percent of the time .
Some of the researchers expressed surprise at their results :
They had thought that the rejects would be so desperate for affection that they would 've latched on to any signs of friendliness , genuine or not .
But instead , those who ’d suffered rejection were more careful to avoid repeating the same mistakes , and so they focused more on facial expressions .
The researchers concluded that the key to spotting a fake smile is to look at the eyes — which , of course , is exactly what Tyra has been telling us all along .

JACKSONVILLE , Fla. , Oct. 21 ( UPI ) -- Early U.S. election voting in Florida has resulted in malfunctioning vote scanners and long lines at polling places , officials say .
In Jacksonville , Fla. , Duval County election officials estimated at least 6,000 people turned out Monday on the first day of early voting , but some were hampered by optical vote scanning machines that were n't working properly , The Florida Times - Union reported .

Seven of the 15 optical scan machines were replaced Monday as a result of problems with the machines rejecting ballots , Jerry Holland , Duval County supervisor of elections , told the newspaper .
" We 're looking at everything , " he said , adding that humidity , the paper or the machines themselves may have been factors .
Some voters said they were n't confident their votes were being counted but officials assured them they would be .
The lines for early voting led Florida election officials to predict this year 's presidential elections will break records for voter turnout , the Times - Union said .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. factory activity shrank in September to its lowest since the 2001 recession , and private employers shed jobs for the third time in four months as the financial crisis tightened its grip on the world ’s largest economy .

U.S. private - sector employers cut 8,000 jobs in September , according to a report by ADP Employer Services and Macroeconomic Advisers that did not include the impact of the financial chaos of the past few weeks .
Worse yet , the U.S. unemployment rate may increase to 7 percent by the middle of 2009 , as poor jobs conditions are expected to persist for another 9 to 10 months , Macroeconomic Advisers Chairman Joel Prakken said .
Separately , the Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity fell to 43.5 in September from 49.9 in August , under the level of 50 that separates contraction from expansion .
That was the worst reading since 40.8 in October 2001 , when the economy was still mired in the last recession .
Factories have held up relatively well in the current slowdown thanks to booming exports , but the report indicated a stalling global economy was taking its toll .
“ For the first time , it ’s really starting to look like a recession , ” said Marc Pado , U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co in San Francisco .
“ Maybe we do n’t get that number in the fourth quarter necessarily , but it ’s going to be tough at this point to avoid a recession . ”
On Wall Street , stocks ended the day lower .
Government bonds , which usually benefit from signs of economic weakness , rose on the day .
However , markets remained transfixed by speculation over a possible bailout for the financial sector .
The U.S. Senate was gearing up to vote on a revised $ 700 billion U.S. financial bailout bill after 7:30 p.m..
The House , which rejected the original plan on Monday , was likely to vote on Friday , a senior aide said .
THE PICTURE OF WEAKNESS
The ISM report painted a comprehensive picture of weakness , which may only get worse as turmoil in the financial sector further constrains the credit companies need to fund their business .
The ISM manufacturing employment index hit its lowest since April 2003 .
The outlook also looked bleak , with the new manufacturing orders index sinking to its lowest since January 2001 and the export index sliding to its lowest since July 2006 .
“ We ca n’t see strength in the overall index in the next couple of months , ” said Norbert Ore , head of the ISM ’s Business Survey Committee .
Meanwhile , planned layoffs at U.S. companies rose 7.2 percent from a month earlier in September but jumped 33 percent from the same month a year ago , according to a report by employment consulting firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas Inc .
The September job cuts brought the third - quarter layoffs total to 287,142 , the highest quarter of cuts since the fourth quarter of 2005 , the report said .
However , the figures might not fully reflect the recent trauma in finance , which included the record bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holding Inc and the collapse of Washington Mutual , the largest U.S. bank failure .
“ It may take several weeks or months for the fallout from September ’s Wall Street turmoil to hit the employment numbers , ” John A. Challenger , chief executive officer of Challenger , Gray & Christmas , was quoted as saying in the report .
It was a similar story for the ADP data , which comes ahead of the government ’s comprehensive labor market report on Friday that is expected to show the U.S. economy as a whole shed jobs for a ninth consecutive month in September .
The September non-farm payrolls report from the Labor Department is expected to show a loss of 100,000 jobs , according to a median estimate from economists .
Last month ’s ADP payroll readings were gathered prior to the financial chaos over the past several weeks .
“ It ’s really older news , ” said Prakken , of Macroeconomic Advisers , about the September ADP report .
A machinists ’ strike at Boeing and disruptions from Hurricane Ike could add 77,000 job losses to the BLS data for September that were not reflected in the ADP data , he said .
Prakken said the ADP report does not count these events as job losses , though he added that they are likely to be reflected in the BLS payroll survey .

WASHINGTON  Richard S. Fuld Jr. blamed the news media .
He blamed the short - sellers .
He blamed the government , as well as what he characterized as an “ extraordinary run on the bank . ”
But the chief executive of Lehman Brothers Holdings , the bankrupt remnant of a once - great investment house , never really blamed himself .
Instead , in his first public appearance since Lehman ’s collapse , Mr. Fuld said in sworn testimony before a Congressional panel on Monday that while he took full responsibility for the debacle , he believed all his decisions “ were both prudent and appropriate ” given the information he had at the time .
That stance did not sit well with angry members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , who peppered Mr. Fuld with hostile questions about the hundreds of millions he made over the last eight years .

" Hu Jia is one of the real defenders of human rights in the People 's Republic of China , " said Hans - Gert Poettering , president of the European parliament .
Hu was sentenced to three and a half years in jail this spring on subversion charges , amid what human rights campaigners described as a coordinated crackdown on activists before the Olympics .
Hu 's wife , Zeng Jinyan , welcomed the award as a sign that Europe was paying attention to human rights in China and was concerned about her husband 's case .
Zeng , who has also been under house arrest , along with the couple 's baby , told the Guardian : " It is also a [ sign of ] approval of his work .
I guess he must be very glad if he knows about it . "
But she said the family 's situation was improving and that she was able to go out comparatively freely .
She visited Hu yesterday and guards allowed him to hold their child for the first time .
Supporters have been concerned about Hu's health because he suffers from liver disease .
There have been some signs recently of the authorities relaxing strict controls on dissidents now the Olympics are over .
But in a letter to Poettering last week , China 's ambassador to the EU wrote : " If the European parliament should award this prize to Hu Jia , that would inevitably hurt the Chinese people once again and bring serious damage to China - EU relations . "
Qin Gang , a spokesman for the foreign ministry , told a press conference in Beijing : " To issue an award to such a criminal is interference in China 's judicial sovereignty and totally against the initial purpose of this prize . "
You turn on your car , but it does n’t start .
The battery is dead .
No big deal .
We ’ll show you exactly how to jumpstart your car with this guide .
While jumping a dead battery is super simple , you ’d be surprised by the number of men who have no idea how to do it .
And even if you have learned how to jump start a car before , it can be easy to forget what cables go where .
Positive on negative ?
Ground the positive cable on the car with the good battery ?
Red cable is negative ?
To help you avoid looking like a putz when asked to jump start a car and to help prevent you from shocking yourself when you do it , this article offers a complete multi-media rundown on how to jump start a dead car battery .
But first …
How to Tell If Your Battery Is Dead
Before you try jump starting a car , you need to determine that the battery is the reason the car is n’t starting up .
If you turn the ignition and hear the engine cranking , a dead battery is n’t your problem and jump starting it wo n’t do a darn thing .
However , if you turn the key and the car does absolutely nothing , then there ’s a good chance you have a dead battery on your hands and jumping it may be your ticket to getting back on the road .
Your 60 - Second Illustrated Crib Sheet to Jump Starting a Car
To Jump Start a Car With Cables , Follow These Steps :
1 . Make sure both cars are turned off .
2. Connect one end of the red ( positive ) jumper cable to the positive terminal on the stalled battery .
3 . Connect the other red ( positive ) cable to the positive terminal of the good battery .
4. Connect one end of the black ( negative ) jumper cable to the negative terminal of the good battery .
5 . Connect the other black ( negative ) cable to a clean , unpainted metal surface under the disabled car ’s hood .
6 . Start the car that ’s doing the jumping ; run for 2 to 3 minutes before starting dead car .
7. Remove cables in reverse order .
8 . Keep jumped car running for at least 30 minutes to give battery sufficient time to recharge .
Note :
You should always carry jumper cables in your car with you ( along with a number of other things ! ) .
You never know when you ’re going to need them .
And you ’re done .
Give yourself a pat on the back for a manly job well done .
The hardest part of the job is simply remembering where to put each cable .
Many a man has broken out in a sweat wondering if he is about to make a wrong move and toast himself to a crisp .
Here ’s the good news :
It ’s probably impossible to electrocute yourself from jump starting a car .
The battery might give you a big shock , but the voltage is too low to penetrate your skin and put you down for the count .
But no one wants to be on the receiving end of a zap , no matter how mild .
So come up with some sort of device to help you remember which color goes where .
I personally think : red = blood = life = positive ; black = death = negative .
How to Jump Start a Car Without Cables
If you have a standard transmission car , you can jump start that bad boy without using cables .
Here ’s how you do it :
1 . Find a stretch of clear downhill road .
2 . Fully depress the clutch and put the car in first gear .
3 . Turn the ignition to on .
4 . Take your foot off the brake and start rolling down the hill , leaving the clutch fully depressed .
5 . Coast down the hill until you reach 5 - 7 miles per hour .
6 . Release the clutch quickly .
You should feel the engine turn and start .
If it does n’t start the first time , depress the clutch and release it again .
7 . If you do n’t have a hill , get some of your buddies to give you a push and follow the steps above .

During the presidential campaign season , every pundit -- regardless of political affiliation -- has touted the " town hall " format as the strongest and most comfortable debate setting for John McCain .
Unfortunately , McCain performed miserably in Tuesday 's town hall debate with Barack Obama , once again looking desperate , rambling and uncomfortable .
So how is the GOP going spin it ?
C&L sources who are on GOP e-mail lists report that at least a half hour before the debate was even finished , they started receiving e-mails spinning and whining about the format and how it was n't a REAL town hall -- therefore , it 's unfair to poor John McCain .
Ben Smith at Politico got the ball rolling :
I wrote earlier that this would likely be an empathy contest , but between the odd rules , the candidates , and the visibly displeased moderator , that 's not really happening .
The questions are basically impersonal , and the questioners then disappear .
Right .
It 's not the debater who failed .... it's the debate format that failed him .
Let 's see how many of the right wing water carriers pick up and run with that lame excuse .
The incredible story of a lion cub bought over the counter at Harrods in London , reared as a pet in a furniture store by two young Australians , who was then freed into the wild in Kenya , has become an internet sensation .
Paul Eccleston reports .
And film footage more than 30 years old of Christian the lion emerging from the wild and being movingly reunited with his former owners has been seen by millions of people .
Christian , born to a pair of captive lions at Ilfracombe Zoo , was sold to the Knighsbridge store at a time when exotic pets could easily be bought .
The 35lbs cub was bought in 1969 for 250 guineas by two young Australians – John Rendall and his friend Ace Bourke – who were living in west London .
For a year he was at the heart of ‘ swinging ’ London in Chelsea ’s Kings Road living in a furniture store and lavished with care and attention by his two owners who spent £ 30 per week providing him with four meals per day together with vitamin supplements .
A kindly local vicar allowed Christian to exercise in a graveyard , he was taken to fashionable local restaurants , travelled in a Bentley and even featured in an advertising campaign for iconic ’60s fashion store Biba .
Christian , placid and loving to everyone he met , became a local celebrity and was often on show lying in the front window of the shop .
In 1970 , when local side Chelsea beat Leeds in the FA Cup Final replay , the store received a call from a policeman who said : ‘ The football fans are going to be boisterous , so you ’d better get your bloody lion out of the window or they ’ll smash it in . ”
John Rendall , who has now written a book telling Christian ’s story , said the lion had his own living quarters in the basement complete with a litter tray which he unfailingly used : “ He had a beautiful musky smell that was very distinct , ” he said .
“ But he was clean .
“ He was a lot of work .
It took all four of us – me , my then girlfriend Jennifer Mary , Ace Bourke and an actress called Unity Jones – to look after him . ”
The pet lion grew quickly and within a year weighed 185lbs and was developing his distinctive mane .
His owners knew that something had to be done about Christian ’s future when Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna – stars of the hit 1966 film Born Free – walked into the shop .
The film told the story of a lioness who was successfully reintroduced to the wild in Kenya .
The two stars suggested that pioneering wildlife conservationist George Adamson and his wife Joy – whose work formed the basis of the Born Free film – could help Christian begin a new life in the wild in the Kenyan bush .
Within a year , in 1972 , Christian – accompanied by owners John and Ace – was flown in a specially designed crate from London to Nairobi and then by light plane close to Adamson ’s camp at Kora .
Adamson , a controversial and often aloof figure , warned that Christian was unlikely to survive the transition but warmed to the two young men when they demonstrated the understanding that had developed with their boisterous pet .
“ I think George Adamson got quite a shock when he met us , ” said Rendall .
“ Straight from the King ’s Road , in all our gear – flares from Granny Takes A Trip , and with hair everywhere .
“ We looked rather different from everyone else in Nairobi .
But then so did Christian .
He ’d come from winter in England , so had a very thick coat – he was almost as hairy as we were . ”
Adamson was won over when during the Land Rover journey to Kora he was persuaded to stop – against his better judgement – to allow Christian to answer a call of nature .
The lion hopped out warily for the first time onto the hot and dusty Kenya soil , did what he had to do , and then obediently jumped back into the vehicle .
“ I got back in the car , too , shut the door and George Adamson turned round and said to me , ‘ That is quite remarkable .
You may call me George ’ . ”
At the makeshift camp where Adamson carried out his pioneering work with lions Christian was quickly integrated with two other animals , a male called Boy and a female , Katania .
The three would walk out into the Kora Reserve with the rifle - carrying Adamson gradually learning about their environment .
The biggest threat Christian and Boy – who became inseparable once Christian had accepted that Boy was boss – would face was from wild lions as they attempted to set up their own territory .
Tragically Boy had to be shot by Adamson after he mauled and killed an African chef called Stanley who had left the safety of the compound .
When he stumbled on Boy the chef fled in panic – the worst thing he could have done – and was instinctively chased and brought down by the lion .
As Christian settled into his new surroundings Rendall and Ace Berg returned to London but continued to visit Kenya to check on their former pet ’s progress .
In 1974 Adamson wrote to them to say Christian had carved out his own territory and established his own pride and the two replied to say they would make one last visit to say goodbye to Christian .
Adamson said they would probably be wasting their time as Christian had not been seen for nine months but uncannily – the day before they arrived back at Kora – the now full - grown lion suddenly reappeared accompanied by his females and cubs .
And the moment when the two young men were reunited with the lion was captured on film .
They call to the lion who immediately stands up and begins walking towards them ?
Would he remember them ?
Would he be friendly ?
Was he now a dangerous wild animal ?
The outcome never seems to be in doubt .
The lion is clearly deliriously happy to see them both again , bounds towards them and standing on his hind legs and throws his giant paws around their shoulders .
Rendall remembers the touching scene : “ He ran towards us , threw himself on to us , knocked us over , knocked George over and hugged us , like he used to , with his paws on our shoulders .
“ Everyone was crying .
We were crying , George was crying , even the lion was nearly crying . ”
“ The lionesses were far from pleased .
There was a lot of growling and spitting .
George said : ‘ This is n’t safe – we ’d better go . ’
So we each put a hand on Christian ’s back and he walked with us back to camp . ”
After spending the night with his unlikely former owners , the male lion returned to his pride .
“ We watched him go back to the two lionesses , who were not at all happy with this man , smelling of nicotine , whisky and humans , ” said Rendall .
“ He just walloped the two of them with his paw , then collapsed . ”
That was the last time Christian was seen .
Adamson – like his wife Joy – was eventually murdered in the bush by poachers .
But the film of the encounter has now been revived and is being used by the Born Free Foundation to raise funds for the work they continue to do with lions .
Born Free Foundation Founder and Trustee Virginia McKenna said : “ Millions of people have been moved by the amazing affection between Christian the lion and his human friends , John and Ace .
“ As Elsa the lioness , all those years ago , awoke a respect and fascination for lions so , I believe , Christian can be another ambassador for these wonderful animals .
Now so critically reduced in numbers , across Africa .
“ If you can help us to help them – join us , adopt a lion , buy the “ Christian the Lion ” DVD , made by my husband Bill Travers , we would be so grateful . ”

Karthik Rajaram had fallen hard .
The 45 - year - old Porter Ranch financial manager who once made more than $ 1.2 million in a London - based venture fund had lost his job .
His luck playing the stock market ran out .
On Sept. 16 , he bought a gun .
He wrote two suicide notes and a last will and testament .
And then , sometime between Saturday night and Monday morning , he killed his wife , mother - in - law and three sons , and took his own life .
“ This is a perfect American family behind me that has absolutely been destroyed , apparently because of a man who just got stuck in a rabbit hole , if you will , of absolute despair , somehow working his way into believing this to be an acceptable exit , ” said LAPD Deputy Chief Michel Moore .
“ It is critical to step up and recognize we are in some pretty troubled times . ”
Advertisement
In a letter addressed to police , Rajaram blamed his actions on economic hardships .
A second letter , labeled “ personal and confidential , ” was addressed to family friends ; the third contained a last will and testament , Moore said .
The letter to police voiced two options : taking his own life , or killing himself and his entire family .
“ He talked himself into the second strategy , ” Moore said .
“ That that would be the honorable thing to do . ”
Authorities believe Rajaram killed his family and himself after seeing his finances wiped out by the stock market collapse , according to a source familiar with the case , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing .
Concern about the family ’s welfare began Monday morning when Rajaram ’s wife , 39 - year - old Subasri , did not show up for her carpool .
Friends went to the house in the 20600 block of Como Lane , only to find it strangely quiet .
The morning newspaper lay in the frontyard .
The family ’s two cars , a Suburban and a Lexus SUV , were parked in the driveway .

When police entered the home in the gated , Spanish - style community , they first found the gunman ’s mother - in - law , Indra Ramasesham , 69 , dead in a downstairs bedroom .
His wife and three sons -- Krishna , 19 , a sophomore at UCLA majoring in business economics ; Ganesha , 12 ; and Arjuna , 7 , all named after Indian gods and warriors -- were discovered in various upstairs bedrooms , all shot in the head , some with multiple gunshot wounds .
Their father was found dead in a bedroom with Ganesha and Arjuna , the gun still in his hand , police said .
The Rajarams had lived in the upscale Sorrento neighborhood of Porter Ranch for a couple years in a 2,800 - square - foot rented house .
The landlords , another Indian couple , said that the family paid their rent on time and that there were no indications of trouble .
Neighbors in the Northridge neighborhood where the family previously lived said they were well - liked and enjoyed entertaining guests .
Except for one night when residents heard a man screaming for hours , the family seemed content for the nine years they lived there .

“ He loved those kids more than any man I ’ve seen love his sons , ” said next - door neighbor Sue Karns .
But Karthik Rajaram , who held an MBA from UCLA , was a hard - driving businessman .
He was involved in several financial ventures .
Between his home sale and another lucrative investment , he should have had a pile of cash .
A 2001 article in The Daily Telegraph of London , under the headline “ Bust , but big bucks for the big boys , ” called Rajaram a “ winner ” in a deal for NanoUniverse , a Los Angeles - and London - based venture fund taken public on the London Stock Exchange .
For a 12,500 - pound investment , Rajaram , one of the company ’s founders , received 875,000 pounds -- or about $ 1.2 million in 2001 dollars -- after a voluntary liquidation , the newspaper reported .
Advertisement
He also sold his house in 2006 , a calculated decision even though his wife , a bookkeeper at a pharmacy , did not want to move , their former neighbors said .
He sold the house for $ 750,000 , making a sizable profit on a home the couple purchased in 1997 for $ 274,000 .
“ The market was going down and he wanted to get out before the bottom dropped out , ” Karns said .
“ I talked to him last December and he said , ‘ I feel I did a good thing by selling when I did . ’ ”
It is unclear how Rajaram invested the cash since then and how he lost it .
Advertisement
In 2003 and 2004 , he worked for Greg Robinson , an entrepreneur and founder of several companies , at Azur Partners LLC , a management consulting agency .
Robinson said he was forced to fire Rajaram because “ his life was n’t moving in the right direction . ”
“ He had some behavioral problems , ” Robinson said .
“ He was n’t reliable .
. . .
He was not an emotionally stable person .
It was a real problem and would affect any business he was involved in . ”
The two had also worked together in the Century City office of PriceWaterhouseCoopers and Robinson recalled Rajaram as being “ a very smart guy , ” who he believed posted a perfect score on his business school entrance exam .

Although Karns and her husband said they liked Karthik Rajaram and were stunned by the news , they said he was “ very high - strung , very intense . ”
“ The man was never relaxed , ” Sue Karns said .
In the Porter Ranch neighborhood , next - door neighbor Kinda Almukaddem said she had rarely spoken to the family since they moved in a couple of years ago .
But in the last two weeks , Karthik Rajaram visited her twice asking whether she would be home this past weekend .
He urged her to keep her side windows shut because he had heard of burglaries in the area .
Rajaram seemed nervous -- shaking , pacing and taking notes on a notepad as he spoke to her , she said .
Advertisement
“ He noticed my side windows were open , the side that my house shares with him , ” she said .
“ Now , come to think of it , I think he was trying to have me close my windows on that side so I would n’t hear anything . ”
Police said nobody reported hearing gunshots or anything out of the ordinary .
But on Monday , the neighborhood was far from normal , with police leading convoys of media into the gated community .
Children at nearby Alfred B. Nobel Middle School , where 12 - year - old Ganesha Rajaram was a seventh - grade honors student , were sent home with notes informing their parents of the news .
“ This one will shake people to the core , ” Principal Robert Coburn said .
“ When you think about it , all kids have a mom and dad .
And if a father can do this to his kids , it ’s very scary . ”

An introduction to the Steady State Economy .
Should this be the way globalisation goes ?
Read the article then add your thoughts below .
Previous posts in the “ New Economic Architecture Required ” series have looked at Wealth & Value , Money & Debt and Growth & Competition .
What these very brief analyses have shown is that we , the human race , are living beyond our means .
A Steady State Economy may be a way of bringing our consumption back into line , eliminating boom and bust in the process .
The Steady State Economy
This economic model was first advocated within classical economics as John Stuart Mill ’s “ stationary state ” .
It has since been developed by Herman Daly , former senior economist at the World Bank and now a public policy professor at the University of Maryland .
There are a number of principles which underpin the Steady State Economy , not all of which can be detailed here .
The article Towards A Steady State Economy , published earlier this year on The Oil Drum , provides a full discussion .
Here is an outline of three of the key points :
The Limit of Economic Growth
Basic economic growth is fuelled by an increasing population buying ever more stuff .
This can not be sustained an so there comes times when spending can no longer support growth – recession .
The economy is therefore a finite creature which cannot sustainably grow beyond a population ’s overall wealth .
Once that ceiling has been reached any further growth is demonstrably unsustainable an should not be allowed to happen .
However , different parts of the economy will always rise and fall according to market pressures , thus continuing economic activity and its support for prosperity and rising standards of living will continue .
These rises may not be as fast , but they will be financially sustainable and permanent .
Conservation of Natural Resources
All economic activity is ultimately based upon the supply of naturally sourced materials : the raw materials which human ingenuity puts to good use .
Commodity markets are excellent vehicles to regulate the foreseeable availability of such materials .
However , they do not preserve these resources for future use : a boom in demand will always leads to a boom in consumption .
Oil is a perfect example of this .
A supplementary cap and trade system on all raw materials will ensure that they are not all used up in a decades long glut but would remain available for centuries to come .
As well as having a positive effect upon the economy ’s environmental footprint this will also gear economic activity towards development rather than growth .
This will put quality above quantity , establishing a lean and efficient economy where product differentiation is based upon the value as well as price .
Fair Participation
In Free Markets
Free markets work at their best when as many people as possible are able to participate in them in a fair and equitable manner .
At present this is not the case ; the wealthy are able to game the system to their advantage .
This prices the poor out of the market , disenfranchising them and leading to a market which is no longer free or fair .
The best way to remedy this is to set minimum and maximum levels to individual income and a ceiling on personal wealth .
These need not be overly constraining , just enough to ensure that dominance and disenfranchisement no longer occurs .
The knee jerk is to think about this as being anti-wealth .
It is not ; it ’s a pro-market measure designed to protect it and ensure all can participate and prosper in continued economic development , irrespective of wealth .
The Future Economy
[ social_buttons ]
No one can doubt the tremendous value free markets can bring to economic activity .
Like any powerful force , they need to be channelled to ensure their effect is predominantly beneficial .
The only question is , where should the regulatory boundaries be drawn in order to maximise the value created by free markets and limit their potential for destruction ?

Dear TrueCrypt Developers
I hate you all .
You 're a bunch of asshats .
Apparently , the good name of TrueCrypt is so incredibly valuable that you can't possibly permit anyone to redistribute it with the tiniest of modifications under the same name .
The minor problem with that is that it completely fucks things up for distributions .
We really can't package just about anything without modifying it .
For TrueCrypt that involves a small patch to fix your ridiculous system of having your users provide the source tarball for wxgtk and building an internal copy of it ; the patch simply lets us build against the system wxgtk , as nature intended .
It also involves , y'know , putting it in a package ( which is a modification under your license ) , adding a menu entry and consolehelper stuff to let normal users run it - you know , all the simple stuff that people actually want .
So the TrueCrypt package we want to ship with Mandriva has been ' modified ' .
And according to your ridiculous license , that means we can't call it TrueCrypt .
It ca n't identify itself as TrueCrypt anywhere .
It ca n't use any of the original graphics you ship it with , and it has to include some specific bits of boilerplate text and specifically exclude some others .
This is bad enough .
Yet you can't even make it easy for us , can you ?
If you 're going to require anyone who modifies your application in the tiniest of ways to rename it , you could at least MAKE IT EASY TO RENAME .
Y'know , have the name be a variable defined once in one file ; then we could simply change that and we'd be done .
But no .
The name is hardcoded in several dozen places and there are several variables in which it crops up .
All of which needs to be changed .
We can't even just do s/truecrypt / somethingelse / on the entire source tree because that would change it in some places where the license specifies it should n't be changed .
VERY FUCKING GOOD , THANK YOU .
If you 're going to require certain boilerplates be changed when the package is ' modified ' , at least make this easy .
It could perfectly simply just be a build switch .
But no , I have to go into random source files where the original boilerplate is hardcoded , and change it by hand .
Awesome .
Thank you once more .
And finally , if you 're going to require that no original graphics be used , you could at least MAKE THE FUCKING THING BUILD WITHOUT THE GRAPHICS FILES .
It 's not like they 're vital to functionality ; it could just display a blank grey space or whatever .
No functionality would be lost .
But no , if I just remove the files , the build breaks .
So I have to manually replace every single bleeding graphic with a stupid GIMPed up replacement .
Awesome .
So in summary your ridiculous license wasted eight hours of my life and results in a much uglier and more modified package than would be necessary if you did n't have such insane terms in the first place .
Way to shoot yourselves in the foot , guys .
Anyway , who the hell thought such a stupid license was necessary ?
Why are you so special ?
Imagine what the Linux world would be like if everyone decided to act like you ?
We 'd be releasing Mandriva Pinux , featuring JDE 4.1 , DWARF 2.24 and AjarOffice 3.0 .
Actually , we would n't , because we'd have wasted all our time on stupid rebranding patches and would n't be able to ship anything .
Everyone else seems perfectly happy to release their code under a license which lets distributors distribute it ( this is after all our job ) .
Get over yourselves and join them .
Or had n't you ever wondered why major distros do n't ship your software ?
For anyone actually wanting to use TrueCrypt on Mandriva - the package is called realcrypt .
6.0a will be in / backports for 2008 Spring and 2008 soon , hopefully .
It 's in Cooker now .
Oct. 25 , 2008 -- Chaos in the financial system may translate into better than expected bonuses for Wall Street .
Yes , you read right .
While the outlook is pretty grim , at least compared to last year 's $ 33.2 billion bonanza , compensation consultants expect a 30 % to 50 % decline in payouts this year , but billions will still flow .
Click here to learn more about what Wall Street 's titans earn at our partner site , Forbes.com .
The bonus pool is being artificially inflated by a combination of job losses ( meaning fewer people sharing the smaller pot ) , merger guarantees and efforts to retain or attract key employees .
Some workers will get nothing for sure , especially on desks that have had the worst performance .
Senior - most executive officers will probably see their bonuses slashed 70 % to 100 % , according to Alan Johnson of Johnson Associates .
But others , especially stars , and those in well - performing groups , will get their millions .
" There are people doing well , " says Johnson , an executive pay consultant who specializes in Wall Street compensation .
" Accruals are down , but not as much as you would think . "
If Johnson 's predictions hold out , Wall Street 's 2008 bonus pool will be $ 19.9 billion to $ 23 billion .
Johnson compares the current downturn to the 2001 - 2002 period , only then there was not this " artificial prop up " of the bonus pool .
" On a purely Darwinian basis , bonuses would be down a lot more , " he says of this time around .
Through the first nine months of this year , combined net revenues for Lehman Brothers , Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America , Merrill Lynch , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are down 27 % , to $ 202 billion , according to their quarterly financial statements .
Compensation costs for investment banks like Goldman are typically close to half of revenues , but bonuses are just one component of that .
Base salary and benefits make up about 60 % of a firm 's reported compensation costs .
The rest is in incentive and other deferred compensation .
The same banks collectively recorded $ 97 billion in compensation expenses so far this year , a drop of just 7.4 % from last year .
Again , bonuses are just a portion of this expense .
Lehman set aside $ 6.1 billion so far this year , Citi , $ 25.8 billion , JPMorgan $ 17.6 billion , Bank of America $ 14.3 billion , Goldman $ 11.4 billion , Merrill $ 11.2 billion , and Morgan Stanley $ 10.7 billion .
All of them , except for Lehman , will get $ 125 billion from the Federal government 's efforts to rescue the financial system , and in individual amounts that equal or exceed those accrued compensation numbers .
Citigroup , for example , is getting a $ 25 billion infusion of government money .
Banks are bound to be sensitive to the political and public relations problems associated with paying blockbuster bonuses , but that 's not going to stop them from paying something , most likely in the form of stock .
Deferred stock awards , which do n't have to be added to expenses until they vest , will likely be a popular way of rewarding employees this year .
" We expect to see cash drop quite significantly , " says David Schmidt , a pay consultant at James F. Reda & Associates .
Given that there are a lot fewer workers on Wall Street these days than there were last year , those who are getting bonuses may benefit from not having to share the pot with as many colleagues .
Then again , they may just feel lucky to have a job .
New York 's Independent Budget office forecast 20,000 job cuts earlier this year , but the actual number is now expected to exceed that by a long shot .
At Merrill Lynch alone , the job losses could total 10,000 as the company merges with Bank of America , says Ladenburg Thalmann Analyst Richard Bove .
Barclays is also seen cutting thousands of jobs as it acquires Lehman Brothers ' U.S. brokerage operations .
Guarantees are complicating pay matters this year .
Along with its acquisition of Lehman operations , Barclays inherited a $ 2.5 billion bonus accrual fund for New York - based Lehman employees , an amount greater than the $ 1.7 billion it is paying for the company .
Angry Lehman workers in London wanted to know why they did n't have access to a similar pool .
The $ 2.5 billion pool , which was kept separate from Lehman 's bankruptcy filing , works out to $ 250,000 for each New York - based Lehman employee , which is better than the $ 180,000 average Wall Street bonus in 2007 , when Lehman was still a solvent company .
Barclays says the money is an accounting accrual and that it has no obligation to use it to pay bonuses .
Firms are also under pressure to pay bonuses to keep some workers from walking across the street to a rival .
And then there are the sign - on bonuses banks paid so far this year .
Merrill 's John
Thain was particularly active at that game .
He snagged Thomas Montag , a star Goldman trader , with a promise of a $ 39 million sign - on bonus for this year .
Montag could get millions more , too , in stock if he leaves in Merrill 's change of control .
Banks may not have to pay up as much to retain lower - level worker bees , because there are simply fewer competitors to snatch them away .
Bear Stearns and Lehman are gone , Merrill is being merged into Bank of America , and hedge funds , the greener pastures of the last few years , are also ailing .

Rove : GOP infighting ' a sad sight to see ' David Edwards and Andrew McLemore
Published : Sunday October 26 , 2008
Print This Email This Republican strategist Karl Rove bemoaned finger - pointing within the GOP as the McCain campaign continues to fall behind in the polls , calling it a " sad sight to see . "
Speaking with Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday , Rove said the problem lies with politicians who lose confidence " before the decision is made . "
" It is a sign of undisciplined people who do not have the loyalty they ought to have to the candidate whom they are serving , " Rove said .
" Nobody makes themselves look good in this process . "
He admitted when prodded by Matthews that infighting usually spells a losing campaign , but criticized an article in Sunday 's New York Times Magazine , which detailed the dissidence among McCain aides that has drawn media attention .
Rove said he " was appalled by the personal attacks " he claimed the article made against McCain 's chief campaign strategist Steve Schmidt .
The magazine depicted Schmidt , an acknowledged protégé of the Rove - style campaigning associated with the Swift Boat attacks against John Kerry in 2004 , as largely responsible for the biggest gaffes of the McCain campaign .
The following is an excerpt from the article .
###
Discussion carried on into the afternoon at the Morgan Library and Museum as McCain prepared for the first presidential debate .
Schmidt pushed for going all in : suspending the campaign , recommending that the first debate be postponed , parachuting into Washington and forging a legislative solution to the financial crisis for which McCain could then claim credit .
Exactly how McCain could convincingly play a sober bipartisan problem - solver after spending the previous few weeks garbed as a populist truth teller was anything but clear .
But Schmidt and others convinced McCain that it was worth the gamble .
###
When asked by Wallace about recent accusations from McCain aides that Sarah Palin is a " diva " who has " gone rogue , " Rove said campaign aides have " enormous respect for her abilities . "
" We got two people that I know inside the McCain campaign who are not throwing in the towel , " Rove said , referring to McCain and Palin .
" Both of them energetically out there on the campaign and this is what is going to really matter in the next ten days , not what staffers are trying to cover themselves with . "

His new plan is more generous to financial institutions and more costly for taxpayers .
McCain changes homeowner plan
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) made an overnight change in the homeowner bailout he proposed at Tuesday ’s presidential debate , making it more generous to financial institutions and more costly for taxpayers .
McCain 's staff says it was always meant that way .
Advertisement
When McCain sprang his surprise idea at the start of the debate in Nashville , his campaign posted details online of his American Homeownership Resurgence Plan , which would direct the government to buy up bad home mortgages , allowing strapped people to keep their property .
The document posted and e-mailed by the McCain campaign on Tuesday night says at the end of its first full paragraph : “ Lenders in these cases must recognize the loss that they ’ve already suffered . ”
So the government would buy the mortgages at a discounted rate , reflecting the declining value of the mortgage paper .
But when McCain reissued the document on Wednesday , that sentence was missing , to the dismay of many conservatives .
That would mean the U.S. would pay face value for the troubled documents , which was the main reason Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) gave for opposing the plan .
A McCain campaign official explained the change : “ That language was mistakenly included in the initial draft , and it ’s been corrected .
It does n’t reflect the intentions of the initiative , which necessitated the correction and the removal of the sentence .
A simple mistake . ”
Obama Campaign Economic Policy Director Jason Furman said in the campaign statement opposing McCain 's plan : " John McCain wants the government to massively overpay for mortgages in a plan that would guarantee taxpayers lose money and put them at risk of losing even more if home values do n’t recover .
The biggest beneficiaries of this plan will be the same financial institutions that got us into this mess , some of whom even committed fraud . "
The McCain campaign estimates in both documents that the plan would cost about $ 300 billion .

Manage Your Finances With GNUCash
by Ostatic Staff - Jun. 06 , 2008
Hackers might like to think that the most important programs on their computer is an editor , programming language , or even a Web browser with the latest plugins .
But for many people , a computer is nothing more than a tool , something that they use to write letters , perform calculations , and create presentations .
Even if Linux were the most user - friendly operating system on the planet , but if it were n't for the OpenOffice productivity suite , no one would ever use it .
I thus continue to be surprised by the relatively low profile of an excellent productivity application , GNUCash .
There are many people who say that they can't or wo n't switch away from Windows because of Quicken , which allows them to keep track of their money .
GNUCash is a similar sort of program , but as you might expect , it contains not only a large number of built - in features , but also many capabilities that can be scripted and customized .
In its simplest form , GNUCash allows you to keep track of your money , in any number of different accounts .
GNUCash uses the double - entry bookkeeping system , which can seem difficult to understand until you actually try it .
The tutorials that come with GNUCash were more than enough to help me understand what was happening , and how to configure my accounts .
It soon became clear to me that my simple accounting needs are child 's play for GNUCash , which can handle an enormous number and variety of accounts , currencies , and payment schemes .
The most recent release of GNUCash ( 2.2.5 ) came out in late April of this year .
As usual , this version came with a number of bug fixes , particularly when it comes to importing QIF ( Quicken Interchange Format ) files .
One of the goals of GNUCash is to allow users to work with their banks and credit card companies , and this often means that GNUCash must be compatible with QIF , since so many people use Quicken .
In many cases , this means that you can have your bank information feed directly into GNUCash , giving you a living , unified view of your finances .
But GNUCash is more than just a Quicken clone .
You can access much of its functionality using Guile , a simple version of the Scheme programming language .
You can also create custom reports , including charts .
And of course , you can create output files that will be read by spreadsheets and other programs .
GNUCash is a powerful and useful piece of software , albeit one that addresses a mundane task .
If you are interested in taking better care of your finances , I suggest that you try GNUCash ; versions are available for Unix , OS X ( using X Windows ) , and Windows .

I 've now finished my Hoogle Summer of Code work , though I still intend to continue working on Hoogle when I get the chance .
Before the coding period expired , I was able to add a number of new features to Hoogle .
These features are all available at Hoogle , under http://haskell.org/hoogle/
The old text search feature was very fast , using an on disk trie to navigate around the possible matches .
The downside to this trie was the space it consumed , about half the database was devoted to it .
Fortunately , I came up with an alternative way to get fast text searching ( albeit slightly slower ) , in a lot more compact form .
Much smaller database files also mean much faster database generation , as the time spent in the IO routines is the main bottleneck .
I rewrote the underlying binary layer in Hoogle , to make it faster .
It 's not as fast as I would like , and I think that moving to memory - mapped files is probably a good idea .
With these improvements , along with the compact text searching , I am able to generate databases in about 2 seconds ( compared to about 20 seconds before ) .
Hoogle has been able to run database restricted searches for some time , but now the databases contain enough information to make it practical .
By addingorto the search you can include or exclude certain packages .
For example , to find out which map functions are in the containers package try map + containers .
To find out which map functions arein the containers or bytestring packages try map - containers - bytestring .
I have also split out the GHC .* modules from base , so if you want to find some unboxed types in GHC 's libraries try # +ghc .
Note that not all the documentation links work from the GHC modules , I am still trying to fix this .
By default Hoogle searches the following packages : array , base , bytestring , cabal , containers , directory , filepath , haskell - src , hunit , keyword , mtl , parallel , parsec , pretty , process , quickcheck , random , stm , template - haskell , time , xhtmlThe " ghc " package is also available if specified withand includes the GHC .* modules of base only .
I have now replaced the default Hoogle with Hoogle 4 , but have copied Hoogle 3 to http://haskell.org/hoogle/3 .
Unfortunately , it does n't yet work , as I need some admin help .
But it will in the next few days , I hope .
The only reason I can think of for using Hoogle 3 is Gtk2hs library searching , which I do want to add to Hoogle 4 when possible .
There are quite a lot of enhancements to Hoogle that I still want to make .
I have tried to list all these improvements in my bug tracker .
If you find a bug , or want some feature , open an issue .
If you have a particular interest in a bug , you can star it , to be informed on its progress and to indicate to me that you care .
I 'm particularly interested in two pieces of feedback :
Do you use any type / name search engine ?
Do you want to still use Hoogle 3 ?
Do you use Hayoo ?
If you use something else , what feature draws you to it ?
What do you dislike about Hoogle 4 ?
There are many things which effect Hoogle 4 users that I 'm not aware of .
If you open a bug saying what annoys you ( or leave a comment and I 'll do it for you ) then I can keep track of this information .
Even if you do n't necessarily see any way to fix the problems , I 'd still like to know them .
Thanks for everyone who has given feedback on Hoogle so far , it has been very useful .
IT IS bad enough that Americans are on the hook for $ 700 billion to bail out their country 's mortgages and banks .
But the financial crisis is about to visit even more serious fiscal harm on the economy by shrinking one of the Treasury 's plumpest sources of tax revenue .
Between 2004 and 2007 , the budget deficit narrowed from $ 413 billion to $ 162 billion in large part thanks to rapid growth in tax revenue .
This was caused not just by rising incomes , but also by a shift in the distribution of incomes to the wealthy , who pay the highest tax rates .
Much of that wealth came from the credit boom which drove up financial profits , salaries and bonuses as well as property and stock values and related capital gains .
But that means the financial bust is almost certain to crush the government 's tax take .
It has already started : the budget deficit for fiscal 2008 ( which ended on September 30th ) was $ 455 billion , or 3.2 % of GDP , much more than the $ 389 billion projected in July .
Much of the shortfall appears due to lower taxes on profits and the wealthy .
In early September , just before Lehman Brothers ' bankruptcy plunged the world into financial turmoil , the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office reckoned the deficit for fiscal 2009 would be around $ 438 billion .
But Peter Orszag , the agency 's director , now thinks it will be at least $ 750 billion , due both to the recession 's impact on revenue and spending ( such as for unemployment insurance ) and costs associated with various government bail - outs .
At 5 % of GDP , that would be the highest level since 1986 .
In fact , though , the deficit will probably be far larger .
J.D. Foster , an economist at the Heritage Foundation , notes that earlier this decade , when he worked in the White House budget office , the dotcom crash led to a loss of revenue equal to 2 % of GDP beyond what a weaker economy alone would account for : it resulted from lower capital gains , stock options proceeds , bonuses and other sorts of income that are highly correlated to financial markets .
That would equate to about $ 300 billion in today 's economy .
Mr Foster thinks the hit this time around will be even bigger because the recession is likely to be deeper than 2001 's mild episode and the pain on Wall Street greater .
Then there 's the prospect of additional fiscal stimulus , which won support on October 20th from Ben Bernanke , the Federal Reserve chairman .
The Democrats in Congress , who already have a $ 61 billion package in the works , are now suggesting $ 150 billion .
Barack Obama has proposed up to $ 190 billion over two years , and would merge that proposal with Congress 's one should he become president .
Republicans and John McCain have countered with separate grab bags of tax cuts , though continued Democratic control of Congress dooms such plans in their current form .
The $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Programme ( TARP ) will also add to the deficit , though less than might appear .
Mortgages or bank equity earn income and can later be sold ; they are not a drain on the Treasury like a tank or a dole cheque .
So when the Treasury purchases debt , it will only book a cost to the extent that it pays above the market price .
Oddly , though , when it purchases equity in a bank it will book the full cost in that year 's budget .
Since it plans to invest $ 250 billion in bank equity , the addition to the deficit this year will be at least that much .
This all threatens to add up to a deficit of at least $ 1 trillion , or nearly 7 % of GDP , this fiscal year , a figure that is likely to force the next president to postpone some of his more ambitious proposals .
Still , even fiscal hawks concede a higher short - term deficit is a tolerable price for avoiding a potential depression — though a 7 % deficit is probably testing their tolerance .
And at present the American government can borrow at absurdly low interest rates : 1 % for three months or about 4 % for 30 years .
Yet it can not take its lenders for granted .
This year , the Treasury may have to raise more than $ 1.4 trillion in debt , according to Morgan Stanley , to finance not just the deficit but the TARP and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .
“ It 's going to be painful to be faced with humungous auction after humungous auction especially when competing against Europe , ” which is funding its own bail - outs , says one Wall Street analyst .
The Treasury got a warning of this earlier this month , when yields on its bonds briefly spiked .
America has long borrowed without fear of a backlash , thanks to lenders ' lack of attractive alternatives .
And it may for a while yet : much of the private sector either can't borrow or does n't want to , and other countries also face yawning deficits , making them far from attractive .
The national debt , at 38 % of GDP , is well below its 1990s peak of 49 % .
But much of the deficit is still financed by foreigners , and global capital flows are now being rocked by the financial crisis .
The next president will no doubt find deficits at 7 % or more of GDP sobering enough .
Without a plan for cutting that high figure back once the financial crisis and the recession pass — and with the inexorable climb in Medicare and Social Security costs as the baby - boomers retire now under way — investors may need to be compensated much more than they are now to keep on buying America 's debt .
I promised to post the slides from our talk on the Haskell Platform which Don and I presented at the Haskell Symposium yesterday .
Haskell : Batteries Included
Malcolm did us all a great service by videoing the talks .
Unfortunately he had to catch his flight home before our talk so there is no video for that one .
Don did the talk with the slides and I did the live demo .
Fortunately the demo worked .
We ran the new hackage server on my laptop and we invited people to connect .
I demoed uploading a new package and within a few seconds people in the audience were able to download and install it using cabal - install .
That of course is old hat to the open source Haskell hackers but part of what we were trying to do is to persuade the academics to make better use of Hackage to publish libraries and tools that they develop as part of their research .
One new thing we demoed was generating build reports and uploading them back to the hackage server .
In fact we had several people in the audience upload report for the new package within 30 seconds of me uploading it .
The build reporting is part of the plan for testing the packages in the Haskell Platform but more generally to gather information on what packages build in what environments .
This applies to all fields , including medicines and health care industry .
First of all , a particular problem is taken into consideration .
The cause of the condition is identified .
After finding the causes , scientists use knowledge and research to find a suitable drug to address the problem .
For example , some researchers addressed the issue of male pattern hair loss .
They used scientific knowledge and researched thoroughly to get to the cause of hair loss .
In view of their findings , they came up with a drug called minoxidil .
HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) -- Asian markets were mauled Friday , with Japanese , Indian and South Korean indexes slumping more than 9.5 % each to end below crucial psychological milestones as fears of a global recession swept across the region .
Benchmarks in Hong Kong , Australia , Singapore and Taiwan dropped to their lowest levels in at least three years .
Japan's Nikkei 225
Average sank 9.6 % to end at 7,649.08 , a closing level it has n't seen since April 29 , 2003 .
The benchmark is now valued at less than a fifth of its all - time high of 38,915.87 , which it touched in December 1989 .
" There is a complete loss of confidence and it was brought on by the decline in Japan , " said Francis Lun , general manager at Fulbright Securities in Hong Kong .
" We are going back to the stone ages . "
South Korea 's Kospi index dropped even more , plunging 10.6 % to close at 938.75 , registering its first fall below the 1,000 - point level since June 30 , 2005 .
India 's Sensitive Index hit the day 's bottom at 8,566.82 , a level it has n't seen since November 2005 , before ending down 11 % at 8,701.07 .
During the tumultuous week , the Nikkei lost 12 % and the Sensex shed nearly 13 % , while the Kospi sank more than 20 % .
Hong Kong 's Hang Seng Index , which ended below the 14,000 - point level a day earlier , fell past even the 13,000 milestone during the session for the first time since October 2004 .
The index ended down 8.3 % at 12,618.38 .
" I do n't think the turmoil will be finished any time soon .
I think it 'll continue this quarter and the next .
It 's very difficult to see the bottom in the near - term , " said Hirokazu Yuihama , head of regional strategy at Daiwa Institute of Research in Shanghai .
The losses in Tokyo were led by Sony Corp. ( 6758 ) SNE , +0.25 % , which slumped 14.1 % to end at its lowest level since 1995 , after the company on Thursday cut its full - year profit forecast to 150 billion yen ( $ 1.54 billion ) from 240 billion yen , citing a stronger yen , weaker sales in its electronics unit and hard times in the financial - services segment .
See full story .
Other exporters were also hammered in the wake of Sony 's profit - warning after the U.S. dollar fell below the 96 yen - level , as risk - averse investors unwound their carry trades .
Singapore , rest of region
Australia 's S&P / ASX 200 dropped as low as 3,830 , the lowest it has seen since November 2004 , before paring some losses to end at 3,869.40 for a loss of 2.6 % .
Taiwan 's
Taiex ended at its lowest point of the day -- 4,579.62 , a level it has n't seen since May 2003 .
Singapore 's Straits
Times index touched the day 's bottom at 1,590.36 , a level it has n't seen since September 2003 , before ending down 8.3 % at 1,600.28 .
China 's Shanghai Composite and New Zealand 's NZX 50 index were among the best performers of the day , with the Shanghai index ending down 1.9 % at 1,839.62 , while the NZX 50 index lost 1 % to 2,778.55 .
Yuihama said recession worries were in place , and that it was " almost certain " that the U.S. and Europe could go into a recession during the third and fourth quarters of 2008 .
" That is very negative for Asian economies .
Export - dependent economies like South Korea , Taiwan and China will be hit hard , " he added .
He said Hong Kong 's Hang Seng Index was expected to find support near the 12,000 - point level , Singapore 's Straits Times index near 1,500 and Taiwan 's Taiex close to 4,300 .
Analysts said fears of further earnings downgrades for regional corporations also likely contributed to the sell - offs .
Peter Hilton , head of Asian equities research at Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong , said analysts were likely to downgrade corporate earnings for 2009 .
" In general , strategists and economists had held some hope that in the second half of 2009 , we might be moving ahead , but now , that 's being rapidly discounted and analysts are going to have to continue to discount 2009 earnings , " said Hilton .
After the crisis in the financial markets and the credit markets , " the next step is for the real economy , which is slowing quickly in the third quarter , " said Hilton .
Over $ 820 billion wealth lost in a week
The weekly losses this week across the top eight stock markets in the region -- Tokyo , Hong Kong , Shanghai , Sydney , Mumbai , Seoul , Singapore and Taipei -- totaled nearly $ 820 billion , according to FactSet Research data .
Of those losses , Tokyo , the largest stock exchange in the region by market capitalization , lost more than $ 190 billion , while Hong Kong lost almost another $ 180 billion .
Regional detail
In Tokyo , Sony 's outlook also dragged down other exporters , with Canon Inc. ( 7751 ) CAJ , - 2.70 % slumping 12.6 % and Sharp Corp. SHCAY , +3.13 % ( 6753 ) shrinking 13.7 % .
In Asian currency trading , the U.S. dollar bought 95.21 yen , compared with 97.56 yen late Thursday , as investors unwound their carry trades .
In Seoul , shares of Samsung Electronics Co. SSNLF , slipped 13.8 % after the company 's third - quarter net profit dropped 44 % from the year - earlier period , according to reports .
In Hong Kong , shares of market heavyweight HSBC Holdings ( 5 ) HBC , lost 12.5 % , pressuring the benchmark Hang Seng Index .
Among other notable losers , diversified China Resources Enterprise ( 291 ) lost 11.6 % and bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing ( 388 ) HKXCF , - 0.99 % fell 7.1 % .
Shares of Industrial & Commercial Bank of China ( 1398 ) gave up 7.4 % in Hong Kong and 2.6 % in Shanghai before the mainland 's largest lender reported a 25.5 % growth in third - quarter profit .
In Mumbai , shares of Maruti Suzuki India ended 9.9 % lower after it reported a 37 % drop in fiscal second - quarter net income from the year - ago period due to an increase in raw material costs and higher depreciation charges .
Among other big losers of the day , shares of real estate major DLF slumped 24 % , and market heavyweight Reliance Industries skidded 16.4 % , although it posted a better - than - expected 7.4 % growth in second - quarter net profit on Thursday .
December crude - oil futures fell $ 1.40 to $ 66.44 a barrel in electronic trading , after climbing $ 1.09 to $ 67.84 a barrel Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
From the Anchorage Daily News , a conservative columnist ends the deference on Troopergate :
The governor has given so many different reasons for firing Monegan I 've lost count .
From the " we need new direction " and " new energy " to " he was n't hiring enough cops , " to " he was n't doing enough about alcohol in the bush " to " he lobbied for budget increases " to the latest version , which is a doozy ; Monegan displayed " egregious rogue behavior . "
The governor also originally said that neither she , Todd nor anyone from her administration pressured Monegan regarding Trooper Wooten .
Palin then was forced to admit there was serial contact once the Frank Bailey tape surfaced .
But she insisted she was just learning of it .
But e-mails have surfaced detailing Palin complaining to Monegan about Wooten .
You will get more and greener bangs for your buck with new quad - core Xeons from Intel .
Intel is using a new process and building the chips without fire - retardent halogen which can pollute the environment around chips fabs .
The new Xeon 5400 processors use transistors made from a Hafnium - based , high -k metal gate formula .
The older silicon dioxide gates , running between chip substrates and just a few atoms thick , leaked current causing heat gain and additional power to overcome the losses .
The new gates are more than 100 times better in voltage leak terms , which makes the chip run cooler and need less power .
High -k gate Penryn 45 nm processors .
Intel 's 45 nm Penryn processors used the high -k gate technology first .
There are three chips in the 5400 line : X5492 running on 150 watts at 3.4GHz ; X5470 needing 120 watts and cycling at 3.5GHz ; and the X5430 needing just 50 watts to cycle at 2.66GHz .
Intel is also bringing out a new dual - core X5270 with an 80 watt power draw and 3.5GHz cycle rate .
The X5470 has recorded a record Spec _rate 2006 score of 150 .
Intel reckons workstation , high - performance , blade and mainstream servers will use these chips , made by Asus , Dell , Fujitsu , Fujitsu - Siemens , Gigabyte , HP , IBM , Microstar , NEC , Quanta , Rackable Systems , Sun Microsystems , Supermicro , Tyan and Verari Systems .
The new 5400 series processors are available now , while the X5270 will be available this fall .
You 'll have to pay quite a few bucks to get the bangs these little beasties deliver though .
The high - end X5492 is $ 1493 and the X5430 , the cheapest one , is $ 562 .
AMD hopes to move from its 65nm to a 45nm process before the end of the year , and will have a 125 - 45 watt Deneb chip line out in the first half of next year .

Why the crazy prices ?
The list above shows what are currently the ten most expensive paintings ever sold .
The following article , however , is an attempt to understand why ;
Why these particular paintings ?
Why these mind - boggling amounts ?
Before researching this list , I – a cultural layman – naively expected to see a through - line where money met majesty , where wealthy art aficionados blew their fortunes on specimens of unmitigated genius , and where my own lack of knowledge would blossom into understanding and appreciation .
What I found instead was a sordid mess of crime , propaganda , economic perversity and some pretty crappy art .
Together , these ten paintings were sold for more money than the average Briton will earn in 1,403 lifetimes2 .
While that sinks in , let ’s take a closer look at some of the factors behind the list .
6. Wasserschlangen II , Gustav Klimt
The art of the con
Forget artistry , forget beauty , forget historical significance .
There ’s a very simple reason why some of these paintings went for such ridiculous prices .
And , if you ’re anything like me , it ’s a reason that elicits a lovely warm glow of schadenfreude …
… the buyer got conned .
The world of high - end art dealing has always been a cesspit of forgeries , fraud and criminality .
So perhaps it ’s no surprise that the current list of most expensive paintings includes two sales that became part of one of the art world ’s biggest scandals : the so - called ‘ Bouvier Affair ’ .
9. No. 6 ( Violet , Green and Red ) , Mark Rothko
Since 2003 , Russian fertiliser magnate , Dimitry Rybolovlev , had been amassing a vast collection of high - end art bought via a Swiss art dealer , the eponymous Yves Bouvier .
This relationship had seemed rosy , until 2015 when Rybolovlev accused Bouvier of overcharging him for purchases over a 10 - year period .
Since the paintings in question were some of the most sought - after in the world , the scale of the finances involved was staggering .
According to Rybolovlev , Bouvier had inflated the prices on no less than 38 pieces he had bought through him , swindling the poor oligarch out of more than $ 1 billion in the process .
Both Klimt ’s Wasserschlangen II and Rothko ’s No. 6 ( Violet , Green and Red ) , numbers six and nine on the list , respectively , were among these scam sales .
The case of the Rothko sale is a good example of how Bouvier operated .
Rybolovlev was under the impression that he was buying the piece from French winemakers , Christian and Cherise Moueix , for the price of € 140 m with Bouvier acting as a middleman .
It turned out , however , that Bouvier had actually bought the painting from the couple himself for a mere € 80 m some months before .
Thus , after selling it to the unwitting Rybolovlev at an eye - watering mark - up of nearly 60 % , Bouvier pocketed a cheeky € 60 m for his offshore account3 .
Encompassing a series of ongoing civil and criminal proceedings in various countries , the Bouvier Affair has continued to snowball , shining a light onto the shadiness in all corners of the art world .
Last year , for instance , Rybolovlev filed a suit against Sotheby ’s , through which 12 of the 38 artworks were bought .
Seeking $ 380 million in damages , he claimed that the venerable auction house had ‘ instilled [ Rybolovlev ’s ] trust and confidence in Bouvier and rendered the whole edifice of fraud plausible and credible ’ .
A more recent twist saw Rybolovlev himself accused of multiple accounts of criminality for attempting to influence officials over the Bouvier saga .
With so many threads still playing out , it will be a long time before we reach the end of this saga .
Although , as we shall see later , it has n’t all turned out bad for the beleaguered Rybolovlev …
10 . No. 5 , 1948 , Jackson Pollock
Propaganda , postmodernism and poor taste
You may have been expecting the world ’s most expensive paintings to be dominated by classical styles – religious Renaissance art perhaps , or Turner ’s atmospheric landscapes , or Van Gogh ’s swirling colours .
Instead , the most common style represented – taking up four of the top ten spots – is the idiosyncratic smears , squiggles and splats of Abstract Expressionism .
For many of us , the sight of De Kooning 's inane smears or Rothko 's simplistic blocks of colour induce bemusement rather than awe .
But whereas a layman like myself might perceive only pretentious vacuity and facile mediocrity , those with vested interests ( whether financial , cultural , or vocational ) tend to see groundbreaking masterpieces and , of course , fat piles of money .
2. Interchange , William de Kooning
So how did such divisive scrawlings become some of the most coveted prizes in human art ?
The answer , or at least part of it , can be traced back to a covert propaganda campaign conducted by the US intelligence services .
Abstract expressionism ostensibly grew out of a rejection of post - war authoritarianism and conformity by left - wing American artists in the 1940s .
Unsurprisingly , it was initially shunned by the establishment ; derided for its simplicity and meaninglessness by cultural commentators and attacked by US politicians for its subversive intent by connecting it with the Cold War bogeyman of communism .
The CIA , however , saw something else in the burgeoning art movement – something they felt could help them win the cultural battle against the Soviet Union .
The predominant form of art in the USSR at the time was the rigid , state - sanctioned style of Socialist Realism .
The CIA recognised that abstract expressionism , with its unorthodox , chaotic and ultra-subjective approach , was the antithesis of the Soviet style .
But , even more importantly , it was American .
Thus , the CIA covertly set up and funded the Congress for Cultural Freedom to promote America – and abstract expressionism – as a beacon of artistic and intellectual liberty .
As documented by many sources in recent years , the organisation was a “ a vast jamboree of intellectuals , writers , historians , poets , and artists which was set up with CIA funds in 1950 and run by a CIA agent …
At its height , it had offices in 35 countries and published more than two dozen magazines ” .
4. Number 17A , Jackson Pollock
Running for many years and costing millions of dollars , the campaign was a huge success , propelling the art style to the forefront of the world ’s cultural landscape .
Through its global network of proxies and agents , both witting and unwitting , the CIA funded various high - profile exhibits for abstract expressionist artists , the most prominent of whom became exceedingly rich and famous as a result .
Though still ignored by many , the CIA ’s secret role in the promotion of abstract expressionism was made public decades ago .
In the years since , this style , and the subsequent postmodern styles it influenced , have become staples of the world ’s artistic output .
Today , works by Rothko , Pollock and their modern imitators hang on the walls of government institutions , corporate offices , soulless hotels and overpriced restaurants the world over .
This is because the groundwork laid during the period of CIA propaganda – the academic intellectualising , the chin-stroking criticism , the hype , the celebrity , the money – has been taken up wholeheartedly by the contemporary art industry and its advocates4 .
So , is the popularity of postmodern drivel all the fault of the CIA ?
Probably not .
Are the exorbitant amounts of money paid for abstract nonsense a result of CIA propaganda ?
Almost certainly .
3. The Card Players , Paul Cézanne
Cultural arms race of the Gulf states
40 % of the buyers of the ten most expensive paintings are the filthy rich rulers ( and their proxies ) of Qatar and Saudi Arabia .
For years these two rival states have been using their vast oil fortunes to amass huge museum collections of notable artworks and historic artefacts5 .
It ’s all part of their ongoing public relations attempts to rebrand their countries as modern global cultural hubs – instead of repressive , backward regimes – and themselves as patrons of the arts – instead of brutal , exploitative tyrants .
5. Nafea Faa Ipoipo , Paul Gauguin
Since coming to power in the mid-90s , aside from prising the country from the influence of Saudi Arabia , Qatar ’s ruling Al Thani family have been hoovering up pricey artworks from across the globe .
Three of the top ten list are Al Thani purchases – Picasso ’s Les Femmes d’Alger , Gauguin ’s Nafee Faa Ipoipo and Cézanne ’s The Card Players – the latter of which smashed the previous art price record on its sale in 2011 .
As many commentators have suggested , Qatar ’s mission to create a ‘ world - class ’ art collection in such a short period of time has helped inflate prices across the industry .
It ’s not like they ’ve been very discerning in their purchases either , buying and commissioning various pieces of crap from modern art ’s most talentless hype- magnet , Damien Hirst , for example .
This art splurge makes sense when you realise that Qatar needed to fill a glut of art galleries that opened in the capital , Doha , in the last decade – and the dozens more that are still being built .
Determined to not be outdone by their Qatari rivals , the Saudi royal family6 raised the stakes considerably in 2017 by making the most expensive art purchase in history .
Not only did the Salvator Mundi purchase beat the existing record price by a staggering 50 % , but it was also notable for another intriguing reason : it may not be a da Vinci painting at all .
1. Salvator Mundi , Leonardo da Vinci
There is no doubt that da Vinci did indeed paint the original Salvator Mundi sometime around 1500 .
Where this painting ended up , however , is somewhat hazy and further confused by the numerous copies made by the painter ’s pupils .
What is known for sure , is that the current Salvator Mundi , then an overpainted ‘ mess ’ attributed to an unknown painter , was bought at a New Orleans auction in 2005 for just $ 1,000 .
After many years of restoration , reassessment and speculation the piece was shakily attributed to da Vinci .
In 2013 , it was bought by our old friend Yves Bouvier for $ 83 million .
Who immediately sold it on to his bewildered chum , Dmitry Rybolovlev , for $ 127.5 million .
Luckily for Rybolovlev ( see , I told you it did n’t all turn out bad for him ) , the Saudi royals decided to purchase the piece for their pals at the new Abu Dhabi Louvre for the record sum of $ 450.3 million .
A bold move considering that the provenance of the painting was so dubious that the museum itself refused to exhibit it .
As pleasant as it is ( in a ' stoner Jesus ' kind of way ) , you might wonder why anybody would pay nearly half a billion dollars for a painting many believe is worth a tiny percentage of that ?
Notwithstanding the fact that these are the same insane rich people that want to build a robot city in the middle of a desert , it makes perfect sense when you realise that it has been a hugely successful PR campaign for the new museum and for Saudi Crown Prince Bin Salman himself .
Certainly makes for better headlines than his disgraceful war on Yemen , does n't it ?
8 . Nu couché , Amedeo Modigliani
Inequality , financialisation and speculation
Ultimately , this list is n’t about the art , it ’s about the money ( that is why this article exists and probably why you are reading it , after all ) .
For the ultra - wealthy who are doing the buying and selling , art is just a means to an end .
Whether the art is being purchased as a vehicle for money laundering , for boosting a public image , or simply for financial speculation , the end is , essentially , always the same : more wealth ( and , of course , the power which it confers ) .
The idea of art as investment has been around for a long time , but it received a calculated boost in the 1960s when the London Times newspaper teamed up with Sotheby ’s to periodically publish an index charting price rises in art sold at auction .
This wily piece of PR heralded the advent of art as a lucrative asset class , promising returns that could easily outperform traditional commodities .
In the decades since , the ‘ art as investment ’ trend has been breathlessly promoted by the corporate culture industries on one side and the parasitic financial industries on the other .
These , together with the increasing global inequality that has made the super - rich super - richer , have resulted in ever more money being splashed out on art assets .
7. Les Femmes d’Alger , Pablo Picasso
You can practically hear Deloitte ’s money - men salivating in their biennial Art & Finance Report as they work themselves into a frenzy over big money stats : ‘ With an estimated $ 1.62 trillion of UHNWI [ ultra - high net - worth individuals ] wealth allocated to art and collectables in 2016 and an estimated $ 2.7 trillion by 2026 . ’
With forecasts like that it ’s not surprising that the financial industries have been falling over themselves to create new financial instruments - ' innovative ' loan products , securitisation funds , derivatives , even blockchain technology - with which to further inflate and milk the financial potential of art .
But it ’s not just the potential for profit that makes art a favourite investment for the rich and dodgy – it ’s also the sector ’s complete lack of regulation and transparency .
Unlike just about every other item in the world , art can be bought or sold completely anonymously , there are no official registers of transactions or ownership .
This makes art the perfect investment vehicle for the world ’s increasingly wealthy elite .
These are , after all , people who have expanded their fortunes by circumventing regulations that the rest of us flout at our peril .
So , billions of pounds being poured into a highly financialised , unregulated market , propped up by a sycophantic media and the world ’s corrupt elite .
What could possibly go wrong ?
Well , as many commentators have pointed out , the speculative bubbles and crashes of the art market seem to mirror that of the wider global economy .
Most pertinently , the art market was riding high with investments and record - breaking sales just before the Global Financial Crisis struck in 2008 .
So , perhaps it should give us pause for thought that , when adjusted for inflation , nine of the current ten most expensive paintings were bought in the last 10 years .
If we ’re getting to the end of the current art bubble , then the coming pop may affect us all .

As someone who finds Rothko’s art laughably overrated , I find it quite fitting that a fertilizer tycoon , who made billions selling excrement , also spent his billions buying excrement .
The dribbles and daubs of abstract expressionism , much like the unmade beds and preserved sharks of postmodern contemporary art , are devoid of innate artistic merit .
Therefore , in order to keep the money rolling in , many people are employed in endless attempts to give meaning to the meaningless – and to inform those of us who think it ’s a load of crap that we ‘ just do n’t get it ’ ( they even employed scientists to ‘ disprove ’ the commonly held view that ‘ a child could paint that ’ ) .
You only have to hear people praising this kind of work for its ‘ delicate weft of insight , at once mystical , scientific and psychological ’ or its ability to ‘ provoke antithetical metaphysical responses ’ once to realise the truth in the following statement by British anarchist writer , Darren Allen :
‘ The pointless ugliness of contemporary art , the gladhanding venality of the art scene and the complete absence of sensitivity , intellect or originality in art criticism — in short the capitalism of the cultural industry — is usually disguised in a river of pseudo - intellectual pomo- babble ’ .
At least it ’s a more respectable way to fill museums than the old ‘ invade and plunder ’ technique that many western countries used to employ .
Though initially unknown , the buyer was revealed to be a ‘ lesser ’ Saudi prince , Badr bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al Saud , but many now believe that he was acting as a stand - in for the real owner , the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman .

I feel really bad for Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher , aka “ Joe the Plumber . ”
Here is a guy , minding his own business , playing football on his front lawn with his 13 - year - old son , when he looks up and sees a candidate for president walking down his street .
This particular candidate is tall , well - spoken , extraordinarily well - educated , accomplished , and black .
Joe is a Republican , so he figures he ’ll confront a Democrat he does n’t much care for .
He goes over to him and … well … embellishes a little bit , as we are all wont to do on occasion .
He tells the candidate he ’s trying to buy a business that brings in more than $ 250,000 a year , and that would mean he would have to pay more taxes , would n’t it ?
The candidate probably should have probed Joe a bit about whether he meant that the business charged a total of $ 250,000 or whether that was the profit , but he probably figured that Joe was a businessman and did n’t want to insult his intelligence .
So , the candidate from Chicago told him it would , but that tax savings for those earning less than he does would benefit others who could then afford his services more easily , meaning he could make more money from getting them as customers in a Keynesian “ spreading the wealth around . ”
Joe ’s encounter with Senator Obama was duly reported in the media , and as befits the news cycle in this time of rapid change , quickly forgotten .
Except by John McCain and his campaign staff .
McCain , you see , had a tough debate coming up soon , and he thought that Joe ’s story and Obama ’s “ spread the wealth ” comment could be used to advantage , so he went to the debate and constantly brought up Joe ’s name in an attempt to hammer Obama on tax fairness , making the point that if a plumber who had worked so hard and earned enough to buy a business could be hurt by Obama ’s tax plan , then so could other ordinary Americans .
There was just one problem :
Joe was n’t exactly who and what he said he was , and the media quickly found out about it and published what they found .
It turns out that Joe is not a licensed plumber and has never gone through any plumbing courses , which makes his work in Ohio illegal .
His employer has a license , but not to do work in Joe ’s county .
Uh oh .
Joe also owes nearly $ 1,200 in back taxes and there ’s a lien on his property .
He almost certainly does n’t have the money to buy a business ( his last public report of income was only $ 40,000 ) , does n’t really know much about business , and if the business he ’s dreaming of buying ( his boss ’s ) earns $ 250,000 + as he says , it must be the only two - man plumbing business in the world to do so .
And , there ’s an outside chance that Joe is related to Charles Keating ’s son in law .
Charles Keating is the swindler John McCain got entangled with that earned McCain a reprimand from the Senate Ethics Committee .
So where does this leave Joe ?
Well , he ’ll almost certainly be told to cease and desist working as a plumber until he gets a license .
The tax people will come after him .
His employer is bound to be angry .
He ’s about to become a national laughingstock .
There ’s a good chance that all those TV interviews people have been wanting will be canceled .
Joe is about to lose his livelihood , his good name , and his dignity .
And what about John McCain ?
Well , he ’s not only crushed Joe with his maverickness loose cannon - ness , he ’s also made himself look like a fool for running with a story that turns out to be just another Republican fairy tale ( see “ Reagan , welfare queen , the ” ) .
And this is the overarching reason why Americans should run screaming from John McCain .
I can imagine that carrier jet pilots need quick reactions and must sometimes make split - second decisions .
I ’m sure John McCain ’s willingness to make those quick decisions was very useful to him in wrecking three aircraft .
But who earth wants a president who makes snap judgments on complex issues ?
Do we really want a man who plays Lone Ranger , parachuting into delicate legislative negotiations to “ fix ” things , only to exit stage right ( Heavens to Murgatroid ) on a whim for a debate after those negotiations fall apart ?
Do we really want a guy who makes a snap judgment on a running mate , and gives us a woman who is undereducated , underexperienced , underbrained , undercurious , and under Todd Palin ( surely Paris Hilton has better taste ) ?
A woman who has spent enough time in beauty pageants and being a television sports announcer to give a professional look on camera , but who is stumped by that most difficult of questions : “ What publications do you read ? ”
Do we want a man who lurches from one campaign message to another every 32 seconds , hoping something , anything , will resonate ?
This time , John McCain hurt only Joe the Plumber with his impulsive behavior .
Give him the reins of the executive branch , and there ’s no end to the damage he can do .
We should know , should n’t we ?
“ Fire , ready , aim ” has been the motto of the White House for eight long years .
And it ’s been a great ride , has n’t it ?
Conservative pundits and bloggers expressed outrage over McCain ’s plan to buy up troubled mortgages .
McCain has pundits ' scratching ' heads
Conservative pundits and bloggers expressed outrage Wednesday over John McCain ’s plan for the federal government to spend $ 300 billion to buy up troubled mortgages , announced during his debate with Barack Obama Tuesday night .
“ Last night , he took that position on the housing issue of buying up everybody 's mortgage , ” former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said on Fox News .
“ Conservatives are scratching their heads today and saying , ‘ What happened ? ’ ”

" What on earth is that about ? " Huckabee asked .
“ Then you got to ask , which houses ?
The condos in southern Florida , where people bought $ 500,000 homes as a second home and now can't pay for them ?
Are we buying those , too ? ”
Conservative columnist and blogger Michelle Malkin could n’t hold back her disdain for the proposal .
“ I ca n’t underscore enough what a rotten idea John McCain ’s ACORN - like government mortgage buy - up is , ” Malkin wrote on her blog , referring to the controversial Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , a group reviled by conservatives for its support of liberal ideals and alleged corruption .
“ Will he propose a similar plan for those who bought mutual funds at or near the market top ? ”
“ Folks , forget about all this policy wonkery , ” National Review ’s Andy McCarthy advised in the magazine ’s online blog , The Corner .
“ McCain 's policies have driven us crazy for years . ”
“ The thought that he 's going to win this thing on policy is foolish , ” McCarthy wrote .
“ I mean , now , Fan , Fred and $ 800 billion later , his great idea is to spend a few hundred bill more to buy the bad mortgages ?
Really gets the juices flowing , does n't it ? ”
McCain senior domestic policy adviser Douglas Holtz - Eakin defended the plan in a conference call with reporters , calling it the “ best way to go forward . ”
“ Sen . McCain believes this is exactly the right kind of policy .
Provide direct help to homeowners ; at the same time , support the financial markets and keep them from further damaging the availability of credit to Main Street America , one of the — the real threats to the economy at this point in time , ” Holtz - Eakin said .
Under McCain ’s plan , the government would purchase mortgages directly from homeowners rather than from banks , and replace the homeowners ’ current payments with “ manageable fixed - rate mortgages ” designed to keep people from defaulting .
Taxpayers would cover the difference in cost between the old mortgage and the cheaper one provided by the government .
McCain critics said the plan was similar to ones already proposed and scoffed at the notion that it anything new .
But among conservatives , the idea of rescuing failed mortgages sparked the same sort of ire as the $ 700 billion economic bailout recently passed by Congress .
“ Conservatives groaned in unison when John McCain launched his ‘ new ’ initiative to renegotiate the principal on home mortgages with owners approaching bankruptcy , ” conservative blogger Ed Morrissey wrote .
“ Some called this a ‘ second bailout , ’ and others predicted a massive hit on home values nationwide , ” he added .
“ In fact , this is nothing terribly new nor innovative , and it has as much chance of preserving home values as it does of eroding them . ”
When introducing his plan during the debate , McCain acknowledged that it carried a high price tag .
“ Is it expensive ?
Yes , ” McCain said .
“ But we all know , my friends , until we stabilize home values in America , we 're never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy .
And we 've got to give some trust and confidence back to America . ”
Conservative financial scholar Alex J. Pollock of the American Enterprise Institute said he understands why conservatives are upset , but he sided with McCain nonetheless .
“ Nobody who understands the power of free markets likes bailouts , but it is a phase we go through again and again , ” Pollock said .
“ These are not things you ’d like to do , but you ’re addressing the crisis , so you do it . ”

A good deal of MMO game play revolves around combat .
Whether it 's World of Warcraft , Warhammer Online , or Age of Conan , at some point in the game you will be killing waves of rats in order to level up .
But , if you 're looking for something a little more peaceful , or maybe something with a little religious twist , then you may want to check out the creatively titled World of Peacecraft .
The game is being created by The Religious Society of Friends , also known as Quakers .
WoP will attempt to bring traditional Quaker values into the MMO space — for those of you wondering just how that could be turned into a game , here 's a brief description from The Click Heard Round the World :
Different quests will take you back in time in Quaker history , according to the notice .
You begin in 17th Century England , as you walk in the shoes of Quaker founder George Fox , preaching against the evils of war and unjust rule , meeting in clandestine locations to avoid persecution , and facing beatings and imprisonment at every turn .
Then you are transported to the early 1800s in the United States , helping shepherd escaped slaves to freedom as part of the Underground Railroad .
Later quests involve you in the women 's suffrage movement , the civil rights movement , and the anti-death penalty and anti-war protests of today .
I 'm still not too sure how that would translate into a game , but it does at least seem to be very different from any other MMO on the market .
The creators of the game are looking to appeal to more then just Quakers , however , and hope that all types of people will hop online into its online world .
" Whether you are a Buddhist , Muslim , Jew or just a curious agnostic , you will find much to do and enjoy in World of PeaceCraft , " WoP CEO Thad Thomas said .
What 's even more surprising than the concept of the game , however , is that its creators expect to launch in December for both the PC and Mac .
That 's not a lot of time to tune something as complex as a MMORPG .
Combine that tight schedule with the title of the game , and it's hard no to be a little suspicious of WoP .
Daniel Craig Says He Will Play Bond Until His ‘ Knees Go ’
Daniel Craig , who reprises his role as James Bond in the latest movie ‘ Quantum of Solace ’ says he will play Bond until his “ knees go ” insisting he has no intention of giving up the part in the near future .
He tells Britain ’s Hello ! magazine :
“ Bond is becoming a long - term job .
We will see how this one turns out .
If everything goes well , if people still want to see these movies , I will keep doing them for as long as it takes–or until my knees go , whichever happens quicker . ”
He also revealed he grew accustomed to Bond ’s cocktail of choice while shooting the new film adding :
“ I like the martini I had on the last film –the Vesper .
I can only do a few of them because they are a heavy drink –two parts vodka , two parts gin , then a measure of Kina Lillet .
It ’s a big fat heavy drink of alcohol but it ’s actually quite good .
I did n’t have to drink them on set but we did .
We ordered it all in and got shakers and played around with the measure .
The trouble is , with three it ’s OK but four , you ’re thinking , ‘ Well , this evening could be over soon ! ' ”
Tonight , Sony is launching a TV ad campaign featuring Daniel Craig as James Bond to promote its high definition televisions in a tie - in with the upcoming Quantum of Solace film .
The new ad has been timed to heighten public interest in the launch of the latest Bond film on October 31 .
The campaign will run on TV and cinema and print ads will run in - store where Sony products are sold .

HOW quickly would Usain Bolt have run the 100 metres at the Beijing Olympics if he had n’t slowed in celebration before the finish line ?
A team of physicists have calculated an answer : the Jamaican gold medallist could have slashed his time from 9.69 seconds to 9.55 seconds .
In the final 20 metres of the race on 16 August , Bolt extended his arms and thumped his chest in celebration , slowing himself a little .
But he still broke the world record he himself had set in May .

Celebrities are often used as role models , affecting how we dress , what we eat , places we go and how we behave .
What can we learn from celebrity in regards to our web sites ?
I was surprised to find that many of the top celebrities did not have any kind of official website , with others leaving the task of building their official web site to sponsors .

( Updates with Citadel ’s denial the Fed spoke with counterparties about problem debt )
CHICAGO , Oct 25 ( Reuters ) - Examiners with the Federal Reserve have questioned Wall Street counterparties about their exposure to debt and other holdings of Citadel Investment Group , The Wall Street Journal said on Saturday , a report Citadel denied .
Citing people familiar with the matter , the Journal said the Fed questioned the counterparties in at least two instances in recent days .
But Katie Spring , a spokeswoman for Citadel , denied the rumors that the Fed had spoken to the hedge fund ’s counterparties specifically about Citadel and possible problems with its debt .
“ We deny these rumors , ” she told Reuters on Saturday .
She said that Citadel continues to have more than 30 percent of its investment capital in cash .
The Journal ’s report came a day after Citadel , one of the world ’s largest hedge funds , said it had more than $ 10 billion in available credit .
The Chicago - based fund company , which manages $ 18 billion , held a conference call to quell rumors it was facing liquidity issues .
The fund firm , founded by Kenneth Griffin 18 years ago , denied on Friday market talk it had approached the U.S. Treasury for a cash injection and that the Federal Reserve was coming to inspect its accounts .
The rumors had surfaced in the wake of news that Citadel ’s two main funds had lost 35 percent since January , traders and hedge fund investors said on Friday .
The Fed has been speaking with dozens of prominent hedge funds and their counterparties in the past weeks to monitor trading and liquidity issues as the financial crisis deepened , industry sources have said .
The average hedge fund has lost roughly 19 percent since January , the $ 1.7 trillion industry ’s worst - ever performance , according to data from Hedge Fund Research .

" Perl 5 to 6 " Lesson 09 - Comparing and Matching
2015-02-25
" ab " eq " ab " True " 1.0 " eq " 1 " False " a " == " b " failure , because " a " is n't numeric " 1 " == 1.0 True 1 === 1 True [ 1 , 2 ] === [ 1 , 2 ] False $x = [ 1 , 2 ] ; $ x === $x True $x eqv $x True [ 1 , 2 ] eqv [ 1 , 2 ] True 1.0 eqv 1 False ' abc ' ~ ~ m/a/
Match object , True in boolean context ' abc ' ~~ Str True ' abc ' ~~ Int False Str ~~ Any True Str ~~ Num False 1 ~~ 0..4 True - 3 ~~ 0..4 False
Perl 6 still has string comparison operators ( eq , lt , gt , le , ge , ne ; cmp is now called leg ) that evaluate their operands in string context .
Similarly all the numeric operators from Perl 5 are still there .
Since objects are more than blessed references , a new way for comparing them is needed .
=== returns only true for identical values .
For immutable types like numbers or Strings that is a normal equality tests , for other objects it only returns
True if both variables refer to the same object ( like comparing memory addresses in C ++ ) .
eqv tests if two things are equivalent , ie if they are of the same type and have the same value .
In the case of containers ( like Array or Hash ) , the contents are compared with eqv .
Two identically constructed data structures are equivalent .
Perl 6 has a " compare anything " operator , called " smart match " operator , and spelled ~~ .
It is asymmetrical , and generally the type of the right operand determines the kind of comparison that is made .
For immutable types it is a simple equality comparison .
A smart match against a type object checks for type conformance .
A smart match against a regex matches the regex .
Matching a scalar against a Range object checks if that scalar is included in the range .
There are other , more advanced forms of matching : for example you can check if an argument list ( Capture ) fits to the parameter list ( Signature ) of a subroutine , or apply file test operators ( like -e in Perl 5 ) .
What you should remember is that any " does $x fit to $y ? " - Question will be formulated as a smart match in Perl 6 .

Terrorists are increasingly turning to credit cards , according to an expert on terrorist financing .
Credit cards serve two key terrorist functions , providing both operational funding and as a means of distributing money to group members .
“ Credit card exploitation and fraud has become a growth industry for terrorists , ” writes IPSA International ’s Dennis Lormel in a September 2008 white paper entitled , “ Terrorism and Credit Card Information Theft . ”
Lormel is a managing director with investigative consulting services provider IPSA .
According to Lormel : “ Credit card information theft and fraud represents a lucrative funding stream for terrorists and consequently poses a serious threat to our national security . ”
While Lormel writes that there is no exact data on the amount of credit card use by terrorists , there are “ ample ” reports showing that terrorists do rely on credit card information in helping to reach their goals .
Terrorist reliance on credit cards appears to be on the rise .
“ I think it ’s taken an upward path over the last few years , ” Lormel says via phone , meaning “ a limited number of people can do an incredible amount of damage . ”
Payment system experts agree that terrorist reliance on credit cards is worthy of concern — even if it ’s less than shocking .
“ Fraud and terrorism do go hand in hand , ” says Judith Rinearson , a partner with the international law firm of Bryan Cave .
“ That ’s not a huge surprise . ”
Eyeing cards , stopping terrorists
Banks and financial institutions have an important role to play in combating terrorism since they can effectively limit the flow of funds to terrorists .
“ The focus for credit card fraud should be placed on both the source and availability or distribution of funds , ” Lormel writes .
Fighting terrorists involves capitalizing on their weaknesses .
“ Communication and financing are the two biggest vulnerabilities for terrorists , ” Lormel says , since both represent opportunities to track and identify them .
The fight requires “ us being able to exploit their vulnerabilities as opposed to them exploiting ours , ” he says .
That ’s why financial institutions have a tough — but necessary — job to do .
“ The banks have been trying very hard to stay on top of it , ” Rinearson says .
Still , with terrorists constantly updating their techniques , “ It is a moving target , ” she says .
Nevertheless , it ’s a target that banks must hit , says Debra Geister , director of Fraud Prevention & Compliance Solutions with LexisNexis in New London , Minn .
“ Terrorism is a very dynamic and ongoing thing , ” Geister says .
As terrorists get more creative financially “ it puts more of the general population at risk , ” she says .
It ’s not only the danger to consumers that keeps banks attentive to anti-terrorist measures .
“ Financial institutions are certainly mandated by law to do so , ” Geister says , with both negative press and the wrath of regulators resulting if banks do not .
“ They want to do everything they can to be diligent to protect themselves and protect the financial systems in this country , ” she says .
White paper worth considering
Lormel ’s white paper was released by enterprise payment solutions developer Shift4 Corporation as a follow - up to a presentation he gave as a speaker at Shift4 ’s 2007 Real Security Summit .
Lormel is more than just an author : Before taking on his role as a managing director for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism issues at IPSA International , Lormel spent 28 years as a special agent for the FBI .
In his paper , Lormel notes that it is important to consider the various types of terrorist groups , what funding they require , the mechanisms used for fundraising and operations and the degree to which individual members and cells are used .
Groups such as al - Qaida , Hezbollah and Hamas may have similar monetary needs and operational goals , but their funding sources , actual operations and use of funds are “ vastly different , ” Lormel writes .
Therefore , preventing terrorist financing requires a consideration of differences in operations and funding requirements .
Al - Qaida turns to plastic
For example , the shift in al - Qaida ’s structure — from an organizational structure to an ideology associated with regional terrorist groups back to a group reforming as an organization — has meant a change in its source of funds .
Where al - Qaida once relied on wealthy donors and charities for most of its money , pressure from the U.S. government on Middle Eastern donors and charities prompted a shift :
“ This led to greater reliance on criminal activities including credit card information theft and fraud to raise funds , ” Lormel writes .
“ Al - Qaida operatives commit credit card information theft and fraud more on an individual basis than as a group or cell activity .
However , depending on the circumstances , they will commit fraud as a group or cell . ”
Movement of funds
Terrorists ’ home base also determines whether cards are used .
Depending on their locations , terrorists may choose to move money by formal or informal means .
While countries such as Pakistan and Afghanistan present opportunities for the informal movement on funds , “ To operate in Western society , terrorists must rely more on formal mechanisms ” like credit cards , Lormel writes .
The ability to carry plastic has benefits for terrorists .
Other experts have noted that credit cards allow the easy movement of funds between countries and between individuals .
Compared to cash ( which is subject to scrutiny as it crosses borders ) , cards provide a less conspicuous way to get money to operatives .
Not everyone agrees that credit cards make more sense for terrorists .
“ Not only are card transactions easy to trace , but the cards can also be frozen and turned off , ” says Rinearson .
True , says Geister , but that may not mean much for terrorist fraudsters .
“ How well can I track them if they ’re using somebody else ’s identity ? ” she wonders .
Terrorists who have multiple accounts in several names and no intention to repay may find a closed card to be little more than an inconvenience .
In the end , cash and credit may each be useful tools for terrorists .
“ One way or the other they both serve their purpose , ” Geister says .
Plastic fraud
Calling credit cards “ extremely vulnerable to fraud ” and “ used extensively by terrorists , ” Lormel highlights five out of 12 areas of “ systemic weakness ” terrorists use to raise and move funds that involve credit card information and fraud :
Identity theft and fraud —
Theft of card information , for example , can be used to establish a false identity .
Credit cards —
The Internet can serve as an educational medium , as well as a means for stealing via hacking and phishing .
Criminal activity —
Crime is increasingly relied upon to raise funds , but can also leave terrorists more open to detection .
Internet — Credit card information is “ extremely vulnerable ” to being exploited using the Internet .
Cyberfraud —
Terrorists routinely visit websites and chat rooms to discuss hacking , carding and other schemes .
Lormel cites the case of Imam Samudra as underscoring the need for credit card security .
Samudra acted as a member of the Indonesian affiliate Jamaah Islamiah and masterminded the 2002 nightclub bombings in Bali .
In his jailhouse manifesto written in 2004 , Samudra included a chapter that discussed the vulnerability of U.S. computer networks to hacking , credit card fraud and money laundering .
Instead of focusing on specific techniques , however , Samudra explained how to find others in chat rooms to perfect hacking and carding techniques .
The Internet represents a perfect place for terrorists to trade techniques .
“ With that type of information available for people to use and develop tradecraft , it plays right into that upward trend , ” Lormel says .
It also allows terrorists to maintain a low profile , even as they plan or stage attacks .
“ One thing about the Internet is that it ’s a very anonymous channel , ” says LexisNexis ’s Geister .
Changing world , changing terrorists
“ It is possible to detect terrorist financing but not highly probable , ” Lormel writes .
That ’s why he recommends systems be created and put in place that make it more likely .
For banks , “ You ca n’t be static , and you ca n’t be complacent , ” Rinearson says .
“ Financial institutions need to constantly review red flags , review losses and then update and enhance programs . ”
As for cardholders , experts say they should look for unusual account activity on their credit reports and make every effort to protect credit card data , including on receipts from retailers , as well as making sure online protections like virus filters and firewalls are in place .
It comes down to one central point .
“ Credit cards are certainly a tool that can be exploited , ” Lormel says .

At its Professional Developers Conference , Microsoft has shown Windows 7 to the public for the first time and has revealed a user interface with some of the largest changes to the operating system 's interface since Windows XP — if not earlier — and which bear slight resemblances to Apple software .
The public appearance on Tuesday has shown an interface that may be familiar to long - time Windows veterans but which also rethinks concepts that have existed since the introduction of the taskbar in Windows 95 more than 13 years ago .
Like Apple 's Dock in Mac OS X , Microsoft is now taking a more minimalist approach to its task management and has reduced the taskbar to a sliding list of icons that includes both running software and shortcuts to commonly - used titles .
A new context - sensitive menu item , known as a jump list , lets Windows 7 - aware programs offer some of their built - in functions without having to switch tasks — a function already present in Mac- oriented programs like iTunes , which supplies basic track navigation without having to bring iTunes to the front or invoke its Dashboard widget .
Other changes to the taskbar , however , are meant to improve window switching and are potentially faster than tricks such as Expose in Leopard .
Mousing over any active program 's icon in the taskbar shows all open windows , while users can also quickly peek at the larger contents of a window just by mousing over the thumbnail , which temporarily brings the window to the front .
Windows 7 's taskbar : active programs have borders that show the number of windows .
The Windows 7 desktop ; system tray at bottom right , desktop gadgets ( widgets ) in background .
Besides these additions , Windows 7 should have several changes to other parts of the operating system that are either intended to simplify common actions or to eliminate nagging quirks of Vista .
The system tray is now locked into the place and wo n't show third - party apps that the user has n't authorized ; the Gadget sidebar has been scrapped in favor of desktop items ; dragging windows to the screen edges resizes them automatically based on context .
And Microsoft's now notorious User Account Control , which was attacked by critics as imposing security prompts too often , can now either be toned down to infrequent warning - only messages without being shut off entirely .
A new file system feature dubbed Libraries lets users view files of particular types or content in special modes without having them located in a particular folder or launching a search .
Additionally , the ribbon interface from Office 2007 will port over to key Windows apps to try and reduce the clutter of menus in those components .
At a deeper level , Microsoft also plans for a FileVault - like drive encryption system known as BitLocker , a Device Stage service for managing cameras , peripherals and other plug - in hardware , and better maintenance that includes protection against unstable drivers that repeatedly crash the system .
Windows 7 should also perform much more smoothly on low - end hardware and , according to multiple live reports , was demonstrated at the conference running well on a netbook .
Until now , Microsoft has been forced to offer Windows XP for these systems to avoid handing the market to Linux .
A Windows 7 Library showing photos from the entire system sorted into groups .
Paint in Windows 7 is one of multiple apps using the ribbon toolbar at top .
The introduction of Vista 's eventual successor comes at a critical time for the Redmond , Washington - based company .
It recently launched a $ 300 million ad campaign in an attempt to mend the public perception of today 's Windows as broken but which also avoids mentioning Vista by name — a trait which Apple has been keen to exploit in its latest " Get a Mac " ads , which jab Microsoft for purportedly being ashamed of its own product .
Some businesses home users have yet to adopt Vista due to compatibility and performance problems that prevent these groups from using legacy hardware or software .
Despite the relatively complete showing of version 7 , though , Windows users still have a significant wait before it 's made available as a finished release .
A test version released to attendees is described as pre-beta and will require at least one additional beta and customer responses before a final ship date , which Microsoft has estimated is most likely for early 2010 .
I post this from time to time to see if there are any corrections , or additions , that people can help me with .
This project originally began out of disgust over a foolish and inaccurate male privilege list that I saw foisted on a public gathering by a male gender feminist .
Men are :99.999 % of American combat deaths and casualties ( historically ) 97 % + since the 1st Gulf War ( DOD ) " The numbers of wounded women and female amputees , meanwhile , are considerably less than their male counterparts -- at least 378 wounded versus 17,490 ; 11 amputees versus over 400 - - but they are historic for modern day warfare .
"
A Pentagon study published in March on the mental health of soldiers returning from deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan found that more than one - third of U.S. soldiers received psychological counseling .
A statistic buried in the study : 23.6 percent of women reported a mental health concern compared with 18.6 percent of men.( currently , women are not even required by law to register for selective service , but even retarded or physically disabled men are , in addition to all the healthy ones ) 94 % of industrial deaths and accident ( NIOSH ) ( Even though murder is the leading workplace cause of death for women , a statistic often used by gender feminists , that number is only a percentage of the 6 % of workplace deaths that women comprise .
In other words , " a fraction of a small fraction . " )
Men are : 76 % of homicides DOJ80 % of Suicides CDC # Suicide took the lives of 30,622 people in 2001 ( CDC 2004 ) .#
Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death for all U.S. men ( Anderson and Smith 2003 ) .# 24,672 suicide deaths reported among men in 2001.24,672 / 30,622 = .8056952 ( or in other words , over 80 % of all suicide deaths in 2001 were male ) also : " Suicide ranks 11th among causes of death in the US , with 30,622 completed suicides in 2001 .
It is the 3rd leading cause of death among people 15 to 24 yr .
Men ≥ 75 yr have the highest rate of death by suicide .
Among all age groups , male deaths by suicide outnumber female deaths by 4:1 . "
" The other most common suicide victims are divorced and / or estranged fathers like Derrick Miller .
In fact , a divorced father is ten times more likely to commit suicide than a divorced mother , and three times more likely to commit suicide than a married father .
According to Los Angeles divorce consultant Jayne Major : " Divorced men are often devastated by the loss of their children .
It 's a little known fact that in the United States men initiate only a small number of the divorces involving children .
Most of the men I deal with never saw their divorces coming , and they are often treated very unfairly by the family courts .
'" A woman is the party filing for divorce in about 66 % of divorce cases .
" How often was it that many more of women wanted the divorce more than the men ?
2/3 .
The same as the amount responsible for divorce filings .
And yet another study of divorced couples found that the majority of divorced wives and husbands both agreed it was the wife who wanted out .
" Women receive custody in about 84 % of child custody cases .
In the spring of 2002 , an estimated 13.4 million parents had custody of 21.5 million children under 21 years ofage whose other parent lived somewhereelse .
About 5 of every 6 custodial parentswere mothers ( 84.4 percent ) and 1in 6 were fathers ( 15.6 percent ) , proportionsstatistically unchanged since 1994 ( Table A ) .

Even though more women die of heart disease each year , men die of heart disease many years earlier .
The 2006 United States ' rate of incarceration of 751 inmates per 100,000 population is the highest reported rate in the world , well ahead of the Russian rate of 628 per 100,000.93 % of the prison population is male with over 60 % having no High School education .
America has now passed Russia as the country that has the largest percentage of its population incarcerated , yet we still claim to be the freest country on earth .
The number of persons on probation and parole has been growing dramatically along with institutional populations .
There are now 7.2 million Americans incarcerated or on probation or parole , an increase of more than 290 percent since 1980.205 ( and growing ) wrongly convicted people have been exonerated by DNA evidence since the beginning of the Innocence Project .204 of the wrongly convicted were men .
Most of them had charges of rape against them .
As we see in the Duke Lacrosse rape case fiasco , false accusers are rarely prosecuted and when they are it is only as a misdemeanor ( at most ) , while rape itself is vigorously prosecuted as a felony .
One attorney speaking at premiere for the movie , After Innocence , estimates that there are between 20,000 and 100,000 wrongly convicted still in prison .
We hear a lot about the historical oppression of women 's voting rights , but few if any women who were born in the 20th century were every without the right to vote in their lifetime , upon reaching legal voting age .
On the other hand , around 2400 hundred California men ( 42 % of CA men killed in Vietnam ) gave their life for their country without being allowed by their country to vote .
The exact number is 2,381 .
Four of the twelve Iwo Jimo flag raisers died for their country without their country ever allowing them the right to vote .
" The youngest Vietnam KIA is believed to be Dan Bullock USMC , at 15 years old .
At least 5 men killed in Vietnam were 16 years old .
At least 12 men killed in Vietnam were 17 years old .
There are 120 persons who listed foreign countries as their home of record .
At least 25,000 of those killed were 20 years old or younger .
The oldest man killed was 62 years old .
" If you do a full count on all the men in the 20th century who died for their country without being allowed to vote the numbers will be staggering .
In America there are over 270 women 's commissions , but only one for men in New Hampshire .
There are over 700 Women 's Studies programs on colleges and universities throughout the United States teaching thousands or tens of thousands of classes from the gender feminist perspective , but not one program or class , teaching men's studies from the masculist perspective .
Men are a significant percentage of domestic violence ( 26 % of intimate partner homicides ) , yet are denied service at most tax payer funded domestic violence shelters .
In contrast , women get every veteran 's benefit a man does , yet comprise less than 3 % of combat deaths or casualties and a woman makes the cover of Time magazine ( person of the year / 2003 standing in front of two men .
It appears to me American men are routinely treated like 2nd class citizens in their own country .
CDC lists male victims of domestic violence at more than 34 % , but men injured in Iraq ( and all other men ) are by law in California excluded from domestic violence shelter services .
They would have a lot of trouble getting in a CA shelter if some evening the little misses puts a frying pan to their head .
Only one shelter in Lancaster , CA accepts men and it has been extensively harassed for doing so .
Someone online pointed out in a post that some people say breast cancer is a greater concern in women than prostate cancer in men based on reported deaths overall .
Are we considering that men today die on average 6 years sooner than women ?
I read somewhere that around 1920 the death rates were roughly equal .
The death rates for prostate and breast cancer are similar , but because men die of other things more frequently - accidents , war , heart disease etc. , there are fewer men left to die of prostate cancer .
" This would be akin to saying people from a nation like Zimbabwe are immune to Alzheimer 's - but in fact they die of other things before they can get old enough to contract Alzheimer's .
" The Socialist / Communist wage gap myth based on the " comparable worth " paradigm : Spending Gap: orPocketbook Power : How to Reach the Hearts and Minds of Today 's Most Coveted Consumer - WomenBernice KannerFrom the Back CoverNot too long ago , legendary adman David Ogilvy chided his peers for talking down to women .
He berated those who ignored women or discounted them , misconstruing men's higher paychecks to mean greater spending clout .
And he was right .
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis , women -- who comprise just over 51 percent of the U.S. population , making them the largest consumer segment in the country -- control six trillion dollars in buying power annually .
Statistics show that : Women make 88 percent of all U.S. retail purchases .
Some experts even predict that , by 2020 , women will control most of the money in America .
Women control 88 percent of all purchases .
Women handle 75 percent of family finances .
43 percent of those with assets over $ 500,000 are women .
One out of every 11 women in America owns a business .
Women influence two out of every three of the 3 trillion dollars spent in the U.S. each year !
Men die on average about 5 years earlier than women , but no compensation is made in the Social Security System 's retirement age for this disparity .
Exactly which areas those were , he could n't say ...
" How about equal rights in parenting , domestic violence policies , criminal sentencing , paternity , forced labor , military conscription , public health policies , genital integrity , false accusations , reproductive rights , and equal rights across the board ?
' How come you never talk about men ?
You do n't blog about areas where men are underrepresented !'
Exactly which areas those were , he could n't say ... "
They also are underrepresented in enrollment on college and university campuses based on their numbers in the general population .

For the next giant leap in spacecraft design the action is with a handful of rocketeers trying to blast their homebrew missiles into the beyond . *
Photo : J.Bennett Fitts * __Mounted horizontally __on a launch rail , the long , slender rocket exudes such papable menace that you cant ' help but feel sorry for the poor bastards on the receiving end .
Except that this is n't a wapon of mass destruction .
It 's a glorified toy built by middle - aged hobbyists moonlighting as rocket scientists .
The only people in imminent danger are the guys standing around the makeshift launchpad .
We 're in the middle of Black Rock Desert , the vast , dry lake bed in Nevada ( best known as the site of the annual Burning Man bacchanal ) , and at the moment there 's nothing to hit for miles in any direction .
But there 's a very real risk the thing will blow up before it leaves the ground .
" All right , listen up , " says Wedge Oldham , a sturdy , take - charge ex-Navy submariner , now a software engineer , who launched his own 30 - foot - tall , 700 - pound monster during a previous visit to the playa .
This morning he 's responsible for inserting the igniter into the motor of the rocket .
The solid - fuel propellant is inert , so there 's almost no chance it will catch fire prematurely , but the pyrotechnic compound around the igniter is notoriously flammable .
" If something goes wrong , the thermite will go off instantaneously , " Oldham says .
" There will be no ducking or running out of the way .
So make sure you 're in the position you want to be in when you 're incinerated . "
On this scorching summer weekend , 75 amateur rocketeers and a few indulgent friends and family members have gathered in the desert to play Wernher von Braun for a day .
Known as the Association of Rocket Mavericks , they 're the top guns of model rocketry — and perhaps the shade - tree innovators - to - be of the aerospace industry .
If NASA is the establishment , and upstarts like Burt Rutan 's Scaled Composites are the contenders , then these guys are the hardcore wannabes — enthusiasts who pour their time , money , and considerable knowledge into these launches and even harbor dreams that their experiments will change the course of rocketry .
The ground crew tilts the rocket until it 's vertical .
Tom Rouse , a 53 - year - old general contractor , looks on nervously as Oldham kneels in the silt and carefully slides the igniter into the engine .
A compact man with a trim mustache , Rouse builds high - end spec houses by day and high - flying rockets at night .
He 's got $ 3,000 and innumerable hours invested in the missile on the pad , and he 's more concerned about its immediate future than his personal safety .
" There are so many things that can go wrong , " he says .
" The motors could be strong but the flight computers fail , or the computers could work fine but an O - ring fails .
All it takes is one little problem and it's over in a second . "
Photograph : J. Bennett FittsTechnically , Rouse is launching a hobby rocket , but do n't confuse it with the cardboard - and - balsa - wood kits fired off by kids since the dawn of the space age .
This 13 - foot scratch - built beauty features a carbon - fiber fuselage that houses four flight computers , four parachutes that will be deployed by compressed carbon dioxide canisters , and four solid - fuel motors that pack more thrust than a cruise missile .
The rocket fires in two stages to maximize speed and altitude :
Once the first three motors have burned out , they fall away and the fourth ignites .
According to the simulation software Rouse used to plan the flight , the rocket should shoot straight up at least 12 miles before drifting , intact , back to the ground .
Hobby rocketry is divided into two major camps : one devoted to smaller model rockets and the other , epitomized by Rouse , dedicated to high - power numbers .
A subset of this more ambitious world focuses on experimental motors , so called because they 're built not by commercial vendors but by individuals who can make them as big and as aggressive as the laws of chemistry and physics permit .
Three years ago , Rouse formed the Association of Rocket Mavericks to push the envelope .
" For some guys , it 's simply a matter of packing as much propellant as will fit in a container , lighting the fuse , and running away as fast as you can , " says Tom Atchison , who sits on the Rocket Mavericks board .
" There 's nothing wrong with that .
But we want to raise the technology to a level where we can address some of the challenges faced by the aerospace industry .
We 're the early adopters .
We 're in a position to take risks that companies can't when they 're fulfilling government contracts .
We can work on alternative propulsion systems and innovative recovery techniques .
We 're saying , ' Let the unwashed masses play with these things and conduct experiments and see what they come up with . ' "

The closest thing the Rocket Mavericks have to a celebrity is Gene Nowaczyk , who last year launched a gigantic rocket to nearly 100,000 feet .
( For hobbyists , anything over 10,000 feet grabs people 's attention , and flying into the troposphere , which starts at around 25,000 feet , requires some serious engineering .
Thus far , only one amateur has made it beyond the threshold of space , defined as 62 miles , or roughly 330,000 feet . )
Nowaczyk is n't here yet , but for the past few days his progress has been the subject of word - of - mouth updates ( " Gene 's on his way . "
" He 's in Winnemucca . "
" He 'll be here tonight . " ) .
Until Nowaczyk 's follow - up project is ready to fly , though , Rouse is top dog .
At mission control — a folding table 1,500 feet from the launchpad — all eyes are on his rocket as he presses the red button .
The thermite igniter generates 4,000 degrees of instantaneous heat , and Rouse 's craft shoots skyward with none of the slow - motion gravitas of a space shuttle takeoff .
There 's enough smoke and fire to satisfy the most jaded pyromaniac .
Then an audible pop !— a sonic boom — as the projectile breaches the sound barrier .
After a six - second burn , the white plume shuts off , like a skywriting airplane between letters .
The booster separates from the second stage , and after three seconds of coasting , the fourth motor lights .
Shortly after the flame winks out , the rocket disappears in the blue haze .

The crowd breaks into a ragged cheer .
But Rouse is apprehensive .
" I do n't see a chute , " he says .
" Does anybody see a chute ? "
High - power rocket wisdom , engineering department , has it that going up is the easy part .
The real challenge is recovery .
Unlike NASA 's onetime - use vehicles , model rockets are designed to be launched repeatedly .
This requires an intricate in - flight ballet in which the rocket splits into several pieces after reaching maximum altitude and then deploys a series of parachutes to progressively slow the descent of each section .
Due to a packing snafu , Rouse 's rocket descends too slowly and is buffeted off course by gusty winds .
But thanks to the GPS signal beamed from the nose cone , he recovers it unbroken about 10 miles from the launchpad .
He drives back to mission control in his pickup with a broad smile on his face .
When he downloads the data logged by the flight computers , he determines that his bird flew to an altitude of 13 miles and reached a speed of Mach 3.47 .
" How many people have launched a rocket that went to 70,573 feet ? " he asks an hour later , still stoked .
" I can probably count them on my fingers . "
Photograph : J. Bennett FittsBlack Rock Desert is 400 square miles of forbidding wasteland ringed by modest mountains that are largely obscured this morning by the smoky haze from distant wildfires .
The khaki -colored playa , parched and cracked by the relentless summer sun , is brittle on top and soft underneath , like a birthday cake gone stale , and each step elicits an audible crunch .
In the bleak , seemingly lifeless terrain , the dozen or so RVs and tents look like a moon base .
At the center of the camp is the Rocket Mavericks trailer .
A supersize satellite dish positioned to pick up a GPS signal looms overhead .
Inside the trailer are a 24 - megabit satcom unit able to pump out live webcasts , a pair of Wi-Fi systems that can light 4 square miles of playa , and a Silicon Graphics workstation .
Two men sweat in the cramped , un - air - conditioned space as they wrench on a black rocket 7 1 / 2 feet long that looks like a scaled - down cross between a ' 60s - vintage X - 15 rocket plane and a surface - to - air missile .
The elder one is Tom Atchison , gray - haired , energetic , and upbeat .
Atchison , 47 , discovered rocketry as a child while tinkering with gunpowder his father had given him to make fireworks .
After engineering stints at NASA and HP Labs , he earned his fortune running tech companies in Silicon Valley .
When his friend Dirk Gates , founder of computer component maker Xircom , mentioned that he was flying high - power model rockets , Atchison felt his old passion reignite .
" I said , ' Wow !
That 's so cool ! ' " he recalls .
" ' Is it legal ? ' "
Space - going vehicles rely primarily on liquid fuel .
But liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen are do n't - try - this - at - home propositions — too expensive , too complicated , and too dangerous for most amateurs .
Gunpowder propelled early generations of hobby rockets in the '60s , and it 's still used for puny models .
But by the ' 80s , amateur rocketeers were dabbling with bigger , much more powerful motors packed with solid fuels similar to the propellants found in Cold War ICBMs and the space shuttle 's strap - on boosters .

Rocket engines are rated on a letter scale from A to Z , and each letter is twice as powerful as the preceding one .
Thus , a C motor is twice as powerful as a B and four times as potent as an A .
Generally , model rocketry runs from A to G. Everything else is considered high - power rocketry .
The largest off - the - shelf engine is rated O . Here at Black Rock , a couple of rockets are flying on experimental P motors , and the star attraction is Nowaczyk 's king - size Q .
When Atchison rediscovered rocketry in 2001 , the scene felt like the early days of computing , when the big companies — and big money — were in mainframes but the innovations came from geeks working out of their garages .
He gravitated toward the Rocket Mavericks , who were more serious - minded than some of the other tinkerers , and quickly imbued the organization with a vision that transcended hobbyism .
" The challenge is cheap , repeatable access to space , " he says .
" I could definitely see us doing orbital flights by 2015 .
We 're focusing on the suborbital piece first because we have to develop the skills of the early adopters . "
Photograph : J. Bennett FittsAtchison 's pitch resonates especially well with techies .
It 's no coincidence that the Rocket Mavericks ' roster is heavy on Silicon Valley stalwarts .
Exhibit A is the owner of the black rocket that Atchison is helping to prep .
Looking boyish in his floppy hat and baggy shorts , Steven Jurvetson is a 41 - year - old managing director of Draper Fisher Jurvetson .
As one of the most tech - savvy venture capitalists in the world , he 's a celebrity around Sand Hill Road .
He and his young son had been launching model rockets when Atchison introduced him to high - power models , and Jurvetson 's first taste of the hard stuff — a launch on the playa in 2006 — hooked him .
" Blowing things up is inherently fun , and there 's something about a rocket roaring into the air that excites you on a visceral level , " Jurvetson says .
" But along with the pyrotechnic appeal , rocketry makes the science tangible and allows you to engage it on a personal level . "
Jurvetson is putting his money where his mouth is .
His $ 10,000 Draper Fisher Jurvetson J - Prize will be awarded by Rocket Mavericks to the first rocketeer who makes two or more successful flights to 30,000 feet while carrying a 4.4 - pound payload — a useful capability for academic research .
Also , he has built his own rocket to go after what 's known as Level 3 certification , the highest " degree " in hobby rocketry , which will allow him to play with engines rated class M and greater .
Jurvetson has come to Black Rock in a rented RV carrying all his rocket gear , his son , and his high school buddy Erik Charlton , a marketing executive at Logitech who 's here to make an L3 cert flight of his own .
Photograph : J. Bennett FittsJurvetson is ready to assemble his motor .
The solid - fuel propellant is molded into grains , also called slugs or chunks , that look like spools of thread and feel like pencil erasers .
He loads them into a cylindrical case , much as he might slide batteries into a tubular flashlight .
Then he screws everything together and walks his rocket out to the launchpad .
There he discovers a problem :
He can't switch on one of the two onboard flight computers — essentially a microcontroller that serves as an altimeter and orchestrates engine stages and parachute deployment .
After a quick - and - dirty fix with superglue and a soldering iron , the rocket is ready for liftoff .
Jurvetson lets his son press the red button .
The launch is perfect .
Five seconds into the flight , as the rocket carves into the clouds , his son asks plaintively , " Can I let go now ? "
The rocket tops out around 6,000 feet .
But this flight is n't about altitude ; it 's about a safe launch and intact recovery .
Jurvetson meets both goals , satisfying the certification requirements .
Following his flight , he 's as amped as Rouse was after flying 10 times higher .
Armed with his L3 , he 's ready for , well , just about anything .
" In many industries , " he says , " great ideas get lost in large bureaucracies , and it 's people at the low end of the market who push the envelope .
Who 's going to explore crazy ideas like airbag landings on the moon ?
Rovers , pod racers , glider reentry ? "
The answer , unspoken , is clear .
Photograph : J. Bennett FittsGene Nowaczyk , with his salt - and - pepper Van Dyke , muscle T , and cargo shorts , looks more like a tourist on a Las Vegas bender than a rocket scientist on a launch site .
He smokes a Marlboro Light as he works on his rocket ; a gallon bottle of Jose Cuervo is close at hand .
For the record , though , he 's not actually drinking the tequila , just swirling it around in his mouth and spitting it out .
" I 've got a toothache , " he says .
Nowaczyk , 40 , is a mechanical engineer who came to rocketry by chance .
" My daughter wanted to do this , " he says .
" Then she turned into a girl , and Daddy turned into a boy . "
He formed a company — Payload Specialties — to develop so - called sounding rockets , which are designed to take instruments aloft on research - gathering suborbital flights , and next year he plans to fly his rocket into space .
Eventually , he hopes to turn Payload Specialties into a moneymaking proposition .
But today 's task is to replicate the 100,000 - foot flight he made here last year .
Nowaczyk , his partner , Tim Covey , and their friend Gary Stroick arrived last night after towing their trailer 30 hours from Missouri .
They worked on the rocket until 2 am , and they were back at it by dawn .
Watching them check the wiring , pack the parachutes , and screw the pieces together spotlights a fundamental but often overlooked truth : Rocketry is hard .
Inspired entrepreneurs with deep pockets , like Elon Musk and John Carmack , have suffered countless failures despite spending millions of dollars on their rocket programs .
Even NASA gets things catastrophically wrong every now and then .
Nowaczyk 's rocket is a monster by hobby standards — 17 feet long and 375 pounds .
It looks like a big white cigarette with a silver needle nose on one end , three badass fins on the other , and a black section near the top that houses the flight computers .
The homebrew Q - class motor is rated at 9,000 pounds of thrust .
( The Redstone that propelled Alan Shepard into space in 1961 pumped out 78,000 pounds . )
Nowaczyk has made room for a payload compartment to hold various pieces of memorabilia , including a baseball signed by members of the Chicago Cubs , and an experiment he 's ferrying on behalf of a Missouri high school that will correlate altitude with temperature .
Photograph : J. Bennett Fitts
The rocket is so big that Nowaczyk transported it to Black Rock in dozens of pieces , planning to assemble it on the launchpad .
Now he trucks it to a 22 - foot - high hydraulic launch rail he fabricated himself .
For six hours under the broiling sun , Nowaczyk , Covey , and Stroick piece everything together .
Twenty minutes before liftoff , they power up the onboard video cameras .
Nowaczyk turns his attention to the flight computer .
Suddenly he murmurs , " We 've got issues .
It is n't arming . "
Unflustered , Nowaczyk methodically prods the computer .
Covey is concerned that the power will run out before reentry .
" You 've got 15 minutes , " he tells Nowaczyk .
" Twelve and a half ... Gene , you 've got 10 minutes . "
After consulting the computer manual , Nowaczyk is finally able to boot the machine , and he calmly buttons up the rocket with four minutes left on the clock .
The team hustles into a pickup truck and reaches launch control at T - minus two minutes .
Wedge Oldham counts it down : 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 ... Nowaczyk punches the launch button and the rocket streaks skyward on a white plume that sends dust clouds roiling away from the pad .
A second later , a white light flares and the fuselage explodes in a fireball that showers debris over the playa .
There 's a moment of silent shock and awe .
Then come the groans .
High - power rocketry wisdom , black - humor department , holds that the only thing cooler than a successful launch is an unsuccessful launch .
But nobody 's laughing now .
Nowaczyk has sunk too much sweat equity and too many dreams into this project .
Still , he manages a grin .
" Negative launch angle detected , " he jokes .
Then he drives off to collect the wreckage .

Rocket Scientists Say We'll Never Reach the Stars
Private Rockets Could Boost Military , Too
I addressed the issue of wordpress upgrades once before .
That was a hacky home grown solution .
For a while now I 've been using git instead , which is the organized way of doing it .
This method is not specific to wordpress , it works with any piece of code where you want to keep current with updates , and yet you have some local modifications of your own .
To recap the problem shortly .. you installed wordpress on your server .
Then you made some changes to the code , maybe you changed the fonts in the theme , for instance .
( In practice , you will have a lot more modifications if you 've installed any plugins or uploaded files . )
And now the wordpress people are saying there is an upgrade available , so you want to upgrade , but you want to keep your changes .
If you are handling this manually , you now have to track down all the changes you made , do the upgrade , and then go over the list and see if they all still apply , and if so re-apply them .
git just says : you 're using a computer , you git , I 'll do it for you .
In fact , with git you can keep track of what changes you have made and have access to them at any time .
And that 's exactly what you want .
1. Starting up ( the first time )
The first thing you should find out is which version of wordpress you 're running .
In this demo I 'm running 2.6 .
So what I 'm going to do is create a git repository and start with the wordpress - 2.6 codebase .
# download and extract the currently installed version wget http://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.6.tar.gz tar xzvf wordpress-2.6.tar.gz cd wordpress # initiate git repository git - init # add all the wordpress files git-add .
# check status of repository git-status # commit these files git- commit -m ' check in initial 2.6.0 upstream ' # see a graphical picture of your repository gitk -- all
This is the typical way of initializing a repository , you run an init command to get an empty repo ( you 'll notice a .git/ directory was created ) .
Then you add some files and check the status .
git will tell you that you 've added lots of files , which is correct .
So you make a commit .
Now you have one commit in the repo .
You 'll want to use the gui program gitk to visualize the repo , I think you 'll find it 's extremely useful .
This is what your repo looks like now :
gitk is saying that you have one commit , it 's showing the commit message , and it 's telling you that you 're on the master branch .
This may seem odd seeing as how we did n't create any branches , but master is the standard branch that every repository gets on init .
The plan is to keep the upstream wordpress code separate from your local changes , so you 'll only be using master to add new wordpress releases .
For your own stuff , let 's create a new branch called mine ( the names of branches do n't mean anything to git , you can call them anything you want ) .
# create a branch where I 'll keep my own changes git - branch mine # switch to mine branch git - checkout mine # see how the repository has changed gitk -- all
When we now look at gitk the repository has n't changed dramatically ( after all we have n't made any new commits ) .
But we now see that the single commit belongs to both branches master and mine .
What 's more , mine is displayed in boldface , which means this is the branch we are on right now .
What this means is that we have two brances , but they currently have the exact same history .
2. Making changes ( on every edit )
So now we have the repository all set up and we 're ready to make some edits to the code .
Make sure you do this on the mine branch .
If you 're already running wordpress - 2.6 with local modifications , now is the time to import your modified codebase .
Just copy your wordpress / directory to the same location .
This will obviously overwrite all the original files with yours , and it will add all the files that you have added ( plugins , uploads etc ) .
Do n't worry though , this is perfectly safe .
git will figure out what 's what .
Importing your codebase into git only needs to be done the first time , after that you 'll just be making edits to the code .
# switch to mine branch git - checkout mine # copy my own tree into the git repository mine branch # cp - ar mine / wordpress .. # make changes to the code #vim wp - content / themes / default / style.css # check status of repository git-status
When you check the status you 'll see that git has figured out which files have changed between the original wordpress version and your local one .
git also shows the files that are in your version , but not in the original wordpress distribution as " untracked files " , ie .
files that are lying around that you have n't yet asked git to keep track of .
So let 's add these files and from now on every time something happens to them , git will tell you .
And then commit these changes .
You actually want to write a commit message that describes exactly the changes you made .
That way , later on you can look at the repo history and see these messages and they will tell you something useful .
# add all new files and changed files git-add .
# check in my changes on mine branch git - commit -m ' check in my mods ' # see how the repository has changed gitk -- all
When you look at the repo history with gitk , you 'll see a change .
There is a new commit on the mine branch .
Furthermore , mine and master no longer coincide .
mine originates from ( is based on ) master , because the two dots are connected with a line .
What 's interesting here is that this commit history is exactly what we wanted .
If we go back to master , we have the upstream version of wordpress untouched .
Then we move to mine , and we get our local changes applied to upstream .
Every time we make a change and commit , we 'll add another commit to mine , stacking all of these changes on top of master .
You can also use git - log master .. mine to see the commit history , and git - diff master .. mine to see the actual file edits between those two branches .
3. Upgrading wordpress ( on every upgrade )
Now suppose you want to upgrade to wordpress - 2.6.2 .
You have two branches , mine for local changes , and master for upstream releases .
So let 's change to master and extract the files from upstream .
Again you 're overwriting the tree , but by now you know that git will sort it out .
# switch to the master branch git-checkout master # download and extract new wordpress version cd .. wget http://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.6.2.tar.gz tar xzvf wordpress-2.6.2.tar.gz cd wordpress # check status git-status
Checking the status at this point is fairly important , because git has now figured out exactly what has changed in wordpress between 2.6 and 2.6.2 , and here you get to see it .
You should probably look through this list quite carefully and think about how it affects your local modifications .
If a file is marked as changed and you want to see the actual changes you can use git - diff < filename > .
Now you add the changes and make a new commit on the master branch .
# add all new files and changed files git-add .
# commit new version git- commit -m ' check in 2.6.2 upstream ' # see how the repository has changed gitk -- all
When you now look at the repo history there 's been an interesting development .
As expected , the master branch has moved on one commit , but since this is a different commit than the one mine has , the branches have diverged .
They have a common history , to be sure , but they are no longer on the same path .
Here you 've hit the classical problem of a user who wants to modify code for his own needs .
The code is moving in two different directions , one is upstream , the other is your own .
Now cheer up , git knows how to deal with this situation .
It 's called " rebasing " .
First we switch back to the mine branch .
And now we use git-rebase , which takes all the commits in mine and stacks them on top of master again ( ie. we base our commits on master ) .
# check out mine branch git - checkout mine # stack my changes on top of master branch git -rebase master # see how the repository has changed gitk -- all
Keep in mind that rebasing can fail .
Suppose you made a change on line 4 , and the wordpress upgrade also made a change on line 4 .
How is git supposed to know which of these to use ?
In such a case you 'll get a " conflict " .
This means you have to edit the file yourself ( git will show you where in the file the conflict is ) and decide which change to apply .
Once you 've done that , git - add the file and then git - rebase -- continue to keep going with the rebase .
Although conflicts happen , they are rare .
All of your changes that do n't affect the changes in the upgrade will be applied automatically to wordpress - 2.6.2 , as if you were doing it yourself .
You 'll only hit a conflict in a case where if you were doing this manually it would not be obvious how to apply your modification .
Once you 're done rebasing , your history will look like this .
As you can see , all is well again , we 've returned to the state that we had at the end of section 2 .
Once again , your changes are based on upstream .
This is what a successful upgrade looks like , and you did n't have to do it manually .
Tips
Do n't be afraid to screw up
You will , lots of times .
The way that git works , every working directory is a full copy of the repository .
So if you 're worried that you might screw up something , just make a copy of it before you start ( you can do this at any stage in the process ) , and then you can revert to that if something goes wrong .
git itself has a lot of ways to undo mistakes , and once you learn more about it you 'll start using those methods instead .
Upgrade offline
If you are using git to upgrade wordpress on your web server , make a copy of the repo before you start , then do the upgrade on that copy .
When you 're done , replace the live directory with the upgraded one .
You do n't want your users to access the directory while you 're doing the upgrade , both because it will look broken to them , and because errors can occur if you try to write to the database in this inconsistent state .
Keep your commits small and topical
You will probably be spending most of your time in stage 2 - making edits .
It 's good practice to make a new commit for every topical change you make .
So if your goal is to " make all links blue " then you should make all the changes related to that goal , and then commit .
By working this way , you can review your repo history and be able to see what you tried to accomplish and what you changed on each little goal .
Revision control is about working habits
You 've only seen a small , albeit useful , slice of git in this tutorial .
git is a big and complicated program , but as with many other things , it already pays off if you know a little about it , it allows you to be more efficient .
So do n't worry about not knowing the rest , it will come one step at a time .
And above all , git is all about the way you work , which means you wo n't completely change your working habits overnight , it will have to be gradual .
This tutorial alone should show you that it 's entirely possible to keep local changes and still upgrade frequently without a lot of effort or risk .
I used to dread upgrades , thinking it would be a lot of work and my code would break .
I do n't anymore .
For those so inclined to cry over the details of the proposed bailout , the financials are below the fold .
There appears to be some movement , though , which is positive .
Reuters reports :
The Bush administration has accepted changes to its $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout plan that would give the government a stake in institutions unloading assets under the plan , the chairman of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee said on Monday .
( snip )
On reducing foreclosures , Frank said , “ The foreclosure piece is agreed on .
There was Republican congressional opposition but the administration accepted it .
“ They ’ve accepted our views on oversight … There is some contention now over compensation and corporate governance . ”
The compensation they are arguing about is , get this , Golden Parachutes ; the Democrats are opposed to them and the Republicans do not want to allow those CEO ’s to walk away without our tax dollars .
Good to see the Republican ’s are staying true to their nature : screwing over middle America .
I bet you ’ll be heartened to know that the Pentagon and the Department of Defense will not be affected by shortage of credit funds resulting from this meltdown .
For the wonkish amongst us , the bailout financials , from CNBC , follow :
— Up to $ 700 billion to buy assets from struggling institutions .
The plan is aimed at sopping up residential and commercial mortgages from financial institutions but gives Treasury broad latitude .
— Up to $ 50 billion from the Great Depression - era Exchange Stabilization Fund to guarantee principal in money market mutual funds to provide the same confidence that consumers have in federally insured bank deposits .
— The Fed committed to make unspecified discount window loans to financial institutions to finance the purchase of assets from money market funds to aid redemptions .
— At least $ 10 billion in Treasury direct purchases of mortgage - backed securities in September .
In doubling the program on Friday , the Treasury said it may purchase even more in the months ahead .
— Up to $ 144 billion in additional MBS purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The Treasury announced they would increase purchases up to the newly expanded investment portfolio limits of $ 850 billion each .
On July 30 , the Fannie portfolio stood at $ 758.1 billion with Freddie ’s at $ 798.2 billion .
— $ 85 billion loan for AIG , which would give the Federal government a 79.9 percent stake and avoid a bankruptcy filing for the embattled insurer .
AIG management will be dismissed .
— At least $ 87 billion in repayments to JPMorgan Chase [ JPM 47.05 — UNCH ( 0 ) ] for providing financing to underpin trades with units of bankrupt investment bank Lehman Brothers [ LEH 0.2151 — UNCH ( 0 ) ] .
Paulson said over the weekend he was adamant that public funds not be used to rescue the firm .
— $ 200 billion for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The Treasury will inject up to $ 100 billion into each institution by purchasing preferred stock to shore up their capital as needed .
The deal puts the two housing finance firms under government control .
— $ 300 billion for the Federal Housing Administration to refinance failing mortgage into new , reduced - principal loans with a federal guarantee , passed as part of a broad housing rescue bill .
— $ 4 billion in grants to local communities to help them buy and repair homes abandoned due to mortgage foreclosures .
— $ 29 billion in financing for JPMorgan Chase ’s government - brokered buyout of Bear Stearns in March .
The Fed agreed to take $ 30 billion in questionable Bear assets as collateral , making JPMorgan liable for the first $ 1 billion in losses , while agreeing to shoulder any further losses .
— At least $ 200 billion of currently outstanding loans to banks issued through the Fed ’s Term Auction Facility , which was recently expanded to allow for longer loans of 84 days alongside the previous 28 - day credits .

Deep beneath the Earth ’s surface from New York to West Virginia sits the Marcellus Shale , an enormous geological deposit of natural gas .
Natural gas is one of the cleanest fuels available  if you can extract it without ruining the water around it .
Retrieving Marcellus natural gas requires hydraulic fracturing with horizontal drilling , a process that shoots millions of gallons of water deep underground to break the rock and unlock the gas .
Now that prospectors are using this process increasingly in Pennsylvania and hoping to begin soon in New York , there are two important questions :
Where will all that water come from ?
And what happens to it when it is no longer needed ?
New York officials are exploring whether it ’s possible to drill safely without poisoning water supplies .
High on our list of concerns is whether the used water  some of it tainted with toxic chemicals  will later seep into streams , rivers and deep water wells , placing New York City ’s municipal water supply at risk .
Before the state allows exploration , there should be a clear agreement on how the used water will be dealt with safely .
Energy companies have already signed so many new leases for drilling rights with landowners in New York and Pennsylvania that one farmer called it a “ modern - day gold rush . ”
Nobody wants to deprive these landowners of the money they can make , but the price of their good fortune cannot be the contamination of water supplies for everyone else .

A Calgary author and journalist says most Canadians do n’t understand that we ’re living in a “ petrostate ” that could undermine our democracy .
Andrew Nikiforuk , author of Tar Sands : Dirty Oil and the Future of a Continent ( Greystone Books , $ 20 ) , told the Georgia Straight in a phone interview that Canada needs a national debate on the topic .
“ I think the tar sands has created a political emergency for the country , ” he said .
In his book , Nikiforuk describes the Alberta tar - sands developments as the world ’s largest construction project , the world ’s largest capital project , and the world ’s largest energy project — one that uses as much water in a year as a city with a population of two million .
“ We need reporters from our national daily newspapers living in Fort McMurray and writing about this nation - changing event , ” Nikiforuk said .
“ This is an event much greater than the building of the national railway .
This is an event much greater than the Apollo moon project . ”
Canada , which has approximately 175 billion barrels of recoverable oil , is the largest supplier of oil to the United States , having surpassed Saudi Arabia .
“ We have become a petrostate without any of the safeguards that a petrostate should have , ” Nikiforuk said .
He noted that there is a vast amount of political - science research demonstrating that oil wealth hinders democracy .
He said this is true regardless of whether the petrostate is in the Middle East , and whether it ’s a large or small country .
Nikiforuk pointed out that Canada has ignored recommendations from the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development calling on countries that generate a great deal of oil wealth to put those revenues into a separate fund that cannot be touched by politicians .
“ Canadians need to start thinking of themselves as a petrostate , and they need to start thinking of the kinds of controls needed to protect the country from the excesses of oil , ” he said .
“ We also need to think about the pace , and where we want to go with it .
It is out of control . ”
He said that oil wealth undermines democracy in several ways .
Governments enriched by petroleum revenues reduce taxes , which makes the public feel good about politicians who make these decisions .
Oil money is also used to buy votes , he alleged .
“ Then , those parties tend to stay in power for long periods of time , ” Nikiforuk said , noting that Conservatives have governed Alberta for 37 years .
“ Parties that stay in power for long , long periods of time tend to become more authoritarian in nature . ”
Alberta has the lowest provincial voter turnout in the country .
Nikiforuk said governments that remain in power for decades tend to make more appointments based on patronage rather than merit .
“ So you end up with all kinds of people being appointed to positions they should not be in , ” he claimed .
He estimated that $ 200 billion has been spent developing the Alberta tar sands if the cost of pipelines , refinery expansions , and upgraders is included .
“ It has brought 700,000 people into Alberta since 1996 , ” Nikiforuk said .
“ It is almost like the invasion of Iraq , but in this case , it ’s a petroboom . ”
According to the Alberta - based Pembina Institute , two tonnes of the bituminous sands , otherwise known as tar sands , and two tonnes of overburden must be excavated to create a single barrel of oil .
Nikiforuk writes that producing each barrel generates three times as much greenhouse gas as a barrel of conventional oil because of the work involved .
He noted that the tar - sands developments are playing a role in preventing Canada from meeting its climate - change goals .
But the impact goes beyond that , affecting cross-Canada labour mobility and causing politicians to amend immigration legislation to allow more temporary foreign workers .
“ The tar sands has changed Canada in the same way the fur trade has changed Canada , ” Nikiforuk said .
He said that Canadian provincial and federal governments have generated $ 60 billion from tar - sands development , but claimed that Canadians have little to show for it .
In his book , he notes that Ottawa will have collected at least $ 50 billion from tar - sands developments by 2020 .
“ True to the First Law of Petropolitics , ” Nikiforuk writes , “ government has used this windfall so far to reduce corporate taxes and slash 2 per cent off the federal sales tax .
While Norway has kept the resource curse largely at bay with clear accounting and its dedicated oil / pension fund , Ottawa has spent the cash to win friends and influence elections . ”
Nikiforuk said that Canada has no strategy for ensuring self - sufficiency in energy over the long term , even though it appears that conventional oil production has peaked around the world .
He also said that no Alberta politician ever expected that environmentally concerned Americans would start asking questions about degradation wrought by tar - sands developments .
“ What we ’re seeing is a complete vacuum here in terms of political direction , political policy , political strategy , ” he claimed .
“ It ’s dangerous for Alberta .
It ’s dangerous for Canada .
It ’s dangerous for North America . ”
Andrew Nikiforuk will speak on Sunday ( October 26 ) at 7 p.m. at the Capilano Performing Arts Theatre ( 2055 Purcell Way , North Vancouver ) .
Tickets are $ 10 /$ 12 .
Fallows gets uncharacteristically ruffled by McCain's Ayers attacks :
If John McCain has a better set of plans to deal with the immediate crisis , and the medium - term real - economy fallout , and the real global problems of the era -- fine , let him win on those .
But it is beneath the dignity he had as a Naval officer to wallow in this mindless BS .
I will say nothing about the dignity of a candidate who repeatedly winks at the public , Hooters - waitress style .
A great country acts great when it matters .
This is a time when it matters -- for politicians in the points they raise , for journalists in the subjects they write about and the questions they ask of candidates .
And , yes , for voters .
I 'm afraid that Jim is dealing with what we 're all dealing with : the fact that the myth we had of McCain is , in fact , a lie .
The real McCain - dishonest , dishonorable and despicable - is now in plain sight .
To say I 'm disillusioned would be an understatement .
The last six weeks have shown us all something we 'd rather never have found out .
But we can't ignore it now , can we ?
We want to hear what you think about this article .

The backend servers that power the world of Internet Services have become increasingly diverse .
With today 's announcement that Microsoft Windows Server is available on Amazon EC2 we can now run the majority of popular software systems in the cloud .
Windows
Server ranked very high on the list of requests by customers so we are happy that we will be able to provide this .
One particular area that customers have been asking for Amazon EC2 with Windows Server was for Windows Media transcoding and streaming .
There is a range of excellent codecs available for Windows Media and there is a large amount of legacy content in those formats .
In past weeks I met with a number of folks from the entertainment industry and often their first question was : when can we run on windows ?
There are many different reasons why customers have requested Windows Server ; for example many customers want to run ASP .
NET websites using Internet Information Server and use Microsoft SQL Server as their database .
Amazon EC2 running Windows Server enables this scenario for building scalable websites .
In addition , several customers would like to maintain a global single Windows - based desktop environment using Microsoft Remote Desktop , and Amazon EC2 is a scalable and dependable platform on which to do so .
Amazon EC2 with Windows Server is still currently in private beta testing , but will be available for general use before the end of the year .
Keep an eye on the AWS Weblog for information about Amazon Web Services at the Microsoft Professional Developer Conference .
Scientists have discovered a new species of bacteria in the mouth .
The finding could help scientists to understand tooth decay and gum disease and may lead to better treatments , according to research published in the August issue of the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology .
" The healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses , fungi , protozoa and bacteria , " said Professor William Wade from King 's College London Dental Institute .
" The bacteria are the most numerous : there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth .
Around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species . "
Scientists studied healthy tissue as well as tumours in the mouth and found three strains of bacteria called Prevotella that could not be identified .
Prevotella species are part of the normal microbial flora in humans and are also associated with various oral diseases and infections in other parts of the body .
The researchers named the new species Prevotella histicola ; histicola means ' inhabitant of tissue ' .
" Interestingly , this species was isolated from within the oral tissues , both in oral cancers and normal , healthy tissue , " said Professor Wade .
" This confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells . "
Tooth decay and gum disease are the most common bacterial diseases of man and are caused by changes in the microbes normally present in the mouth .
To understand these diseases better , scientists first need to know which bacteria are present in human mouths .
Understanding the composition of the oral microbiota will also help scientists devise new prevention measures and treatments for oral diseases .
" A detailed description and name for each species of bacteria are needed so that different laboratories can recognise all of the bacterial species present in the mouth , " said Professor Wade .

A week earlier the Federal Reserve had to extend a huge credit line to AIG to keep the troubled firm from collapsing
The world 's largest insurance company , AIG , spent $ 440,000 ( £ 250,000 ) on a lavish corporate retreat at one of California 's top beachside resorts just a week after accepting an $ 85 bn emergency loan from the US government to stave off bankruptcy .
Details of the getaway emerged at a congressional hearing today where lawmakers expressed outrage at AIG executives " wining and dining " at the height of a financial crisis .
An invoice from the St Regis resort in Monarch Beach , south of Los Angeles , shows that AIG spent $ 139,375 on rooms , $ 147,301 on " banquets " , $ 23,380 on spa treatments and $ 6,939 on golf at an eight - day company event which began on September 22 .
A week earlier , on September 17 , the Federal Reserve had to extend a huge credit line to AIG to keep the troubled firm from collapsing due to vast liabilities on risky financial insurance policies .
" Average Americans are suffering economically , " said Henry Waxman , chairman of the House oversight committee .
" They are losing their jobs , their homes and their health insurance .
Yet less than one week after the taxpayers rescued AIG , company executives could be found wining and dining at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation . "
Set in 172 acres of grounds on a bluff overlooking the Pacific ocean , the St Regis resort describes itself as " Tuscan inspired " .
Rates for its 325 rooms are typically upwards of $ 500 a night and the travel guide Fodor 's gives the place a rave review , saying : " Exclusivity and indulgence carry the day here ; you can even have someone unpack for you . "
An AIG spokesman said the event was to entertain independent insurance salesmen of AIG American General - one of the company 's main US operations which offers life , health and accident policies .
" It was a recognition event for independent agents of AIG American General who distribute insurance policies , " said the spokesman .
" It was planned months ago . "
In written evidence to Congress , AIG 's former chief executive , Robert Willumstad , blamed an " unexpected and unprecedented market - wide crisis of confidence " for the company 's financial predicament .
AIG wrote off more than $ 50bn in unrealised losses on complex mortgage - related instruments such as credit default swaps .
But Willumstad , who stood down as a condition of the federal bail - out , blamed mark - to - market accounting rules for accentuating the impact of the company 's exposure , prompting downgrades by credit rating agencies .
" Looking back at my time as CEO , I do n't believe AIG could have done anything differently , " said Willumstad .
" The market seizure was an unprecedented global catastrophe . "

No business can work without validation .
Software ’s are made to make business automated so validation forms the core aspect for any software .
Almost 80 % projects in .NET implement validation as shown in figure below .
Figure : - Validation implemented
The above figure shows how business validations are implemented for a simple customer class .
We have two properties customer code and customer name .
Both of these properties are compulsory .
So we have created a class called as ‘ ClsCustomer ’ , with two set / get properties for customer code and customer name .
If we find that customer code is empty in the set of the property we raise an error .
The same methodology we have used for customer name .
Now we can consume the class in the ASPX UI as shown in figure ‘ Business object consumed ’ .
We have created the object , set the properties and in case there is error we have caught the same and displayed it in a label using try catch exception blocks .
Figure :- Business object consumed
This implementation looks good to some extent as we have put the business validation in the class and decoupled the UI from any business validation changes .
Let ’s list down the common problems associated with the above methodology : -
Tangled validation : -
If the validation rules changes we need to compile the whole class .
As the entity and the validation layer are entangled in one class , changes in validation leads to compilation of the whole class .
So out first goal should be decouple this validation logic from the entity class .
When we say entity class we are referring to the ‘ ClsCustomer ’ class .
Figure :- Tangled validation
Figure :-
Decoupling validations from the entity class
No need of compiling : - Validations are volatile entity .
They change from time to time .
If we can change validation constraints without compiling will lead to better maintenance of the system .
One go validation and results : -
The second issue is validations are executed in every set of the property and errors are displayed one by one .
It would be great if we can validate all the validation once and display all the errors once .
All these things can be achieved by using Microsoft validation application blocks .
Step 1 :- Download the Enterprise library 4.0 from here .
Step 2 :-
Once you install it you should see the same in programs – Microsoft patterns and practices .
Before we move ahead to understand how validation application blocks works .
We will first walkthrough fundamentally how validation application blocks decouples the validation from the entity classes .
Validation application blocks stands in between the entity class the validation .
Validations are stored in configuration files like web.config or app.config depending whether it ’s a web application or a windows application .
So the validation blocks reads from the configuration file the rules and applies it over the entity class .
We can maintain these validations using the enterprise configuration screen provided by Microsoft blocks .
Figure : - Decoupling validations from entity classes
Now that we have understood how validation blocks will work .
We will run through a example practically to understand the concept .
Step 3 :- Once you have installed the block , click on Enterprise library configuration UI to define validation on the configuration file
Figure :- Loading Enterprise configuration screen
Step 4 :- Click on open and browse to your web.config file and click the open button .
Figure :-
Open the web.config file
Step 5 :- Once you have opened the web.config file you should see a tree like structure as shown in figure ‘ Add validation block ’ .
Right click on the main tree and add the validation application block to your web.config file .
Figure :-
Add validation application block
Step 6 :- Once you have added the validation application block you should see a validation application block node .
Right click on the node , select new and click the type menu .
Figure : - Add the assembly type
Step 7 :- Once you have clicked on the type menu you should see a dialog box as shown in figure ‘ Load assembly ’ .
Figure : - Load assembly
Step 8 :- Click on load assembly and browse to the assembly DLL to which you want to apply validations .
Figure : - Browse the assembly
Step 9 :-
Select the class in the assembly as shown in figure select class .
Figure :- Select class
Step 10 :- Once you have loaded the assembly , you should see a new node ‘ MyRules ’ as shown in figure ‘ Choose members ’ .
Right click on ‘ MyRules ’ ? new and choose members .
Figure : - Choose members
Step 11 :- Once you have clicked the choose members menu you will be popped up with a property selector box as shown in figure ‘ Select properties ’ .
In the customer class we have two properties on which we want to apply validations one is the customer name and the other is the customer code .
So we will select both the properties and click ok .
Figure : - Choose properties
Step 12 :- Once you have selected the properties you can see both the properties in the UI .
To apply validation right click on let ’s say customer code property .
You will now see list of validations which you can apply on the property .
This tutorial will not go in details about all the validations .
If you are interested in the same you can read about it more on http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc309336.aspx .
For the current scenario we will select range validator .
Figure : - Select range validator
Step 13 :- Once you have selected range validators , you will see the below property box for range validators .
In this particular scenario we need that both the property i.e. customer code and customer name should not be empty .
So in the lower bound we will put 1 , which signifies that at least one character is needed .
In the lower bound type we have selected as inclusive , which means the lower bound check is compulsory .
In the message template put the error message which you want to display in case there are issues .
Figure : - Range validator properties
Step 14 :-
In the default rule select the rule which you have just made .
If it ’s none validations will not fire .
Figure : - Select rule
If you are done just save everything and watch your web.config which is now modified with the validation tags .
You will see both the validation i.e. customer name and customer code in XML format inside the < validation > tag .
The best part of the config file is now you can change the validation in the config file itself .
You guessed right … no recompiling , no installation and completely decoupled .
Figure : - Web.config with validation tags
Step 15 :- Ok , now that we are done with putting the validation in the web.config file .
Its time to write the code which will read from the config file and apply to our entity class .
So the first thing we need to reference the validation application block in our assembly references and include the name spaces in our clsCustomer class .
Figure : - Reference validation application blocks
Figure : - Import the validation namespace
Step 16 :- Once you are done with adding the namespaces its time to fire the validation .
Below is the code snippet which shows how the validation application block fires the validation using the web.config file .
First step create the customer object and set the property .
In the second step we tell to the validation static class to validate the object .
The validation static class returns validation results .
This validation results are nothing but error failures in case the validation fails .
In the final step we have looped through the validation results to display the error .
Figure : - The validation code
Ok , now that we are done its time to see the action .
You can see in the UI we have just set empty properties and it showed me both the business validations errors from the collection .
Figure :- Validation in action
The other problem with validation is that it only does server side you can read my tutorial how we can generate client side validators using validation engine at ApplicationBlock.aspx
NDP Leader Jack Layton and Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe joined the audience at a Tuesday night concert in Montreal organized by artists protesting $ 45 million in cuts to culture funding announced by the Conservative government last August .
Federal NDP Leader Jack Layton speaks to reporters on Tuesday as he announces his party 's campaign pledge to bolster arts and culture funding .
( ( CBC ) )
The event was organized by artists from Quebec who want their voices to be heard in the federal election campaign .
Layton had already attacked the cuts at a campaign event in Quebec City on Tuesday afternoon , where he said a New Democratic government would immediately cancel the Conservatives ' $ 45 - million cut to arts funding , and invest $ 125 million more .
" One of the key things we must do , before we start giving $ 50 - billion tax giveaways to banks and oil companies , is to protect and promote the arts , " Layton said .
" We have to begin that project by protecting the artists themselves . "
He also pledged to give the CBC and Radio - Canada " stable , sure and appropriate funding , " while also protecting Telefilm and the Canadian Television Fund .
Layton said the NDP is committed to Canadians being able to make programming in French and English " made and produced by people here and starring people from here , " while Stephen Harper 's Conservatives have tried to " turn off the floodlights on our stories , on our hearts , on our souls . "
" Mr. Harper says protecting artists and funding arts is a waste of taxpayers ' money , " Layton said .
" We say that creative industries are an enormous part of our country 's future … I say we give them the fair shake and treat them as the entrepreneurs and small business owners that they are . "
Speaking ahead of Tuesday night 's concert , Gilles Duceppe said the funding cuts hurt more than just the artistic community , citing carpenters , cooks and people in the transport industry whose employment relies on the arts .
" I do n't want there to be any more cuts , and if there are other proposals , we should talk about them , " Duceppe told reporters in Quebec City on Tuesday .
Harper dismisses criticism over ' niche issue '
Critics and members of the arts community , especially in Quebec , decried the funding cuts announced by the Conservative government earlier this summer , accusing Harper of censoring creative production in Canada and harming the nation 's image abroad .
Before Parliament was dissolved , opposition parties demanded a parliamentary review of the Tories ' cuts and asked for a moratorium on the measures until the Commons heritage committee had a chance to hold hearings on culture and arts funding .
The Conservatives insist the money is being reallocated to other arts and cultural programs , including various official languages projects , the 400th anniversary of Quebec City and projects connected with the 2010 Vancouver - Whistler Winter Olympic Games .
Speaking on Tuesday in Saskatoon , Harper downplayed the outrage over the cuts as a " niche issue for some . "
The Conservative leader also insisted that while funding for some programs has gone down , other programs have seen a boost and overall funding for the federal Heritage Department has increased by eight per cent since his government came to power .
" Of course , this government chooses its priorities , " Harper told reporters after announcing a campaign proposal to end house arrests for serious crimes .
" You know , I think when ordinary , working people come home , turn on the TV and see … a bunch of people at a rich gala all subsidized by the taxpayers , claiming their subsidies are n't high enough when they know the subsidies have actually gone up , I 'm not sure that 's something that resonates with ordinary people . "
In an interview with CBC News , Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan said he was alarmed by Harper 's comments .
" It 's not a niche issue , It 's a huge issue , " Egoyan said , adding there are " a lot of ordinary people " working as carpenters , technicians , drivers and support crews on films , plays and television productions in Canada .
" There 's an incredible economic trickle - down effect to the arts in this country and you cannot dismiss it as being something that we watch in the glamorous events . "
On Tuesday , the NDP launched a new ad campaign aimed at the fury in the province over the arts cuts , with the ad playing on the name of Harper 's party by referring to the party as Conservat - tueur de la culture , or " culture killer . "
But Harper hit back at Layton 's party , saying the ad showed the " extreme " side of the New Democrats .
" Look , I understand that some parties think you should spend more on culture than we do , but to say we ’ve been slashing culture or cutting , it is simply not true , " he said Tuesday .
" And when the NDP runs an ad like that , that just shows the extreme side of the NDP , a side of the NDP that has no serious economic program at all for the country , just a whole bunch of promises without limit , without any idea of how they ’re going to pay for them . "
Dion promises arts investment
Harper used the opportunity to target the Liberals ' platform announced a day earlier , saying a Liberal government would have little to offer the arts community after it mismanaged Canada 's economy into a deficit and recession .
" The Liberal party goes around the country making all these great promises , " Harper said .
" But what happens in the end , when they actually try to put together a budget , first of all , a lot of their promises vanish .
They ’re gone , they ’re retracted …
So anybody who thinks the Liberals are going to increase culture or anything else , they ’re sadly mistaken . "
Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion has also vowed that his party would restore the arts funding if elected to form a government in the Oct. 14 federal election .
He also pledged the Liberals would double the funding for the Canada Council for the Arts to $ 360 million .
Speaking Tuesday in British Columbia , Dion said a Liberal government would increase the tax credit for television and film from 25 per cent to 30 per cent , a move he said would result in a $ 160 - million injection into the film and television industry .
" There is no strong economy without a strong artistic and cultural industry , " Dion said , adding that 36,000 workers depend on the movie and television industry in British Columbia for employment .
Dion told reporters at an event in Burnaby .
" With a Liberal government , Canada will have more movies , more novels , more theatres and more music . "
Dion will spend a full day campaigning in British Columbia on Tuesday , as he visits Burnaby and Vancouver .
Also on Tuesday , Green Leader Elizabeth May continues her whistle - stop rail tour of Canada as she stops in Rivers , Man. , and later for a rally in Winnipeg .
Her train is also set to stop in Sioux Lookout , Ont. , in the evening .
On the morning of the 9/11 , just moments after the World Trade Center collapsed from the terrorist strikes , Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) went on television and immediately began focusing the nation ’s attention on Iraq .
In an interview with CBS ’ Dan Rather on 9/11 , McCain said :
To be honest with you , Dan , I never thought that an operation of this sophistication and size would take place .
I just never did .
But I do n’t think there ’s any doubt that there are countries — Iraq , Iran , Libya , North Korea and others — who we know engage in proliferation of — of capabilities and , from time to time , involve themselves in state - sponsored terrorism .
But never did we imagine on a scale such as this .
The next day , on 9/12 , McCain reiterated the point in an interview with Chris Matthews .
" It is n’t just Afghanistan , " he said , " we ’re talking about Syria , Iraq , Iran , perhaps North Korea , Libya and others . "
Just a few weeks later — on Oct. 9 , 2001 — McCain narrowed his focus , arguing that Iraq was " obviously " next :
PAULA ZAHN : And as you know , Senator , the U.S. and Great Britain notified the U.N. Security Council yesterday that they reserve the right to strike against other countries in this campaign .
What countries are we looking at ?
MCCAIN : Well , I think very obviously Iraq is the first country , but there are others — Syria , Iran , the Sudan , who have continued to harbor terrorist organizations and actually assist them .
On Oct. 18 , 2001 , McCain told David Letterman , " the second phase is Iraq " while linking Iraq to the anthrax attacks .
Watch it :
In Jan . 2002 , McCain visited a crowd of soldiers aboard the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt and yelled : " Next up , Baghdad ! " �
The New York Times ’ David Kirkpatrick recently noted that McCain " began making his case for invading Iraq to the public more than six months before the White House began to do the same . "
The Times reported :
While pushing to take on Saddam Hussein , Mr. McCain also made arguments and statements that he may no longer wish to recall .
He lauded the war planners he would later criticize , including Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney .
( Mr. McCain even volunteered that he would have given the same job to Mr. Cheney . )
He urged support for the later - discredited Iraqi exile Ahmad Chalabi 's opposition group , the Iraqi National Congress , and echoed some of its suspect accusations in the national media .
And he advanced misleading assertions not only about Mr. Hussein 's supposed weapons programs but also about his possible ties to international terrorists , Al Qaeda and the Sept. 11 attacks .
SHIPPENSBURG , Pa.  Supporters of Senators Barack Obama and Joseph R. Biden Jr. often look like Benetton - colored billboards , decked out for their candidates in Obama - Biden hats , T - shirts and buttons .
Supporters of Senator John McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin like logo merchandise , too , but tend more toward pompoms ( yes , pompoms ) , homemade signs ( “ Pitbulls 4 Freedom ” ) , flag pins and chest paint .
There is more dancing at Democratic rallies , more shouting out at Republican ones .
They chant “ Yes , we can ” ( or “ Sí , se puede ” ) at Obama and Biden rallies , “ U.S.A . ” and “ Drill , baby , drill ” at McCain and Palin rallies ; the D ’s bounce to blaring folk - rock and Motown ( Bruce Springsteen , Stevie Wonder ) and the R ’s counter with country - pop ( including Dolly Parton ’s “ 9 to 5 ” ) and arena rock ( AC / DC ) .
Democratic rallygoers seem more worried about Ms. Palin than about Mr. McCain .
They speak of feeling weary of “ the politics of fear ” and claim Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin are “ irrelevant ”  unless they win , as one supporter in Charleston , W.Va. , said with a smile - cringe .
When you ask Republicans what they think of Mr. Obama , the word “ socialist ” comes up more often than not .
They mention that he is a smooth talker , and not in a good way .
A lot of them seem to have real problems with Michelle Obama , too , though they cannot pinpoint why .
And they do not much care for that Joe Biden , either , or whatever his name is  many cannot immediately summon it .
In some prior blog entries , I highlighted some features of the project system that enable you to use and organize multiple files as well as multiple projects within your solution .
In my next blog entries , I want to continue showing you some more features along these lines , but now with more of an eye towards pragmatics , including some advice on how to choose among different ways to organize your code .
Multiple files in F# , and the implicit module
Suppose I have a tiny F# source code file like this :
let AnyAsString x =
sprintf " %A " x
This is a surprisingly handy function ( we ’ll see why shortly ) – it takes any F# value and returns a reasonably - formatted human - readable string version of that value .
( You can read more about the various F# printf functions and specifiers here . )
Suppose I want to call this function from a different source file further down in my project – how do I do it ?
Just trying to call it directly does n’t work ; for example if I write
AnyAsString [ 1 ; 2 ; 3 ]
in a different file , I get
The value or constructor ‘ AnyAsString ’ is not defined .
The reason is that , if you write code at the " top level " of a file without using a " namespace " or a " module " ( and I ’ll talk more about when / how to use namespaces and modules to organize your code in a future blog entry ) , then F# implicitly puts your code in a module whose name is the source code filename .
So if my AnyAsString function were defined in " Debug.fs " , then to call it from another file I need to write
Debug .
AnyAsString [ 1 ; 2 ; 3 ]
Put another way , the original code I showed for that file is equivalent to
// Debug.fs
module Debug Debug let AnyAsString x =
sprintf " %A " x
only this version is less subtle ( by virtue of being explicit about the module ) .
Debugging F# code – breakpoints , locals , and the immediate window
Consider this silly little program which I ’ve defined in Program.fs :
// Program.fs
// demonstrate calling a function from another file
printfn " %s " ( Debug .
AnyAsString [ 1 ; 2 ; 3 ] ) printfnDebugAnyAsString type Suit =
| Club
| Diamond
| Heart
| Spade type Rank =
| Ace | Deuce | Trey | Four | Five
| Six | Seven | Eight | Nine | Ten
| Jack | Queen | King
type Card =
| Card of Suit * Rank let bullet = Card( Spade , Ace )
printfn " %A " bullet let Guess ( yourCard : Card ) =
if yourCard = bullet then
printfn " I knew it , everyone always picks the ace of spades ! "
else
printfn " Not the spade ace ?
You are very clever . " let my Card = Card( Diamond , Trey )
printfn " ( mine is % A ) " myCard
Guess ( myCard )
The program itself is not very interesting or meaningful , but that ’s good , because I want to focus on the tooling .
Suppose I put a breakpoint on the first line of the Guess function ( by clicking in the margin or pressing F9 ) :
and run the program inside the debugger .
When I hit the breakpoint , in the Locals window ( Debug > Windows > Locals ) , you ’ll see the " yourCard " parameter ( near the bottom ) :
but the value of the card ( 3 of diamonds ) is not apparent from this view .
( EDIT , Jan 2010 : note that the default debugger experience here has greatly improved , see this entry . )
Even expanding the " + " entry for this local variable will not help much .
However , thanks to our Debug .
AnyAsString function , we can easily see the value using the Immediate window ( Debug > Windows > Immediate ) .
In the Immediate window , I can type " Debug. AnyAsString ( yourCard ) " and it shows me the value ( near the bottom right ) :
There are a number of improvements to the out - of - the - box F# debugging experience that we hope to make in future releases , but in the meantime , this is one alternative technique you can use to inspect the value of local variables inside the debugger .
AnyAsString is an example of a " utility function " that you may find useful in many of your F# programs .
Next time I ’ll discuss various ways to organize and reuse small libraries of utility code across multiple projects and solutions .
I store pumpkin puree in my freezer , in approximately one - cup quantities .
Aside from the obvious use in pumpkin pie , it comes in handy for pumpkin bread , pumpkin muffins , pumpkin dip ... you get the idea .

Several years ago , when my two girls were babies , my mother - in - law and I decided we had nothing better to do with our lives than to prepare a Thanksgiving meal made entirely from scratch , i.e. no prepackaged or prepared foods .
And we almost did it — using everything from homemade chicken stock to a 20 - pound turkey from our own backyard .
His name was Harold .
It was a difficult day for our family .
Just kidding on the Harold thing ; we actually bought a fresh turkey .
But we did have a pretty pure Thanksgiving dinner , capped off by the most delicious pumpkin pie I ’d ever tasted — made especially scrumptious by pumpkin puree that she and I made ourselves .
I ’d never been a big fan of pumpkin pie until then , but there was just something about the texture and flavor that convinced me that making my own pumpkin puree was worth the extra effort — and as it turns out , it is n’t much effort at all .
I ’ve been pureeing my own pumpkin ever since .
It ’s around this time of year that I start storing up pumpkin puree in my freezer , in approximately one - cup quantities .
Aside from the obvious use in pumpkin pie , it comes in handy for pumpkin bread , pumpkin muffins , pumpkin dip , pumpkin smoothies , pumpkin cookies , pumpkin butter …
I even mix the puree with butter and maple syrup for a ridiculously sinful fall side dish .
And do n’t even get me started on how good it is for you .
I do n’t even need to tell you ; just look at the color and you ’ll be a believer .
I ’ve read opinions that declare canned pumpkin puree just as good as , if not better than , the fresh stuff .
And you know me — I ’m always willing to go along with a more convenient shortcut .
But all I can tell you is that in my experience … in my isolated , agoraphobic , reclusive experience …
I ’ve been more pleased with the outcome of pumpkin - based dishes in which I ’ve used the from - scratch puree .
So give it a try this year !
Substitute homemade for the stuff in the can .
And report your findings here .
Pumpkin recipes will follow .
For now , though , let ’s get the fundamental process down .
You can start pureeing pumpkin today !
To begin , select a couple of small - ish pumpkins .
The larger they are — for instance , jack - o - lantern pumpkins — the more you ’ll run into weird tastes and textures .
( Though the first time my mother - in - law and I pureed pumpkin , we used a big motherin ’ thing and it turned out just fine . )
I think the one on the left senses the end is near .
Could have something to do with the gigantic knife right next to him .
Ugh .
This is always the worst part .
I ’m sorry , guys … but you ’re a part of the food chain .
I ’m just following the natural order of things .
Pretend he ’s a jack - o'- lantern and lop off his head near the stem .
Cut in half like so …
Then take a moment to examine his innards .
Pretend you ’re a surgeon .
Repeat with his compadre .
Okay , wait a minute .
I know there are vegetarians .
I understand that .
And while I do n’t necessarily subscribe to the exact same set of values vegetarians do , I do understand where they ’re coming from .
Animals are sweet .
And cuddly .
And fellow citizens of this earth .
But before I continue with this personification of vegetables , is there such a thing as a belief system that espouses that vegetables are somehow alive ?
And that if we lop off their heads we ’re committing some form of murder ?
I just want to make sure before I continue on to the next step .
I ’m all about not offending here at ThePioneerWoman.com .
I do n’t want to make anyone ’s hiney cringe .
Anyway , as I was saying , back to the pumpkin ’s guts …
With a spoon or a scoop , scrape out the seeds and pulp from the center .
Sometimes you have to use a little elbow grease — the stringy stuff likes to hang on .
And do n’t get too worked up about leaving a few strings behind .
It wo n’t hurt anything .
( Translation : I give you permission not to be thorough . )
Place all the seeds into a bowl and puh - leeeeez do not discard them .
We ’ll roast them later .
Repeat until all the pumpkin pieces are largely free of seeds and pulp .
Place pumpkin pieces on a baking sheet ( face up or face down ; I ’ve done both ) and roast in a 350 - degree oven for 45 minutes , or until pumpkin is fork - tender .
This is what it looks like when it ’s done — just nice and light golden brown .
( FYI , I do n’t drizzle the pumpkin with olive oil before baking , because I want the puree to be in its purest form . )
Here ’s what happens to the skin .
And that makes it pretty easy to remove the skin from the pumpkin pieces .
Sometimes I use a knife and scrape the “ meat ” from the skin as I peel it back .
I do n’t want to sacrifice any of that delicious orange goodness .
My eyes .
They need it .
Continue peeling off the pumpkin skin …
Until you have a big pile of the stuff .
And if you think I did n’t break off a chunk of this stuff and pop it right into my mouth , you ’re sorely mistaken .
Now , if you have a food processor , throw in a few chunks at a time .
A blender will work , too , if you add a little water .
OR … you can simply mash it up with a potato masher …OR move it through a potato ricer … OR process it through a food mill .
Whatever makes your skirt fly up .
Pulse the pumpkin until it ’s totally smooth .
Now , while some pumpkin , depending on the batch you get , can be quite watery , this was almost too dry .
I added in 3 tablespoons of water during the pulsing and it was just the moisture it needed .
( Note , if the puree is overly watery , you should strain it on cheesecloth or over a fine mesh strainer to get rid of some of the liquid .
Dump the pureed goodness into a bowl …
Then fill the food processor with more pumpkin chunks .
And puree away !
And dump it on into the bowl with its fallen comrades .
NOW !
You can either use this immediately in whatever pumpkin recipe you ’d like …or you can store it in the freezer for later use .
Here ’s how I store my pumpkin :
Grab a large plastic storage bag and fold the edges outward .
( This will keep you from smudging pumpkin all over the inside of the bag , not that that matters since it ’ll eventually be all over the inside of the bag anyway , so why am I even suggesting this ?
Forgive me , please .
Forgive me . )
I spoon about 1 cupful of pumpkin into each bag ; that way , I know exactly how much I ’m getting when I pull a bag out of the freezer .
Seal the bag with just a tiny bit of an opening remaining , then use your hands to flatten out the pumpkin inside the bag and push out the air .
See ?
IT ’S A GOOD THING I HAD YOU FOLD THOSE SIDES DOWN SO YOU WOULDN ’T GET PUMPKIN ALL OVER THE INSIDE OF THE BAG , HUH ?
Sometimes I amaze even myself .
Fill as many bags as you can , stacking them as you go .
Store them in the freezer until you need them .
I know those freezer police try to tell you only to store it for six to eight months , but I SWANEE I ’ve used year - old pumpkin from the freezer before with great success .
Do n’t tell the freezer police .
I do n’t want any trouble .

Shiva ( pronunciation : [ ʃɪ.ʋə ] ; Sanskrit : शिव , Śiva , lit .
" Auspicious one " ) is the supreme God in the Shaiva tradition of Hinduism .
In the panchadeva system of the Smartha tradition , Shiva is one of the five equal bonafide scripture - sanctioned forms of God .
Followers of Hinduism who focus their worship upon Shiva are called Shaivites or Shaivas ( Sanskrit Śaiva ) . [ 3 ]
His role as the primary deity of Shaivism is reflected in his epithets Mahādeva ( " great god " ; mahā = great + deva = god ) , Maheśhvara ( " great lord " ; mahā = great + īśhvara = lord ) , and Parameśhvara ( " Supreme Lord " ) .
Shaivism , along with Vaiṣṇava traditions that focus on Vishnu , and Śākta traditions that focus on the goddess ( Devī ) are three of the most influential denominations in Hinduism .
Shiva is usually worshipped as the Shiva linga .
In images , he is generally represented as immersed in deep meditation or dancing the Tandava upon the demon of ignorance in his manifestation of Nataraja , the lord of the dance .
Shiva is one of the six primary forms of the Divine in Smartism , a denomination of Hinduism that puts particular emphasis on six deities , the other five being Vishnu , Shakti , Ganesha , Kartikkeya and Surya .
In some other Hindu denominations , Brahma , Vishnu , and Shiva represent the three primary aspects of the divine in Hinduism and are collectively known as the Trimurti .
In this school of religious thought , Brahma is the creator , Vishnu is the maintainer or preserver , and Shiva is the destroyer or transformer .

Now that I have my weblog looking reasonably consistent between Gecko and WebKit based browsers , I ’ve taken another look at Opera .
Opera does n’t have support for border - radius , but does have support for background images in SVG , which can be used to provide the same effect .
My Nav
Bar on my test site now employs this technique , and it requires two separate images : 039 on CCD and CCD on FFF .
More complex effects are also possible , with only slightly more work .
I ’ve applied some of those techniques here .
Frankly , my first reaction to this was mixed .
No two ways about it : it requires more work and more page fetches to produce the same result as could be done in CSS .
This might be slightly better if one could somehow embed the SVG in the CSS file itself , as many of the SVG files are engineered for a single purpose .
This lead me to initially think that having CSS continue to capture the common cases , leaving comparatively advanced techniques like SVG for special purpose or complex effects was the right way to go .
But then I saw this ( screenshot ) and even ( &deity ; forbid ) this ( screenshot ) , and it occurs to me that SVG opens the door to unubtrusive special purpose and ( when judiciously employed ) not - so - complex effects .
It would be fairly easy to give my Nav Bar a more clearly defined frame , a more tapered shape , and use filter effects to vary the color .
The pluses for SVG in CSS is that it does n’t require either adjusting your markup or JavaScript to achieve these effects , a desirable characteristic that generally the other techniques do n’t share .
Nor does it require that your page be XHTML .
And there are lots of good techniques for effectively caching static files .
The only remaining issue is that this technique works best for backgrounds instead of borders , as backgrounds images ( if present ) are displayed on top of the background color , making the background color an effective fallback for browsers that do n’t support SVG in CSS .
Of course , the background can draw a border within the padding , but any CSS provided borders would still show up outside of the background .
Meanwhile , Robert O’Callahan has been exploring other ways to integrate these technologies .

It was just two years ago that Republican Mark Foley resigned from Congress for sending improper sexual email and phone text messages to teenage male Congressional pages .
Well , this is another Congressional district that keeps on giving .
Foley was replaced by Democrat , Tim Mahoney , who is now running for reelection .
Mahoney is a conservative who ran on a “ Faith and Families ” platform and a promise to restore integrity to the seat .
But Mahoney ( a married father ) has admitted to having an affair .
At least this affair did n’t involve the words “ gay ” or “ pedophile ” but a complication is that Mahoney ’s dalliance was with one of his staffers .
When the affair he said she resigned , but there is a recording of the phone call where he fired her , ranting some pretty nasty things , like :
You ’re fired . …
Whenever I do n’t feel like you ’re doing your job , then you lose your job .
And guess what ?
The only person that matters is — guess who ?
Me .
Do you understand that ?
Now this is how life really is .
This is how it works .
Finally , after she threatened him with a lawsuit he agreed to pay her $ 121,000 in hush money .
Now that ’s integrity !
Now , it ’s always ironic when someone who makes family values and integrity a centerpiece of their campaign is exposed as a hypocrite .
But what makes this one even more interesting is that it will be difficult for Republicans to wave this an example of how Democrats are just as corrupt as Republicans , because Mahoney was actually a Republican who was recruited to run as a Democrat against Foley in the first place .
Since being elected , Mahoney has voted with the Republicans almost as much as he has voted with the Democrats .
Is it any wonder that the Democrats have pulled their advertising from this race , and Nancy Pelosi has even called for an investigation of Mahoney ?

Getting hit by somebody wearing a knuckle duster is going to hurt at the best of times , so I dread to think what one that packs a 950,000 volt punch will feel like .
The Knuckle Blaster Stun Gun is intended as a self defence device for people who jog in dodgy areas ( and if it ’s a really really bad area you could always wear one of these on each hand as well as the defensive jacket ) .
Before shocking any potential muggers you should probably ask them if they have a pace maker , then again nah , just knee them and follow up with 950,000 volts to their face .
You can get the Knuckle Blaster Stun Gun via Amazon for $ 44.99 .
US stocks soared following big rallies in Europe and Asia .
The price of gold and US Treasury bonds , traditional safe havens in times of turmoil , both slipped back .
The dollar rose against the yen but slipped against the euro , while oil prices surged .
Here 's a rundown of what 's happening :
— The Treasury said it would use $ 50 billion to back money market mutual funds whose asset values fall below $ 1 a share .
The intent is to shore up ailing money markets after signs that this long - safe corner of financial markets , home to some $ 3.5 trillion of deposits , was at risk of falling victim to the year - old credit crunch .
" For the next year , the U.S. Treasury will insure the holdings of any publicly offered eligible money market mutual fund — both retail and institutional — that pays a fee to participate in the program , " the Treasury said in a statement .
The Treasury said concerns about the net asset value of money market funds falling below $ 1 have exacerbated global financial market turmoil and caused severe liquidity strains in world markets .
— The Federal Reserve said it would lend even more money directly to financial institutions so they could purchase certain assets from money market funds .
— The SEC temporarily banned short - sellingon 799 financial stocks to boost investor confidence on Friday , one day after the UK Financial Services Authority took a similar step .
— Morgan Stanley said the government proposal is a potential " game - changer " in its plans .
Morgan has been discussing a potential merger with Wachovia and other firms .
The latest government efforts come after the credit crisis , which had largely been seen as problem for Wall Street risk takers , threatened to spill over into Main Street .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama ’s lead over Republican rival John McCain fell slightly to 9 points , according to a Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby poll released Saturday , the second consecutive day the race has narrowed .
Obama leads McCain by 51 percent to 42 percent in the rolling three - day tracking poll , which has a margin of error of 2.9 points .
Obama led by 10 points Friday and 12 points on Thursday .
Pollster John Zogby said McCain , who had seen his Democratic rival stake out a widening lead as economic issues dominated the campaign , appeared to be winning some converts with his own economic message .
“ He scores points when he differentiates himself on the economy and when he lays off the negative .
Negative campaigning is not working for anyone this year , ” Zogby said .
“ What ’s important here is that this race is not over . ”
Obama , 47 , has led many national opinion surveys in recent days as well as in polls in important battleground states where the November 4 election will be likely be decided .
But Zogby said the 72 - year - old McCain over the past two days had been able to cut into the Illinois senator ’s main base of support among women and independent voters , a shift that coincided with his campaign ’s move to highlight differences between the two candidates ’ economic policies .
Women , who backed Obama by 20 points Friday , now give him a 16 - point lead , and his lead among independents had fallen to 16 points from 26 Friday .
Zogby said that while the poll showed only 3 percent of voters remained totally undecided in the race , that number grew to about 16 percent if one included voters who were only leaning toward or moderately inclined to support a particular candidate .
“ That means that more people have not completely made up their minds , ” Zogby said .
McCain ’s support was strongest among white voters , who backed the Arizona senator by 49 percent to 43 percent .
Obama , who would be the first black president , won 92 percent support among black voters and 70 percent among Hispanics .
Independent Ralph Nader and Libertarian Bob Barr held relatively steady at 2 percent and 1 percent respectively .
The rolling tracking poll surveyed 1,203 likely voters in the presidential election .
In a tracking poll , the most recent day ’s results are added , while the oldest day ’s results are dropped to monitor changing momentum .

Six tons of steel that lumbers around on eight giant legs
Police fired a Taser at a naked Brooklyn man armed with only a fluorescent light tube yesterday , sending him falling to his death from a second - floor ledge after he went on a 40 - minute rant .
Iman Morales ’ mom begged cops not to hurt her son , telling them he ’s sick – then watched in horror as he plunged from the top of the roll - down gate on which he ’d been perched .
An Emergency Services officer , acting on the orders of his boss , fired at the 35 - year - old man at around 2 p.m. , as he waved the 8 - foot fluorescent light tube , police sources said .
“ His body froze up and he fell face - first , ” said Sean Johnson , who witnessed the drama at 489 Tompkins Ave. in Bedford - Stuyvesant .
Morales , who crashed 10 feet to the pavement , died a few hours later at Kings County Hospital .
Asked if police followed the proper protocol for using a Taser , NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said , “ That ’s being reviewed . ”
A New York Police Department lieutenant was stripped of his gun and badge , and the officer who used the stun gun on the man was placed on administrative duty Thursday , officials said .
Amid his mostly unintelligible rant , Morales was heard yelling , “ You ’re going to kill me .
I ’m going to take everyone with me . ”
He also screamed , “ I ’m going to die .
You ’re all going to die with me . ”
Morales first emerged hanging out a third - floor window after a blowup with his mother at around 1 p.m. , witnesses said .
Twenty minutes later , he climbed the fire escape to the fourth floor , where he tried to force his way into a neighbor ’s apartment .
“ He tried to come into my window and I ran out , ” said 40 - year - old Tonya Wright .
“ He said , ‘ Let me in . ’
I told him , ‘ I ’m not letting you in . ’ ”
Morales then headed to the second floor and screamed to the crowd , which included his frantic mom .
“ She was saying , ‘ No ! No !
Do n’t hurt him .
He is sick , ’ ” Wright said .
With police shouting for him to get down , Morales made his way to a ledge above a the gate .
“ Walk down now !
Move down ! ” the police can be heard shouting to him on video .
He then picked up the light tube and waved it in the air before jabbing cops who had climbed out of the windows above .
“ When he was poking the cop , people were laughing , ” Johnson said .
He refused orders from the officers and continued his incoherent tirade .
Finally , one of the ESU cops on the street shot him with the Taser .
“ He just fell face first , ” said witness Sean Brown .
“ People were screaming and yelling .
It was wrong . ”
It was unclear what set off the episode , but , said Johnson , “ once he started hitting the cop with that pole , that ’s when it turned serious . ”
Morales had one prior arrest , for a Manhattan petit larceny .
“ This is very out of character , ” said the building ’s superintendent , Charlene Gayle , 31 .
“ Nice guy , clean cut , well kept , never irrational .
Did n’t have irrational behavior . ”

Palin defends $ 150,000 wardrobe in her own clothes Nick Cargo
Published : Sunday October 26 , 2008
Print This Email This On Sunday , Alaska Governor Sarah Palin took a couple minutes to distance herself from $ 150,000 in controversial wardrobe purchases for herself and members of her family in the opening of her speech to an audience in Florida .
" This whole thing with the wardrobe , " she said , " I try to just ignore it because it 's so ridiculous , but I 'm glad now that [ The View's Elizabeth Hasselbeck ] brought it up .
It gives me an opportunity , without the filter of the media , to get to tell you the whole clothes thing ... They are not my property .
Just like the lighting and the staging and everything else that the RNC purchased , I 'm not taking them with me .
I 'm back to wearing my own clothes from my favorite consignment shop in Anchorage , Alaska . "
Palin also made sure to note her inexpensive wedding ring , gifted earrings and lapel pin worn to honor her son who just left for Iraq .
A third of the garments bought for Palin , which she said were for wearing during September 's Republican National Convention , have already been returned , said the McCain campaign , and the rest will be donated to charity after Election Day .
" This is deliberately sexist , " Hasselbeck said during her introduction of the Governor .
" I know you know that , " she added , as an audible wolf - whistle was lodged by an audience member .
" I 'm actually personally most impressed by her accessories .
You know , like the flag pin that she wears in honor of her son and our military men and women fighting abroad .
And they fight for our very right to be here today in her support .
Now , they did n't list that accessory and its value in their report , did they ?
You know why ?
Because they know it 's priceless . "
Expenditures that have been documented include almost $ 50,000 at Saks Fifth Avenue and $ 75,000 at Neiman Marcus .
" Republicans , RNC donors and at least one RNC staff member have e-mailed me tonight to share their utter ( and not - for - attribution ) disgust at the expenditures , " said The Atlantic 's Marc Ambinder .
Embedded below are Elizabeth Hasselbeck 's opening remarks , followed by a clip of Governor Palin :
The Jed Report has also compiled clips of Fox News reporters slamming criticism of Palin on her wardrobe while conveniently forgetting the stretch earlier in the 2008 campaign when former Senator John Edwards was mocked and berated repeatedly over the fact that he had received two $ 400 haircuts .
" Television is a cosmetic business , " said Fox anchor Gretchen Carlson in the Governor 's defense .
" Always has been , always will be to a certain extent .
So is politics . "
" Somebody is sitting in a makeup room right over here who does our makeup and does our hair , " added Steve Doocy .
" If you 're in the public eye , you 've got to look good . "
Joel Haugen , a Republican fighting a tough congressional race against the Democrats in Oregon , has fallen out with his party .
The reason : his surprise endorsement of Barack Obama for the presidency .
" I believe in putting nation before party and my first priority is following my conscience with regard to what is best for America , " Haugen said in a statement yesterday .
" I have a huge amount of respect for John McCain , but I believe that he has more of a cold war mentality . "
Haugen is just one of many Republican politicians , dubbed Obamicans , who have defected to Obama .
The latest high - profile desertions include Scott McClellan , President George Bush 's former press secretary , who endorses Obama in a CNN programme to be broadcast this weekend , and William Weld , the one - time Republican governor of Massachusetts .
Weld , in a statement released yesterday , described Obama as " a once - in - a - lifetime candidate " .
Last weekend , Bush 's former secretary of state Colin Powell publicly backed the Democratic candidate in Obama 's biggest Republican catch so far .
It is unusual to see so many Republican politicians and columnists shift , even allowing for the fact that affiliations are more fluid in the US than Europe .
The Obamicans have a website , republicansforobama.org , listing those who have endorsed Obama .
Campaign paraphernalia is also available from Obama 's team , including a badge " Republicans for Obama " .
According to Haugen 's campaign manager , Sarah Tiedemann , he made no secret of his views while fighting for the party nomination , telling the press about his unhappiness with President George Bush 's eight years in office and that he was likely to endorse Obama over McCain .
He won 70 % of the nomination vote .
The Republican party became increasingly " unfriendly " , Tiedemann said , and has withdrawn all financial support .
Haugen , as a compromise , is now standing under an independent banner , though he remains a registered Republican .
Tiedemann said the reaction among Republicans over his endorsement was mixed .
She acknowledged it was " unusual " to make such an endorsement but Haugen " feels the Republican party has got so far from its roots " .
Other defectors include Arne Carlson , Republican governor of Minnesota from 1991 - 1999 , who wrote in the Minneapolis Star - Tribune on Thursday : " The choice of Governor Sarah Palin as a running mate , and the resultant shallow campaign based on fear and suspicion , looks frighteningly similar to the politics of Karl Rove [ Bush 's campaign strategist ] . "
He described Obama as having " the potential to become a truly great president " .
McClellan .
who published a book this year critical of the Bush administration , accusing it of lying , told CNN he would vote for Obama because he offered the best chance of changing the way Washington works .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
I have watched Gov. Sarah Palin flaunt her baby at political rallies and pass him along from family member to family member as if he were nothing more than a plastic prop .
I ca n’t help but wonder about a candidate so eager to capitalize on having a baby with Down syndrome .
Yes , her story is dramatic .
She was a mother of four who chose to have a fifth child even though she knew he would be born with special needs .
If you combine that with her eldest child being shipped off to Iraq on Sept. 11 , you have one remarkable Lifetime movie script .
However , there ’s an equally compelling story involving her Democratic vice - presidential rival , Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. ( whose son also is being shipped off to Iraq next month but with less hype ) that was never captured on film .
It ’s a story that reveals far more about Mr. Biden ’s character than Mrs. Palin ’s public spectacles ever will .
It was Jan. 3 , the night of the Iowa caucuses .
I had traveled to Des Moines to volunteer for the fledgling Biden campaign .
There were n’t many of us , maybe just a few hundred in a banquet hall that night awaiting Mr. Biden ’s speech after his disappointing fifth - place finish .
After assuring everyone in the room that he was going to be just fine , that there was no reason to feel sad and that he would be returning happily to the Senate to continue fighting for all of us , he walked among the crowd thanking everyone for his or her support .
I waited nearly an hour , till the crowd had dispersed a bit , before making my way to Mr. Biden , hoping to shake his hand and tell him my great line that I had been rehearsing in my head over and over .
After finally getting within an arm ’s reach of him , I saw my chance and extended my hand .
But instead of greeting me , Mr. Biden turned to the guy next to me .
“ This guy ’s my buddy ! ” Mr. Biden said , breaking into his patented smile and enveloping the guy in a grandfatherly bear hug .
At first , I was annoyed that Mr. Biden had ignored me .
But then I saw that the guy he was hugging was a young boy in his early teens with Down syndrome .
I waited patiently as Mr. Biden cradled the boy ’s head in his arms , stroked his hair lovingly and looked him square in the eye , repeating to him over and over , “ You ’re my buddy .
Thanks for coming here tonight and being with me .
I ’m so happy you ’re here . ”
Mr. Biden ’s affection and empathy for that boy was n’t being played for any crowds or any cameras .
On a night when he had just been eliminated in his second and probably last run for the presidency , when he could have been disappointed and bitter and made an early exit , Joe Biden was genuinely more concerned about making this boy feel loved and appreciated than he was about himself .
I turned around and left the banquet hall , forgoing my only chance to shake Mr. Biden ’s hand and thank him for his honorable run for the presidency .
I figured nothing I could say to him could top the grace and humanity I had just witnessed in that moment .

Barack Obama accused John McCain of resorting to smear tactics yesterday as Republicans showed signs of alarm at the prospect of a Democratic clean sweep in both the White House and Congressional races on November 4 .
His attack came after McCain 's team , in an unusual step , signalled at the weekend that it is to switch strategy towards more personal and nastier criticism of Obama .
McCain 's team offered an early glimpse of the new strategy by accusing Obama of being friends with a terrorist , Bill Ayers .
He is one of the founders of the Weathermen , a radical underground group responsible for a bombing campaign in the US in the 1970s .
The aim of the McCain team appears to be to try to shift attention away from the economic crisis that has led to a haemorrhaging of Republican support over the last two weeks .
Having entered the final 30 days of the campaign , during which the views of undecided voters begin to consolidate , polls and reports from Democratic and Republican campaign staff on the ground suggest a seismic shift is taking place in the electoral map in favour of the Democrats .

The optimism in the Obama camp is based not just on the poll leads but on voter registration .
Obama has more staff and volunteers on the ground and has registered millions of new Democratic voters , an effort unmatched by the Republicans .
The Democrats ' team revealed at the weekend it has registered 1.5 million new voters in swing state Pennsylvania alone .
Unlike in 2004 , when the failed Democratic candidate John Kerry was slow to respond to personal attacks , Obama is countering fast .
In a speech on the campaign trail in Asheville , North Carolina , Obama accused McCain of trying to divert voters from the economic crisis .
" Senator McCain and his operatives are gambling that he can distract you with smears rather than talk to you about substance .
They 'd rather try to tear our campaign down than lift this country up .
It 's what you do when you 're out of touch , out of ideas , and running out of time . "
The Democratic candidate is making inroads into states once regarded as safe Republican areas , while the number of states in which McCain is competitive is narrowing , mainly because of the Wall Street collapse .
The Republican concern is that they stand to lose not only the White House but that the Democrats will also come out of the election with bigger majorities in the Senate as well as the House , giving them a rare dominance in Washington .
McCain is expected to raise questions about Obama 's character in a presidential debate in Nashville , Tennessee , tomorrow night - one of the dwindling number of chances for the Republican candidate to turn the race around .
The Obama campaign will follow up its candidate 's attack on smear tactics by airing an ad on cable television accusing McCain of being " erratic in a crisis " and out of touch , adding : " No wonder his campaign wants to change the subject . "
Tim Pawlenty , the Republican governor of Minnesota and part of McCain 's inner circle , yesterday criticised Obama for attending a political event in Ayers 's home in Chicago .
Pawlenty , who had been on the shortlist as a running mate for McCain , said Ayers was " an unrepentant domestic terrorist " .
Speaking to Republican sympathisers at a fundraiser in Colorado on Saturday , McCain 's running mate , Sarah Palin , also raised the link with Ayers .
" Our opponent though is someone who sees America , it seems , as being so imperfect , imperfect enough that he is palling around with terrorists who would target their own country , " Palin said .
She added : " There is a time when it 's necessary to take the gloves off and that time is right now . "
Ayers , who is now a professor in Chicago , worked on the board of a charity alongside Obama distributing educational funds .
Although the relationship between the two was not close , a video is appearing on websites showing Ayers morphing into Obama .
As well as Ayers , the Republicans are planning to reopen the Democratic candidate 's ties with Antoin " Tony " Rezko , the Chicago property developer and early funder when Obama stood for the Senate .
In awkward timing for Obama , Rezko is due to be sentenced for fraud just days before the election , on October 30 .

In a move that will leave many saying , " Duh !
What took so long , " the Internet Movie Database ( IMDb.com ) has just added movie and TV streaming to its site .
IMDb has long been the first stop for many ( IMDb.com claims 57 million users ) looking to find information related to movies , TV shows , and the people associated with them , such as actors and filmmakers .
Available now , the Amazon.com - owned company hosts " over 6,000 full - length feature films and TV episodes for free . "
This new features is currenly labeled as a " Beta . " IMDb.com will feature a rotating selection of video content from providers such as " CBS , Hulu , Sony Pictures Television and over 500 independent filmmakers . "
Content will include current TV shows such as Heroes , Battlestar Galactica , and The Office ; and even " classics " such as , Star Trek , Buffy the Vampire Slayer , and The A - Team .
Because of its partnership with Hulu , viewers will also be able to see some TV season premiers online before their actual official broadcasts
There is also a selection of fairly recent movies , such as Master and Commander : The Far Side of the World , Liar Liar , and Behind Enemy Lines .
The " Classic Movies " selection includes titles such as Some Like It Hot , Fiddler on the Roof , and The Longest Day .
A selection of current movie trailers is also available .
In addition to the traditional Hollywood fare , IMDb.com is also allowing independent filmmakers to upload their films , trailers , and clips for streaming as well .
Currently , the rights - owners of the videos can upload videos for movies that already have IMDb.com pages , are under 45 minutes , and are 850 MB or smaller QuickTime video files .
IMDb.com explains that while this is the current file size limit , it hopes to expand this soon .
The uploads actually take place on IMDb. com 's sister site , Withoutabox , which is designed as hub to help connect independent filmmakers and film festivals .
As you might expect , all of the streaming video include in - video advertising , including the trailers and independent films .
Every video streaming page also includes a prominently placed link for how users can report " offensive or copyrighted material , " in order to request that video be " taken down .
" Time will tell if the inclusion of video streaming will bring more users to IMDb .
com or if it will just provide a quick - fix to those who already peruse the site .
With the possible exception of the independent films , all of the content is available elsewhere and in far more elegant user interfaces than the rather simplistic one that IMDb.com offers .
Then again , the IMDB.com streaming feature is still a " Beta , " so the site site might still have a few tricks up its sleeve .
As the site is an Amazon - owned company , there is a cadre of innovative developers potentially available to work their magic .
After Bailout , AIG Executives Head to Resort
UPDATED : 11:31 a.m .
Less than a week after the federal government offered an $ 85 billion bailout to insurance giant AIG , the company held a week - long retreat for its executives at the luxury St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach , Calif. , running up a tab of $ 440,000 , Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif . ) said today at the the opening of a House committee hearing about the near - failure of the insurance giant .
Showing a photograph of the resort , Waxman said the executives spent $ 200,000 for rooms , $ 150,000 for meals and $ 23,000 for the spa .
" Less than a week after the taxpayers rescued AIG , company executives could be found wining and dining at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation , " Waxman said .
" We will ask whether any of this makes sense . "
The committee will ask the company 's executives about their multimillion - dollar pay packages -- some of which they continue to receive -- as well as who bears responsibility for the company 's high - risk investment portfolio , which led to its near collapse just weeks ago .
" They were getting their manicures , their pedicures , massages , their facials while the American people were paying their bills , " thundered Rep. Elijah E. Cummings ( D - Md. ) , of the executive retreat at the Monarch Resort .
The House committee , which took on executive compensation at bankrupt Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers yesterday , has received " tens of thousands " of pages of documents from AIG , Waxman said .
Those documents show that as the company 's risky investments began to implode , the company altered its generous executive pay plan to pay out regardless of such losses .
AIG lost over $ 5 billion in the last quarter of 2007 due its risky financial products division , Waxman said .
Yet in March 2008 , when the company 's compensation committee met to award bonuses , Chief Executive Martin Sullivan urged the committee to ignore those losses , which should have slashed bonuses .
But the board agreed to ignore the losses from the financial products division and gave Sullivan a cash bonus of over $ 5 million .
The board also approved a new compensation contract for Sullivan that gave him a golden parachute of $ 15 million , Waxman said .
Joseph Cassano , the executive in charge of the company 's troubled financial products division , received more than $ 280 million over the last eight years , Waxman said .
Even after he was terminated in February as his investments turned sour , the company allowed him to keep up to $ 34 million in unvested bonuses and put him on a $ 1 million - a - month retainer .
He continues to receive $ 1 million a month , Waxman said .
Waxman also looked skeptically at the executives ' defense that the troubles in the business had to do with larger economic forces and not their own bad decisions .
When a former AIG auditor , Joseph St. Denis , expressed concerns , Cassano told him " I have deliberately excluded you from the valuation ... because I was concerned that you would pollute the process , " according to Waxman .
St. Denis resigned in protest .
PricewaterhouseCoopers , AIG 's auditor , told the company in March 2008 that the " root cause " of AIG 's problems was that people assessing risk did not have enough access to the financial products division , where the risky investments originated .
Waxman further suggested that Sullivan had deliberately misled investors .
On Dec. 5 , 2007 , Sullivan expressed confidence to investors .
But a week before , PricewaterhouseCoopers warned Sullivan that the company " could have a material weakness relating to these area , " committee members said .

" I think the ultimate solution is a nationalization of both Fannie and Freddie and I hope a restructuring in that nationalization , " he said .
" And then split them up into five or ten separate entities and sell them back into the market . "
Greenspan 's comments pushed both stocks lower .
He also said that while the priority now is stabilizing the financial system , he is worried about the long - term issue of inflation .
" We will come out of this financial crisis , " he said .
" But we still have to confront that problem of changing balance between growth and inflation , or what we like to call ' stagflation . ' "
Greenspan , who left the Fed in early 2006 and was succeeded by Ben Bernanke , has come under increasing criticism for allowing what many said was easy credit that set up the current financial crisis .
In the interview , Greenspan called the current crisis a " once- in - a- century phenomenon " that went beyond a liquidity crisis and was more what he called a " solvency problem . "
" We have n't gotten closure yet , " he said .
" And it 's going to take a while . "
Tstamps sez ,
I was in Spring Hill , Florida visiting my grandparents , who have all the family pictures of great grandparents and great - great grandparents .
Doing the good familial thing , I decided to take the albums and scan the photos so that the rest of the family could see them .
I only had one day to do this , and the only place near them was Wal - Mart ( the Supercenter by highway 19 ) .
So I take the ( sometimes ) 100 year old photos to Wal - Mart and begin scanning them on their machine .
After a while , a Wal - Mart employee accosts me and tells me that I can't do that because those images are " Copyright to the studios that took them . "
I look down at my pictures .
The picture she is pointing to is one of my great grandmother , taken about 1925 .
She has been dead since 1998 .
The photography studio ( assuming it was taken by a studio ) is not marked , and is long out of business , and the person who took the photo is long dead , as are , likely , his children and all of his business associates .
The only known copy of the photo is the one I 'm holding , which is owned by my grandparents , who gave it to me to copy .
In disbelief , I point out that the photo is almost 100 years old and the people are all dead .
Undeterred , the Wal - Mart employee informs me that " Copyright lasts forever .
It 's the law . "
My scans up to that point are deleted and I 'm free to leave the store with my old photos unscanned .
I guess I should be thankful they did n't have a portable shredder on hand to seize my photos and do away with them right then and there .
Is that in the next set of magic federal laws ?
Do n't be surprised if you keep hearing me refer back to this one speech by Roderick Long , because it 's so damn good and stimulating .
It has everything : Rand , Long , libertarian theory , and ( entangling ? ) alliances .
You do n't have to agree with all of it to have your hair blown back anyway .
Here 's a tasty sample :
While I 've said I do n't want to dwell on terminological issues , I can't resist making a point about " capitalism " and " socialism . "
Rand used to identify certain terms and ideas as " anti-concepts , " that is , terms that actually function to obscure our understanding rather than facilitating it , making it harder for us to grasp other , legitimate concepts ; one important category of anti-concepts is what Rand called the " package deal , " referring to any term whose meaning conceals an implicit presupposition that certain things go together that in actuality do not . [ 11 ]
Although Rand would not agree with the following examples , I 've become convinced that the terms " capitalism " and " socialism " are really anti-concepts of the package - deal variety .
Libertarians sometimes debate whether the " real " or " authentic " meaning of a term like " capitalism " is ( a ) the free market , or ( b ) government favoritism toward business , or ( c ) the separation between labor and ownership , an arrangement neutral between the other two ; Austrians tend to use the term in the first sense ; individualist anarchists in the Tuckerite tradition tend to use it in the second or third . [ 12 ]
But in ordinary usage , I fear , it actually stands for an amalgamation of incompatible meanings .
Suppose I were to invent a new word , " zaxlebax , " and define it as " a metallic sphere , like the Washington Monument . "
That 's the definition — " a metallic sphere , like the Washington Monument . "
In short , I build my ill - chosen example into the definition .
Now some linguistic subgroup might start using the term " zaxlebax " as though it just meant " metallic sphere , " or as though it just meant " something of the same kind as the Washington Monument . "
And that 's fine .
But my definition incorporates both , and thus conceals the false assumption that the Washington Monument is a metallic sphere ; any attempt to use the term " zaxlebax , " meaning what I mean by it , involves the user in this false assumption .
That 's what Rand means by a package - deal term .
Now I think the word " capitalism , " if used with the meaning most people give it , is a package - deal term .
By " capitalism " most people mean neither the free market simpliciter nor the prevailing neomercantilist system simpliciter .
Rather , what most people mean by " capitalism " is this free - market system that currently prevails in the western world .
In short , the term " capitalism " as generally used conceals an assumption that the prevailing system is a free market .
And since the prevailing system is in fact one of government favoritism toward business , the ordinary use of the term carries with it the assumption that the free market is government favoritism toward business .
And similar considerations apply to the term " socialism . "
Most people do n't mean by " socialism " anything so precise as state ownership of the means of production ; instead they really mean something more like " the opposite of capitalism . "
Then if " capitalism " is a package - deal term , so is " socialism " — it conveys opposition to the free market , and opposition to neomercantilism , as though these were one and the same .
And that , I suggest , is the function of these terms : to blur the distinction between the free market and neomercantilism .
Such confusion prevails because it works to the advantage of the statist establishment : those who want to defend the free market can more easily be seduced into defending neomercantilism , and those who want to combat neomercantilism can more easily be seduced into combating the free market .
Either way , the state remains secure .

Thomas Riccio , a lanky 84 - year - old , was dozing off in the waiting room .
A former crane operator at a steel mill and a World War II veteran , he had been in for a physical six months earlier and everything was fine .
His only chronic medical problem was high blood pressure .
When I called his name , he stood up and swayed , almost losing his balance .
His wife and I lunged , each grabbing one of his arms .
“ I ’m OK , I ’m OK , ” he insisted .
“ Just when I get up sometimes , I almost lose my balance , but I have n’t fallen . ”
His wife told me it was the fourth time in three months that he ’d come to the VA clinic with dizziness .
At our regular visits he always said that everything was good .
He was n’t one to complain .
Slowly we made our way down the hall , Mr. Riccio sliding one hand along the wall .
Dizziness is the third most common symptom in primary care , and it ’s one that doctors love to hate .
That is because each of the three main cate­gories of dizziness — vertigo , disequilibrium , and light - headedness — has its own lengthy list of diagnoses .
Vertigo is an illusory sensation of motion or spinning , often accompanied by nausea .
It can be caused by inner-ear problems , mi­graines , or , if accompanied by other symp­toms , a stroke .
Disequilibrium — which is particularly common in elderly patients with arthritis or problems with vision , hearing , or balance — is a feeling of unsteadiness while walking unaided across an open space .
Light - headedness is the sensation of near fainting , such as one might experience when standing up suddenly after a day of gardening in the hot sun .
It most often results from problems in blood flow to the brain caused by anemia , low blood sugar , hyperventilation , dehydration , or cardiac problems .
Which of these three was Mr. Riccio experiencing ?
I was n’t the first doctor to consider the question .
Mr. Riccio told me he had gone to the emergency room three months earlier , complaining of dizziness and headaches he ’d had off and on for several days .
Given the patient ’s history of high blood pressure , the emergency room doctor suspected a stroke , so he asked for a CT scan of Mr. Riccio ’s brain to see if there were any blocked or burst blood vessels .
He also requested blood tests for signs of anemia or low blood sugar .
The CT scan and the blood work both came back normal .
Mr. Riccio was discharged with instructions to take Tylenol , in case he was experiencing a migraine .
During the next three weeks , both the headache and the dizziness eased , but then the dizziness returned .
Over the next few months , he saw three more doctors .
One ascribed the headache and dizziness to sinusitis .
Another thought it could be inflammation of the inner ear .
Another believed elevated blood pressure was the cause .
Mr. Riccio tried various treatments to no avail .
Now it was my chance to solve the puzzle .
“ It comes and goes , ” Mr. Riccio told me .
“ Last night in bed , I thought I was going to pass out .
The room suddenly whizzed around .
Just for about 10 seconds , but it felt a lot longer . ”
Did it happen more if he turned his head to one side or the other ?
He thought for a moment .
“ To the right , ” he said .
“ When I turn my head to the right fast , I get dizzy . ”
“ When you stood up in the waiting room , you looked pretty dizzy , ” I said .
“ When you stand up fast , do you usually get kind of light - headed , like you ’re going to faint ? ”
He shook his head .
What happened when he walked across a large open space ?
Did he feel unsteady ?
He said that he did n’t .
I asked Mr. Riccio to follow my forefinger with his eyes .
A jerking in his eye movements when he tracked my finger could indicate a problem with the balancing system of the inner ear .
The other doctors had n’t noted any rhythmic jerkiness , called nystagmus , but I wanted to double - check .
I repeated the test a couple of times .
Mr. Riccio ’s eye movements were smooth .
Sometimes the information we get from a patient ’s history does n’t match up with the physical , and we have to go with our gut feeling .
My gut was telling me that this was vertigo , even without nystagmus .
Could it be benign paroxysmal positional vertigo ( BPPV ) ?
This is the most common type of positional vertigo , and it occurs most frequently in the elderly .
In almost half of all cases , there is no known cause .
There is one leading hypothesis about how it happens .
Inside the inner ear are three fluid - filled , semicircular canals that serve as balance sensors .
In patients with BPPV , tiny chunks of calcium carbonate crystals , called otoconia , float into the canals .
The crystals are normally attached to a membrane in the inner ear , but they can be dislodged , perhaps by head injury or infection or through the normal degeneration of aging .
“ You know those little handheld pinball games ? ” I asked .
Mr. Riccio nodded .
“ The crystals are like the tiny metal balls in one of those games .
Once they ’re in the wrong spot , it ’s hard to get them back .
They roll around every time you move your head and unintentionally set off motion sensors .
So your brain gets the wrong information about balance .
It thinks you ’re moving in one direction when you ’re really not .
So it overcorrects , and you end up with the spinning sensation . ”
He leaned forward and pursed his lips .
“ Is there another pill to try ? ”
He sounded tired , a little frustrated .
“ Something even better . ”
In 1983 , John Epley , an otolaryngologist in Portland , Oregon , found that a precise series of guided head movements could rid patients of vertigo by directing the disruptive crystals out of the semicircular canals .
Initially the local medical community dismissed his finding .
To many physicians , any technique based on a maneuver or manipulation smacks of hocus - pocus .
But the treatment was backed up by scientific studies , and by 1992 doctors had come to accept it .
The Epley maneuver is now the standard treatment for BPPV .
Because it involves manipulating the head and neck into certain positions , in rare instances it is not recommended for patients with unstable heart disease , severe blockage of the carotid arteries , or neck disease .
Otherwise the maneuver is safe and quite effective , re­lieving vertigo in 80 percent of patients with BPPV .
It was worth a try .
I asked Mr. Riccio to sit on the exam table again .
I explained that we needed to position him so he was lying on his back with his head hanging to one side and gently tilted backward .
I warned him that the changes in position would momentarily trigger the dizziness , if my suspicion about the cause of his vertigo was correct .
Standing at his side , I said , “ Hold my right forearm , ” as I braced my left hand on his back .
“ Now turn your head to the right and keep it turned as you lie down . ”
I guided him down until he was flat on his back , his head tilted back over the edge , his right ear pointing at the floor .
“ Whoa , there it goes , ” he said , opening his eyes wide .
“ That ’s the feeling .
That ’s the one . ”
As I moved his head into the different positions , I pictured a little pinball game and imagined I was directing the tiny balls — the crystals — back into their designated holes .
After 30 seconds I turned his head gently so his left ear was pointing down .
Then I instructed him to keep his head still and to roll over onto his left shoulder , keeping his head angled down to the exam table .
Another 30 seconds .
“ Now please sit up without changing the position of your head and tell me if you still feel dizzy . ” I helped him up .
“ Oh yeah , very dizzy . ”
He braced himself , clutching the edge of the exam table .
We repeated the whole sequence two more times , and by the last time Mr. Riccio sat up , the dizziness was gone .
It might come back , I told him , but it would probably be less intense .
I printed a diagram showing how he could do a modified version of the Epley maneuver at home , using a pillow under the shoulders to position his head at the correct angle .
If he did this a few times a day until the dizziness was gone for 24 hours , it would probably stay away for a while , and in some cases for good .
Two months later he was back for his regular checkup .
We walked briskly from the waiting room to my office .
He was beaming .
“ Doctor , can I give you a hug ? ” he asked .
“ You cured me ! ”
Just call me a pinball wizard .

How will news execs keep audiences interested if the presidential race is effectively decided before most Americans have finished dinner ?
Nation could face short Election Night
Network news executives said they are preparing for an unusual Election Night challenge :
How to be honest with the audience , and still keep them tuned in , if the race between John McCain and Barack Obama is effectively decided before most Americans have finished dinner .
After two elections in which the suspense went far into the evening ( and , in the case of 2000 , for 36 days afterward ) , the executives said they are contemplating how to manage their newscasts in the event of an Obama blowout — in which the Democrat ’s victory would be obvious while polls are still open in most of the country .

“ Our policy is that we wo n’t call individual states until all of the voting in those states is finished , ” said Jeffrey Schneider , ABC News senior vice president .
“ If enough of those states add up to 270 electoral votes , then the outcome is obvious . ”
The quandary is highlighted by Virginia , a state that has not voted Democratic for president since 1964 but where Obama is now leading in polls .
There is no realistic McCain electoral college strategy that does not depend on winning the Old Dominion .
If it is clear on Nov. 4 that Obama has won in Virginia by the time polls there close at 7 p.m. — it will still be daylight west of the Mississippi — the obvious conclusion will be that Obama is headed to the White House .
But executives are already mulling how clearly they would want their anchors and analysts to state the obvious , since networks have been criticized for depressing turnout by calling elections while polls are still open for several more hours .
But they must also decide how they are going to fill air time , since networks are planning to be on the air until 2 a.m. on the East Coast .
Paul Friedman , CBS
News senior vice president , said he has started to think “ about what we could do to augment our Senate and House coverage on election night if the presidential story is over . "
“ As to the presidential race , it 's pretty simple :
We will try to call a winner in each state as soon as possible after the polls close in each state , ” Friedman e-mailed .
“ If that adds up to 270 for someone before the polls close in the West , there 's not a lot we can do .
If there are not enough electoral votes for one man to win it before the Western states close , but we 're pretty sure how they 're going to fall , we will be ready with language which states the obvious without being too obvious .
We can't be in the business of pretending to be stupid . ”
Network political experts do not expect a candidate to reach the winning threshold of 270 electoral votes before 11 p.m. Eastern .
“ Nearly a mathematical impossibility , ” one network official e-mailed .
So even if the trend looks insurmountable , the technical suspense will remain , even in the outcome has been clear for hours .
Friedman said that in case of a landslide , “ We could say something like , ‘ Given the number of electoral votes Obama already has , and given what we know about the voting so far in various states where the polls have not closed , it is going to be very hard for John McCain to win . ’
I would sincerely hope that kind of language would not discourage people out West from voting . ”
Sam Feist , CNN 's political director , cautioned that it could be harder than ever to project states early because all of the new , young and African - American voters could scramble turnout models .
" Projecting races on Election Night is very dependent on comparisons to what the vote looked like in previous years , " he said .
A night of early surprises would be a gift for John King 's " Magic Wall " of computerized maps .
Feist said : " If we know early in the evening that Barack Obama wins a critical state such as Virginia or Florida , we 'll have a conversation about what John McCain would have to pull out of his hat now , " such as Wisconsin , Minnesota , New Mexico , Colorado or Nevada .
McCain strategists , while not conceding defeat , argue that they are running in what is perhaps the most hostile climate a major - party nominee has ever faced , considering the economic implosion , the unpopularity of President Bush and news coverage that they believe has turned against them .
McCain is playing defense in a host of states that George W. Bush won twice , most notably Ohio and Florida but also such normally safe states as North Carolina and Indiana ( which , incidentally , has a 6 p.m. Eastern poll closing ) .
Bush strategist Karl Rove contended in The Wall Street Journal on Thursday that “ Obama Has n't Closed the Sale , ” but even Rove called a McCain recovery “ improbable . ”
“ This task , while not impossible , will be difficult , ” Rove wrote .
“ If Mr. McCain succeeds , he will have engineered the most impressive and improbable political comeback since Harry Truman in 1948 .
But having to reach back more than a half - century for inspiration is not the place campaign managers want to be now . ”
After McCain failed to shake up the race in Wednesday ’s debate , pundits have been increasingly bold in suggesting that the race could be over .
As the leading edge of what is likely to be a race by journalists to forecast the outcome of what has been the most exciting presidential race in American history , ABC News veteran Sam Donaldson said of McCain on “ Good Morning America ” on Thursday : “ Something could happen .
But unless it does , he ’s going to lose . ”
Over on MSNBC , host Joe Scarborough said on “ Morning Joe ” : “ When it becomes obvious that one candidate ’s going to lose , usually members of that party start jumping , like rats from a ship .
You ’re starting to hear from Republicans that are really afraid McCain ’s going to lose , Democrats may [ reach ] 60 in the Senate , and this is going to be a historic rout . ”
And Republican analyst Torie Clarke , who once worked as McCain ’s Senate press secretary and who appeared with Donaldson , had this advice for her former boss :
“ He has to ask himself some very tough questions , because one way or the other , this is the final chapter in his political career .
And how does he want to write that final chapter ? …
Does he want to do anything in an effort to win , or does he want to go out the way he likes to think of himself — as a public servant ? ”
An early Alpha release of the long awaited Mac version of the popular BitTorrent client uTorrent has leaked to the public .
The application is still in development , but most features seem to work just fine .
As expected , the application looks very Mac - like , and better than its Windows counterpart .
Thus far , only Windows users have had the pleasure of running uTorrent .
The client saw its first public release in September 2005 , and soon became the most widely used BitTorrent application .
In 2006 , uTorrent was acquired by BitTorrent Inc. , who continued to develop the application , and promised a Mac version too .
The Mac version came later than expected .
One of the initial developers was taken off the project , and the others were focusing more on the Windows release .
This August , however , uTorrent developer Greg Hazel told TorrentFreak that the first public Alpha version of the Mac release would be ready in a few weeks .
It now seems that someone has beat the uTorrent developers to it , as an early release was posted on The Pirate Bay a few hours ago .
A leak of the BitTorrent client , developed in Cocoa , seemed to be inevitable .
As mentioned before , it is an Alpha version , and not all the features seem to work like they should ( search is broken ) , but it ’s definitely a good start .
Simon Morris , BitTorrent ’s VP of Product Management told TorrentFreak in a response to the leak : “ Apparently an internal development build of uTorrent for Mac has been leaked publicly .
It has been referred to as an “ alpha ” quality build .
The unfortunate part is that we did not intentionally release this build and would strongly recommend folks not to use it as it is n’t yet complete or stable enough to be released to the public . ”
“ The good part is that this is a testament to the fact that we ’re serious about releasing uTorrent for Mac in the near future .
( And counter to recent rumors , this is indeed the uTorrent code - base ported onto OSX , not just Libtorrent with a Mac UI ) .
Hopefully more news coming soon .
We have a sign - up page on the uTorrent website . ”
Most of the people who have tried the application are reporting that the application is fully functional , but that it ’s clearly an Alpha release .
Nevertheless , the first reviews are quite positive .
“ It seems like the uTorrent every Mac - owner has been waiting for is coming , ” an early user told TorrentFreak .
We posted some screenshots of the leaked Alpha release below , click to enlarge .

The RSPCA has launched an Australia wide search for a youth who was video taped beating a kangaroo as his friend looks on laughing .
The video was sent to the RSPCA in WA and shows the youth using kickboxing style attacks on the kangaroo .
In one scene the man pulls the kangaroo towards him and uses his knee to deliver a blow to the animal 's chest .
The final punch knocks the kangaroo to the ground where it appears to lie unconscious .
The RSPCA says it is unclear whether the attack resulted in the death of the animal .
A spokesman for the RSPCA , Richard Barry , says the organisation has launched a nationwide appeal to catch the men responsible for the footage .
" We are appealing to every media outlet in Australia to help us track down the cowards behind the vicious attack on this kangaroo , " he said .
" Thankfully this sickening footage has now been removed from the website where it was first seen .
The next stage is to ensure that those responsible for this film are brought to justice .
" Only a coward would attack an injured and obviously terrified young animal much smaller than himself .
We want these cowards to be caught , charged and prosecuted .
" We are appealing to every media outlet in Australia to help us track down the culprits and we have also posted a photo of the youth at www.rspcawa.asn.au, " he added .
The RSPCA also welcomes the support of the Western Australia Police in finding the perpetrators of this senseless attack .
Anyone with information is asked to call their local RSPCA .
Barack Obama is running a half - hour prime - time commercial on NBC , CBS , Fox , MSBNC , and Univision Wednesday night , said James Hibberd in The Live Feed , but will anybody watch ?
Political ads , especially in swing states , are usually a “ nuisance best avoided rather than Must See TV , ” but viewers have tuned into the debates and conventions in record numbers this year , so maybe they 'll watch this , too .
Nielsen ratings will be one measure of success , said Ira Teinowitz in TVWeek , but the ad also needs to convert undecided voters , motivate Obama backers , and drive TV and water cooler talk Thursday .
Will it ?
Hard to say .
No candidate has done this since Ross Perot in 1992 , before the age of cable .
Call it “ Obama ’s $ 3.5 million gamble . ”
It ’s one he can afford , said the Los Angeles Times in an editorial .
Politicians do n’t run national network ads anymore because there ’s no need to sway voters in safe states like California or Texas .
But Obama has the cash , and this kind of exposure might “ run up his popular vote count nationwide . ”
That may seem unfair to John McCain , but “ nobody ever said politicians were good sports . ”
In an effort to keep citizens politically involved after the election , pro-marijuana activists will be holding an all - day symposium to train attendees on how to organize pro-legalization efforts in their communities .
Denver has been at the recent forefront of the issue , with one 2005 voter - approved ordinance that legalizes possession of up to an ounce of marijuana by adults over the age of 21 .
Another city initiative , passed in 2007 , makes prosecution for possession of small amounts of pot the “ lowest law enforcement priority ” for law enforcement .
The “ marijuana boot camp , ” as it ’s called , will take place Nov. 15 , according to the pro-legalization groups SAFER and Sensible Colorado :
Professionals will provide attendees with valuable information , training , and resources that can help YOU take action in your area to further the movement toward more rational marijuana laws in Colorado .
The event is slated from 9 a.m. – 5 p.m. at the Felix Pomponio Science Center , 3333 Regis Blvd. in Denver .
I do n’t have anything to say beside printing the title to this blog post I just happened across : “ McCain Loses Hastily Convened Fourth Presidential Debate With Lifesize Cardboard Obama . ”

Today in Lansing , MI Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama unveiled his energy plan and his campaign debuted a television ad that charged John McCain with being in the back pocket of big oil .
Obama ’s energy plan itself , is much the same as the one he proposed during the primary with a few minor but significant changes .
Obama now supports opening up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve .
Obama now says that he would use some light crude oil in the reserve , and replace it with heavier crude oil later , “ We should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve for less expensive crude , which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks . ”
This is an idea that Nancy Pelosi has been pushing the House , that Obama originally rejected .
Only July 7 Obama said , “ I have said and , in fact , supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve , but the strategic oil reserve I think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency . ”
I think that Obama should have stuck to his original position .
Just as it does n’t make sense to keep filling the Reserve , it makes even less sense to deplete the reserve for a couple of weeks of relief at the pump , then have to refill it with more expensive oil .
I criticized McCain ’s gas tax holiday , and this Democratic is also stupid .
It was born out of poll numbers and election year pressure .
Advertisements
The other new parts of Obama ’s plan are the emergency energy rebate .
Obama would rescind billions in tax breaks for the oil companies , and use the money to provide energy rebates $ 1,000 per couple and $ 500 per individual to the American people , and a use it or lose it provision for oil and gas leases on federal land , “ I also believe that in the short - term , as we transition to renewable energy , we can and should increase our domestic production of oil and natural gas .
But we should start by telling the oil companies to drill on the 68 million acres they currently have access to but have n’t touched .
And if they do n’t , we should require them to give up their leases to someone who will . ”
The nuts and bolts of the plan remain the same as the one that he touted during the primary , increased fuel efficiency and more hybrid cars , a cap and trade system to reduce greenhouse gases , a requirement for more electricity to come from renewable sources , and the creation of five million new jobs by investing in clean energy .
Obama also criticized McCain for selling himself to the oil companies , “ In fact , he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month , most of which came after he announced his plan for offshore drilling in a room full of cheering oil executives .
His initial reaction to the bipartisan energy compromise was to reject it because it took away tax breaks for oil companies .
And even though he does n’t want to spend much on renewable energy , he ’s actually proposed giving $ 4 billion more in tax breaks to the biggest oil companies in America – including $ 1.2 billion to Exxon - Mobil . ”
This criticism is also repeated in a new ad released by the Obama campaign this morning .
Here is the new ad :
Even with these minor strategic shifts by Obama on offshore drilling and the Strategic Reserve , the contrast between the two candidates remains stark .
McCain wants to keep doing what we are already doing on energy , with the addition of drilling for more oil , while Obama has a goal of eliminating our dependence on foreign oil in a decade .
One candidate has a comprehensive plan , while the other is offering cosmetic change .
That in a nutshell is the early story of this election between John McCain and Barack Obama .
You can read the full text of Obama ’s speech here .
I have to admit that while I eat pretty healthy at home , my weakness is at social gatherings : family parties , weddings , gatherings with friends , barbecues , eating out at restaurants .
I ’ve tried different strategies , with mixed success .
So before I went out last night ( for the FIFTH time in six nights ! ) , I asked my friends on Twitter ( follow me here ) for some of their best tips on eating healthy at social gatherings .
They responded with some great , common - sense tips .
While many of these are tips I ’ve tried before , it ’s good to be reminded of them .
And a couple I have n’t tried yet , so I now have a good arsenal of strategies at my disposal .
I thought you might find these tips useful .
All credit goes to Zen Habits readers on Twitter — thanks guys !
Please note that some of these tips might be a bit contradictory .
You should pick the tips that work best for you , and not look at this as a step - by - step guide to be adopted wholesale .
Eat before you go .
This was by far the most popular tip , and probably the most useful .
Fill up on healthy foods at home .
Place limits .
Try a 2 plate limit , and a 2 drink limit .
Plan ahead .
Find out the menu ahead of time and make healthy choices , before you go .
Drink lots of water and eat fruits and veggies .
You can eat as many veggies as you want without consuming many calories .
Just avoid dipping sauces and dressings .
Have a big salad before the main course .
Again , avoid too much dressing , and go for the lighter dressings .
Log what you eat , so you ’ll be more aware of it .
Avoid alcohol .
It ’s just empty calories .
You can have fun without alcohol — I do it all the time .
Bring your own .
If it ’s a potluck - style gathering , cook something healthy and bring it with you .
Just try to eat healthy most of the week , and relax when you are at social gatherings .
This is one of my favorite tips . :)
You do n’t need to eat healthy all the time .
This is the tip I usually follow , but you ’ve got to come up with other strategies when you ’re going to social gatherings almost every night of the week ( I could n’t help it this past week , but it ’s not my usual schedule ) .
What are your strategies for eating healthy ( or not ) when you ’re out at social gatherings ?

I refuse to believe that the media OR electorate will allow this to be stolen this time .
The narrative is STILL " This is breaking away for Obama . "
The polls are still widening the gap between Obama and McCain .
The alarms are sounding about the purged voters and the Acorn story BEING a fraud .
The Obama team began its process of fighting the now quadrennial Election Larceny by the Republicans .
I find myself living with a bizarre certitude of the righteous outcome .
You might even call it ...

Connoisseurs of campaign tactics tend to be a pretty cynical bunch , so they ’ll doubtless find much to admire in the adroit way Sen .
John McCain ’s camp has handled Sarah Palin since she came aboard the ticket .
Voters , who tend to nourish an inconvenient hunger for information , may be less impressed .
One suspects that sooner rather than later , some will begin to wonder why the GOP is insisting that Palin is entitled to be treated according to a double standard .
McCain ’s campaign manager , Rick Davis , deserved full marks for chutzpah , for example , when he told Fox News ’ Chris Wallace that Palin would not answer reporters ’ questions “ until the point in time when she ’ll be treated with respect and deference . ”
Deference ?
Respect and courtesy , maybe .
Everybody is entitled to those -- including candidates for office -- and journalists seldom look worse than when they forget that .
But deference ?
The president does not require deference from his media interlocutors , but the ambitious governor of Alaska does ?

Palin , Davis said , “ will do interviews , but she ’ll do them on the terms and conditions ” dictated by McCain ’s campaign -- which is to say , according to a standard that applies to no other candidate for office anywhere in the country .
( ABC ’s Charles Gibson will conduct the first Palin interview Thursday ; it will be interesting to see whether he agrees to preconditions . )
The McCain campaign ’s insistence on imposing a double standard for Palin is nowhere clearer than in the demand , voiced by many of the candidate ’s surrogates , that her religious affiliations and their implications be placed off - limits .
The GOP was on firmer ground when it made a similar demand with regard to her children , though it ’s safe to say that if Sen.
Barack Obama had appeared in Denver with his unmarried pregnant daughter and the father of her child , the religious right ’s outraged screams still would be echoing in the nation ’s ear .
Palin ’s religious convictions should be open to inquiry , not least because the McCain campaign so obviously welcomes the support of evangelicals who support the ticket because Palin believes as they do .
More important , Obama has been held to answer -- and rightly so -- for his connection to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and the pastor ’s intemperate views on everything from race to 9/11 .
Obama was forced to give a speech disassociating himself from Wright and finally to leave Wright ’s church .
Nobody seriously questioned the right of the media -- or , for that matter , the Illinois senator ’s political opponents -- to ask whether Obama agreed with what was being preached in the church he ’d chosen to join .
Similarly , no one turned a hair when Joe Biden was asked on national TV when he , as a Roman Catholic , believed life began .
McCain has been asked the same question .
Palin , apparently , operates in a parallel political universe -- or at least McCain ’s handlers would like to see that she does .

Less than a month ago , Palin sat in the pews at the Wasilla Bible Church , to which she and her family belong , and listened to a sermon by David Brickner , who heads Jews for Jesus , a group cited by the Anti-Defamation League for its “ aggressive and deceptive ” proselytizing of Jews .
Brickner said that Arab terrorism against the state of Israel was an expression of God ’s judgment on the Jewish people for their rejection of Christ .
After Brickner concluded his remarks , a special collection was taken up to support the sect ’s activities .
A spokesman for the McCain campaign said Palin does not agree with Brickner ’s views , but somehow it ’s the kind of question a candidate ought to be able to answer for herself .
Voters might also like to know whether Palin supports , as does her church , an upcoming conference that promises to change gays and lesbians into heterosexuals through the power of prayer .
That conference , by the way , is being put on by James Dobson ’s Focus on the Family , one of the national evangelical organizations that discovered a sudden enthusiasm for the GOP ticket when Palin joined .
Ingenious though it may be tactically , it ’s hard to imagine the Palin double standard enduring into the fall .
Campaign connoisseurs not withstanding , politics is n’t a sport , though it has at least one thing in common with the boxing ring -- you can run , but you ca n’t hide .

Democrat legacy Fifty million killed ; Bush legacy Fifty million liberated !
Vanity Opinion | Oct 26 , 2008 | Jim Robinson
Posted on by Jim Robinson
Democrat legacy : Fifty million innocent American babies killed ; Bush legacy : Fifty million citizens of Afghanistan and Iraq liberated !
Obama ( The One ) is the most extreme abortionist ever to run for president .
He will advance Planned Parenthood 's gruesome agenda and war ON America 's unborn .
He will appoint abortionist judges .
Abortion is his litmus test .
Killing babies his legacy .
Fifty million innocent Americans slaughtered is the American Holocaust .
It is the Democrat legacy .
Bush 's legacy is fighting for life and liberty .
He appoints conservative judges who interpret and abide by the constitution rather than implement the liberal agenda .
He projects America 's military power to defend and secure American freedom , America 's interests and freedom throughout the world .
McCain is pro-life , pro-liberty .
He will continue the Reagan / Bush pro-life , pro-liberty legacy .
Obama , the citizen of the world , will surrender in the war on terror .
He promises to slash our defence budget and decimate our military .
Obama 's legacy leaves America vulnerable and defenseless in a more and more threatening world .
The Democrat legacy also includes fifty million jobs lost to high taxes , over regulation , and a hostile environment to business and capitalism .
Why burden our industry with high taxes and crippling regulation ?
Why drive America 's industrial might overseas ?
Why would we replace America 's traditional and rightful capitalism and free enterprise with socialist Marxism ?
No thank you Mr. Obama .
Take your big tax , big spending , big government socialism and Marxism elsewhere !
Try Cuba or Venezuela !
Bush continued Reagan 's legacy of cutting taxes .
McCain will continue the Reagan , Bush , Republican tax cutting legacy .
Bush continued Reagan 's legacy of peace through superior firepower .
McCain will continue the Reagan , Bush , Republican legacy of a strong national defense .
Obama 's weakness would make us a second rate power .
Fifty million Americans without health insurance ?
Health care is a private sector free enterprise and should remain such .
If you think health care costs are high and service lousy now , wait until government gets its hands on it .
There is nothing in the constitution authorizing the government to seize control of private sector enterprise .
Universal health care is socialism and would ultimately destroy the industry .
Socialist health care does not work .
Socialism does not work .
America is a capitalist free enterprise society and should remain such .
Obama is a Marxist / socialist and his Marxist / socialist policies would destroy our health care system , our free economy and our freedom itself .
Why send 700 billion dollars per year overseas for oil ?
This too is a Democrat legacy .
High regulation , extreme environmentalism , continuing nonsensical Democrat blocks on drilling , refining , mining , and nuclear power is bankrupting America , crippling our economy and enriching / empowering our enemies .
Stop the Democrat nonsense !
Drill , baby , drill !
Fifty million mortgages at risk .
This also is a Democrat legacy .
Starting with the New Deal and expanded by Carter and Clinton , the federal program to make a market for selling and guaranteeing home mortgages has morphed into the monster that ate Cleveland .
And Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not just satisfied with Cleveland , they ate and destroyed our entire US economy !
And Obama and his neighborhood organizing pals at ACORN were right in the thick of it .
More Marxism , more Obama .
Wherever you find socialism / Marxism in America , you find Democrats , and you find Obama .
It 's like stepping in it .
No thanks !
I 'll take the Reagan , Bush , McCain , Republican Life , Liberty and free enterprise legacy for America , please !
Good gun control : hitting what you 're aiming at .

May I ping a few fellow freepers with Internet connections ?
...
May I also add that there are not fifty million without helthcare , ' cause even a darned illegal alien can go to an emergency room and get healthcare .
Obama and his goons lie ... they are democrats so this is their nromal modus operendi .
There may be fifty million without a healthcare insurance plan but they can BY LAW go to an emergency room and get healthcare , and the McCain / Palin approach will allow those who want to to have insurance .
Also , Obama is beyond a defender of abortion , he is a protector of infanticide of born alive struggling to breathe infants , as a means to empower his personal political capital .
Finally , Obama cannot give a tax reduction to 95 % of working families because only 50 to 55 % of working families are paying income taxes .
The liar counts a welfare check sent to someone paying FICA taxes as a tax reduction .
Smoke and mirrors are the Marxist way to gain power , then only the flames will be used .

That ’s right .
Margaret Sanger founded Planned Parenthood , and her goal was to curb the birth rate of the poor , especially the birth rate of poor black Americans .
She ’s a disgrace .
Planned Parenthood is a disgrace .
The Democrat party is a disgrace .
And Obama is a baby murdering , America - hating , Godless Marxist and treasonous coward and a disgrace to black America , to manhood and humankind !
It ’s extreme irony , indeed , that the vast majority of black Americans are falling for a man and a party whose greatest desire is to exterminate their race through abortion .
There ’s a reason why Planned Parenthood concentrates its abortion mills in inner city black neighborhoods .
Fifteen hundred black babies per day aborted by Planned parenthood !
The Democrat legacy : Destroy the family , destroy society , destroy free enterprise , genocide , socialism , Marxism .

Sarah Palin 's transformation
The life of a vice - presidential candidate may be gruelling , but it can also be glamorous - $ 150,000 glamorous .
The Republican National Committee has reportedly spent about that amount ( roughly £ 92,000 ) on Alaska Governor Sarah Palin 's wardrobe since she was chosen as John McCain 's running mate less than two months ago .
Alaska is a state where women are more commonly seen in Mukluk boots and heavy furs than stilettos and expensive tailored suits , but thrust into the national spotlight Mrs Palin has adopted a new look .
A self - professed adorer of high heels , she has sported a number of new styles on the campaign trail .
It looks as though Mrs Palin's " the heels are on , the gloves are off " comment was more firmly based in reality than was previously thought .
Swanky stores
It is not the first time a political candidate has come under scrutiny for spending large sums of dollars on improving his or her image .
THE BILL $ 75,062 spent at Neiman Marcus in Minneapolis $ 41,850 spent in St Louis $ 4,100 on make - up and hair consulting $ 4,902 at Atelier , a men 's clothing shop in New York $ 92 on a romper suit and hat with ears Senator Hillary Clinton 's expensive trouser suits provoked comment , while former presidential candidate John Edwards was criticised for his $ 400 haircuts .
Even Mr McCain's $ 500 Italian leather loafers have been noted , never mind his wife Cindy 's Republican National Convention outfit that magazine Vanity Fair valued at $ 300,000 ( thanks largely to a pair of hefty diamond earrings ) .
However , if this type of spending was poorly - received before , it may go down very badly indeed with voters in the present economic climate .
In the midst of a financial meltdown , those from what Mrs Palin called the " pro-America areas of this great nation " - the Middle America of Joe and Jane the Plumber - have been staying away from the stores .
It was always the intent that the clothing go to a charitable purpose after the campaign
McCain - Palin spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt Retail sales decreased by 1.2 % in September - the most dramatic drop since 2005 .
High - end stores ' sales have reflected this fall .
But the RNC , for its part , has been bucking the trend .
The party treated Mrs Palin to a one - day $ 75,000 shopping trip at swanky department store Neiman Marcus in Minneapolis .
A romper suit and hat with matching ears for Mrs Palin 's baby , Trig , was bought at another shop in the city for $ 92 .
The committee also dished out nearly $ 41,850 in St Louis , and $ 4,100 for make - up and hair consulting .
Altogether the RNC spent about $ 150,000 on clothing , hairstyling , make - up and other " campaign accessories " in September , after Mrs Palin was selected as Mr McCain 's running mate .
This adds up to more than double the average American household 's yearly income .
' Pantsuits and blouses ' Amanda Sanders , a celebrity adviser at New York Image Consultants , told the BBC News website that to the average person the price would seem " astronomical " .
She 's not a ' soccer mom ' any more - her new wardrobe says ' take me seriously '
Amanda Sanders
Celebrity image consultant
" Maybe her look could have been reached with $ 50,000 - $ 150,000 seems a little over the top ... especially when the American economy is in the toilet the way it is . "
" That 's , like , a new outfit every day from August to the election . "
However , she praises Mrs Palin 's new look as " very polished and sophisticated " apart from the odd fashion glitch such as knee - high boots , which Ms Sanders deems " inappropriate " for her role .
She speculates that the logic behind the makeover was to make Mrs Palin look less out of place beside the highly - groomed Mrs McCain and elegant Michelle Obama .
" The Republicans could n't have her look so Middle America when Cindy looked so high - end .
They wanted her to look polished and sophisticated like Cindy , " she said .
" She 's not a ' soccer mom ' any more - her new wardrobe says ' take me seriously ' .
They wanted her to look as ' Jackie O ' as Obama 's wife - I think that was important . "
The story could hardly have come at a worse time for the McCain campaign .
The public , and political pundits , have been closely monitoring the spending habits of the candidates and their partners since Wall Street began to falter .
Michelle Obama was criticised after the New York Post ran a story about her ordering lobster , Iranian caviar and champagne to her room at the Waldorf - Astoria hotel .
The paper later retracted the claim , admitting it was entirely false .
" With all of the important issues facing the country right now , it 's remarkable that we 're spending time talking about pantsuits and blouses , " said McCain spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt .
She added : " It was always the intent that the clothing go to a charitable purpose after the campaign . "

Australian girl who hid in cupboard for five years marries her ' captor '
A runaway schoolgirl in northern Australia who made world headlines for hiding in a cupboard for nearly five years while her parents believed she had been murdered , has married her ' captor ' .
And Natasha Ryan reportedly sold her wedding photos to a magazine for £ 77,440 ( AUS $ 200,000 ) - despite having yet to repay the £ 62,000 ( AUS $ 160,000 ) costs of the investigation into her disappearance and suspected murder .
Natasha , then 14 , of central Queensland , secretly moved in with the man she was banned from seeing in 1998 - and never left .
Even when she watched a police murder hunt for herself on television , she remained in hiding with boyfriend Scott Black , a milkman .
Runaway : Natasha Ryan married boyfriend Scott Black after hiding in a cupboard for five years
For four years she lived in semi- darkness , behind closed curtains and only twice ventured out in the middle of the night to breathe fresh air .
The couple 's love appeared to be doomed when the trial of a man who confessed to her murder was stopped when police told the judge : ' We have found Natasha alive and well . '
After a tip - off , police discovered her in a wardrobe at Mr Black 's home in Rockhampton , a mile from her family home .
Natasha , then 18 , returned to live with her mother , Jenny , and Mr Black later went to prison for a year for perjury .
They later moved in together and had a son , Corey , four .
On September 29 they exchanged wedding vows in their home town .
' I did n't notice anybody other than Scott and every so often , I 'd hear the celebrant 's voice break through , ' said Natasha , now 24 , told Australia 's Woman 's Day magazine .
' I did n't think about the past .
I was completely in the here and now .
' I 've never felt this beautiful or happy . '
Scott , 31 , told their guests : '
It 's been a long time coming .
Thanks to the support of our families and friends , we made it . '
Natasha 's gold wedding band read : ' Happy Days Always ' , Woman 's Day reported , adding that as her new husband slid the ring on to her finger , ' Natasha took a deep breath , and as she exhaled it seemed as if years of pain and recriminations were finally melting away . '
Mrs Ryan , while never forgetting the betrayal of her daughter allowing her to believe she was dead , said she had forgiven her .
' The wedding gives Natasha the opportunity to start afresh , ' she said .
Natasha added : ' I 'd like to think I can now stop being known as ' the girl in the cupboard ' . '
John Marto Martin , who owns Ferns Hideaway in Byfield where the wedding was held , told Australian media that the wedding was ' really happy ' .
' It was a family wedding with about 35 guests , ' he said .
' Natasha wore a white wedding gown and Scott had a suit .
There were six in the bridal party . '
He also revealed that the bride had struck a deal with magazine Woman 's Day for her wedding photos - and that Woman 's Day security attended the event , vetting guests to ensure they did not take pictures .
Both Natasha 's parents attended the wedding , but her father claimed he did not know where they were headed for the honeymoon .

An ad in yesterday 's Arizona Republic announced that on October 25 , the " former home of Sen. John & Cindy McCain " will be auctioned .
It 's the onetime central Phoenix digs of the GOP presidential nominee and family -- they moved not long ago to a luxury condo , and the house has since been remodeled , according to The Larsen Company , the group conducting the auction .
You can only tour the place by appointment , but here 's the description of the home at 7110 N. Central Avenue :
" This gracious , private residence is gated and secure on a sprawling 2.7 acre estate lot .
The home features 15,000 sq. ft. , 13 bedrooms , 14.5 baths and 7 car garage .

It is a time of great conflict .
Thirty years of dedicated fandom has allowed GEORGE LUCAS to expand his saga of heroic Jedi Knights and evil Galactic Empires to every form of media in the galaxy .
But expectations are high .
The eagerness of some developers to contribute to an iconic cultural milestone has resulted in games both triumphant and vile .
Throughout this turmoil , a loyal band of Gamers continues to strike a blow for the Old Republic , awaiting the day their victory will be complete ...
The same month principle photography finished on Return of the Jedi , winding his legendary saga down for the foreseeable future , George Lucas approached video game giant Atari with a proposal .
The Atari 2600 , launched just five months after Star Wars premiered , owned the relatively new home video game market .
Lucas wanted to diversify his company 's already - impressive portfolio .
It was a perfect fit .
LucasFilm Games split off from the main company in May 1982 , and immediately started developing for the more advanced Atari 5200 and Atari 800 consoles ... none of which were based on the Star Wars trilogy .
Exclusive license to produce Star Wars games would be sold to outside companies for years to come .
First up was the venerable board game company Parker Bros . , and rather than build a cart based on a five - year - old film , they decided to go with the three - year - old middle child instead .
Star Wars :
The Empire Strikes Back for the Atari 2600 puts players in a snowspeeder for the Battle of Hoth , fighting an unending march of Imperial Walkers headed straight for Echo Base .
Each AT - AT has to be shot forty - eight times before it vaporized , unless players luck into hitting a small glowing block that appears at random .
But the controls are responsive , your snowspeeder is genuinely speedy , and John Williams 's score shrinks down nicely to MIDI - sound size when the speeder glows with the power of The Force , rendering it temporarily invulnerable .
This was the first Star Wars video game , and given its limitations , a good one ... even if sales did n't reflect it .
Empire had the poor fortune of arriving right on the leading edge of the video game crash of ' 83 , helped in no small way by E.T. the Extra - Terrestrial , a dismal game based on the film by Lucas 's good friend , Steven Spielberg .
Parker Bros. took two more stabs with Jedi Arena in 1983 , a paddle - game that somehow made swinging a lightsaber around seem dull , and Star Wars : Return of the Jedi Death Star Battle in 1984 , an anemic re-creation of the Millennium Falcon 's assault on the second Death Star .
A third completed game , Ewok Adventures , went unreleased .
All quickly vanished , eclipsed by Atari 's own take on the series .
While LucasFilm Games stepped away from the franchise , Atari stepped up in a big way .
Fresh off creating Gravitar , his first - ever game project , in - house Atari designer Mike Hally drew the job of building a Star Wars cabinet for the now - booming arcade market .
Vector graphics were his preferred medium , but a high - profile game like this needed something more .
Hally found more when he lifted the game engine from a 1981 project called Warp - Speed , designed solely to help develop 3D vector images ... a big jump from the 2D plane everyone was used to .
Suddenly , Hally had a 3D shooter on his hands .
His game would take players for a first - person spin in Red 5 , Luke Skywalker 's personal X - Wing , for an on -rails assault on the Death Star straight out of the movie .
Released in 1983 and simply called Star Wars , it became one of the most popular arcade titles in history , the first Atari game to include voice acting , and one of the few Star Wars games to feature the original actors .
Digitized sound clips of Luke , Obi-Wan Han Solo , R2 - D2 , and Lord Vader himself ( commenting that the Force was strong in you ) float past your head in the sit - down cockpit cabinet .
Players light up TIE fighters , blast gun turrets and towers rising up from the horizon , face off against Vader and shoot through the obstacle - course trench , just like the movie , and few things beat the rush of blowing up the Death Star real good .
When the Imperials finally wear down your shields and take you out , Obi-Wan Kenobi sends you off in style : " The Force will be with you ... always . "
Start to finish , it is pure fanboy wish fulfillment .
Blame and guilt are the most tragic and hurtful results of today ’s popular beliefs in mind - body wellness .
No matter how many times research has shown that a “ cancer personality ” is a myth , the belief persists that a negative outlook , depression , anger , stress or fatigue can increase our risks for cancers ... and that a positive mental outlook will keep us well .
The latest study in the news depicts one of the most common fallacies of logic and research biases , one often used to convince us of a correlation that does n’t really exist .
See if you can spot it in this news article , reviewed by a Harvard Medical School associate clinical professor :
A Sunny Disposition May Protect Against Breast Cancer
Women who are happy and optimistic appear to be less likely to get breast cancer than their gloomier counterparts , according to a case - control study ...
Ronit Peled , Ph.D. , of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev here , and colleagues reported online in BMC Cancer ...
To explore the issue , they undertook a case - control study in women ages 25 to 45 — 255 had been diagnosed with breast cancer at one of six centers in Israel and 367 were healthy and selected from one of two medical centers ...
All participants were interviewed with the Brief Symptom Inventory — evaluating depression , anxiety , and happiness and optimism — and a Life Event Questionnaire , in which they were asked to recall major stressful life events and their feelings .
Breast cancer patients were asked for information from before their diagnosis ( mean time from diagnosis to interview was one year ) .
Breast cancer patients reported significantly higher depression scores ( P=0.04 ) and significantly lower happiness and optimism scores ( P=0.00 ) compared with the controls .
A greater percentage of breast cancer patients had been exposed to more than one negative life event compared with the controls ( 52 % versus 43.9 % ) , but the difference fell short of statistical significance ( P=0.065 ) ... " general feelings of happiness and optimism can play a protective role against the disease . "
The researchers were unable to identify the mechanism of action through which negative life events may influence breast cancer ...
The biases which make this not a fair test of the hypothesis go beyond the obvious methodological problems , such as that the participants were not randomized , the associated relative risks ( especially expressed as odds ratio ) were untenable , and that the authors turned a correlation into a causation by concluding that happiness and optimism could help prevent cancer .
In this study , they administered questionnaires to women newly diagnosed ( average within 7 months of diagnosis ) with breast cancer at six major oncology units in Israel and to a control group of disease - free women visiting a small outpatient clinic for routine care .
The breast cancer patients “ were asked to report about their feelings prior to diagnosis . ”
The authors reported that the women with cancer had slightly higher scores of depression and anxiety .
Among specific stressful life events recalled by the women with cancer , there was no significant difference to the control group .
But a computer regression model found a 62 % odds ratio associated with having a cumulative number of life events and cancer , while a 25 % lower odds ratio of general happiness feelings associated with the healthy women compared to those with cancer .
This led the authors to carefully conclude that “ experiencing more than one meaningful life event ( severe and / or mild to moderate ) is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women . ”
In their introduction , the authors said that the relationship between “ body and mind ” is an old issue , since H.L.
Snow reported back in 1893 that more breast cancer patients had experienced a traumatic life event .
Since then , the belief has grown to include an association between cancers and chronic diseases with depression , anxiety and personality types , despite the fact empirical evidence continues to be lacking .
Before we look at a sampling of the evidence which has repeatedly failed to support the ' cancer personality ' myth , did you see the bias in this study ?
Recall bias
If you ’ve just been diagnosed with cancer or are facing any serious health problem , it ’s understandable to feel more depressed and anxious than someone healthy .
That does not mean that those feelings contributed to your cancer .
More importantly , it ’s common to ask “ why me ? ” and search for an explanation .
When you look back on your life , you ’re more likely to remember being exposed to things or doing things you believe might have caused you to become sick .
Our subjective feelings and memories are vulnerable to “ recall bias ” and this phenomenon is problematic in epidemiological studies , especially “ retrospective studies ” that look back in time , trying to identify correlations ( risk factors ) among people already diagnosed with a disease .
Our memories are imperfect and unreliable , regardless of how certain we may feel them to be .
The examples are prolific in the medical literature , such as people with diabetes will remember eating more sweets as a kid than someone who believes themselves to be healthy , or those with cancer will be more likely to remember being exposed to electromagnetic fields from power lines , even when neither are really true .
In a classic 1991 epidemiological study , women in the Nurses Health Study had been asked in 1982 to remember how often they colored their hair and their sun tanning .
When the same women were re-examined years later , those diagnosed with melanoma were more likely to report remembering tanning ( which they believed a major risk factor for melanoma ) , where there was no increase in their memory of hair coloring .
This bias in epidemiological research was examined by Eman Hassan at the Department of Health Care and Epidemiology at the University of British Columbia in Canada , in an article in a 2006 issue of the Internet Journal of Epidemiology .
Recall of information is unreliable and inherently inaccurate , he reminded researchers and medical professionals .
As he noted , research has shown that 20 % of critical details of an event are irretrievable after just one year , and 50 % are irretrievable after 5 years .
Not only do we forget things , but “ memory tends to distort perception in systematic ways , ” he said .
Also , “ repeated retrieval of already stored events may add new information as facts and thus events are re-stored in the brain in an altered fashion . ”
Past events have a way of being rewritten in our minds .
“ People with a disease tend to think harder about their prior exposures than disease free people , ” professor Hassan wrote .
“ The presence of disease is presumed to act as a stimulus that affects both the patient 's perception of the causes and his search for possible exposure to a hypothesized risk factor . ”
The more significant or scary the condition is perceived to be , the more likely recall bias can be expected , he said .
In contrast , people among the healthy control group , are more likely to under report their exposures or behaviors , because they ’re less likely to remember them or see them as being relevant .
The end result is that the relative risk of the exposure is inflated in these studies comparing the two groups and looking for correlations .
New mothers of babies with serious congenital problems are naturally filled with guilt and seeking answers , and numerous studies have shown that as they desperately look back trying to recall something that might have caused their babies to be born with problems , they are more likely to over report exposures .
The body of evidence has shown that studies using actual medical records and clinical data are considerably more accurate than studies using self - reported information , such as that recalled by parents of children with childhood diseases .
Recall bias is most pervasive in case - control studies , he said , but can also effect randomized controlled clinical trials when the participants are not blinded to whether they ’re in the intervention or control group .
While researchers can make efforts to design studies to minimize recall bias , the fact remains : “ Research including reported data about past experiences will always be threatened by the limitations of the individual 's memory and the influence of disease / exposure status on the recalling process in humans . ”
The “ cancer personality ” myth
We ’ve already examined that the soundest studies continue to show that a positive mental outlook and surrounding oneself with upbeat people does n’t make cancer patients live longer , nor does feeling sad or angry shorten survival .
The largest study of its kind , a randomized clinical trial of patients with head and neck cancers published last December in the journal Cancer , found “ no statistically significant association between well - being and survival . ”
Their results held even after factoring for every possible confounding factor , such as stage of cancer , smoking , marital status and support , and income .
Despite exhaustively attempting to show a link between mental outlook and prognosis , they could find “ no support for the hypothesis that negative emotional well - being predicts poorer survival . ”
The New Age belief in a mind - body connection has become so popular , that the " cancer personality " myth persists despite the body of evidence , and people believe that chronic diseases are under their control and be prevented by doing everything right and visualizing wellness and positive energy .
Perhaps , learning how diligently researchers have studied and debunked this belief , more people can be empowered with the knowledge that can help free them from guilt and blame .
Researchers in The Netherlands , for example , looked at 9,705 women enrolled in a breast cancer surveillance program in 1989 - 90 .
The women were given personality questionnaires and then followed for 13 years to see if there was any link between personality traits and those who later got breast cancer compared to those who did n’t .
The researchers published their results in the January 2008 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute .
They could found no correlation between any personality factor and a higher risk for breast cancer , with or without adjusting for medical risk factors .
Note that this is a stronger study because it was n’t looking backwards ( retrospective ) among a group of people already with cancer and trying to find a correlation , but was prospective .
Another interesting prospective study examined 29,595 twins enrolled in the Swedish Twin Registry .
They all completed the Eysenck Personality Inventory test , which measured their degree of neurotic tendencies ( levels of anxiety , self confidence , depressive outlook , obsessive - compulsiveness , phobias , etc. ) and extroversion , when they were enrolled in 1973 .
They were then followed through 1999 for six different types of cancers : hormone - related organ cancers , virus - related and immune - related cancers , digestive organ cancers ( excluding liver ) , respiratory organ cancers , cancers in other sites , and all cancer sites .
The researchers could find no correlation between the personality traits and risks for any cancer group .
It might seem intuitively correct that feeling depressed , grief and exhaustion could lower our immune system defenses and make us more vulnerable to cancer , but clinical research has not been able to support this fear .
In another prospective study of 8,527 people in the Copenhagen City Heart Study , they had been examined in 1991 - 1994 and evaluated for their degree of depressive feelings and exhaustion .
After about 8.6 years , the researchers compared the 976 people who got cancers to those who did n’t .
They found those with the highest levels of exhaustion had a 20 % lower risk for developing cancer at all sites , a 36 % lower risk for developing smoking - related cancers , and about half the risk of developing virus and immune - related cancers .
And no significant difference was found for cancers related to alcohol consumption or hormones .
They simply were unable to find any support for the hypothesis that fatigue and depression , as measured in the vital exhaustion index , increased the risk for cancers .
Personality , grief or depression do not make you more vulnerable to cancer , said Dr. Jimmie Holland , M.D. , a psychiatric oncologist at Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center in New York , and author of The Human Side of Cancer .
In the chapter , “ The Tyranny of Positive Thinking , ” she wrote that society was placing an undue and inappropriate burden on patients that seemed to come out of popular beliefs about a mind - body connection .
I would find patients coming in with stories of being told by well meaning friends , " I 've read all about this - if you got cancer , you must have wanted it . "
Others said , " I 've been told that my personality must have caused my cancer and I guess I just did n't handle stress right in my life . "
Even more distressing was the person who said , " I know I have to be positive all the time and that is the only way to cope with cancer - but it 's so hard to do .
I know that if I get sad , or scared or upset , I am making my tumor grow faster and I will have shortened my life . "
This pop psychology fills books , tabloids and talk shows , she wrote , and comes from an interest in mind - body connection .
“ It is important that people know that research simply does not back up these ideas , ” she said .
Obviously , having a rational personality and seeking appropriate and timely medical care when you have significant suspicious symptoms is important , but the idea that people can give themselves cancer or cause their own cancer from negative thoughts , internalized anger , or attitudes is not based on facts .
As she wrote :
Studies do not support the myths about psychological causes of cancer and the role of emotions in tumor growth .
The mind - body connection is fascinating because people hold such strong beliefs about it .
I have come to feel that it is very much like religion .
There are people who are " believers " and all the data in the world could n't shake their faith .
" Nonbelievers " simply are those who would not likely believe in the mind - body connection , even if the data were produced .
This belief is the source of the common response to blame the victims , though , and used to conclude when something bad happens to someone that they must have brought it on themselves .
It ’s a psychological method , she said , that allows us to say to ourselves :
" Well , it could n't happen to me -- it was his own fault . "
It produces a false sense of security that we can prevent events that are actually beyond our control .
So rule number one in coping is : " Do n't believe you brought cancer on yourself . "
The research does not show that either personality or how you handle stress in your life raises risk of developing cancer .
This is one of the myths that makes coping more difficult these days .
Rule number two is : " Do n't believe that you have to have a positive attitude all the time and that sadness or worry will shorten your survival . "
This tyranny of positive thinking is also related to the " mind over matter " ideas of our society .
Things like cancer , diseases of aging and death often just happen , and dutifully following some ideal diet , lifestyle or mind - body wellness modality cannot change that .
Rather than letting that be a scary thought , it ’s empowering knowledge that can free us from the tyranny of living obsessed by fear of dying or from being taken advantage of by those promising optimal wellness .
Science can help you enjoy living life to the fullest and have a lot more fun doing it , just being you .

The sharp decline in the stock market and its volatility dramatically make the point .
More important if less visible , the flow of credit through the banking system and the financial markets is seriously impaired -- even in part frozen .

Prosecutors dropped charges on Friday morning , as expected , against the bicyclist who was shoved off his bike in July by a police officer in Times Square .
The confrontation between the cyclist , Christopher Long , and a New York City police officer , Patrick Pogan , was captured on amateur video and circulated widely over the Internet .
Mr. Long , 29 , had been charged with assault , resisting arrest and disorderly conduct on July 25 after Officer Pogan wrote in his report that Mr. Long had been weaving in and out of traffic and that he had deliberately hit the officer with his bicycle .
But video recorded by an onlooker soon surfaced on YouTube , showing Officer Pogan lowering his shoulder and shoving Mr. Long off his bike on Seventh Avenue at 46th Street as Mr. Long tried to steer out of the way .
( Officer Pogan was stripped of his badge and gun and placed on desk duty pending the completion of an investigation into his conduct . )
Mr. Long , who appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court on Friday morning , wearing a plaid blue shirt and gray slacks , seemed to shy away from the attention and gave only a brief statement outside the courthouse .
“ I ’m just relieved the prosecution ’s over , ” he said .
“ I ’m going to go back to normalcy . ”
He added : “ This is n’t the first time that we ’ve clearly demonstrated police misconduct and brutality , and people are prosecuted .
I ’m just relieved that the prosecutors did take steps to stop the prosecution . ”
Mr. Long has seemed to attract a bit of a cult following .
Several people who have ridden in the Critical Mass bike rides — which Mr. Long was participating in when he was pushed , and which for years have had a troubled relationship with the police — showed up in court and applauded when the judge ordered the case dismissed .
A court officer quickly quieted them down .
One of the supporters had a camcorder and was taping Mr. Long as he walked through the lobby of the courthouse , but again , court officers quickly intervened and demanded that the footage be erased .
Laurie Mittelmann , 19 , participates regularly in Critical Mass and was at the courthouse today to support Mr. Long .
As Mr. Long walked from a horde of reporters , she told him goodbye and added , “ Cool hanging with you . ”
She said Mr. Long has attracted a groundswell of support “ because we are a community and our community is made up of activists and people who care . ”
She added , “ We get excited . ”
CLARKSTON , Georgia ( CNN ) -- James Yarsiah listened to his college classmates discuss whether the civics component of the new U.S. naturalization test -- which prospective citizens can start taking Wednesday -- is more challenging than its predecessor .
Students in a government course at Georgia Perimeter College examine the old and new citizenship tests .
Are new conceptual questions such as , " What does the Constitution do ? " more difficult than old queries like " What is the Constitution ? "
Is a question with a range of acceptable answers , such as the new " What is one reason colonists came to America ? " preferable to the old " Why did the Pilgrims come to America ? "
Yarsiah , a Liberia native who plans to seek U.S. citizenship , waited until the end of the discussion at Georgia Perimeter College to pipe up .
" I 'm just going to study for it , take the test and move on , " the 20 - year - old said , drawing classmates ' laughter .
" The new one is not that much harder because of concepts and stuff .
You still have to study . "
But some in Professor Robert King 's American Government class , which examined sample questions of the old and the new civics tests at CNN .
com 's request Monday , had other opinions on how immigrants who were n't raised to speak English -- or even U.S. citizens -- might fare on the new version .
Many preferred the new test , which the government says includes more meaningful questions , such as those that involve a concept of , or critical thinking about , civics or history .
The new civics list , a pool of 100 possible questions for a test of up to 10 , omits the old " How many stars are there on our flag ? " and " Name the amendments that guarantee or address voting rights . "
Taking their place are questions like : " There are four amendments to the Constitution about who can vote .
Describe one of them , " and " What is one responsibility that is only for United States citizens ? "

Old test 's questions and answers
" It 's more about really knowing something that you would get from living here ... rather than just reading about it and being a bookworm , " said Joey Hornbuckle , 17 , of Newnan , Georgia .
Others , including Ethiopia native Anteneh Workneh , addressed an issue that immigrant advocates have raised : Conceptual questions and answers might require a higher level of education and greater English - language dexterity .
He compared one question found on both tests -- " The House of Representatives has how many voting members ? " -- with a new question : " Why do some states have more representatives ? "
" The first one is a fact .
They 're going to quote the number : 435 , " Workneh , 25 , said .
" But the other one , you have to know more definitions of the words . "
But classmate Simon Reiter said if applicants " do n't ... know it , that does n't mean they should get a passing grade . "
" I think overall [ the test is good ] because it seems like it would make them more involved in the U.S. community , " Reiter , 19 , said .
The change
The old test will take a year to vanish .
Anyone who applied for naturalization by Tuesday can choose either test if they take it by October 1 , 2009 .
After that , only the new test will be given , according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services .
Anyone applying from Wednesday onward cannot take the old test .
Like the new civics exam , the old draws from a pool of more than 95 questions .
Both ask applicants up to 10 questions , with applicants needing six correct to pass .
The test is not multiple - choice ; applicants must know the answer directly and say it .
Both exams , given orally , are part of a larger naturalization test in which applicants also take English reading and writing exams .
The whole test is one of the steps permanent legal residents take to be naturalized .
USCIS was on pace to receive more than 500,000 citizenship applications for a 12 - month period starting in October 2007 .
An applicant 's $ 675 fee allows for a test and one re-test , if necessary .
Some questions on the old civics test were kept .
But many added items require applicants to learn more about U.S. history and citizenship , USCIS says .
" What we 're against is rote memorization of trivial and arbitrary facts that have no impact in a citizen 's life or do not cover fundamental concepts of American democracy , " Alfonso Aguilar , chief of USCIS 's citizenship office , said last year .
USCIS , which posts the questions , answers and study materials online , also says the new test is n't harder and that the English necessary is at a high - beginning level .
Adult educators and community organizations helped with piloting and revisions , USCIS says .
Before the questions were unveiled last year , more than 6,000 citizenship - seekers volunteered to take a pilot .
More than 92 percent passed on the first try -- better than the 84 percent first - try passing rate for the regular test at the time , USCIS says .
Immigrant advocates : English , civics programs under - resourced
Flavia Jimenez of the New Americans Initiative , a citizenship program of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights , said it was important to note the pilot takers were volunteers .
" Any individual who would self - select to take an exam is by definition better capable and probably educated enough to do this without help , " Jimenez , NAI 's program director , said .
She said some new questions put people with lower levels of education and English skills at a disadvantage .
Community groups that help immigrants prepare may need to explain certain concepts in their native languages and then work on English to express the answer , she said .
She said preparing some applicants for the concepts will require more time , straining under - resourced English and civics programs .
Alice Barrett , who instructs a citizenship class in Chamblee , Georgia , said the old test appears more straightforward but the new study materials will be helpful .
She taught the old test through Tuesday 's deadline ; she 'll switch when a new class cycle starts .
" We have been encouraging students to sign up for the old test " because the nonprofit that runs the class was still digesting the new material , she said .
Sue Colussy , program director for immigration services at Catholic Charities Atlanta , said she understood the government 's argument , but the more conceptual test will be more difficult , especially for the elderly .
She said many American citizens " could n't pass the [ old ] civics test . "
" This new test is just going to widen that gap between the person who passes the test and the average American , who does n't have a clue , " she said .

Yet critics like Mr. Crouch observe that no matter how thoroughly black iconoclasts have embraced the word , intending to deflate its impact -- as Richard Pryor did in the 1980's and Chris Rock did in the 1990's -- the word retains its sting .
Mr. Crouch also deplores the coarsening that comes with its unhesitant use .
'' Men and women say things to each other in private , at the dinner table , that they 're not going to say to somebody in public , '' he said .
'' Now if you get to the point where that becomes chic , the private thing is said in public , then you 're going down a decadent road . ''
None of that , the filmmakers say , persuades them that any word should be stricken from discussion .
'' That 's the crux of the issue :
Why do n't we talk about the stuff that 's hanging in the air ? '' asked Ms. Echegoyan , a Bronx native who has worked in Hollywood for more than a decade .
'' Nothing is going to get better unless you can speak your mind . ''
Both Mr. Williams , who grew up in North Carolina and Brooklyn , and Ms. Echegoyan say they are disturbed by the knee - jerk reactions dictated by contemporary political correctness .
When the Eddie Murphy comedy '' Trading Places ' ' is shown on television , they observed , a scene has been deleted in which the character played by the actor Don Ameche uses the slur in explaining that he would never let Mr. Murphy 's character run his company .
'' That 's a critical scene , and it 's been edited out , '' Mr. Williams said .
'' There 's a real danger in doing that .
If you can say a word never existed , you can say Jim Crow never existed . ''

Cannibal cult mother who skinned son and made him eat his own flesh gets 9 years in jail
A cannibal cult mother who tortured her son in a locked cellar while relatives skinned him and forced him to eat his own flesh has been jailed for nine years .
Klara Mauerova , 31 - a member of a sinister religious cult and her sister Katerina led the sickening torture of her eight - year - old son Ondrej and his ten year - old brother Jakub .
A court in Brno in Czech Republic heard how relatives partially skinned Ondrej and forced him to eat his own flesh .
Klara Mauerova , right , has been jailed for nine years for abusing her sons
The judge also jailed Katerina , 35 , for ten years for her role in the sickening abuse .
The two boys had told judges how their mother and relatives had stubbed cigarettes out on their bare skin , whipped them with belts , and tried to drown them .
They were also sexually abused and forced to cut themselves with knives .
The terrified youngsters said they were kept in cages or handcuffed to tables and made to stand in their own urine for days .
Klara Mauerova , far left , and fellow torturer Barbara Skrlova are pictured with Klara 's sons Jakub , 10 , foreground , and Ondrej , 8
The sick sisters - both members of a weird religious cult - refused to reveal why they tortured the brothers .
But state prosecutor Zuzana Zamoravcova said : ' Their aim was to make the boys blindly serve their religious goals . '
Judge Pavel Goth said as he sentenced the women : ' Their aim was to create a person with a completely broken will .
Ondrej and Jakub were repeatedly psychologically and physically tyrannised and held in locked rooms . '
Mauerova 's sister Katerina was jailed for ten years for her part in the torture
Another defendant , 34 - year - old Barbora Skrlova , was also jailed for five years for her part in the torture .
Three others who took part in the abuse were also given jail terms .
Hana Basova , 28 , and Jan Skrla , 25 , were sentenced to seven years each while another man , Jan Turek , was jailed for five years .
Skrlova had posed as an innocent 13 - year - old girl when police arrived to free the boys .
She later ran away to Norway but was traced earlier this year by Czech police who brought her back to face trial .
Barbara Skrlova , seen here in a beanie hat , is pictured after her arrest in Norway .
She posed as a 13 - year - old girl to escape capture
Mauerova at first admitted abusing her children but she said she had been manipulated by her sister Katerina and Skrlova .
The sick abuse was discovered when a neighbour installed a TV baby monitor to keep watch on his new daughter .
But it picked up the signal from an identical monitor next door showing one of the victims beaten , naked and chained in a cellar .
Mauerova had installed it so she could gloat over her victims ' suffering from the comfort of her kitchen .
The defendants are expected to launch an appeal .
Earlier this week , I debated Portfolio magazine finance blogger Felix Salmon about the merits of letting Lehman Brothers fail .
Unlike almost everyone else in the world , I continue to support the decision not to rescue Lehman .
Felix is an apostate from the heterodox position .
In his view , the turmoil we ’ve seen in the financial markets since Lehman declared bankruptcy demonstrates that we should have rescued Lehman .
I wo n’t rehearse the entire argument here .
( You can read the transcript of our debate of Felix ’s blog . )
Instead , wanted to respond to a clever new argument Felix raised yesterday .
The gist of it is that the bankruptcy of Lehman contributed additional moral hazard rather than instilling market discipline .
Here ’s how Felix explains it :
If Treasury had bailed out Lehman , there would always have been the chance that it would n't bail out the next bank to get into difficulties -- just as the bailout of Bear Stearns did n't mean that Lehman was safe .
But after Treasury let Lehman fail , no further failures could be allowed , and indeed one of the main functions of the TARP bill was to make government bailouts much easier .
People like Carney , then , who care deeply about moral hazard , should probably wish that Lehman had been bailed out , rather than be happy that it was n't .
It ’s hard not to admire that kind of intellectual jujitsu .
Unfortunately , it ’s way off base .
While the apparent adoption of a no more bank failures policy will indeed have serious costs — banks will make riskier loans and engage in riskier trades , investors and counterparties will be less vigilant , and resources that could be used productively will be diverted into the perceived safety of government sponsored banking — these would all have been worse if the government had bailed out Lehman Brothers .
Lehman was the sick man of Wall Street , with a balance sheet black hole that rivals AIG’s .
If Lehman could be rescued , anyone could .
The failure of Lehman demonstrated that there was a some vague point of massive insolvency beyond which Hank Paulson would not cross .
And , according to his recent comments to the New York Times , he continues to stand by that position .
This at least puts some limits on the massive risks created by the various bailouts .
Lots of people changed their view about Lehman ’s bankruptcy in the last few weeks .
We wo n’t be at all surprised if lots of people change their mind again , once we learn the true costs and benefits of letting a failed firm actually fail .
With so many people facing mortgage strain , credit crunch , and general economic stress , mortgage assistance and credit repair places are popping up all over .
Some of these places really are legitimate .
Unfortunately , there are a lot of groups out there which are scams or will charge you large sums for services you could have gotten at nonprofits .
Two Warning Signs
1 . They charge for the service .
Many credit and loan counseling agencies out there are run by nonprofits are charge little or nothing for their assistance .
Before paying , look into other options .
At best they ’re simply charging for what you might get elsewhere for free .
At worst , they ’re a fly - by - night scam .
2 . It sounds to good to be true .
If a group offers to repair your credit in a few months , or get payments on your $ 350,000 mortgage down to $ 200 / month , or eliminate your credit card debt–and they charge–run away .
It is possible to negotiate with credit card companies , mortgage companies , etc , for lower payments perhaps even lower interest rate .
And counseling can help you out with that .
But if what they ’re promising sounds too good to be true , then it probably is .
Neither of these signs is conclusive proof that something wrong with the group .
But they ’re both good reasons to look elsewhere .
You can also check out any group at the Better Business Bureau and you should be able to find out if others have reported problems .
But lack of an entry / complaint does n’t prove legitimacy .
Four Non-Profit Options
CNN recent suggested four non-profit options for people facing mortgage / credit / financial problems :
1. The Homeownership Preservation Foundation .
As their name suggests , this group is primarily concerned with helping people pay their mortgages .
You can call 1-888-995-HOPE ( 4673 ) and get a counselor who works with you as long as you need .
They can also assist you in finding resources and groups for other financial issues , so if you ’re worried about credit card debt and other options are n’t working out , give them a call .
2. SCORE .
SCORE provides financial counseling to small businesses .
While you may not think of yourself as a small business owner , you might qualify in some fashion .
For example , if you ’re a SAHM who tutors or you earn part of your income through blogging , you may be eligible .
They have options to meet in person and counsel by e-mail .
3. Avvo. Avvo.com offers free legal advice from actual , vetted lawyers .
You can post questions and often get several responses .
So if you ’re wondering whether an old debt still needs to be paid , or whether what someone told you about credit collection is true , you can find out .
It ’s a great alternative to Yahoo Answers , message boards , and blogs .
4. Credit Unions .
Many credit unions offer special assistance for their members .
Since credit unions can be found all over the US , you can try finding one in your local area and asking what they offer .
It might be worth joining .
Other
You may be able to find more options in your area by asking your church or religious organization ( preferably someone in leadership who can recommend a place which has helped other members ) , your bank , your local Better Business Bureau site .
The first two might even offer credit counseling .
The BBB for my area has a directory which allows you to find organizations in a category and check out their rating .

From TIME :
I am not normally of the view that endorsements mean much in Presidential politics .
But Colin Powell ’s endorsement of Obama today is a real sledgehammer blow to the already staggering McCain campaign .
Not just because a Powell endorsement shores up Obama ’s shaky foreign policy bona fides , but even more because of the content of Powell ’s remarks on Meet the Press .
The General showed he still knows how to launch a brutal offense .
Powell ’s remarks were an across the board indictment of the McCain campaign .
He threw a subtly delivered but perfectly targeted series of chops at each of the the major fractures of the shaky McCain campaign ; the Palin choice , the dark tone of the campaign , the Helter Skelter antics at the onset of the economic crisis .
As a great McCain admirer , I am sad to say it , but the truth is the video of Powell ’s endorsement will boil across You Tube and do great damage in these closing days of the campaign .
Along with their daily horse race numbers , Gallup is also tracking how many voters say they ’ve already voted , either by absentee or early voting in their states .
As of today , the percentage of registered voters is at 10 % who say they ’ve already voted .
Bear in mind that not all registered voters vote — in fact a lot of them do n’t .
So the percentage of the 2008 electorate that has already cast a ballot is certainly higher than 10 % .
Obama 's stop at a diner in Fayetteville , N.C. underscores the continued resistance of some voters to his candidacy — and his identity .
' Socialist , ' ' Muslim ' — Ugly reception for Obama
Barack Obama 's stop at Cape Fear BBQ and Chicken in Fayetteville , N.C. , this afternoon underscored the continued resistance of some voters to his candidacy — and his identity .
The trip , according to a pool report , offered “ some powerful and at times ugly interaction . ”
Campaigning in a traditionally Republican state , the Democratic nominee found lots of supporters of John McCain , at least one woman who believes the Illinois senator is a " closet Muslim " — and another who repeatedly shouted “ Socialist . ”

The following is a compilation of pool reports from print , TV and wire reporters who accompanied Obama to the diner :
Obama arrived at the barbecue joint around 12:30 p.m. , where an older and majority white clientele of several dozen were eating lunch after church services .
Many patrons applauded as he walked into the diner , but Diane Fanning , 54 , began yelling “ Socialist , socialist , socialist — get out of here ! ”
Obama did not look directly at her , as she was across the diner , but it was loud enough that he most likely heard her .
The gentleman next to Fanning , Lenox Bramble , 76 , flashed an angry look at her .
“ Be civil , be courteous , ” he admonished her .
Another woman , Cecilia Hayslip , 61 , yelled back at Fanning ( per Reuters ) , “ At least he ’s not a warmonger ! ”
Bramble told Reuters ’ pooler that he was n’t voting for Obama because he did n’t think he had enough experience .
Bramble ’s wife , Kit , 75 , said after meeting Obama , “ He was very nice , ” but added she ’d been a conservative Republican since Barry Goldwater ’s era and said she would n’t vote for Obama .
Fanning said she ’d heard that former Secretary of State Colin Powell had endorsed Obama but said that “ Colin Powell is a RINO , R - I - N - O , Republican In Name Only . ”
Later , Obama came to the long table where Fanning and other members of a local First Presbyterian church were gathered .
He held out his hand to her and asked , “ How are you , ma’am ? ” but she declined to shake his hand .
Fanning asked Obama about a North American union , and Obama responded : “ Well , you know , I am opposed to it if it were happening .
But it does n’t seem to be actually be happening .
The truth of the matter is there is no plans .
I ’ve talked to a lot of people , including folks down in Texas .
There ’s no plan to create a common government between Mexico , U.S. and Canada .
That ’s just not … that ’s just not happening .
I know some people have been hearing rumors about it .
But as far as I can tell , that ’s just not something that ’s happening .
We would never give up our sovereignty in that way .
Any other questions ?
In an interview , Fanning said , “ I still think he ’s a closet Muslim . ”
Obama spoke at length with many of the others parishioners at the long banquet table and got a much friendlier reception as he spoke about health care , taxes and Social Security .
Fanning told your pooler , “ Some of ‘em are just nicer than I am .
I know how some of ‘ em think . ”
But several of her fellow churchgoers said their support was genuine .
Betty Waylett , 76 , told Obama , “ You ’re doing a great job . ”
She told your pooler that she is a Republican but that she will vote for Obama because she likes the way he speaks and his manner .
Waylett , who is white , said Obama ’s race is not a factor .
“ I never thought about it one way or the other . ”
Pastor Randal Bremer , also at the table , said Obama told him , “ Whether you vote for me or not , I ’ll need your prayers . ”
“ I ’m very impressed by his ability to meet people on a down - to - earth level , ” Bremer said in an interview .
He said that he would pray for Obama but that he planned to vote for McCain , mostly because he prefers smaller government and McCain ’s position on the Iraq war .
He thinks there have been important gains in Iraq , and “ I do n’t want to see that damaged by a premature pullout . ”
Mike Long , 33 , a first - time voter in furniture sales , said after talking with Obama about health care that he ’d gone from less than 50 percent likely to vote for him to “ 98 percent ” likely .
Sheila Evans , 39 , who is biracial , told Obama , “ I ’m so proud of you . ”
She told your pooler Obama had chosen a restaurant frequented more by whites , while one a couple of doors down had predominantly African - American diners on Sundays .
But some of the other older white diners looked surprised and slightly uncomfortable as Obama stopped at their tables to shake hands .
“ I ’m surprised , but I ’m not going to say anything else , ” said Pat Smith , who was joined by her husband .
A group of six retired women said they were mostly Democrats — but mostly undecided about how to vote .
“ I have to pray about it , think about what ’s best for our country , ” said Dorothy Buie , one of the women .
Obama ordered some food to go for himself and his aides .
They ordered chicken , collards , baked beans , slaw and wings .
The tab was $ 13.91 .
The visit lasted about half an hour .
Sketch for Change was cooked up over a dinner party fundraiser for Obama .
We 're a group of folks inspired to create the change we 've been waiting for .

Democrats allege McCain violated campaign finance regulations ; the campaign disputes the charge .
Exclusive : Dems : McCain broke own law
Democratic officials tell Politico that they plan to file a Federal Election Commission complaint on Monday accusing the McCain campaign of being “ a serial violator ” of campaign finance laws .
In one case , Russia 's ambassador to the United Nations was solicited for a donation .
But the McCain campaign says that ’s because his name was on a list rented from Foreign Affairs magazine .

The Republican National Committee filed two complaints against the Obama campaign over the past two weeks .
The Democratic National Committee complaint is interesting because Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) has made campaign finance reform one of his signature issues on Capitol Hill .
DNC General Counsel Joe Sandler said : " The McCain campaign 's lack of disclosure and disregard for the law he helped write raises serious questions about John McCain 's commitment to the openness and transparency the voters expect from their leaders . "
The four - page Democratic complaint charges : “ The McCain campaign , already a serial violator of the federal campaign finance laws , including the Bipartisan Campaign Reform
Act of 2002 popularly known as the McCain - Feingold law , evidently chosen to ignore some of the most fundamental and basic requirements of that law .
... [ T ]he Commission should find reason to believe that the McCain Campaign has violated the [ Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 ] and the Commission ’s rules , and should conduct a prompt investigation . ”
McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said : “ This is a joke — a sad publicity stunt to divert attention from the recent controversies surrounding Barack Obama ’s shady fundraising practices , and his campaign ’s complete refusal to disclose the sources of hundreds of millions of his contributions .
It ’s ironic that the DNC and Obama campaign would launch a complaint based on information fully disclosed our website — which is completely transparent in disclosing 100 percent of our contributions publicly — while the Obama campaign has refused to do likewise .
Obviously all of our fundraising strictly follows all campaign finance regulations , which provide for 60 days to reconcile all contributions . ”
On Oct. 6 , the RNC filed an FEC complaint accusing the Obama campaign of “ acceptance of foreign national and excessive contributions . ”
On Thursday , the RNC expanded its complaint to “ donations from unknown sources and demonstrated lack of oversight or concern for compliance with the law . ”
In a news release to be issued this weekend the DNC elaborated on its accusations : “ [ A ] n analysis of the information provided by the McCain Campaign on its website shows that the campaign received 6,653 contributions that were at least $ 1,000 in excess of legal limit of $ 2,300 — including one donor who contributed $ 56,047 .
The McCain Campaign website also lists 23 anonymous contributions in excess of fifty dollars , despite the legal requirement to maintain the name and address of each contributor any amount in excess of $ 50 , and dozens of additional donors who provided incomplete information . ”
The Democrats ’ complaint points to a report in Al Kamen ’s “ In the Loop ” column in The Washington Post on Wednesday : “ Continuing the pattern of solicitation involving foreign nationals , only a few days ago , it was reported that the McCain Campaign had solicited $ 5,000 to a joint fundraising committee including the Republican National Committee from the Russian ambassador to the U.N. , Vitality I. Churkin . ”
A McCain campaign official said the questioned contributions can be explained as follows :
“ 1 . All anonymous contributions over $ 50 are eventually donated to charity , usually Operation Smile .
“ 2 . We get a ‘ request for additional information ’ from the FEC every month for every report as every campaign does , and we respond to them by amending our reports and sending the FEC a letter letting them know that .
“ 3 . Many donors go over the limit and we do the following to them 1 ) Reattribute the excess to a spouse , 2 ) redesignate it to [ the campaign ’s separate accounting fund ] or 3 ) refund the donor .
Our internal website is updated only once a month ... and does not reflect the changes that go on every day with each donor ’s record .
“ 4 . The solicitation to the Russian ambassador was done because the direct mail vendor for McCain Palin Victory rented a list from Foreign Affairs magazine and there was no way of knowing from the list rental of his position , and the street address line did n’t list Russian Embassy on it .
“ 5 . We refunded donations solicited from a foreign national , even though we have no proof the actual donors were foreign nationals .
We were going above and beyond to make sure there were no potential issues . ”

British Pound Crashes on GDP 0.5 % Contraction
The British Pound Crashed following the worse than expected GDP data that showed that the UK economy contracted by 0.5 % in the third quarter which was against consensus forecasts of 0.2 % and the Market Oracle forecast for a 0.3 % drop .
Anything worse than 0.3 % was expected to lead to panic selling of sterling which is what transpired .
The British Pound fell from an already depressed level of £ / $ 1.61 all the way to £ / $ 1.5250 a drop of more than 8 cents which represents the largest intra-day drop since exchange rates started to float freely following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971 due to trade imbalance strains .
The crash in the British Pound of 28 % from a peak of £ / $ 2.11 to £ / $ 1.52 is highly inflationary as commodities and much of international trade is generally priced in US Dollars , therefore over the last 2 months the fall in sterling will tend to feed through into higher forward inflation about a year from now .
Sterling has been extremely oversold since hitting £ / $ 1.60 however when a currency is in freefall which is where sterling is at this time , it is difficult to call any kind of technical bottoms as corrective rallies can evaporate in a matter of hours as panic again leads to further selling .
Yesterdays analysis - UK Economic Crash Follows Housing , Stocks and Sterling Over the Cliff , pointed out the key factors involved and consequences of a sharp drop in GDP .
The bad economic data confirms the Market Oracle forecast for deep interest rate cuts from 5 % to the target rate of 3.25 % by September 2009 , with the next scheduled cut of 0.5 % at Novembers MPC meeting .
Given the speed of crash being observed in the economy ,
If anything this suggests that interest rates could now be cut to below 3 % , hence the collapse in sterling .
The sharp GDP contraction of 0.5 % in the third quarter does not bode well for subsequent quarters and immediately signals a trend that could see the UK contract by more than the 1990's recession that totaled a drop in the official measure of GDP of 2.5 % over 2 years .
The stock market immediately moved to discount the worsening recession prospects with the FTSE crashing by 9 % to below 3,800 , later rallying to close down 5 % at 3883 .
The in - depth UK GDP forecast for 2009 will be generated over the weekend , subscribe to our always free newsletter to get this and other scheduled forecasts in your inbox on the day of publication .

Mr Kouchner was on a two - day visit to Israel which ended on Sunday Some Israelis may have choked on their breakfast when a newspaper headline quoted France 's foreign minister saying Israel might devour its arch foe , Iran .
Hebrew daily Haaretz splashed across its front page that Bernard Kouchner said Israel might " eat " the Islamic Republic before it got nuclear arms .
The following day Haaretz apologised , saying Mr Kouchner , speaking in English , had actually said " hit " .
Mr Kouchner also offered a diplomatic apology for the " phonetic confusion " .
When Mr Kouchner was asked about the possibility of Tehran developing a nuclear weapon , the Hebrew and English editions of Haaretz newspaper quoted him saying : " I honestly do n't believe that it will give any immunity to Iran .
First , because you [ Israelis ] will eat them before . "
You will eat ( sic ) Iran before it achieves an atomic bomb
Haaretz headline ( in Hebrew )
He went on to say : " And this is the danger .
Israel has always said it will not wait for the bomb to be ready .
I think that [ the Iranians ] know .
Everyone knows . "
The comments were published on Sunday , as Mr Kouchner ended a two - day visit to the region , under the headline in Hebrew saying " You will eat Iran before it achieves an atomic bomb " .
On Monday , the paper published a correction and apologised for the " misunderstanding " , but it also said the transcription had been cleared with Mr Kouchner 's office prior to publication .
The paper did not explain how the mistake had occurred , but dropping the " h " is widely seen as a feature of English spoken with a French accent .
Haaretz 's current English online version of the story - with " hit " rather than " eat " - makes no mention of the earlier confusion .
It could be said any levity about the misquote belies the seriousness of the issue it relates to .
The US , Israel and their western allies say they believe Iran is seeking nuclear weapons , an accusation Tehran strongly denies .
Israel , the region 's sole if undeclared nuclear power , has raised the possibility it might launch a pre-emptive strike against Iran to prevent it from becoming nuclear - armed .

What are these ?
" Large aircraft like the ones we fly in do n't have to produce vortices for propulsion , so they can have fixed wings and engines , but we have found that smaller ones will have to take a leaf out of nature 's book if they are to work efficiently .
" Our work will make the goal of tiny aircraft , perhaps eventually the size of bees , a step closer . "
On Monday we got a look at Microsoft's " hangar bay " for data center containers inside its new Northlake , Illinois facility .
We 've also been told that one of the Google company - built data centers included in its energy efficiency data " could be a container data center . "
So what might one of Google 's container data centers look like ?
The above photo of Google 's brand - new data center in Goose Creek , South Carolina may provide a clue .
The picture , snapped by Charleston - area news blog The Digitel clearly shows a section of the data center that is lighted and open to the elements , looking quite a bit like a parking deck .
You can see larger copy of the image at Flickr .
Could this be Google 's version of the two - story approach used by Microsoft in Chicago , with a first story packed with containers and an upper floor using conventional racks ?
Or might the " parking deck " serve another purpose ?
The exterior views available during the Oct. 7 groundbreaking event at the Goose Creek data center do n't provide many answers , but raise some interesting questions .
Attendees were not allowed inside the data center during the event , which was held in a tent in front of the facility .
But a number of news organizations have published pictures .
The ceiling in the open area looks to be high enough to accommodate a container ( a 40 - foot container is typically 8.5 to 9.5 feet high ) , but perhaps not aboard a delivery vehicle .
It 's clearly a smaller space than the Microsoft container area in Northlake .
The Google data center was announced in April 2007 and is located on a 520 - acre site at the Mount Holly Commerce Park .
It was among the four new data center projects announced by Google in the first half of 2007 , each representing an investment of $ 600 million .
The other data center projects are in Lenoir , North Carolina ; Pryor , Oklahoma and Council Bluffs , Iowa .
I 've learned to be cautious about drawing any conclusions from photos like this .
But pictures of other Google data centers indicate that the Goose Creek design is new , and was first seen in the Lenoir facility ( seen below ) , which also has an open area at one end .
The data center designs at Lenoir and Goose Creek are clearly a departure from facilities built in 2006 in The Dalles , Oregon , as seen in photos taken by The New York Times and John Nelson .
It 's also substantially different from the design of a Google data center in Eemshaven in the Netherlands that was photographed in 2007 by Erwin Boogert :
For a full pictorial history of the inside of Google 's data centers , see James Hamilton 's blog ( scroll down when you get there for the photos ) , where James has posted some photos supplied by Google 's Jeff Dean .
For more photos from the Goose Creek data center , you can check out The Digitel 's Flickr set , the Charleston City Paper and LowCountry Bloggers .
Here 's some of our previous coverage of Google 's South Carolina projects :
I want to see the Youtube video for the first time they do that loop !
A bunch of the other designs from that challenge are way more impressive than this one .
I like the Mitsubishi Rally Car !
That sail thing wo n't work unless it can turn .
Apparently these guys never ice raced .
This view of NASA 's Small Pressurized Rover shows its ability for sideways and rotating ' crab - like ' movements .
NASA ?s newprototype for a future moon truck is proving to be the ultimate lunar RV , allowingastronauts to take extended road trips without the constant drag of bulkyspacesuits .
Aterrestrial version of the SmallPressurized Rover , which can go forward , reverse and side - to - side to tackletough terrain , is completing a three - day drive across the Arizona desert today aftera successful week of testing , NASA officials said .
? It ?s justan incredibly capable machine , ? said Doug Craig , NASA ?s strategic analysismanager for the exploration systems at the agency ?s headquarters in Washington , D.C. ?
It ?s going great and everyone ?s really pleased with it .?
Astronautsand geologists split into two , two - person teams to test the unpressurized andpressurized rover versions on the barren Black Point lava fields of Arizona .
The roveris part of NASA ?s bid to return astronauts to the moon by 2020 under the Constellationprogram .
While some engineers are developing program ?s
Orion spacecraft , Ares I and V rockets , and Altair landers , others are testing how best to moveastronauts on the moon once they get there .
Humansfirst drove vehicles on the moon in 1971 , when Apollo 15 astronauts Dave Scottand Jim Irwin unfolded their electricLunar Roving Vehicle from its berth on their Falcon lander .
Two other mooncars followed on NASA ?s last two Apollo flights , but those rovers were builtfor limited trips .
? Thoselunar rovers were disposable , so they were only going to be used for two orthree days , ?
Craig told SPACE.com .
?
These that we ?re looking now , we ? relooking at up to five years length on the moon .?
The newmoon trucks are designed to serve as either a cargo carrier or lunar buggy .
Thepressurized module version sports a pair of rear - mounted spacesuits withconnecting backpacks .
Astronauts would step into suits , shut the backpack hatchand then detach themselves for lunar exploration .
The recent tests found roverdrivers could suit up relatively easily , Craig said .
? We endedup having to build in hold times because they could get in and out so fast , ? headded .
Under NASA ? scurrent plan , two rover teams would take their moon trucks out on journeys thatcould last up to two weeks away from a lunar base .
If one rover breaks down , all four astronauts could pile into the remaining vehicle and head home .
The newmoon truck actually suffered a flat tire on Monday , with its drivers suiting upand successfully swapping out the flat with a new one , Craig added .
The longestever lunar rover trip during the Apollo era covered just under 8 miles ( 12.5 km ) , according to NASA records .
?
We ? retalking about hundreds of kilometers , ?
Craig added .
?
This is a completelydifferent paradigm than Apollo .?
Drivinglike a moon crab
NASA ?s newmoon rover consists of two separate parts : the RV - like pressurized cabin and the 12 - wheeled Chariot base that can be driven independently by aspacesuit - clad astronaut while perched atop a rotating control turret .
? One of thesurprises was how much better the Small Pressurized Rover was than theunpressurized rover , ? said Craig , adding that the teams found driving from theunpressurized turret tough going .
?
When you ?re in a suit for eight hours andbeing bounced around , it really beat them up .
At the end of the day , they werereally fatigued .?
But evenafter 10 hours of driving from inside the pressurized version , the test crewswere still primed for more mock moon roving action , he added .
NASA ?
sChariot moon truck chassis consists of six bug - like legs , each of which tippedwith two wheels .
The 2,204 - pound ( 1,000 - kg ) vehicle is about 15 feet ( 4.5 meters ) long capable of hauling twice its weight in cargo and driving upto 6 mph ( 10 kph ) on rough terrain .
Each of the wheel talks can pivot 360 degrees and be lifted up to clear rocks or other obstacles , giving the Chariotthe ability to mimic a crab ? s flexible mobility , Craig said .
Thepressurized cabin adds an extra 4,409 pounds ( 2,000 kg ) of weight to the rover , but comes with extra amenities like living quarters , cabinets for provisionsand tools , and a shielded section for shelter against radiation events .
? Theyprovide a safe haven for astronauts on the lunar surface in case there ?s asolar flare , ?
Craig said .
?
In Apollo , they did n?t have that safe haven , andthey ?d have to go back to the lander .?
In additionto the step - in spacesuits , the rovers have a large side hatch designed toattach directly to a moon base entrance .
? These arestill concepts , ?
Craig said , adding that new modifications will likely follow the Black Point tests .
?
It ?s been a really good test out there .
We ?re learning alot .?
NASA spentabout $ 38 million to develop its Apollo lunar rovers in the 1960s and 1970s , according to agency records .
But the final cost for the new moon buggies remainto be seen .
? The lineis ? more than a Ferrari , ?? said Craig , adding that the current concept is amix - match of parts and improvements , must still be refined into a final design .?
It ?s kind of hard to put a number on it .?

Police are bracing for what could be the longest two - wheeled funeral procession ever to hit the Bay Area .
No one knows exactly how many mourners in leather jackets are going to attend services Sunday and Monday for the slain president of the Hells Angels ' San Francisco chapter , Mark " Papa " Guardado .
Some say there could be 1,000 Hells Angels , some say more .
" However many there are , we 're going to be ready , " said Officer Shawn Chase , spokesman for the California Highway Patrol .
Guardado , 46 , was shot Sept. 2 outside a bar at 24th Street and Treat Avenue after what police described as a " wrestling match " with the gunman , who fled on a motorcycle .
Christopher Ablett , 37 , of Modesto , a member of the rival Mongols Motorcycle Club , is wanted on suspicion of murder .
Little is known about how the Hells Angels plan to mourn their beloved leader .
There will be a vigil Sunday at 7 p.m. and a funeral Monday at 10 a.m. at Duggan 's Serra Mortuary at 500 Westlake Ave. in Daly City , with interment to follow at Cypress Lawn cemetery in Colma .
The two - wheeled funeral procession could be the largest in Bay Area history .
The undertakers are expecting more people than the chapel can hold and plan to install loudspeakers in the parking lot to accommodate the overflow crowd , authorities said .
Hells Angels members from around the country are expected to attend .
Daly City police will be on duty at the mortuary , and Colma police will be on duty at the cemetery .
San Francisco police will be on duty if the funeral procession passes through San Francisco or stops at the Hells Angels clubhouse on Tennessee Street , where Guardado lived .
Highway Patrol officers will be everyplace .
" We will have as many officers as we need , " Chase said .
" We could have a couple of hundred ready .
It 's a fluid situation .
We do n't want to see any conflicts , especially with other motorcycle groups .
Things can get out of hand fast . "
Daly City police Capt .
Mike Edwards said a commander had a " cordial meeting " with club members at the funeral home earlier in the week but did not learn exactly what the Angels were planning to do .
Hells Angels members at the clubhouse declined to comment on funeral plans and asked reporters and photographers to leave .
" It 's difficult to judge how to prepare , " Edwards said .
" They said they want to take care of their own .
That 's OK .
We 're here to help .
We 're not here to tell anyone what to do . "
If Hells Angels turn out in the number that some are predicting , Edwards said it could be the largest funeral procession in Daly City history , certainly the largest one on motorcycles .
" They 're not telling us the route of the procession , " Edwards said .
" We 're going to keep things as orderly as possible . "

ABC : NSA agents admit spying on Americans ' private calls David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday October 9 , 2008

The Bush administration has repeatedly defended its warrantless surveillance of Americans as being directed only against " people with known links to al Qaeda and related terrorist organizations . "
Now two intercept operators who worked for the National Security Agency at Fort Gordon in Georgia have come forward to tell ABC News that is n't true .
David Murfee Faulk described to ABC's Brian Ross how he had listened to " personal phone calls of American officers , mostly in the Green Zone [ in Baghdad ] , calling home to the United States , talking to their spouses and sometimes their girlfriends . "
" Co-workers of mine were ordered to transcribe these calls , " Faulk stated .
" When one of my co-workers went to a supervisor and said , ' But sir , these are personal calls , ' the supervisor said , ' My orders were to transcribe everything . ' "
Adrienne Kinne , who like Faulk is an Arab linguist , said she had received the same orders and had listened to hundreds of Americans in the Middle East simply calling home .
She emphasized that these were " Americans who are not in any way , shape , or form associated with anything to do with terrorism .
It was just personal conversations that really nobody else should have been listening to . "
When asked about President Bush 's statement that the intercepts were directed only at known al - Qaeda suspects , Kinne stated , " That is completely a lie . "
She said that military officers , journalists , and Red Cross workers were among the people whose calls she transcribed .
Faulk told ABC that certain calls were even passed around among the intercept operators like office jokes .
" I was told , ' Hey , check this out , there 's some good phone sex . ' ...
It was there , stored the way you 'd look at songs on your iPod . "
" I feel that was something the people should not have been doing , including me , " Faulk acknowledged .
Both whistleblowers ' stories are included in a new book by investigative reporter James Bamford , The Shadow Factory .
Bamford told ABC that although Americans were told the surveillance program was needed to keep us safe , " What it turns out to be is for a more prurient reason , listening for the sake of listening and then laughing . "
CIA Director Michael Hayden , who was previously head of the NSA , has issued a statement saying that " any suggestion General Hayden sanctioned or tolerated illegalities of any sort is ridiculous on its face . "

Wired ’s news feed teases Adam DuVander ’s Webmonkey piece on the so - called “ Apple tax ” thusly :
It ’s no secret that Apple ’s computers cost more than PCs with similar specs .
Well , when you put it like that , it must be true !
But Apple ’s disclosure of its sales figures and estimated market share at a press event Tuesday raises new questions about exactly how much money the company is making off each new Mac purchase .
And new questions mean new jackasstic answers !
Enough teasing !
Let ’s get to the piece .
The concept , which has merit , is that Apple ’s computers cost more than PCs .
Does it have merit ?
Of course !
Adam just said so !
Just how much ?
Apple hinted at the number in its event today : Retail share : 17.6 percent market share of unit sales .
Revenue share : 31.3 percent of retail sales .
In other words , where one in five computer sales is an Apple , these account for one of every three dollars spent .
Apple has more share of the revenue because its computer cost more .
Cost more than what ?
Cost more than similarly configured machines as Adam says ( remember , the teaser promised we ’d be talking about similarly configured machines ) ?
No .
No matter how you crunch the numbers , they imply that Apple charges at least 50 percent more than other manufacturers , maybe even twice as much .
Good lord .
They do not .
How would that even be possible ?
Do n’t you think people might notice that ?
What the numbers show is that Apple competes at the high end of the market and has no presence in the low end of the market .
Are you kidding us , Adam ?
Are you kidding us , Wired ?
Nvidia today rolled out its next - generation 200 - series GPUs , the GeForce GTX 260 and GTX 280 .
The series name is at last a concession to the bewildering naming scheme Nvidia has played with in the vast array of GeForce graphics chips .
That is — starting now .
Customers will still wade through the convoluted model numbers with older offerings .
The 200 - series GPUs are fabricated by the Taiwan foundry , TSMC , on a 65nm process that uses 1.4 billion transistors .
It 's an enormous 576 square millimeters chip and the largest GPU that TSMC has manufactured to date .
To compare , the G92 chip ( used in the GeForce 8800 and 9800 GPUs ) measures 330 square millimeters .
Tony Tamasi holds up the 200 - series chip
Of course , the wafer real estate required for each chip means greater manufacturing cost , and you can probably guess where that expense is ultimately shouldered .
That said , the GPUs pack a lot of punch .
They use a double - slot design that measures 26.67 cm ( 10.5 inches ) in length .
You might want to break out the measuring tape on your box , and also make sure you 've got 6 - pin and 8 - pin power connectors to feed the GTX 280 board 's 236W demands .
The GTX 260 , meanwhile , needs two 6 - pin connectors for 182 watts board power .
GeForce GTX 280
The big GTX 280 sports a 512 - bit memory controller — an upgrade from the previous generation 384 - bit controller — connected to 1,024MB GDDR3 memory running at 1107MHz .
The chip has 240 processing cores ( which used to be called shader units ) and 32 edROPs ( raster operations processors ) , and clocks at 1296MHz .
Nvidia is selling its new big GPU for $ 649 ( £ 333 ) beginning tomorrow .
GeForce GTX 260
The GTX 260 has a 448 - bit memory controller connected to 896MB GDDR3 memory clocked at 999MHz .
The chip has 192 processing cores and 28 ROPs , running at 1242MHz ( that 's pretty darn close to the GTX 280 . )
The smaller GPU is $ 399 ( ~ £ 205 ) and goes on sale June 26 .
All said , Nvidia claims the GPUs on average give a 1.5 x performance boost over GeForce 8 or 9 series GPUs .
Post - debate , Palin power putters out Agence France - Presse
Published : Saturday October 4 , 2008
Print This Email This DENVER , Colorado ( AFP ) 
Despite a gutsy debate performance by Republican VP pick Sarah Palin , she failed to turn the tide in the race for the White House , leaving John McCain struggling to revitalize his slipping bid , analysts said Friday .
Just over four weeks until the November 4 elections , McCain has yet to seize the upper hand from his Democratic rival Barack Obama and has been left trailing in the polls .
On Thursday his campaign admitted that it was pulling out of Michigan , effectively surrendering the midwestern state to the Democrats , to focus instead on six swing states .
And with more bad news on the economic front , McCain was Friday to hold a rally in Colorado before retreating to his Arizona ranch for the weekend , in a highly unusual disappearing act at the height of the campaign .
Missouri , where Thursday 's debate was held , is one of the key states in play -- along with Florida , North Carolina , Virginia , Indiana and Ohio -- and Republicans there acknowledged there was work to be done .
" Senator McCain has to win Missouri to win the White House .
So there is a strong commitment from the McCain - Palin campaign to make sure that we deliver Missouri for that ticket , " said Jared Craighead , executive director of the state 's Republican Party .
He said he hoped to share in any resources now being made available following the decision to leave Michigan .
" I have got the call that in the build - up to the final days , we 're going to have more resources than we thought we would initially , " he said .
Jack Cardetti , communications director of the Missouri Democratic Party , agreed McCain needed to win in Missouri , and said : " I fully expect some of those resources to come right here into Missouri . "
The Obama campaign has opened 40 field offices across the state , with more than 100 paid staffers , Cardetti said , describing it as an " unprecedented commitment to Missouri . "
Palin had stood her ground against Democratic rival Joseph Biden late Thursday in the only vice presidential debate of the 2008 White House race , firing off rapid , well - rehearsed talking points .
The performance by Palin , the first time Alaska governor plucked from obscurity by McCain in late August to be his running mate , will have thrilled the party 's conservative case , following days of concern over her ability .
President George W. Bush tuned out the vice presidential debate after the first half , but came away impressed with his fellow Republican .
" He saw probably about the first half of it .
He thought it was a good debate .
He thought Governor Palin did very well , " Tony Fratto told reporters .
But Palin offered little of substance , and even though both sides claimed victory , the debate is unlikely to have swayed most voters who in recent weeks have been flocking to Obama 's side .
" In the end , the debate did not change the essential truth of Ms. Palin 's candidacy : Mr. McCain made a wildly irresponsible choice that shattered the image he created for himself as the honest , seasoned , experienced man of principle and judgment , " The New York Times wrote .
" It was either an act of incredible cynicism or appallingly bad judgment . "
A slew of polls have put Obama firmly ahead both nationally and in key swing states such as Ohio , Florida and Pennsylvania ahead of the polls .
And they have suggested that voters blame Republicans for the country 's economic woes and trust Obama more with fixing the downturn .
New figures showed the sputtering economy lost 159,000 jobs in September as the weight of the housing collapse and credit crunch hit a broad swath of industries .
Biden , who also did better than expected in the debate , reining in his natural tendency to be too long - winded , had sparred with Palin over the Iraq , the economy , health care and even the role of the vice president .
" Surviving 90 minutes on a stage with Biden did not transform Palin into a plausible president , " wrote E.J. Dionne in the Washington Post .
" Say what you will about Joe Biden -- and last night , he was far from being either the gaffe machine or the windbag so many predicted would appear on stage -- no one loses sleep at the idea of his being in the Oval Office . "
In a congressional hearing room on Thursday , former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan , one of the most influential civil servants of the past century , saw his stock plummet — and his entire career lose its moorings .
More important , the ideological battle over economic theory and the role of government in markets — a fight that has played out in the current presidential campaign — took a historic turn .
With members of the House oversight and government reform committee blasting Greenspan for his past decisions that helped pave the way for the current financial crisis , he acknowledged that his libertarian view of markets and the financial world had not worked out so well .
" You know , " he told the legislators , " that 's precisely the reason I was shocked , because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well . "
While Greenspan did defend his various decisions , he admitted that his faith in the ability of free and loosely - regulated markets to produce the best outcomes had been shaken : " I made a mistake in presuming that the self - interests of organizations , specifically banks and others , were such as that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders and their equity in the firms . "
In other words , whoops — there goes decades of Ayn Rand down the drain .
Democrats on the committee made Greenspan eat ideological crow .
And after the hearing , Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California released letters Greenspan had written to legislators in 2002 and 2003 that now cast the former chief banker as out of touch with financial reality .
Back then , Feinstein was pushing for regulating financial instruments known as derivatives — particularly those called swaps .
In 2000 , Republican Senator Phil Gramm , then the chairman of the Senate banking committee , had used a sly legislative maneuver to pass a bill keeping swaps free from federal regulation .
( Lobbyists for financial firms had helped to write the bill . )
The swaps market subsequently exploded , as financial firms bought and sold swaps as insurance to cover their trading in subprime securities and other freewheeling financial products .
In a nutshell : the rise of unregulated swaps enabled the growth of the shaky subprime securities at the heart of the current financial crisis .
Greenspan was an ardent supporter of keeping swaps virtually unregulated .
In 2001 , Enron , having gone crazy with energy derivatives , collapsed — after the firm had manipulated the California electricity market , costing residents of Feinstein 's states billions of dollars .
Following that fiasco , Feinstein decided the derivatives market needed to be reined in .
As The Wall Street Journal reported in 2004 , " When she telephoned Mr. Greenspan for support , he declined , telling her the proposal threatened the multitrillion dollar derivatives industry , which he considers an important stabilizing force that diffuses financial risk . "
In September 2002 , Greenspan , Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill , Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Harvey Pitt , and Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman James Newsome wrote a letter to members of Congress to note their opposition to legislation that would regulate derivatives .
They wrote :
We believe that the [ over - the - counter ] derivatives markets in question have been a major contributor to our economy 's ability to respond to the stresses and challenges of the last two years .
This proposal would limit this contribution , thereby increasing the vulnerability of our economy to potential future stresses ....
We do not believe a public policy case exists to justify this governmental intervention .
The OTC markets trade a wide variety of instruments .
Many of these are idiosyncratic in nature ....
While the derivatives markets may seem far removed from the interests and concerns of consumers , the efficiency gains that these markets have fostered are enormously important to consumers and to our economy .
Greenspan and the others urged Congress " to be aware of the potential unintended consequences " of legislation to regulate derivatives .
They got it exactly wrong .
Swaps and derivatives ended up undermining , not bolstering , the economy .

Feinstein was not convinced by Greenspan 's argument , and she continued to press for legislation to regulate swaps .
And Greenspan continued to resist .
In a June 11 , 2003 letter — also signed by the new Treasury secretary .
John Snow , the new SEC chairman , William Donaldson , and CFTC chairman Newsome — Greenspan praised derivatives and called them an essential part of the economy :
Businesss , financial institutions , and investors throughout the economy rely upon derivatives to protect themselves from market volatility triggered by unexpected economic events .
This ability to manage risks makes the economy more resilient and its importance cannot be underestimated .
In our judgment , the ability of private counterparty surveillance to effectively regulate these markets can be undermined by inappropriate extensions of government regulations .
They were asserting that government regulation undercuts market - driven self - regulation .
But as events have demonstrated , unregulated swaps did not protect Big Finance firms ; they weakened the entire financial industry in the United States and overseas .
In a November 5 , 2003 letter , signed only by Greenspan , the Fed chair again took a shot at Feinstein 's proposal to control derivatives .
He noted that " enhanced market discipline " would address concerns about the manipulation of markets .
Before the oversight committee , Greenspan said that he had been " partially " wrong to believe that swaps did not need regulation .
But he did seek cover by claiming he had not been alone in screwing up : " The Federal Reserve had as good an economic organization as exists .
If all those extraordinarily capable people were unable to foresee the development of this critical problem ... we have to ask ourselves :
Why is that ?
And the answer is that we 're not smart enough as people .
We just can not see events that far in advance . "
But not everyone got it wrong .
In the late 1990s , regulators at the CFTC wanted to regulate swaps .
Gramm , Greenspan and others — including senior members of the Clinton administration — did not .
Following the Enron debacle , Feinstein took a run at this .
But Greenspan and Bush administration officials said no .
And it was not an issue of smarts ; it was a matter of ideology .
In fact , it was always a matter of ideology for Greenspan , a libertarian champion .
In 1963 , writing in Rand 's " Objectivist " newsletter , he noted , " It is in the self - interest of every businessman to have a reputation for honest dealings and a quality product . "
Regulation , he maintained , undermines this " superlatively moral system . "
Self - governance by choice , he said , would be more effective than governance through government .
Regulation , Greenspan maintained , was the enemy of freedom : " At the bottom of the endless pile of paper work which characterizes all regulation lies a gun . "
Well , it turns out that at the bottom of the system that Greenspan oversaw for years , there was nothing but a pile of bad paper .
And testifying to the House oversight committee , Greenspan , one of the more ideological Washington players of the past few decades , essentially said that Ayn Randism had let him — and the entire world — down .
It was truly a God that failed .

While I was at Rails Summit LA 2008 I got interested again in take a look to NekoVM
While talking with Manuel Aristarán last night , I explained to him the coolness factor of mod_tora , what could be the analog of mod_rails ( Phusion Passenger ) for Neko , but without the nasty fork ( )
So after eating pizza , we decided to hack something to convert Ruby code to basic Neko language , just for the sake of testing .
Tools involved
NekoVM
Is not only cool that this complete VM was created and maintained by one guy , but it ’s even cooler that they package binaries for most important platforms : Linux , OSX , and of course , Windows .
We downloaded the packages , setup the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH and start playing with Neko compiler ( nekoc ) reading the docs at the same time .
AST of Ruby
The question was , how to generate the Abstract Syntax Tree of a Ruby program ?.
That was easy : ParseTree
After digging a bit into the documentation , we found that inheriting from SexpProcessor opens you the door of heaven and unleash the power of ParseTree .
We followed Ruby2 Ruby implementation just to get started .
Something to test
What to test ?
I wondered how cool will perform my sudoku solver script after going through this converter , but after looking at the Sexp it generates , realized that will take more than a couple of hours of hacking 🙁
Going back to basics , we decided to start with a Fibonacci function instead and from there move forward .
Hacking
So we started with the Ruby code and added the required tokens indicated in the sexp to successfully build the code shown below .
You can find the Neko SexpProcessor on github , under nekro project we started .
Performance
Well , I know is just plain silly do a performance comparison between a VM like Ruby with one that could n’t compare or match all the functionality , but bear with me for a second 😉

Though investors have endured some pretty terrible Dow performances in recent weeks , including another 300 - plus point on Friday , the downward spiral has not gone far enough to halt trading on Wall Street .
New York Stock Exchange rules currently call for circuit breakers to interrupt trading only in cases of extreme drops of more than 1,100 points .
Such breaks , established after the Black Monday crash in 1987 , are intended to help investors step back and assess what is happening .
The thresholds for market timeouts are set quarterly , using the Dow ’s average closing price for the previous month , and activate in increments of 10 , 20 , and 30 percentage point drops .
For the current fourth quarter , if the Dow drops 1,100 points before 2 p.m. , trading stops for an hour .
If such a drop happens between 2 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. , trading halts for a half hour .
After 2:30 p.m. , the 1,100 - point threshold expires .
There is also a 2,200 - point mark .
If the Dow falls by that much before 1 p.m. , trading stops for two hours .
Between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. , a 2,200 - drop causes an hour halt .
After 2 p.m. , trading ends .
If the Dow falls by 3,350 points , trading stops for the rest of the day .
The circuit breakers have been activated twice , both times in late afternoon trading on Oct. 27 , 1997 , when the Dow eventually closed off 554 points , or 7.2 percent .
Trading that day was halted under previous triggers , which were later revised in 1998 .
The current triggers have never been hit .
Read
If the president approves , the Securities and Exchange Commission can suspend trading for up to 90 days .
The prospect of a halt to trading seemed possible yesterday morning after Dow , Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures contracts declined 5 percent , meeting a threshold set in May 2001 and triggering a suspension in futures markets .
It was the first time that the “ down limit ” had been reached since the 5 percent mark was set in May 2001 .
That kind of snowball effect can offset a circuit breaker ’s usefulness as a tool for cooling off .
Even so , for some investors , triggering the circuit breakers could mark a bottom to the market .
Every day they go unused is another day for traders , like healthy people wondering when they ’ll catch a flu bug that ’s going around , to worry whether the worst is yet to come .
Total volume in the New York Stock Exchange yesterday was only slightly above the six - month average , and the atmosphere on the floor was calm throughout the trading session , belying the frenzied sell - off overseas and in the futures market .
“ Maybe it ’s like with kids : quiet is bad , ” said Stephen Wood , senior portfolio strategist at Russell Investments .
“ But I do n’t know that I ’m a firm believer in the capitulation theory .
Do you need to have some huge crescendo to end the opera ?
I do n’t know that you do . ”
