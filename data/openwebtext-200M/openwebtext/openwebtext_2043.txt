With the assassination of Benazir Bhutto , one of Pakistan ’s foremost opposition leaders , the bottom fell out of the Bush administration ’s already creaky policy toward that South Asian nation .
The administration had hoped that Bhutto would return to a country in turmoil and take the position of prime minister to give presidential dictator Pervez Musharraf ’s government some popular legitimacy .
Instead , Bhutto went into an opposition mode and then was assassinated .
Unfortunately for the administration , Bhutto was one of the few genuinely popular politicians in Pakistan and has no viable replacement .
The assassination cut in half the administration ’s policy  which was tied to supporting particular personalities , such as Bhutto and Musharraf  leaving only the propping up of the shaky dictator .
The reason given for continued U.S. backing of Musharraf is his alleged support for the U.S. " war on terror . "
He has made some effort to go after al - Qaeda operatives and Islamic radicals in northwest Pakistan .
But Musharraf has a big incentive to keep the most prominent people in those groups free .
As long as Pakistan ’s army , the most powerful political force in the country , can be seen to be fighting , apprehending , or killing these important remnants , heavy amounts of U.S. military aid will continue to flow .
Pakistan already saw U.S. aid evaporate in the 1990s after the United States ’ Soviet arch-rival withdrew from neighboring Afghanistan .
The Pakistanis know better how to play the game this time around .
There is a key to the puzzle of Pakistan : of the $ 10 billion the United States has given to that nation , the Pakistani government has diverted significant amounts to buying weapons to shore up the Pakistani military ’s position against India , its chief rival .
So Musharraf and the army have every incentive to fight al - Qaeda and the Islamists but never eradicate them .
The military aid is fueling an arms race between Pakistan and India in what most experts say is the conflict in the world most likely to lead to nuclear war .
( The United States is also unwisely fueling the conflict from the other side by selling conventional arms to India and will very likely indirectly help India with its nuclear weapons program , should the U.S. - Indian pact on nuclear cooperation be approved . )
Some in American policy circles have advocated making U.S. aid conditional on the Pakistani government ’s making more progress on fighting the Islamists or making democratic reforms .
Instead , U.S. aid to Pakistan should be cut off .
( Arms sales to India should also be stopped and the U.S. - Indian nuclear agreement scrapped . )
Like continued U.S. and NATO occupation of next door Afghanistan ( perceived as " infidels " oppressing a Muslim land ) , the close association of the Pakistani government and the U.S. superpower has fueled the Pakistani Islamist insurgency .
Ending U.S. aid would substantially lessen that inflaming bilateral relationship .
Furthermore , counterintuitively , the aid cutoff would likely increase Musharraf ’s incentive to go after the Islamists .
The Islamist insurgency is growing stronger , as its spilling out of the northwest tribal areas and the Bhutto assassination indicates .
Musharraf and the Pakistani military would have every incentive to try to exterminate the insurgency before it destabilizes Pakistan .
Conversely , they would no longer need to keep prominent Islamists free to keep U.S. aid flowing , because it would have been terminated .
Make no mistake , the United States has an interest in seeing the Islamists defeated , because they harbor and assist al - Qaeda and because , in the worst but unlikely case , they could take over a nuclear - armed nation .
If the United States ca n’t help itself and wants to do something proactive  and much more productive than the counterproductive military aid  to stop the Islamists , it should further substantially hike the bounty on the heads of Osama bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri from the current $ 50 million and $ 25 million , respectively .
Such a reward has the best chance of getting a tip on their whereabouts at a very low cost compared to the ill - spent billions on aid and the normally incompetent U.S. intelligence agencies .
Anyone providing such a tip could also be offered safe passage out of Pakistan and protection for life .
Of course , U.S. covert action and Special Forces raids could be used if the Pakistani military was unable to undertake a raid to take advantage of any tip .
The U.S. could also continue to help Pakistan secure its nuclear weapons .
Progress has already been made in training elite troops to guard them and to store warheads and detonators separately .
Some evidence exists that the U.S. is already attempting to increase such nuclear security help and the activity of U.S. covert and Special Forces .
The United States should be less concerned with whether Pakistan becomes a democracy .
Democracy is less of a precursor to the Pakistani government ’s ability to fight al - Qaeda and the Islamists than is commonly perceived .
Nevertheless , the billions in aid only shores up anti-democratic forces  read the Pakistani military .
Like the perverse effect U.S. aid has on the Pakistani government ’s incentives to eliminate the Islamists , proactive U.S. efforts to promote democracy may actually undermine it .
Democracy may become discredited because it has been associated with the meddling superpower .
Thus , with both aid and democracy promotion , U.S. policy should first be " do no harm . "
Doing less in both cases is likely to get better results .
The AdSense blog has just announced changes to the AdSense referral program which I ’m pretty disappointed in .
In fact they anger me and leave me disillusioned with AdSense .
There are two changes :
1. Changes to Payment System
The ‘ experimental ’ payment system for publishers promoting AdSense is being changed back to the way it was before it was changed a year ago .
The current pay system ( that is about to change ) works like this :
If you refer someone to AdSense who makes $ 5 within 180 days you get a payment of $ 5 .
If you refer someone to AdSense who makes $ 100 within 180 days you get $ 250
If you refer 25 people who make $ 100 within a 180 day period you get a bonus payment of $ 2000
The previous payment system ( which is what things are being changed back to ) is this :
If you refer someone to AdSense who makes $ 100 within a 180 day period you get $ 100 .
This removes the incentive to refer anyone who is a small publisher and it removes the incentive to work hard at referring multiple publishers .
In fact it removes quite a bit of incentive to use the program at all .
As someone who had always just fallen short of the $ 2000 bonus I can tell you that for me it always acted as a huge incentive to promote AdSense .
When AdSense added the $ 5 and $ 2 k bonus I thought it was genius – while the numbers may not have been right – I ’m surprised that AdSense have removed incentive for publishers to refer them in this way .
But if that ’s not enough – get this second change :
2. AdSense Referrals Retired for Publishers outside of North America , Latin America and Japan .
If YOU as a publisher are outside of North America , Latin America , and Japan – you ’ll no longer be able to participate in the referral program .
Yes you hear me right , its about the location of you as a publisher that excludes you from participating in the AdSense referral system .
It ’s got nothing to do with your audience ’s location , the topic you write about , the quality of your blog or any other factor – it ’s about where you blog from .
I ’m not privy to the reasoning for this – they simply say ‘ We ’ve found that this referral product has not performed as well as we had hoped in these regions ’ – but in my mind this is stupidity to the ultimate degree .
As a publisher who blogs from Australia but who has a blog on a niche topic that relates perfectly to AdSense and which has the vast majority of it ’s traffic from the USA ( and which has consistently referred publishers to AdSense that have converted at the $ 100 in 180 range ) I cannot understand the reasoning for this change .
I ’m just one example ( I ’m the example I know best ) and a quick look at my stats shows me that I ’ve displayed AdSense referral ads close to 20 million times .
I ’ve sent them tens of thousands of visitors and have been responsible for thousands of sign ups .
I cannot even begin to imaging how much money those signups have made AdSense – yet today they ’re telling me that they do n’t feel that that kind of evangelism for them is worthwhile paying for ?
I can understand the reasoning for changing payment levels if they are not converting well for AdSense , but to exclude publishers from promoting them based upon the location of the publisher is simply dumb .
AdSense – this is short sighted , this will cost you money , this is stupid .
PS : The last line of the post on the AdSense blog which announces this shows just how out of touch the team that made this decision are with international publishers .
“ We appreciate your support of this referral product , and hope it wo n’t cause you any inconvenience . ”
You hope it wo n’t cause inconvenience ?
Are you serious ?
Shoemoney joins the conversation with AdSense Slaps Foreign Webmasters in the Face
Update : I ’m still a little confused by this decision of AdSense and have been wondering what ’s behind it .
One that comes to mind is that perhaps they have an oversupply of publishers and need to slow down the intake of new ones .
Perhaps with the rise of so many other ad networks advertisers are finding other options to advertise with and going with AdWords less – causing an oversupply of publishers .
Not sure on that one – just the beginning of an idea .
Update 2 : one thing I failed to point out in this post that Andy points out is that publishers that you ’ve referred to Google in the last 180 days which are yet to make $ 100 will be switched to the new payout system at the end of the month .
For example , if you referred someone 4 months ago who has made $ 99.99 as of the end of this month ( when the changes come into effect ) and who makes makes another cent the day after taking them up to $ 100 – you will only get the $ 100 payout instead of a $ 250 one .
Of course that is if you live in the ‘ golden zones ’ of the Americas and Japan .
So for ‘ international ’ publishers – every person that you and I have sent to AdSense since the end of July last year that reaches a conversion point in the coming months will earn us nothing at all .

What a shot in the arm the Nevada caucuses were , where we took the silver as # 2 , beating McCain , Huckabee , Thompson , and -- of course -- Giuliani .
We also got four more delegates .
In South Carolina , we beat Rudy again .
A big thank you to all our wonderful donors , volunteers , and voters .
So many people worked so hard to spread our message of liberty , honest money , peace , and free - market prosperity .
I owe you all my deepest gratitude .
So do our fellow citizens .
So do all future Americans .
Most of the mainstream media continue to pretend that we do not exist .
Yet soon the race will be down to four candidates - Romney , McCain , Huckabee , and me , and there is no stopping us , as Tim Russert grudgingly pointed out the other night .
Thanks to you , we are in this all the way through a brokered convention .
Nevada , by the way , is known as the Silver State for a reason - its great mining industry produced the precious metal for the beautiful silver dollars minted at the fabled Carson City mint .
These constitutional coins , include .775 ounces of silver , in accord with the Coinage Act of 1792 .
Today these coins , worth $ 1 in my father 's day , have about $ 14 in silver .
That is , the dollar is worth 1/14th of what it was , thanks to the counterfeiting Federal Reserve .
The Fed has again taken our country into a terrible crisis .
Who else is talking about honest money that cannot be printed up at will by DC bureaucrats ?
My opponents in both parties are all some variety of print - and - spend Keynesians .
Only we are telling the truth , about who is to blame for this recession , and how we can build real prosperity with sound money , no IRS , no deficit , and strict obedience to the Constitution .
And , of course , no hyper - expensive , hyper - dangerous empire all around the globe .
When I met with some great ladies in Charleston , all of whom wore beautiful hats , I talked about the young people flocking to our banner .
" Do n't forget the young at heart , " said one .
Darn right !
A youthful outlook , work ethic , and optimism characterizes all of us .
Frederic Bastiat predicted many years ago that liberty would be saved by the young .
He might have added the young at heart as well , and how right he was !
I continue to be astounded not only by all our revolutionaries , but by our fellow travelers .
Democrats and even the workers for my Republican opponents come up to me to talk about our ideas .
They are fascinated , and want to learn more .
Reaching so many people does n't necessarily mean a victory in the next primary , but it counts for the real changes we want in our country , now and for our children and grandchildren .
Of course , I am mainly paying attention to the next primary !
We are working hard in Florida , in Louisiana for the caucuses , and then for Super Tuesday in more than 20 states .
Meanwhile , the whole world is watching how we do today in fundraising , on a day dedicated to the memory of Martin Luther King , the great champion of non-violence at home , peace abroad , and civil disobedience against tyrannical government .
Please make your most generous donation
http://www.ronpaul2008.com/donate/.
We can't let this movement be stopped , nor slowed .
I promise you that I will continue to pour all my heart and mind and strength into the battle .
I know you will too .
Let 's work together for all we love , and all we hope for : freedom !
Surely , it is worth all our efforts .
Sincerely ,
Ron
Ok , Grandma may still have some difficulty but in honor of today ’s Nobelists , Hurwicz , Maskin and Myerson let ’s give it a go .
Suppose that you are selling a rare painting for which you want to raise the maximum revenue .
There are two potential buyers , Tyler , who values the painting at $ 100,000 , and Alex who values it at $ 20,000 .
The problem would be simple if you knew this information – you would then set the price at $ 99,999 and Tyler would buy maximizing your revenue .
But how much Tyler and Alex value the painting is their own private information .
How then should sell the painting ?
One possibility that springs quickly to mind is an auction .
In a standard English open - cry auction Alex and Tyler will bid for the painting and the bids will keep rising until Alex is forced to drop out at $ 20,001 .
Thus the auction earns you $ 20,001 .
Not bad but is this the maximum revenue possible ?
Remember that Tyler values the painting at $ 100,000 so you could be leaving a lot of money on the table .
What else can you do ?
Well , how about an auction with a reserve price , say $ 50,000 – think of a reserve price as a secret bidder who calls in his bids on the phone .
A reserve price of $ 50,000 works well in this case as Tyler will pay $ 50,001 .
But note that you just got lucky , if Tyler had valued the good at $ 30,000 you would have earned nothing at all .
Thus you would like to know whether a reserve is always optimal and how to set it .
( Riley and Samuelson , and much more generally Myerson both show that a reserve price is always optimal and how to set it ) .
But why stop at a reserve price ?
How about a reserve price and an entry fee ?
But why stop at reserve prices and entry fees ?
You can add any kind of requirement to the auction that you want but will these requirements help you to raise revenue ?
Lets boil the problem down to its essence .
Think about an auction as a mechanism – bidders put information into the mechanism , their bids , and the mechanism tells them the outcome .
( Hurwicz was the first to really start thinking about mechanisms in these very general terms . )
You want to design the mechanism to achieve a certain outcome .
The mechanism can be as complicated as you want but it must satisfy certain conditions .
First , the bidders must participate voluntarily – you ca n’t boil them in oil – so there is a participation constraint .
At the end of the day the bidders must expect to be at least as well off as if they did not play the mechanism game ( at least on average ) .
Second , there is an incentive compatability constraint .
You do n’t know how much Alex and Tyler truly value the painting so suppose that Tyler mimics whatever Alex does – Tyler can do this since he values the painting at least as much as Alex does .
It follows that whatever outcome the mechanism assigns to Alex , Tyler must get at least as much .
This is a significant constraint because it means that if you want Tyler to do something different than Alex , and you do , you want Tyler to bid more , then you must give Tyler something in return .
Thus , even in the optimal mechanism you , the seller , are not going to get everything .
Tyler is going to walk away with some surplus .
We still have n’t solved for optimal mechanism , however .
And here is where the magic comes .
Not magic as in something wonderful but magic as in hand - waving .
Maskin and Myerson proved something very useful about mechanisms with these types of constraints .
It turns out that if you follow the constraints then you can restrict attention to mechanisms in which Tyler and Alex always tell the truth about their values , this is called the revelation principle .
( In a sense , this is obvious for imagine that we find the optimal mechanism given that Tyler and Alex submit whatever bids / information they want .
Then you tell Tyler and Alex – next time why do n’t you tell the truth about your values and we promise to give you exactly the outcome that we would have given you under the previous mechanism . )
In the case of auctions the direct mechanism is well known , a second price auction .
In a second price auction the high bidder wins but pays the second highest - bid .
In this auction it makes sense for every bidder to bid his true value – see if you can work out why – and it turns out that as the revelation principle says , revenues in this direct auction are the same as in say a regular English auction ( under certain conditions , of course ) .
Ok , I have gone on for a while .
Here ’s the bottom line .
The basic set - up of agents with private information submitting " bids " which are then fed into a mechanism resulting in outcomes is very general .
How to raise taxes , regulate a monopolist , fund a public good ( here ’s my own contribution to mechanism design ) , allocate organs , assign interns to hospitals , split common costs , allocate electricity across a grid – all can be thought of as mechanism design problems .
The tools that Hurwicz , Maskin and Myerson developed and their methods of paying attention to participation and incentive compatability constraints and using the revelation principle helps us to design , at least in principle , the best solutions to all of these problems .
At a campaign stop in New Hampshire with booster Holy Joe Lieberman , Republican presidential contender John McCain shows that he has his finger on the pulse of the national mood ( 2/3 of New Hampshire citizens poll that they want the troops home now ) by telling potential voters that he'd like to stay in Iraq for 100 years .
Q : President Bush has talked about our staying in Iraq for 50 years -- " ( cut off by McCain )
McCain : " Make it a hundred . "
Q : " Is that ... " ( cut off )
McCain : " We 've been in South Korea ... we 've been in Japan for 60 years .
We 've been in South Korea 50 years or so .
That would be fine with me .
As long as Americans ... "
Q : [ tries to say something ]
McCain : " As long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed .
That 's fine with me , I hope that would be fine with you , if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where Al Qaeda is training and equipping and recruiting and motivating people every single day .
Celebrity Apprentice Cast Not So Star Studded
Donald Trump has finally unveiled the list of celebrities who will compete for their favorite charities when the NBC reality show Celebrity Apprentice airs on January 3 .
Word of caution - if you 're looking for a star studded cast you will be disappointed .
The fourteen chosen to compete in season seven have some notoriety but not on any grand scale .
According to Trump , they all have experience in business and they have all done something dramatic with money .
Trump will rely on Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. to assist him during each celebrity task and also in the boardroom .
Omarosa , the nasty woman from season one is back .
Others include Vincent Pastori from the Sopranos , Stephen Baldwin , Gene Simmons of Kiss fame , Marilu Henner of Taxi , actress and model Carol Alt and country star Trace Adkins .
Rounding out the fourteen are a gymnast , a Playboy playmate , a former executive producer turned life coach , an Olympic softball gold metalist , a heavyweight boxing champ , and a reality show judge .
The contestants will be competing against each other on weekly tasks designed to raise charity dollars and the biggest slacker will be shipped home at the end of each week .
Contestants will try to hang on until the last show in order to win the grand prize of $ 250,000 for their chosen charity .
We 've included some additional pictures .

If there 's a positive side to some of the anti-Ruby negativity , it 's that new voices are joining the fray .
In the must - read If Rails Is A Ghetto , Please , Let Me Be Ghetto , John Munsch sums up the current anti-Ruby sentiment pretty well :
Everybody who has seen the explosive growth of Ruby and Rails over the last couple of years eclipse their favorite language / framework ( e.g. Python , Groovy , PHP , etc. ) seems to be blogging or commenting this idea that Ruby and Rails is n't really that great , it 's just hype .
It 's only a committed few who have something to gain from you adopting Rails ( i.e. a book to sell , consultant hours , etc. ) who are promoting something that is snake oil .
Seriously , how stupid do you think we all are ?
I 've been doing professional development since 1985 and doing it full time since ' 87 .
Do you really think that I and thousands of others can't tell when something works and it does n't ?
I did HTML when the only browser was NCSA Mosaic and ASP websites to build DevGames.com and then later GameDev.net in 1999 .
That was painful .
I can tell the freaking difference people .
This works and it works well .
I might not pick it for building the next version of eBay because it would n't stand up to the load , but I would pick it for building the early versions of the next site that will become as big as eBay because it will offer that site lots of fast growth and flexibility .
Officials said the State Department has provided a license for the sale of advanced computers for a Syrian border surveillance program , Middle East Newsline reported .
They said the systems were being provided through a United Nations program that could significantly enhance Syria 's military capabilities .
In 2004 , President George Bush signed legislation to severely restrict technology exports to Syria , deemed a gateway of Al Qaida for the war against the U.S. military in neighboring Iraq .
But the legislation allowed the president to waive sanctions on grounds of U.S. national security .
Officials said the U.S. firm Cisco would supply computers and networking equipment to Syria under UN program .
They said Syria would receive about $ 2.2 million in equipment under a program termed " Modernization of Syrian Customs Directorate , " launched in 2005 and meant to be completed in early 2008 .
Cisco was granted a license by the U.S. Commerce Department to sell the computers to Syria in September 2006 .
The UN has confirmed the sale while the Commerce Department has not responded to the report .
A federal investigation has determined that the U.S. Defense Department approved the export of spare parts of the F - 14 fighter - jet to front companies for Iran .
The aircraft parts as well as other U.S. military equipment were said to have been purchased by brokers for China and then relayed to Teheran .
It just never stops .
When I listed the first set of Hello Kitty Tattoos , I naively thought that the topic would n’t come up again .
It did n’t take long for the Hello Kitty Star Wars Storm Trooper tattoo to appear , then the Hello Kitty Batman tattoo which I , again , thought would put things to an end .
But then there was the Hello Kitty zombie tattoo and then Hello Kitty zombie II tattoo .
I felt those were never gong to be able to be topped until I saw the Hello Kitty scarification which pretty much clinched the title in my opinion , but alas , things always get worse in Hello Kitty Hell …
I know you read the title of this post and were shaking your head in disbelief even before you looked at what I have written .
You thought that I was exaggerating to draw you into the blog because there is no way in Hell ( Hello Kitty or otherwise ) that anyone would ever get a Hello Kitty Jesus tattoo .
Hello Kitty fanatics are wacko , but there is a line even they will not cross , right ?
See , I have had that delusion too , but it always proves to be wrong because fanatics of the evil feline do n’t know what a line looks like that should n’t be crossed .
Thus , the Hello Kitty Jesus tattoo :
No problem , I ’m more than happy to wait a few minutes while you clean up the mess on your computer screen and keyboard before writing more .
Take your time and make sure that all food and drink have been expelled from your stomach before attempting to look again .
No , it ’s not a problem that you need to run to the bathroom again because while cleaning up you noticed that it really does say “ Hello Kitty is my Jesus ” – I ’ve already been there and understand that the food just wo n’t stay down …
Each year I look at what Hello Kitty
Hell the previous year provided and have a small glimmer of hope that things ca n’t get any worse .
I pat myself on the back for surviving another year without gouging my eyes out with Hello Kitty forks ( or spoons or chopsticks or basically any utensil since they have all been Hello Kittified ) due to all the Hello Kitty that surrounds me and imagine that the worst is surely over .
Then within the first two weeks of the New Year , something like this ends up in my mailbox to remind me that Hello Kitty Hell can always get worse and 2008 is going to bring unbearable amounts of Hello Kitty pain …
Sent in by tattoo artist Brian from Youngstown , Ohio who deserves the worst of the worst that Hello Kitty can offer for not only thinking for a second that it was a good idea to send this photo to me , but for also giving notice of what 2008 is going to be like in Hello Kitty Hell …
The UK’s Opinion Research Business has released another statistical study of Iraqi casualties since the launching of the American invasion , one that updates , revises , and essentially confirms their earlier estimate of a million - plus dead .
The price of “ liberation ” is indeed high , but was it worth it ?
The Iraqis have a simple answer : some 60 percent tell pollsters attacks on U.S. and allied military personnel are justified .
So much for being greeted with garlands of flowers and hailed as “ liberators .
” The Americans have a similar , if less emphatic answer : a recent poll asking if the invasion and subsequent occupation “ was or was not worth the number of U.S. military casualties and the financial cost of the war ” yields a resounding no , with 59 percent -- up three points .
A million dead -- and for what ?
So that the neoconservatives could stand astride Washington and the world , bellowing threats and beating their chests in the wake of 9/11 , braying that everything -- everything -- had changed , especially the basic rules of human decency .
Because it was “ doable , ” as Paul Wolfowitz put it .
Because our foreign policy is in large part built around the concept of making the Middle East safe for Israel .
And , most of all , because of the sheer hubris of those who thought themselves above the laws of God and man -- who thought they were gods , and let loose American thunderbolts with reckless abandon , with deadly consequences .
The response to the last ORB data release was vehement : the U.S. government , which does n’t even bother counting Iraqi dead and wounded , derided it , and the neoconservative pundits lit into it as “ propaganda ” and an exaggeration , whilst the more ambitious assailed the methodology of every attempt to measure the vast war crime that the killing fields of Iraq represent .
Yet the results of the ORB study have been expanded , to include estimates from rural as well as urban areas .
The major criticism of the previous study was that the emphasis on conducting interviews in urban areas skewed the results in the direction of an overestimation : the revised study meets this critique head on , covering all areas of the country except for Karbala and Al Anbar , for safety reasons , and also Irbil -- for political reasons .
It seems Kurdish regional government officials were n’t eager for a full accounting of the war dead , for reasons best known to themselves : the interviewers were barred from conducting interviews in the area .
The impact of these omissions pushes their estimate downward , and yet the number is astonishing .
Think of it : a million plus dead .
A full 20 percent of all Iraqi households have endured a death in the family not of natural causes , the great majority of these being Sunnis .
In light of this horror , I could n’t help but think of John McCain ’s remarks the other night at the Republican debate , defending his stated contention that we could and probably should stay in Iraq for a hundred years :
“ We are going to be there for some period of time , but it ’s American casualties , not American presence .
We ’ve got troops right next door in Kuwait .
We ’ll probably have them there for a long time .
We have troops in Bosnia .
We ’ve had troops in South Korea for some 50 years .
By the way , President Eisenhower did n’t bail us out of Korea .
But the point is that we need to protect America ’s national security interest .
It ’s not a matter of presence .
It ’s a matter of casualties .
” American , not Iraqi casualties : the latter do n’t even figure into McCain ’s moral calculus , such as it is .
As long as Americans are n’t dying in any great numbers , it ’s okay to drive us into bankruptcy , alienate the peoples of the world , and fuel the fires of anti-American terrorism .
Since our national security is so often invoked by McCain and his ilk to justify their policy of perpetual war , it needs to be emphasized that the tactics employed by suicide bombers and other terrorist acts have historically been responses to military occupation by a far superior force .
Yet McCain looks forward to extending our suzerainty over Iraq for a hundred years .
How many more Iraqis will die in the span of Iraq ’s American century ?
McCain is not so much of a maverick that he does n’t bother looking at the polls : he knows how many Americans think the war was n’t worth it , and he knows he can’t win unless he confronts this sentiment .
So he ’s going out there with his line about how “ it ’s a matter of casualties . ”
For all his self - promoted concept of himself as some sort of crusading idealist , in this instance at least his cold political calculation is that Americans just care about American dead , and screw the Iraqis .
Except it is n’t true .
Soldiers are coming home with terrifying tales of the war and the level of violence , which is not declining but visibly rising after a brief lull even as the neocon pundits sing paeans to the surge .
The American people are horrified by what Bush and his neocon brain trust have wrought in Iraq , and they are n’t going to be anything but repulsed by this kind of moral blindness , which only takes into account our own costs , both human and material .
Not that McCain , whose self - confessed difficulty with economic issues comes as a surprise to no one , cares much about the latter .
He grimaced and rolled his eyes during the debate , as Ron Paul laid out the economic consequences of the McCainiac hyper - interventionist foreign policy .
In answer to a question about whether we ’re better off now than we were eight years ago , the Texas troublemaker averred :
“ No , no , we ’re not better off .
We ’re worse off , but it ’s partially this administration ’s fault and it ’s the Congress .
But it also involves an economic system that we ’ve had for a long time and a monetary system that we ’ve had and a foreign policy that ’s coming to an end and we have to admit this .
…
We were elected in the year 2000 to have a humble foreign policy and not police the world , and yet what are we doing now ?
We ’re bogged down in another war .
We ’re bankrupting our country and we have an empire that we ’re trying to defend which costs us $ 1 trillion a year .
” It ’s coming to an end , and we have to admit this , because the markets are roiling as the prospect of an American super - recession takes shape , and the central bank acts with unprecedented boldness to shore up the shaky foundations of an economy built around artificial bank credit expansion .
This , after all , is how states finance wars , and especially wars of choice ( i.e. wars of aggression ) such as Iraq : the invisible taxation of bank credit expansion , i.e. inflating the money supply .
Without the link to gold , or some other commodity or basket of commodities , governments are free to debase their own currencies , and thus destroy the very basis of commerce .
The three branches of the federal government are bound by the chains of the Constitution , and yet when gold was separated from the value of the currency the government was “ freed ” from its bounds , and unchained it went forth -- to make war .
Financing wars , especially unpopular wars , is a tricky business : direct taxation is the least desirable option .
It might create undue awareness of the war ’s real costs .
Much better to exact the invisible tax of inflation , which eats into people ’s savings and takes its highest toll on those least able to afford it .
It ’s the most regressive tax of all , yet both political parties support it fulsomely .
They ’d rather sell the country ’s assets off to the Chinese than give up their bipartisan delusions of Washington as the Imperial City , the capital of a rising world empire .
Paul ’s dark warning that we have “ a foreign policy that ’s coming to an end and we have to admit this ” certainly rings true as the financial markets quiver on the edge of a massive meltdown .
Our empire is a bubble that ’s about to burst , along with the economic bubble the Federal Reserve lives in mortal fear of .
Whether this is punishment from on high , or simply economic “ blowback ” rebounding from our fiscal and foreign policies , is a matter of taste and disposition .

Iran launched the rocket with a big televised fanfare on Monday
" Long - range missiles are one of the components of a [ nuclear ] weapons system , " Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov told Interfax .
Therefore Monday 's test launch of Iran 's Explorer - 1 space rocket was " of course , a cause for concern " , he said .
Iran insists its nuclear programme is purely for peaceful energy production .
Correspondents say the statement by Mr Losyukov appeared to indicate that Moscow increasingly shares Western concerns about Tehran 's nuclear course .
" It increases suspicion of Iran regarding its possible desire to create a nuclear weapon , " he was quoted as saying .
Iran said the rocket which was test - fired would be used to launch research satellites .
The US State Department said the launch was " troubling " , as it was an example of the same technology behind long - range ballistic missiles .
In the past , Russia has been more sceptical than some Western powers about Iran 's missile capability , saying it would take a long time to build long - range missiles .

It was early in 2006 , and Matt Carey , the new CTO of eBay , was attending his first focus group about the online shopping site .
It was a memorable experience , to say the least .
“ It ’s hard to use , ” complained a longtime customer .
She had been collecting antique glass on eBay for years .
But lately , the treasure hunt was more frustrating than fun .
“ I get lost , ” she said .
“ I ca n’t get back to my search results .
I have to go all the way out and start over . ”

“ This is not good , ” Carey thought to himself .
This particular buyer was , as he puts it , a “ dyed - in - the - wool , right - down - the - center customer . ”
What she was describing is known by the pejorative “ pogo sticking . ”
To Carey , who had just moved to eBay after 20 years at Wal - Mart , it was the equivalent of “ having customers not able to shop in your store because they can’t find the aisles . ”
It is not news that eBay has lost the magic that made it an Internet darling a few years back .
After peaking at $ 59 a share in late 2004 , the company ’s stock plunged to $ 23 two years later .
CEO Meg Whitman may boast about the company ’s latest stats –record number of users , revenue , and items listed for sale–but the fact is that the rate of growth at the company is slowing .
EBay has tried to jolt itself by investing as much as $ 4 billion in Skype ( which has yet to pay off ) and $ 1.5 billion in PayPal ( which has been far more successful ) .
Yet 70 % of revenue still comes from the core marketplace business .
And as Carey recognized , the weakness there has become impossible to ignore .
How troubling is the slowdown ?
Despite the double - digit increase in listings and gross merchandise sales that the company reported last year , both of these key indicators have steadily decelerated over the past three years .
In 2006 , gross merchandise sales grew by less than 20 % , the smallest rate ever .
More troubling still , the number of active users –those who bid , bought , or listed at least once in the previous year–rose by only 14 % , the slowest rate since 2001 .
EBay is responding with a whole new strategic gamble–one some company insiders say is its most ambitious ever .
The mastermind is John Donahoe , 47 , whom Whitman brought aboard three years ago and installed as president of eBay Marketplaces ( and as her heir apparent ) .
His bold stroke–what he calls “ our number - one strategic priority ” –is recasting the site to focus primarily on buyers , not sellers .
As obvious as this realignment might seem , it is a sea change for an outfit that long regarded sellers as its main customers ; some 1.4 million vendors rely on the operation for their primary or secondary income .
Donahoe ’s key partner is Carey , 42 , who is charged with making the buying experience efficient and fun again .
Improving one of the Web ’s most heavily trafficked sites without disturbing its global–and vocal–sellers ’ network and its millions of loyal buyers is a challenge that Carey compares to a “ four - wall expansion ” at Wal - Mart : turning a standard store into a supercenter without disrupting day - to - day operations .

The good news is there are signs of progress .
Wall Street has noticed –the stock has gone up by about $ 10 a share since its low a year ago .
Still , shares remain about 40 % below their high , and the ultimate outcome of this effort to revive eBay ’s growth is in doubt .
“ This is definitely an inflection point , ” says Robert Peck , an analyst with Bear Stearns .
As Jeff King , eBay ’s senior director of product search ( what eBay calls “ finding ” ) , puts it : “ This is our biggest bet . ”
Twelve years after a pony - tailed programmer named Pierre Omidyar built an unfussy auction Web site one Labor Day weekend , it ’s easy to forget how swiftly and thoroughly eBay changed the online - shopping game .
Within four years , customers had listed 130 million items and sold nearly $ 3 billion worth , giving rise to a new type of entrepreneur , the at - home eBay retailer .
The site ’s charm lay in the fact that the merchandise was utterly unpredictable , and in the way that auctions introduced an element of competition .
The initial hodgepodge of obscure collectibles and discontinued items at bargain prices was joined by hard - to - find new products and pricey cars and jewelry .
Part flea market , part Mall of America–eBay chalked up $ 52.5 billion in total sales last year , more than the sales of Amazon , Apple , and Nike combined .
There ’s still nothing else like it in size and breadth .
From the beginning , the strategy was to amass an unrivaled array of goods that would attract buyers .
It worked well .
In fact , as Donahoe now admits , it worked too well .
The site became bloated and unwieldy .
At any given point , it features about 100 million items for sale , with nearly 7 million new listings every day .
“ EBay ’s abundance was one of its attractions , ” Donahoe says .
“ But if you type in ‘ BlackBerry ’ and get 23,000 search results , it ’s not that helpful . ”
( His offhand math is not far off the mark : A search in September produced 3,911 phones and PDAs , and 17,771 accessories . )
Donahoe is sitting in the employee cafeteria at eBay North , one of two corporate campuses in the San Jose area , in early September .
It ’s just after 8 a .m .
The campus is coming to life , the parking lot starting to fill .
Donahoe is already in midday form after his 6 a.m.
Pilates class in the company gym .
In a sense , he ’s trying to do for eBay Marketplaces what Pilates does for his lanky 6 - foot - 5 frame : improve its flexibility .
“ This is not a one - time project , ” he says of the drive to revamp the buyer experience .
“ We ’ll make big changes over the next couple of years and keep iterating and innovating . ”
Whitman and Donahoe worked together in the 1980s in the San Francisco office of Bain & Co. ; Donahoe stayed and eventually became Bain ’s worldwide managing director .
In many ways , he says , eBay has been going through a natural evolution , from a wildly successful startup to a public company with global reach to , well , a maturing business .
“ Early on it created a market , ” he says .
“ Now we have competition on all sides . ”
advertisement
Today , the company ’s homegrown vendors can sell through their own Web sites , as well as channels such as Amazon.com and Overstock.com .
Shoppers have even more online options .
A bargain is only a Google search away , and brick - and - mortar retailers have worked hard to upgrade the shopping experience on their sites with virtual assistants , gift registries , product videos , customer reviews , and liberal return policies .
Once an e-commerce innovator , eBay fell behind .
“ We were shackled by our own success , ” says Eric Billingsley , who runs the engineering side of the finding operation .
“ When the company was growing 80 % or 120 % year over year , the mind - set was , ‘ If it ’s not broken , do n’t fix it . ’? ”
“ The buying experience has n’t changed dramatically since 1999 , compared with the rest of the Internet , ” says Scot Wingo , president and CEO of ChannelAdvisor , which makes software to automate everything from auctions to shipping for sellers on eBay and other sites .
“ The highway is now crowded , and others are going faster . ”
Historically , eBay made sellers the priority for a very good reason :
They generate revenue .
Sellers are the ones who pay eBay fees for listing an item , posting a photo , even processing a payment through PayPal , which eBay bought in 2002 .
But Donahoe realized that eBay had to stimulate shopping , and to do that , the company needed technology designed around the buyers ’ needs .
In late 2005 , Donahoe began looking to hire a new CTO .
Given the site ’s size and complexity , there were n’t many candidates with the appropriate experience .
Then he met Matt Carey .
Carey did n’t know much about eBay–in fact , he had never used the site–but he had helped build and oversee the technical infrastructure behind the world ’s largest retailer , one of the most data - centric businesses on the planet .
In two decades at Wal - Mart , he had experienced firsthand both unprecedented growth and the challenges of maturation .
A half - hour into the interview , Donahoe excused himself and called a colleague : “ We have to have this guy . ”
Carey inherited a catastrophe .
Shortly after he arrived in San Jose in December 2005 , the site ’s core listings , largely auctions , and those for its 600,000 individual stores were combined for the first time–a blunder no one now takes credit for .
Previously when you typed in , say , “ Sony PlayStation , ” the search engine combed through only the core listings .
To see the other merchandise , you had to surf over to the eBay Stores site and do a separate search or browse the stores .
The goal of combining the entries was to show a broader mix of inventory on a single search ; the effect was to give more exposure to the store products .
The new setup was rolled out with no customer testing .
advertisement
Within weeks , nearly every measure of eBay ’s business was down .
Bids .
Return visits .
The conversion rate , or percentage of listings sold .
Average sales price .
In hindsight , it ’s hard to understand why no one at eBay foresaw what would happen .
Because eBay charges less for store listings than core auction listings , once they all appeared in a single search , many sellers shifted their inventory to save on fees .
Suddenly , store merchandise , which tends to be pricier , was crowding out the auctions–and the bargains .
Auctions bottomed out at just 17 % of total listings , yet they still accounted for 91 % of sales .
The misstep triggered headlines , a falling stock price , and pointed questions from analysts .
Whitman explained repeatedly that the marketplace was out of balance .
In March 2006 , eBay rolled back the program .
Finally , in August the company used its only real lever :
It raised fees for store listings .
That fiasco became the catalyst for overhauling the buyer experience .
Carey asked for a detailed report :
When were shoppers abandoning the site ?
How much were they scrolling through the new search results ?
He discovered that there was no mechanism to create such a report .
It took “ many , many , many hours and days and weeks , ” he says , to unravel exactly what customers were doing .
It turned out that eBay collected all sorts of data about transactions –“ It knew that business like the back of its hand , ” Carey says–but little related to shopping .
“ I said , ‘ We got gaps in the data .
We got holes , ' ” he recalls .
And his mission was to plug them .
Carey grew up in Okmulgee , Oklahoma , where his father operated the family ’s furniture - and - appliance store .
It was located in a four - story building , the tallest in town .
As a boy , he dusted furniture in the showroom and rode the elevator for fun .
As a teenager , he delivered air - conditioners , sold bedroom suites , repaired TVs .
Meanwhile , his mother was working for IBM in information systems .
“ When we were young , she used to take me and my brother to the data center , and we ’d sleep on the floor in her office while she wrote programs on punch cards , ” Carey says .
After graduating from Oklahoma State University , he went to work for Wal - Mart as a programmer trainee , combining his retail and tech know - how .
On his first day , he wrote a program automating a sales report for Sam Walton about the Sam ’s Club stores–all 12 of them .
The IT department was small enough , with only 300 or so employees , that he met Wal - Mart ’s CIO early on .
“ I think I ’m going to want to do your job one day , ” Carey told him .
advertisement
The CIO invited the 24 - year - old to work alongside him for six months and learn the ropes .
Carey eventually had a hand in developing virtually all of Wal - Mart ’s major systems , from software that analyzed every inch of shelf space to programs that identified inefficiencies in the company ’s global supply chain .
“ The lesson there was , it ’s all in the data , ” he says .
“ If you start with the lowest level of detail , you can answer any question about the business . ”
He ’d watched from Bentonville , Arkansas , over the years as colleagues left for tech companies like Amazon and Dell , and when eBay came calling , he was intrigued .
Still , leaving the only employer he ’d ever had was terrifying .
“ You ’ve got no idea how hard that was , ” he drawls .
“ No idea . ” Before moving to San Jose , Carey put the family ’s dining room set up for auction on eBay .
It sold within days .
“ A retired couple in Hot Springs drove in with a truck and picked it up , ” he says .
“ I thought , Wow , that ’s $ 1,000 , man !
This is totally powerful . ”
He got his first taste of the eBay culture on day one .
Everyone works in cubicles , but executives get individual conference rooms , decorated in a theme their colleagues pick out : Blondie for Whitman .
Dennis the Menace for Donahoe .
And Elmer Fudd for Carey , an avid hunter .
Seeing his conference room for the first time –with two double - barrel toy shotguns mounted on the wall , plus a couple of comic - book covers–he remembers thinking , “ Okaaay .
Am I in the wrong room ? ”
Carey set about creating what he calls a “ culture of analytics , ” particularly around buyers and product development .
More experimenting , more testing , more data .
“ I want to eliminate feelings and get down to true math , ” he says .
In just 10 months , his team built a faster and more flexible technology platform .
His developers also began testing applications on small randomly selected samples of the eBay population ( typically 1 % or 2 % ) .
In the old eBay , one former engineer had so many failed launches that he had earned the unfortunate nickname the Rollback King .
Now , if a new feature does n’t improve buyer engagement–a new metric , in which return visits , bidding , buying , and other activities are weighted –it does n’t graduate from trials to reach a broader audience .
“ In a Darwinian sense , ” says Billingsley , one of eBay ’s top developers , “ to be a survivor , something has to keep producing . ”
advertisement
The evolution of the eBay search engine is continuing , driven by the need to boost browsing and sales .
One step is to give shoppers more relevant information , more rapidly .
Until recently , the search engine relied on sellers ’ product descriptions .
When you typed in the name of a product or brand , the software looked for those words in the sellers ’ 55 - word listings .
The results were then ranked according to the closing date of the auctions .
If you entered “ John Deere , ” you could get a listing for a John Deere tractor or a set of John Deere sheets .
By eBay ’s definition , both were equally relevant .
Playing catch - up with other consumer - oriented sites , the company is now applying the “ wisdom of crowds ” to create a new feature called “ best match . ”
Every click on the site is measured ; the outcome of every one of the 2,600 searches per second is tracked to determine what leads shoppers to bid or to buy .
If you submit “ John Deere ” today , you ’ll see the John Deere products that most previous shoppers purchased .
“ We get flack that we ’re trying to control search , but we ’re letting the buyers vote with their clicks and say what ’s relevant , ” says search - meister King .
“ It ’s a big , big , big change for us . ”
Narrowing even the most relevant search by price or brand or size has been a particular problem for eBay .
Unlike other retail sites that sell a set inventory , eBay has to index and classify a constantly changing universe of whatever people are selling .
So where Apple.com or Bananarepublic.com has you pick from predetermined price options , for example , one new eBay feature lets you set your own price range .
The site also steers buyers to those sellers with the most positive feedback .
EBay is launching a “ snapshot view ” in certain categories in time for the holidays ; instead of the usual prominent text and thumbnail images , a larger image pops up as you scroll over the picture of a sweater or a vase .
It ’s the sort of functionality online shoppers have come to expect .
“ If they ’re shopping for clothes , ” says King , “ they ’re comparing us to Nordstrom now . ”
What about serendipity –that item you were n’t looking for but are delighted to discover ?
EBay staffers talk about serendipity all the time .
So at the bottom of the list of matches are a few outliers .
“ If we got rid of cheetah iPod covers , we ’d lose a little of eBay , ” King says .
What does all this mean for the sellers ?
Chris Hinze , who turned to eBay when asthma made him abandon his auto - mechanic business , is enthusiastic .
Working out of his home in Portland , Connecticut , the 46 - year - old refurbishes fixtures bought wholesale into what he calls “ power showerheads ” with dramatically more water flow .
He ’s an eBay PowerSeller , meaning his sales amount to at least $ 1,000 a month and buyers give him high feedback scores .
advertisement
Hinze attended eBay Live , the annual gathering of thousands of sellers , for the first time this past summer .
After one session , he approached King and mentioned that searches for “ shower heads ” and “ showerheads ” produced significantly different results .
Back in San Jose , King had his team add the terms to their “ stemming ” project , which combines related words in the finding system .
The result : a flood of customers for Hinze ’s Superpowershower .
He sold three months ’ worth of merchandise in three weeks .
“ Crazy , huh ? ” he says .
It ’s a good example of the power of eBay ’s algorithms , both to steer shoppers toward what they ’re looking for and to boost a small business 3,000 miles away .
In essence , that was Omidyar ’s original vision : linking strangers through a virtual transaction that served both parties well .
An honest , efficient marketplace , he called it .
But tinkering with the search engine creates new winners and losers ; some sellers bubble up , others disappear .
No matter what , somebody ’s unhappy , suspicious of favoritism , accusing eBay of tilting its playing field .
Even minor tweaks can disrupt business for sellers who rely on automated software to manage hundreds or thousands of auctions .
It ’s all there in the often vitriolic discussion boards on the site .
The biggest question facing eBay today is whether the totality of the changes that Donahoe and Carey are implementing can do for eBay and its millions of sellers what the “ showerhead ” / ” shower head ” fix has done for Hinze .
Therein lies eBay ’s central conundrum .
“ We do n’t pretend to have all the answers , ” says Donahoe .
“ We ’re doing things that will upset some people .
But we ’re not just listening to the average noise .
We ’re sharply focused on what our buyers want and need . ”
Ultimately , the new strategy is a risk , but it ’s one that eBay ca n’t afford not to take .
Faced with the classic growth - company problem , it ’s betting that it can regain momentum by becoming more like mainstream retailers while still offering stuff you ca n’t find anywhere else ( Michael Vick ’s purported handwritten notes for his televised apology in August : $ 10,200 ) .
The buyers will decide if eBay made the right move .
If they shop the site more regularly and purchase more Nintendo Wii consoles and Coach bags and iPhones and Elmer Fudd comics and antique glass , the sellers will applaud the changes .
At eBay , there ’s little doubt what ’s at stake .
“ If we do n’t change , we get marginalized , ” says Carey .
“ We ca n’t let that happen . ”
advertisement
Employees , who seem to take pride in running a global democratic marketplace , profess a greater sense of mission .
“ We have n’t even released an eighth of what we ’ve done , ” says Billingsley .
“ That ’s what excites me .
It has n’t even begun . ”
Customized pages are in the works .
More social - commerce features .
An eBay to Go widget with your favorite auction listings to post on your Web site or your MySpace page , complete with a clock to remind you to bid before it ’s too late .
It all sounds good .
But is it enough ?
Even eBay ’s revamped search engine can’t find the answer .
Often times , white people get frustrated with the state of their country .
They do not like the President , or Congress , or the health care system , or the illegal status of Marijuana .
Whenever they are presented with a situation that seems unreasonable to them , their first instinct is to threaten to move to Canada .
For example , if you are watching TV with white people and there is a piece on the news about that they do not agree with , they are likely to declare “ ok , that ’s it , I ’m moving to Canada . ”
Though they will never actually move to Canada , the act of declaring that they are willing to undertake the journey is very symbolic in white culture .
It shows that their dedication to their lifestyle and beliefs are so strong , that they would consider packing up their entire lives and moving to a country that is only slightly different to the one they live in now .
Within white culture , it is agreed upon that if Canada had better weather it would be a perfect place .
Being aware that this information can be used quite easily to gain the trust of white people .
Whenever they say , “ I ’m moving to Canada , ” you must immediately respond with “ I have relatives in Canada . ”
They will then expect you to tell them about how Canada has a perfect healthcare system , legalized everything , and no crime .
Though not true , it will reassure them that they are making the right choice by saying they want to move there .
But be warned , they will reference you in future conversations and possibly call on you to settle disputes about Canadian tax rates .
So use this advice only if you plan to do some basic research .
Note : Canadian white people threaten to move to Europe .
Note : Europeans are unable to threaten to move anywhere .
( West Babylon , N.Y. )
At a press conference in front of Rudy Giuliani ’s Manchester headquarters this morning with a massive mobile truck billboard in tow , a representative of the Marijuana Policy Project joined two New Hampshire patients to challenge presidential candidates Rudy Giuliani , John McCain and Mitt Romney to back up their statements regarding medical marijuana with scientific evidence , offering the legal maximum $ 10,000 campaign contribution to any of the three who can prove that their statements are true .
“ In response to questions from patients who have benefited from medical marijuana , these candidates have made claims that are flat - out false , ” said MPP executive director Rob Kampia .
“ Since appeals to science , compassion and common sense have n’t worked , we ’re talking to them in a language we know they understand — campaign contributions .
If Giuliani , Romney or McCain can back up their claims that medical marijuana is n’t needed or is too dangerous , we ’ll give their campaign $ 10,000 , but if they can ’t , they need to stop lying . ”
Any responses from the campaigns will be evaluated by an independent panel of medical experts .
An image of the billboard along with full details of the challenge and relevant scientific data are posted at www.medicalmarijuanaworks.org.
“ I ’m sick of the lies , ” said Clayton Holton , who is disabled by muscular dystrophy and who was snubbed by Romney in video footage widely seen on CNN and YouTube .
“ If our politicians are going to withhold my medical treatment from me , something that ’s considered torture to do to our enemies in battle , then for the sake of all sick Americans , they better be able to prove that it ’s necessary , with evidence and not just with words . ”
In responses to questions posed by New Hampshire voters at campaign events , all three leading Republicans have claimed that marijuana is either too dangerous for medical use or not needed because adequate substitutes exist — claims that are contradicted by published scientific data .
In letters being delivered today to each of the three candidates , Kampia cited their specific statements and challenged them to supply proof .
In his letter to Giuliani , Kampia wrote :
“ We find it notable that you dismiss marijuana as too dangerous for medical use , while your law firm represented Purdue Pharma — the makers of the highly addictive and toxic opioid OxyContin — given that the company paid $ 634.5 million in fines and penalties for misleading doctors and patients about the drug ’s abuse potential , and given that a growing body of evidence suggests that medical marijuana can reduce the use of such highly addictive opioid painkillers . ”
The billboard will accompany MPP ’s Stuart Cooper this afternoon as he delivers letters from Kampia to the McCain and Romney headquarters in Manchester .
A visit to Romney ’s national headquarters in Boston is planned for Friday .
Further events with the Pinocchio billboard in New Hampshire and other primary or caucus states are expected .
With more than 23,000 members and 100,000 e-mail subscribers nationwide , the Marijuana Policy Project is the largest marijuana policy reform organization in the United States .
MPP believes that the best way to minimize the harm associated with marijuana is to regulate marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol .

None of the sweets has artificial colours , according to Nestle
The blue sweets were first introduced in 1989 - and discontinued in 2006 as part of a drive to remove artificial ingredients in children 's food .
Makers
Nestle say the new colouring comes from a seaweed called spirulina .
The firm says the other seven colours in the packs also have no artificial colours and flavourings .
This is part II of II of the article how picurls.com was created .
In part one we made a universal plugin - based website scraper in Perl to get posts from social news and social bookmarking websites .
In this part I will describe the database design and how the user interface was done in PHP and Smarty template and caching engine .
Database design
I chose SQLite database for this project because of its simplicity - the whole database is a single file and its excellent performance and memory footprint .
The only thing I am concerned with is concurrency issues .
SQLite FAQ says :
SQLite allows multiple processes to have the database file open at once , and for multiple processes to read the database at once .
When any process wants to write , it must lock the entire database file for the duration of its update .
But that normally only takes a few milliseconds .
Other processes just wait on the writer to finish then continue about their business .
However , client / server database engines ( such as PostgreSQL , MySQL , or Oracle ) usually support a higher level of concurrency and allow multiple processes to be writing to the same database at the same time .
This is possible in a client / server database because there is always a single well - controlled server process available to coordinate access .
If your application has a need for a lot of concurrency , then you should consider using a client / server database .
But experience suggests that most applications need much less concurrency than their designers imagine .
If picurls gets really popular people might have start getting database errors when posting comments or updating their profiles .
I certainly do not want to create such a negative user experience .
The database uses the most simple SQL constructs and thus can can easily be moved to a client / server database engine if something bad happens .
Here is how the database scheme of the first version of picurls looks :
CREATE TABLE items ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT , title STRING NOT NULL , sane_title STRING NOT NULL , url STRING NOT NULL , thumb STRING NOT NULL , site_id INTEGER NOT NULL , date_added DATE NOT NULL , visible BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 ) ; CREATE TABLE tmp_items ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT , title STRING NOT NULL , url STRING NOT NULL , date_added DATE NOT NULL , site_id INTEGER NOT NULL , tries INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 ) ; CREATE TABLE comments ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT , comment STRING NOT NULL , item_id INTEGER NOT NULL , user_id STRING NOT NULL , anonymous_name STRING , ip_address STRING NOT NULL , date_added DATE NOT NULL ) ; CREATE TABLE sites ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY , name STRING NOT NULL UNIQUE , sane_name STRING NOT NULL UNIQUE , url STRING NOT NULL UNIQUE , visible BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 , priority INTEGER NOT NULL ) ; CREATE TABLE users ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT , username STRING NOT NULL UNIQUE , password STRING NOT NULL , data STRING , ip_address STRING NOT NULL , date_regged DATE NOT NULL , date_access DATE NOT NULL , can_login BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 ) ; CREATE INDEX IDX_sites_sane_name on sites ( sane_name ) ; CREATE INDEX IDX_sites_priority on sites ( priority ) ; CREATE INDEX IDX_items_site_id on items ( site_id ) ; CREATE INDEX IDX_items_date_added on items ( date_added ) ; CREATE INDEX IDX_items_sane_title on items ( sane_title ) ; CREATE INDEX IDX_comments_item_id on comments ( item_id ) ; CREATE INDEX IDX_comments_user_id on comments ( user_id ) ; CREATE INDEX IDX_comments_date_added on comments ( date_added ) ; CREATE INDEX IDX_comments_item_user_ip on comments ( item_id , user_id , ip_address ) ; CREATE INDEX IDX_users_username on users ( username ) ; INSERT INTO sites ( name , sane_name , url , priority ) VALUES ( ' Digg ' , ' digg ' , ' http://www.digg.com', 1 ) ; INSERT INTO sites ( name , sane_name , url , priority ) VALUES ( ' Reddit ' , ' reddit ' , ' http://reddit.com', 2 ) ; INSERT INTO sites ( name , sane_name , url , priority ) VALUES ( ' del.icio.us ' , ' delicious ' , ' http://del.icio.us', 3 ) ; INSERT INTO sites ( name , sane_name , url , priority ) VALUES ( ' StumbleUpon ' , ' stumbleupon ' , ' http://www.stumbleupon.com', 4 ) ; INSERT INTO sites ( name , sane_name , url , priority ) VALUES ( ' Flickr ' , ' flickr ' , ' http://www.flickr.com', 5 ) ; INSERT INTO sites ( name , sane_name , url , priority ) VALUES ( ' Simpy ' , ' simpy ' , ' http://www.simpy.com', 6 ) ; INSERT INTO sites ( name , sane_name , url , priority ) VALUES ( ' Furl ' , ' furl ' , ' http://www.furl.net', 7 ) ; INSERT INTO sites ( name , sane_name , url , priority ) VALUES ( ' Boing Boing ' , ' boingboing ' , ' http://www.boingboing.net', 8 ) ; INSERT INTO sites ( name , sane_name , url , priority ) VALUES ( ' Wired ' , ' wired ' , ' http://www.wired.com', 9 ) ; INSERT INTO users ( id , username , password , ip_address , date_regged , date_access , can_login ) VALUES ( 0 , ' anonymous ' , 'x ' , ' 0.0.0.0 ' , ' 1970-01-01 00:00:00 ' , ' 1970-01-01 00:00:00 ' , 0 ) ;
As I mentioned in part one I want the whole project to be reusable in the future ( I already have an idea what I will fork from this project ) .
You might have noticed that the database schema almost does not contain fields specific to picurls ( except ' thumb ' field in items and tmp_items tables ) .

If SQLite becomes unsuitable for picurls at some point , I can just dump the database and use almost the same database schema ( maybe changing a few field types ) in MySQL or PostgreSQL .
User Interface Design
I chose PHP programming language as the server side language for the user interface of picurls .
One of the reasons is that it is one of the most popular programming language and as I am releasing the full source code of picurls , I expect someone to help me with adding features or just spotting bugs :)
The logic behind handling requests of the user interface works similar to the web.py framework .
First we define the URL structure , and specify which scripts will handle which request URLs .
Here is an example of picurl 's URL structure :
$ pages = Array ( '#^/(?:index\ .(? :html|php ) ) ?$ #' => ' page-index.php ' , # main page handler '#^/ site/( \w+ ) (?:-( \d+ ) )?. html# ' => ' page-site.php ' , # site handler ( digg , reddit etc ) '#^/item /([a-z0-9-]+) .html# ' => ' page-item.php ' , # single item handler '#^/login.html# ' => ' page-login.php ' , # login page handler '#^/register.html# ' => ' page-register.php ' , # registration page handler '#^/logout.html# ' => ' page-logout.php ' , # logout page handler '#^/my-comments (?:-( \d+ ) )?. html#'=> ' page-my-comments.php ' , # my comment page handler '#^/my-profile.html# ' => ' page-my- profile.php ' # my profile page handler ) ;
For example , a request to ' http://picurls.com/site/digg-3.html' would get handled by ' page - site. php ' script .
The value ' 3 ' ( page number ) would get saved , so the page - site . php knew which page number got requested .
Each request to the server gets handled by the default webserver index file - index. php .
To have it this way I set up mod_rewrite to rewrite URLs to index.php :
< IfModule mod_rewrite.c> RewriteEngine On RewriteBase / RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule . /index.php [ L ] </ IfModule >
It is very important to have human readable URLs , such as ' http://picurls.com/item/animals-really-can-get-along-pictures.html' and not something like ' http://picurls.com/item.php?id=37'.
This way the website will rank better on search engines and people will easier find what they were looking for .
I noticed that people coming from search engines to digpicz and redditmedia have most often searched for a set of keywords they remembered from the picture .
Here is the index .
php script that handles the URL requests and dispatches them to appropriate scripts :
See catonmat.net/ftp/picurls-index.phps
And here is the page - site . php script which handles requests for pictures from particular site ( such as digg or stumbleupon ) :
See catonmat.net/ftp/picurls-page-site.phps
The actual contents of the pages get served by Smarty templating and caching framework .
It is a good practice to separate application logic and content from its presentation .
Read the about Smarty page for an example why it's a good practice if you have not done it before .
As I went with a dynamic ( PHP ) solution for serving contents and I expect the website to become quite popular and I am on a server with limited resources , I needed to find a good and fast way to display contents of the website .
Smarty has exactly what I am looking for - support for caching .
The first version of picurls.com does not do caching dynamically ( based on content change ) , instead it just caches pages for some constant time and then flushes cache until the next request .
That 's about it . :)
Please ask in the comments if you want a more detailed explanation of some software components !
Download Picurls Website Source Code
All the scripts in a single .zip :
Download link : catonmat.net/ftp/picurls-dot-com-website-source-code.zip
The source code is released under GNU General Public License .
If you use the source and create your own picurls - like website you must link back to my ( this ) blog https://catonmat.net and you must link back to http://picurls.com!
The .zip archive contains several subdirectories :
cache - directory where Smarty keeps cached pages .

db - directory where the SQLite database is kept .
I included a sample database with 90 pictures - 10 pictures from each of the sites picurls.com takes contents from ( digg , reddit , delicious , flickr , stumbleupon , simpy , furl , wired and boing boing ) .

To get your own picurls website running , you will have to configure config .
php file in www directory where you need to specify full path to the sqlite database ( in db directory ) .
That 's just the user interface , though .
No new items will ever be retrieved from websites because you have to submit the scraper up .
The instructions would take another article .
If you want to try , though , look at cronjob.sh shell script in scripts directory .
Running this script periodically will scrape websites for new posts which look like images posts and try to insert them in the database ( you will have to change some constants in picurls_db_inserter.pl script ) .
After this script has run , pic_mover.pl script has to be run ( also needs constants changed ) .

There are several human characteristics considered to be genetically predetermined and evolutionarily innate , such as immune system strength , physical adaptations and even sex differences .
These qualities drive the nature versus nurture debate and ask of our species , who is more successful and why ?
Psychologists Agneta Herlitz and Jenny Rehnman in Stockholm , Sweden asked an even more complicated question of human predisposition :
Does one ’s sex influence his or her ability to remember every day events ?
Their surprising findings did in fact determine significant sex differences in episodic memory , a type of long - term memory based on personal experiences , favoring women .
Specific results indicated that women excelled in verbal episodic memory tasks , such as remembering words , objects , pictures or everyday events , and men outperformed women in remembering symbolic , non-linguistic information , known as visuospatial processing .
For example , the results indicate a man would be more likely to remember his way out of the woods .
However , there are also sex differences favoring women on tasks such as remembering the location of car keys , which requires both verbal and visuospatial processing .
“ In addition , women are better than men at remembering faces , especially of females , ” described Herlitz and Rehnman , “ and the reason seems to be that women allocate more attention to female than to male faces . ”
To determine this particular finding , the psychologists presented three groups of participants with black and white pictures of hairless , androgynous faces and described them as ‘ female faces , ’ ‘ male faces ’ or just ‘ faces . ’
The findings , which appear in the February issue of Current Directions in Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , indicate that women were able to remember the androgynous faces presented as female more accurately than the androgynous faces presented as male .
In additional studies , psychologists also discovered that women perform better than men in tasks requiring little to no verbal processing , such as recognition of familiar odors , and that the female episodic memory advantage increases when women utilize verbal abilities and decreases when visuospatial abilities are required .
Environmental factors , such as education , seem to influence the magnitude of these sex differences , as well .
While the probability of genetically - based differences between the quality of male and female memory remains unknown , the results suggest that females currently hold the advantage in episodic memory .

Apple is in talks with both DoCoMo , Japan ’s top carrier , and number three Softbank about launching the iPhone , but both have balked over the share of subscriber revenue that Apple is demanding , sources at the Japanese companies said on Tuesday .
Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs met DoCoMo President Masao Nakamura in San Francisco earlier this month , a company source said .
The two discussed the terms of a deal should DoCoMo , which controls over half of Japan ’s mobile market , become exclusive carrier partner for the iPhone , he said .
“ The negotiations are not going smoothly , as Apple ’s conditions are extremely hard to meet , ” the source said .
“ The ball is in Apple ’s court right now . ”
Apple 's talks with Softbank , which bought Vodafone 's VOD.L local unit in 2006 , could be a negotiating tool to win a favorable deal with DoCoMo , another source said .
Spokesmen at DoCoMo and Softbank declined to comment .

In watching this disturbing feed in which an audience member challenges Senator John Kerry concerning the 2004 presidential outcome , you will clearly see he was not a threat to anyone .
So , the question is ; why did the police move in and taser this man for asking a question that is most likely in the minds of others ?
I noticed that this same feed was picked up by MSNBC and was bantered about by Tucker Carlson and Willy Geist who is a frequent guest of his .
Geist opines this man ’s question as being “ strange ” and who is he to judge a question that has been on the minds of many as I read various political lists ?
Most likely he opined it “ strange ” because the man cites ‘ Skull and Bones ’ which is a society that both Senator Kerry and President Bush belonged to while attending Yale .
CBS did a piece on Skull and Bones back in June of 2004 in which they wrote of it , “ Bonesmen , as they 're called , are forbidden to reveal what goes on in their inner sanctum , the windowless building on the Yale campus that is called the Tomb . ”
I do not know about you , but I find that strange and not the question asked of Kerry ’s and Bush ’s membership to it .
This event took place at the University of Florida and I am of the opinion that a university is a place where students are supposed to be learning and that does mean asking questions .
They should be free to ask questions of invited guests .
Should n’t they ?
Geist states that this man “ disrupted ” the event as he asked that question of Senator Kerry .
From what I saw it was the police who disrupted the event .
This is disturbing on so many levels where a citizen of this country cannot even ask a question of an elected representative without being ensnared , a taser gun used on them and ultimately arrested .
Senator John Kerry served in the military and the military is used to fight for our freedoms and one of those freedoms is the first amendment to our United States Constitution .
Yesterday was Constitution Day and Senator Kerry should have stood in defense when that amendment reads , “ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances . ”
The man arrested was exercising his right of free speech in asking that question .
He was petitioning the government for a redress of grievances ” since Senator Kerry is an elected representative of the Senate .
From what I viewed he was calmly asking the question thereby fulfilling that the people have the “ right to peacefully assemble ”
Geist opined that the “ student became more and more worked up ” Wait , just wait , Mr. Geist .
He was not getting worked up , but was calmly asking a question of Kerry .
Mr. Geist , he was not being “ annoying ” or “ pestering ” Senator Kerry as you so stated on that program , merely asking a question and even citing Greg Palast .
Now let me opine on this arrest .
Instead of standing up on that stage , Senator Kerry should have told those police officers to stand down since he represents this government and he should have upheld our United States Constitution which he is sworn to uphold .
The chilling words that I heard is when this young man who had every right to ask these questions of Senator Kerry was , “ Help ! ” … “ What have I done ? ” and “ I did n’t do anything ! ”
To that young man , you have not done anything and your first amendment rights were violated .
I also think what bothered me is the humorous nature both Carlson and Geist treated this abridgement of free speech .
They did so as they enjoy their first amendment rights day - in and day - out .
To that I also add , shame on both of them for treating this in such a jovial manner .
I have often said of our founders , they were geniuses when it came to drafting the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
They must be saying how dumb some are for not upholding these rights guaranteed to ‘ we the people ’ .
Northeastern University and a start - up company cofounded by an associate professor have filed a patent - infringement suit against Google Inc. , claiming that database technology patented in 1997 was misappropriated by the world 's most popular Internet search service .
" This particular patent has to do with the fundamental database architecture , which they use to serve up every single result they serve to you , " said Michael Belanger , president of Jarg Corp. in Waltham .
Jarg is a privately funded developer of advanced search technology .
The company was cofounded by Northeastern associate professor Kenneth P. Baclawski and holds an exclusive license to the patent , which is owned by Northeastern .
The patent covers a method for chopping up database queries into multiple portions and having each part processed by a different computer .
This allows for much faster searching of huge databases , like Google 's vast index of Web pages on the Internet .
Though Google was incorporated in 1998 , Belanger said he and Baclawski had no idea the company might be infringing the patent , until about 2 1/ 2 years ago .
That 's when a representative of a Boston - area law firm , which Belanger declined to name , told him of seeing a presentation by Google that described the company 's Web search technology .
The database search technique described in the presentation resembled Northeastern 's patented technology , the law firm told Belanger .
" When a law firm tells us that it 's very likely that the Google architecture is the fundamental architecture on which our company is founded , we have a fiduciary responsibility to our investors to do something , " Belanger said .
He did further research and became convinced Google was using the patented technology .
But the law firm that provided the original tip refused to take the case unless it was paid in advance , and Jarg could n't afford the fees .
" We are aware of the complaint and believe it to be without merit based upon our initial investigation , " said Google spokesman Jon Murchinson .
Northeastern University declined to comment .
Belanger said it took him 2 1/ 2 years to find lawyers who would take the case on a contingency basis - meaning they only get paid if they win .
On Tuesday , those lawyers filed suit against Google in US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in Marshall , a venue that specializes in patent cases .
According to the research firm LegalMetric , patent plaintiffs who sue in Marshall win 78 percent of the time .
In addition , said Jay Sandvos , partner at Bromberg & Sunstein , an intellectual property law firm in Boston , the Texas court tends to issue higher - than - average financial awards to victorious plaintiffs .
" If you 're going to take on a contingency case , you want to feel you 're going to get a big payoff , " said Sandvos .
" The Eastern District of Texas tends to be friendly that way . "
But Sandvos said that while some frivolous patent suits are filed in Marshall , many serious litigants favor the Texas court as well , thanks to its vast experience in handling such cases .
" Because they have so much patent litigation , they have a certain expertise , " Sandvos said .
Belanger said he has no interest in shutting down Google .
" We expect them to be generous enough to pay a normal royalty " if Northeastern and Jarg win the case .
Northeastern will get half of whatever money is left after the lawyers are paid and other expenses are covered .
But any such outcome is a long way off .
Sandvos predicted it will be one to two years before the case goes to trial .

Could the next UK census be the final one of its kind ?
The US Patriot Act allows personal data held by companies in the US to be made available to intelligence agencies .
But Treasury Minister Angela Eagle told MPs the government had received legal assurances this would not happen if Lockheed Martin wins the census bid .
The defence company is one of two firms competing for the £ 450 m contract .
People in the UK are suspicious of anyone that tries to make lists
Angela Eagle , Treasury Minister
The other bidder is German telecoms company T - Systems , part of the Deutsche Telecom group .
MPs on the Commons Treasury sub - committee raised concerns about data security , following recent data lost by HM Revenue and Customs and the DVLA , which used a US sub - contractor to process learner driver forms .
Legal advice
They also quizzed Ms Eagle - the minister in charge of national statistics - about the Patriot Act , which they said could be used by the US authorities to access personal data without the consent of those concerned .
" We have received legal advice that there is no risk that that would happen , " she told the committee on Wednesday .
" Some of the arrangements that would be made would ensure that data was owned and kept within the UK .
" There has been no evidence of the US Patriot Act being used to subpoena companies that are not US - based . "
The 2001 Patriot Act increased the powers of US law enforcement agencies to monitor telephone and e-mail communications to combat the terror threat - but it has been criticised for infringing civil liberties .
' Extremely anxious '
Ms Eagle said UK - based firms would carry out the census contract on behalf of Lockheed Martin and she was " pretty confident " there would be robust safeguards on the security of data .
The company 's chances of landing the contract would be affected if there were concerns about confidentiality , she told the MPs .
Asked whether there would be a clause in the contract forbidding personal information being sent out of the UK at all , she said she would write to the committee in confidence .
But she added that the census had a 200 - year record of keeping people 's details secure " and we are extremely anxious , from ministers down , that this would not take place " .
Lockheed Martin was involved in running the 2001 census in the UK , when it won a £ 54 m contract to check postcodes and process returned forms .
The government estimated it saved £ 15 m by using a private contractor but the firm was criticised for the late delivery of work .
The budget for the 2001 census was £ 207m .
Final census ?
A full census of the UK population takes place every 10 years , with every household legally obliged to give details of who is living in their house on the day of the survey .
The 2011 census could be the last survey of its kind .
There are concerns it is no longer up to the job of providing reliable data on which to base important public spending decisions , given the UK 's rapidly shifting population .
The Office of National Statistics is looking at other methods of counting the population , such as a compulsory register of addresses .
Ms Eagle told the committee she was " agnostic " about whether the 2011 survey would be the final UK census .
ID cards
She said moves to replace the census with a national address register were dropped in 2006 after a row with the Ordnance Survey over intellectual property rights .
It was thought the government 's ID card scheme " would provide us with a national register in due course " but it was " far too early " to say whether that would happen in practice .
Ms Eagle said a move to an address register of the type used in some other European countries , in which householders have to inform the authorities every time they change address , could be controversial .
" People in the UK are suspicious of anyone that tries to make lists .
" The issue of ID cards has n't exactly been non-controversial - and it would n't be non-controversial to people to have a national address register , I 'll be bound . "
Public spending
Earlier in the session , she said she was confident the ONS would be given an extra £ 25 m to add a " fourth page " to the census form , which might include questions on how long people have been in the UK .
There would also be extra cash to improve the quality of population statistics generally , she told MPs .
According to figures quoted by Conservative MP Graham Brady - prepared for him by the House of Commons library from existing research - the public purse will be £ 9.5 bn short in 2011 / 12 because of population underestimates .
Ms Eagle said she had not seen the figures but added : " I am confident we have got systems in place to respond if there was to be a gap of that sort . "
Campaigners , led by The Green Party , have called on the government to reject Lockheed Martin 's census bid over its role in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Everyone has heard of stories about hidden messages in songs , many of which could only be heard by playing the record backwards .
That was in the vinyl era .
CD owners had to rip their songs into wav files and process them with a suitable software tool .
For example the manpage of SoX describes its reverse efect as “ Reverse the sound sample completely .
Included for finding Satanic subliminals ” .
Some years ago I was listening to a CD by the Scottish band Urusei Yatsura when I heard the disctintive sound of a ZX Spectrum audio tape in one of its tracks .
That sound had already been used several times by some artists ( such as Aphex Twin ) , but this time it was very sharp and sounded like a complete program .
So I loaded it into the emulator and I found a funny satanic message written by the band :
The source code ( it was written in BASIC ) had some comments , including this one :
What is sadder ?
a. Finding this
b. Writing it
For those interested , this message can be found at the beginning of the song “ Thank you ” from their last album “ Everybody loves Urusei Yatsura ” .
You can also load this program using a ZX Spectrum emulator .

Editor ’s note :
This week , Eco -Libris blogger Raz Goldenik takes a look at a new ( and potentially greener ) method for selling books : by the chapter .
This post was originally published on Saturday , February 23 , 2008 .
I read few days ago in Springwise ( a great source to new interesting ideas ) about a new initiative of Random House : Selling books by the chapter .
Random
House explains the logic behind the new initiative : “ Sometimes what you want is a slice instead of the whole pie .
That ’s why we ’re offering a new reading experience– the ability to purchase individual chapters .
Imagine that !
Downloading and reading exactly the part of a book that meets your needs ” .
The first book to be offered by them is Made to Stick written by Chip Heath and Dan Heath .
This book actually looks like a very interesting book .
Here ’s the book description on its website :
Why do some ideas thrive while others die ?
And how do we improve the chances of worthy ideas ?
In Made to Stick , accomplished educators and idea collectors Chip and Dan Heath tackle head - on these vexing questions .
Inside , the brothers Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that “ stick ” and explain sure - fire methods for making ideas stickier , such as violating schemas , using the Velcro Theory of Memory , and creating “ curiosity gaps . ”
The process is very simple — on the book ’s website you can find a short description of each one of the six chapters of the book and its epilogue .
You can choose the chapter that ’s right for you and download it as an Adobe Digital Editions file for $ 2.99 .
The introduction and index are available for free with the purchase of any chapter .
If you want to purchase the paper version of the book , you can still do it for $ 24.95 ( or the audio CD for $ 29.95 ) .
I like this idea as it generates more incentives for customers to download the book ( or the chapters they are interested at in this case ) instead of buying the paper version .
As Springwise writes , this idea wo n’t work for every book , as most books you want to read from page one to the last page , but it can definitely work for guide books , such as Made to Stick .
Random
House is already involved for almost two years in a green initiative that is aimed to increase its usage of recycled paper to 30 % by 2010 .
I ’m not sure if Random House had the goal of reducing the usage of virgin paper when they came up with their chapters initiative , but it ’s definitely goes a welcomed by product .
Now we should only see if this initiative will really work .
I guess other publishers will wait as well before jumping into the water with similar initiatives .
We ’ll keep you posted as always .
So , you have to make a sequel , but the original cast wants no part of it .
Also , the plot of the first film makes a sequel logically impossible .
Are you going to let that stop you ?
Of course not !
As the below movies prove , you 're in good company !
Well , you 're definitely in company anyway .

10 Evan Almighty Sequel To : Bruce Almighty Tenuous Connection :
Evan Baxter , the anchor from the first movie .
Oh , and God. Continue Reading Below Advertisement Plot Summary :
Congressman Evan Baxter is told to build an Ark , and he has to do it using ancient tools , because God is kind of a dick .
Why It Does n't Work :
The first movie 's premise was an interesting ' what - if ' fantasy : " What if you had the powers of God ? "
Pondering this question while ignoring Jim Carrey as he twisted his stupid face around made Bruce Almighty almost tolerable .
Evan Almighty takes this a step further and asks an even more thought - provoking question : " What if you had to build a boat ?
And also , you had a beard ? "
For the sequel , news anchor Evan Baxter has become a congressman .
How ?
Jim Carrey made him say a bunch of stupid crap on live television .
You 'd think saying " my tiny little nipples went to France " might make the campaign a bit challenging .
Should n't God have mentioned this to Evan ?
" Hey , remember when you said a bunch of embarrassing stuff on live television , and how it 's haunted you every day of your life , since it 's totally unexplainable and frightening that someone else took control of your body ?
Yeah , that was my fault . "
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
That 's just the beginning of the dickishness from Evan Almighty 's God , who presumably could have used
His powers to prevent the flood , rather than have Evan build a stupid - ass boat .
It 's almost like they found it hard to write a family comedy based on the time God got mad and drowned the entire planet .
Obama manager : Clinton already had her ' Red Phone ' moment Nick Juliano
Published : Friday February 29 , 2008

Print This Email This Barack Obama 's presidential campaign manager responded to an ominous new commercial from Hillary Clinton that seems to question whether the young Illinois senator can protect the country .
" It 's 3 am and your children are safe and asleep .
But there 's a phone in the White House and it 's ringing .
...
Your vote will decide who answers that call , " says a spooky sounding narrator in Clinton 's new ad , which began airing in Texas Friday .
David Plouffe , Obama 's campaign manager , said the ad should cause voters to question the judgment of both presidential candidates , where he said Obama has the advantage .
" Sen. Clinton has already had her red phone moment ... in 2002 .
It was on the Iraq war , and she and John McCain and George Bush " displayed the same judgement , Plouffe told reporters on a conference call Friday .
Clinton was joined by a majority of Senate Democrats , including former presidential candidate John Edwards , and every Republican in voting for the 2002 resolution that authorized the invasion of Iraq .
The Clinton campaign responded on its own conference call , with her advisers insisting the ad was not meant as an attack on Obama , rather it was trying to pose a question to voters .
" This is a positive ad , it has very soft images , " Clinton 's chief strategist Mark Penn told reporters .
Clinton adviser Howard Wolfson began the call saying the campaign was " very proud " of the ad .
The Obama campaign announced Friday morning that it would re-release a commercial featuring Air Force Gen. Merrill A. McPeak , a former member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , praising the Illinois senator 's judgement .
After the call with Obama 's staff , McPeak and other foreign policy advisers spoke to reporters on a conference call , which was held simultaneous with the Clinton campaign's .
McPeak said the ad raised questions of what kind of temperament voters should look for in their president , and argued Obama was better suited for the Oval Office .
" Barack has shown that he has exactly the kind of temperament we need , " McPeak said .
" He 's the kind of guy that military leadership will want to see in the White House , someone you can predict what his action is going to be . "
Sen. Richard Durban ( D - IL ) said Obama 's opposition to the war demonstrated he had the judgement to be president .
" I can recall when it was 12:50 a.m. and the date was Oct. 11 2002 , it was truly a red phone moment on the floor of the Senate , " Durbin said , referring to the date of the Iraq war resolution , which he voted against .
" Seventy - seven senators gave the wrong answer . "
Clinton 's advisers charged that Obama 's war opposition amounted to little more than giving a speech at an anti-war rally in 2002 , and they noted that he and Clinton have voted the same on Iraq measures in the chamber since he was elected in 2004 .
Plouffe said the arguments in Clinton 's ad were worn out and noted its similarity to Walter Mondale 's " Red Phone " ad from the 1984 primary and Lyndon Johnson 's infamous " Daisy " ad , which only aired once during the 1964 campaign .
Clinton 's latest ad was created by the same ad - man responsible for Mondale 's Red Phone .
Clinton adviser Wolfson disputed the similarity to the daisy ad .
" The dandelion [ sic ] ad envisions basically the apocalypse , " he said .
" And that is not at all what this ad does . "
The latest Clinton ad " will not be effective whatsoever , " Plouffe predicted , going on to praise Obama 's judgement for opposing the war from the start .
He also noted that Clinton and McCain , the Republicans ' presumptive nominee , have been sounding similar themes in their national security - based attacks on Obama .
" John McCain and Hillary Clinton showed the same judgment on Iraq , " Iran and diplomacy , Plouffe said .
" It 's a mindset that needs to change . "

Note on point - free programming style
This old comp.lang.
functional article by Albert Y. C. Lai , makes the point that Unix shell pipeline programming is done in an essentially " point - free " style , using the shell example : grep ' ^X - Spam - Level ' | sort | uniq | wc -l and the analogous Haskell code : length .

filter ( isPrefixOf " X - Spam - Level " )
Neither one explicitly mentions its argument , which is why this is " point - free " .
In " point - free " programming , instead of defining a function in terms of its effect on its arguments , one defines it by composing the component functions themselves , directly , with higher - order operators .
For example , instead of : foo x y = 2 * x + y one has , in point - free style : foo = (+ ) .
( 2 *) where ( 2 *) is the function that doubles its argument , and (+ ) is the ( curried ) addition function .
The two definitions of foo are entirely equivalent .
As the two examples should make clear , point - free style is sometimes natural , and sometimes not , and the example chosen by M. Lai was carefully selected to bias the argument in favor of point - free style .
Often , after writing a function in pointful style , I get the computer to convert it automatically to point - free style , just to see what it looks like .
This is usually educational , and sometimes I use the computed point - free definition instead .
As I get better at understanding point - free programming style in Haskell , I am more and more likely to write certain functions point - free in the first place .
For example , I recently wrote : soln = int 1 ( srt ( add one ( neg ( sqr soln ) ) ) ) and then scratched my head , erased it , and replaced it with the equivalent : soln = int 1 ( ( srt . ( add one ) . neg . sqr ) soln )
I could have factored out the int 1 too : soln = ( int 1 . srt .
add one .
neg . sqr ) soln I could even have removed soln from the right - hand side : soln = fix ( int 1 . srt .
add one .
neg .
sqr ) but I am not yet a perfect sage .
Sometimes I opt for an intermediate form , one in which some of the arguments are explicit and some are implicit .
For example , as an exercise I wrote a function numOccurrences which takes a value and a list and counts the number of times the value occurs in the list .
A straightforward and conventional implementation is : numOccurrences x [ ] = 0 numOccurrences x ( y:ys ) = if ( x == y ) then 1 + rest else rest where rest = numOccurrences x ys but the partially point - free version I wrote was much better : numOccurrences x = length .
filter ( == x )
Once you see this , it 's easy to go back to a fully pointful version : numOccurrences x y = length ( filter ( == x ) y )
Or you can go the other way , to a point - free version : numOccurrences = ( length . ) . filter .
( == ) which I find confusing .
Anyway , the point of this note is not to argue that the point - free style is better or worse than the pointful style .
Sometimes I use the one , and sometimes the other .
I just want to point out that the argument made by M. Lai is deceptive , because of the choice of examples .
As an equally biased counterexample , consider : bar x = x*x + 2*x + 1 which the automatic converter informs me can be written in point - free style as : bar = ( 1 + ) . ap ( (+ ) . join ( * ) ) ( 2 *)
Perusal of this example will reveal much to the attentive reader , including the definitions of join and ap .
But I do n't think many people would argue that it is an improvement on the original .
( Maybe I 'm wrong , and people would argue that it was an improvement .
I wo n't know for sure until I have more experience . )
For some sort of balance , here is another example where I think the point - free version is at least as good as the pointful version : a recent comment on Reddit suggested a >>> operator that composes functions just like the .
operator , but in the other order , so that : f >>> g = g .
f or , if you prefer : ( >>>) f g x = g( f( x ) )
The point - free definition of >>> is : ( >>>) = flip (. ) where the flip operator takes a function of two arguments and makes a new function that does the same thing , but with the arguments in the opposite order .
Whatever your feelings about point - free style , it is undeniable that the point - free definition makes perfectly clear that >>> is nothing but .
with its arguments in reverse order .

When European naturalists first visited the New World Tropics they saw vast forests that seemed untouched by humans .
While indigenous people often lived in these forests , their populations were small .
This led to a perception of tropical forests as primeval , “ virgin ” forests .
In the last few decades , this perception has changed - large areas now covered by mature forests have a history of cultivation .
In many cases , “ primeval ” forests are less than 500 years old .
La Selva biological station in Costa Rica is one of the premier research stations for Neotropical biology .
Prior to archaeological study of the site , much of it was assumed to be free of human influence .
However , the discovery of pre-Columbian artefacts led to the discovery that the site had been occupied at least 3000 years ago .
Charcoal was more abundant in alluvial terraces ( flatter areas with deeper , more fertile soil ) and less abundant in the less fertile upland soils .
A chronology , established by Sol ( 2000 ) 1 , divided the La Selva into four archaeological phases : La Cabaña 1000 – 1550 CE ; La Selva 500 – 1000 CE ; El Bosque 300 BCE– 500 CE ; La Montaña 1500 –300 BCE .
To better understand the history of the site , Lisa Kennedy of Virginia Tech and Sally Horn of the University of Tennessee , Knoxville , undertook a study of sediment cores extracted from the Cantarra swamp2 , a 0.5 ha wetland dominated by perennial herbs .
They used pollen , charcoal and macrofossils to reconstruct the environmental history of the site .
Wetlands are frequently used to reconstruct vegetation histories .
As sediments accumulate in bodies of water , plant pollen , fern spores and charcoal fragments are trapped .
Pollen coats are extremely tough , and decay takes place very slowly in waterlogged soils .
If the vegetation surrounding the site changes , different types of pollen will be deposited into the site .
Someone with the patience to sort through these cores can observe thousands of years of history in a few metres of sediment .
The most obvious evidence of human activity is the presence of corn ( Zea mays subsp. mays ) pollen .
Corn is a cultivated species which does very poorly without human intervention .
Thus , the presence of corn pollen in the wetland sediments is direct evidence of agriculture .
Corn pollen shows up from 880 CE to somewhere between the mid-1600s and mid-1800s .
Pollen of other species like Amaranths , Asteraceae ( the sunflower family ) , and other grasses and herbs also peak during and before the “ corn zone ” , often at the same time that charcoal density peaks .
This may also reflect cultivation , although it could represent weedy species establishing after fires .
Corn pollen was found in sediments about 1300 years older at another lake about 2 kn distance from this one .
The authors suggested that disturbance in this time period at Cantarra swamp may have represented the cultivation of root crops ( which do n’t leave the kind of pollen signature that corn does .
As a forest ecologist , I find some of the “ other evidence of disturbance ” to be the most interesting .
There are several peaks of Cecropia pollen , and to a lesser extent Trema pollen .
These are fast - growing species that are usually associated with large gaps in the forest - specifically the type that human agricultural activities may have suggested .
Other peaks of pollen belonging to forest species suggests that periods of forest recovery were interspersed with the cultivated times .
This is very interesting stuff .
We are too inclined to interpret forests as “ primeval ” .
In many cases , what our eyes see as ancient is only a few centuries old .
It is important to understand that if we want to construct realistic models of forest dynamics .

Mozillaハッカーであ るRobert O'Callahanによる、 「 UTF - 16はダメ、UTF -8でいいじゃん」という話。
私も前に書いたような気がするけど、 UTF -16は良くない。まず、第一にUTF-16はバイト単位のCES( Character Encoding Scheme ) でないので エンディアンの影響を受ける。これは結局同じ名前で2種類のCESがあるのと同じである。
それを区別するための方策 がBOM ( Byte Order Mark ) だが、 これが輪をかけてよくない。 BOM の文字としての意味 は「 ZERO WIDTH NON - BREAKING SPACE 」なので、
これは見えない文字である。付いているかどうかひと目でわからない文字は
面倒なだけである。うっかり文字列やファイルの途中に混じってしまったら目も当てられない。
さらにその 全身 前身であ るUCS2 と比較して 、 UTF - 16は固定長ではない。ので、n番目の文字をアクセスするコストは 普通に実装すればO(n )である。
UCS2 の頃に重大な選択を 「 してしまった 」Javaとかはともかく、 これから選ぶならUTF -16はありえない。 もう、ダメの三連荘。
UTF -16がダメなら、なにを選ぶのか。 ここではUTF-8を推奨している。私も(条件つきで)賛成する。
UTF -8は、エンディンアン問題と無縁である。
BOM も不要だ( 付けられるけど ) 。メモリ効率 もUTF -16よりはずっといいし。 可変長であるという点はUTF-16同様だけど、
それもそんなに問題ではない。
というのも、そもそもn番目の要素へのアクセス(ここではCharAt(n)と呼ぶ ) は

Well , it had to happen .
Madonna has been a terrible actor in many , many films and now - fiercely aspirational as ever - she has graduated to being a terrible director .
She has made a movie so incredibly bad that Berlin festivalgoers were staggering around yesterday in a state of clinical shock , deathly pale and mewing like maltreated kittens .
She is also the producer and co-author of the script .
If she 'd done the location catering as well , they 'd have had a Jonestown situation on their hands .
Madonna has made a dumb and tacky comedy - drama about three people sharing a flat in a quaintly conceived " London " and her conception of super - cool streetwise reality is so clueless it's as if Marie Antoinette had made a film about cake - munching peasants .
One of her characters is a pill - popping pharmacy assistant ; one 's a wannabe ballerina forced through poverty to work at a lap - dancing club ; and the third is a Ukrainian punk - poet who earns a few bob humiliating masochists while wearing ex-Soviet military garb in his ratty bedroom .
This last is played by Eugene Hutz , who does occasionally raise a smile , but everything else is a mess .
Madonna 's script is a nightmare of crass and fatuous stereotypes : south Asians , Jews , gays - no one escapes her lack of insight or common sense .
Despite living in Britain for many years , she has only the sketchiest notion of what the place is like .
Her film reaches a Zen state of pure offensive awfulness when the lap - dancer 's mentor comes round with a gigantic wad of £ 20 notes .
This was her " tips from last night " .
Her " tips " ?
From " last night " ?
Perhaps Madonna really does think that this is what lap - dancers make in a night .
Or perhaps it's what she thinks they ought to make , or what they 'd make if she was playing a lap - dancer in her acting pomp , the 80s era of Desperately Seeking Susan , whose picturesque vision of Bohemian life this film faintly and tragically recalls .
Oh dear .
How is it possible that the exhilaratingly talented star from that time has dwindled to such a dullard ?

Clinton , Obama bank major donations from Abramoff 's former law firm Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday February 20 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Jack Abramoff has been the specter haunting Republican politicians for a few years now .
The disgraced GOP lobbyist , who pled guilty in 2006 on fraud and corruption charges , burrowed his way deep into Washington , DC 's political elite , leading to the convictions of top Bush administration officials and contributing to 2006's electoral calamity for the Republican Party .
Abramoff's fall also encouraged Democrats to reposition themselves as the party of clean government .
But in 2008 , it might be harder for the Democratic presidential nominee to make the same case that his or her Congressional counterparts successfully built in 2006 .
Facing off against likely Republican nominee John McCain , who as a senator led early investigations into Abramoff 's corrupt lobbying , either Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama could find themselves linked to Abramoff and his former law firm , the Miami - based giant Greenberg Traurig .
A RAW STORY review of Federal Election Commission records shows that Clinton and Obama both received hundreds of thousands of dollars of donations from Greenberg Traurig staff .
Moreover , each candidate has particularly benefited from the largesse of the firm 's top management and its registered lobbyists .
The Clinton and Obama campaigns were both contacted on Monday and Wednesday for comment regarding donations to their candidates from Abramoff - linked donors .
Neither responded to RAW STORY 's queries .
Giant firm takes out checkbook for Democratic candidates Greenberg Traurig has offices all over the United States and is one of the largest law firms in the country .
It hired Jack Abramoff and his lobbying team in 2001 , and fired him in 2004 when knowledge of a federal investigation of his practices became public .
Greenberg Traurig attorneys have actively donated to this season 's presidential campaigns .
A Feb. 12 article from the Huffington Post noted that McCain , the senator whose Indian Affairs Committee investigations helped bring down Abramoff and embroiled Greenberg Traurig in years of legal trouble , took in more than $ 100,000 from the firm 's employees .
But McCain was not alone among the likely presidential candidates in receiving big money from Greenberg Traurig attorneys .
According to FEC records , Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign , along with her earlier senate campaign and political committees , received just under $ 200,000 in donations from Greenberg Traurig employees .
And Barack Obama , who has not been operating a national political campaign as long as Clinton , is halfway there , banking just over $ 100,000 from the firm 's attorneys .
But beyond merely earning donations from the firm 's attorneys , Clinton and Obama have both benefited heavily from the firm 's registered lobbyists and management .
In all , Senator Clinton received just under $ 50,000 in donations from Greenberg Traurig 's registered lobbyists who represent interests ranging from health insurance company Humana to New Balance Shoes to Dole Food .
But Clinton also received about $ 18,000 in donations from lobbyists who worked directly on accounts with Abramoff himself .
Both Joe Reeder and Alan Slomowitz , who worked alongside Abramoff for various clients , have donated to Clinton 's presidential campaign .
Reeder worked with Abramoff on an account with Voor Huisen Project Management , which appeared to be a shell corporation and paid Abramoff $ 2.1 million in fees .
Slomowitz was a registered lobbyist for the American International Center , a money laundering front organization established by Abramoff and run by a lifeguard in Delaware , as well as many of his other accounts .
The other two Clinton donors , Ronald Platt and Michael D. Smith , both left Greenberg in the aftermath of the Abramoff controversy , and only made donations to Clinton 's pre-presidential political committee " Friends of Hillary . "
Smith , along with three other former Greenberg employees , was asked to resign from Greenberg after improperly taking payments from a firm run by Michael Scanlon , an Abramoff associate who pled guilty to a conspiracy charge in 2005 .
None of these four lobbyists have been charged with breaking any laws .
Obama , on the other hand , appears to have remained mostly true to his frequent pledges to not take money from lobbyists .
But recently , one appears to have made it through the firewall .
Richard Edlin , a registered Greenberg Traurig lobbyist with SPI Spirits , gave the senator $ 1,500 in the 4th Quarter of 2007 .
While Edlin was not a member of Abramoff 's team , he was implicated in one of the convicted lobbyists ' money laundering schemes , according to a June 2006 report in The Hill .
However , as the article points out , " It is unclear ... whether Edlin knew the true purpose , " of the phony donation he was asked to process , and Edlin was not charged with any wrongdoing .
While Obama has not received as much as Clinton did from Greenberg Traurig lobbyists , the firm 's top executives , who made the decisions to initially hire and eventually fire Abramoff , have given heavily to the Illinois Democrat .
Firm founders Larry Hoffman and Robert Traurig , along with current executive director Cesar Alvarez were all included in $ 14,500 from the firm 's executive leadership to Obama .
Clinton also received $ 7,600 from the firm 's general counsel and the chair of its New York office , who appear to have hedged their bets and given to Obama as well .
GOP could launch attacks on Abramoff connections While Congressional Democrats have made the most hay out of links between their Republican opponents and Abramoff , the GOP has demonstrated its willingness to attack Democrats on the same charges .
In Dec. 2005 , the National Republican Senatorial Committee circulated a document entitled " Democrats do n't know Jack ? " which identified 40 Democratic senators who had received donations from Abramoff and his partners .
In specific '06 campaigns , the very Abramoff - tied lobbyists who gave to Clinton and Obama were highlighted by Republican candidates and their organizations .
For instance , Republican Bob Corker , who defeated Harold Ford , Jr. in a tight Tennessee Senate race in 2006 , slammed his opponent for receiving money from Greenberg Traurig attorneys , including Michael Smith and Alan Slomowitz .
" Congressman Ford needs to explain all his dealings with Team Abramoff and acknowledge that his recent denials were completely false and misleading .
Tennesseans have the right to the truth about the Congressman 's connection to these lobbyists , ' " read a Jan. 2006 statement from Corker 's campaign after Ford denied receiving money from Abramoff - connected lobbyists .
And even at the local level , Republicans have brought up Abramoff's attorneys ' donations to Democratic candidates .
In a 2007 race for the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in Virginia , Republican Gary Blaise charged Democratic incumbent Gerald Connolly with taking money from Joe Reeder , who also gave to Clinton 's campaign .
Unlike Corker , Blaise did not succeed in defeating his Democratic opponent .
Whether or not Republicans will actually confront the eventual Democratic candidate on donations from lobbyists tied to Abramoff is anybody 's guess .
McCain 's receipt of donations from the firm and its lobbyists might at least cancel out any effort by the GOP to make that move .
But if they do , the charge might stick better to Senator Obama , who has declared strongly on the campaign trail that he wants to get lobbyists out of federal elections .
" In terms of how we 've been running this campaign , we have seen that I have not taken money from federal registered lobbyists .
We are not taking money from PACs , " Obama argued in the very first Democratic presidential debate in South Carolina last April .
Obama also has gone a step further , arguing that he has a record of promoting government ethics initiatives within the Senate .
" I 'm the only person on this stage who has worked actively just last year passing -- along with Russ Feingold -- some of the toughest ethics reforms since Watergate -- making sure that lobbyists could not provide gifts and meals to congressmen , making sure the bundling of monies by lobbyists was disclosed , " he argued in an October 2007 debate in Philadelphia .
Clinton , on the other hand , has stood by her general willingness to accept money from lobbyists .
" A lot of those lobbyists whether you like it not , represent real Americans , " Clinton declared at the Yearly Kos convention last August , shaking off some jeers from the audience .
" They represent nurses , they represent , you know , social workers ... and yes , they represent corporations and they employ a lot of people .... the idea that somehow a contribution is going to influence you , I just ask you to look at my record , I have been fighting for the same things , my core principles have not changed . "
And Clinton 's willingness to take money from lobbyists has paid off .
According to the Center for Responsive Politics , Clinton took in just under a million dollars from political action committees in 2007 .
In defense of ‘ political disharmony ’
It looks like the column of the day actually ran yesterday , with David Ignatius ’ piece in the WaPo about the state of America ’s readiness for another possible terrorist attack .
Ignatius ’ column believes we should all be more united .
Behind who or what ?
Well , that ’s the tricky part .
Ignatius describes what he believes would happen in the wake of another deadly assault .
Liberals would blame the Bush administration for making America a more vulnerable target .
Did n’t the war in Iraq inflame Muslim terrorists around the world ?
Would n’t we have been safer today if we had focused on al - Qaeda in Afghanistan rather than embarking on a costly war that has sapped the military and CIA and added to America ’s enemies ?
These arguments are n’t imaginary :
We hear them every day , almost as rehearsals for the post - attack finger - pointing .
And how would conservatives respond ?
They would blame liberals , who , in their view , have weakened America ’s anti-terrorism defenses .
Could n’t we have stopped the bombers if critics had n’t exposed the National Security Agency ’s secret wiretapping program ?
Would n’t aggressive CIA interrogation techniques have yielded more intelligence that might have prevented the tragedy ?
Did n’t congressional demands to withdraw from Iraq embolden the terrorists ?
I can hear the voices on talk radio and cable news right now .
Ignatius added that our divisions are so deep , we are not “ politically healthy . ”
We had a shared sense of purpose after 9/11 , but it has “ totally …dissipated . ”
I suppose some of this is , to an extent , true .
Americans have substantive policy disagreements about national security and foreign policy .
The past several years have , thanks to an intentional strategy , driven people apart .
Ignatius ’ description of what the arguments would be in the event of another attack is probably right .
But like most David Broder columns , Ignatius leaves out the important parts .
Are the left ’s arguments right ?
Are the right ’s ?
What should Americans with sincere disagreements do ?
Ignatius does n’t say .
He simply wants the nation to “ get serious , and to get ready . ”
It all sounds very nice , except for the details .
As Ignatius describes it , Americans simply need to get unified .
Unified behind what ?
Behind unity .
I do n’t doubt that Ignatius means well , but his argument is lazy and hard to take seriously .
It ’s easy to urge Americans to get together ; it ’s a challenge to lay out an agenda for them to rally behind .
It ’s simple to tell people to stop arguing ; it ’s hard to talk about solutions .
Ignatius ’ column sings the virtues of national unity as if policy differences were inherently petty and parochial .
They ’re not .
Those arguments he attributes to the left and right are indicative of a serious disagreement about the direction of the country .
His
Post column seems to suggest that the debates simply end so that we can all get together , arm in arm , against our common foes .
But that ’s not “ politically healthy . ”
As Atrios put it :
It ’s an interesting phenomenon with people who spend much of their lives in the Beltway that they forget that disagreement is at the root of politics .
It is n’t a flaw .
People have genuine disagreements about stuff .
There ’s nothing wrong with that .
There ’s no virtue in everyone agreeing about everything , even if they all happen to agree with David Ignatius .
It ’s frightening , not delightful , when people blindly line up to support their nominal leaders .
Ignatius believes we ’re not prepared for the “ next attack . ”
I ’m very much inclined to agree .
If he wants to perhaps talk about what we should do about this in his next column , I ’ll be sure to take it seriously .

There are some intuitive reasons for this : our data stores can be compromised , and so can our communications .
But the most important reason is that we have to think of our users ' passwords as sensitive personal data .
Their passwords are their key to their privacy , so they are personal , they are sensitive , and no one ( not even us ) has the right to know them .
And we must honor this if we want to gain our user 's trust .
Almost all modern web applications need , in one way or another , to encrypt their users ' passwords .
We could say that , from the moment that an application has users , and users sign in using a password , these passwords have to be stored in an encrypted way .
2 . The algorithm
So , we have to encrypt passwords , but ... how ?
Here comes our first rule :
I. Encrypt passwords using one - way techniques , this is , digests .
This is because , except for some specific scenarios ( mainly regarding legacy integration ) , there is absolutely no reason for a password being decrypted .
If you encrypt your passwords using password - based encryption ( a two - way technique ) and an attacker gets to know your encryption password , all of your user passwords will be revealed ( and , probably , all at a time ) .
If you do n't have such encryption password ( or key ) to be able to decrypt , this risk disappears , and the attacker will have to trust on brute force or similar strategies .
' But what if one of my users loses his / her password ?
Ca n't I remind it to him / her ? '
The answer is a loud and clear NO .
Not only you cannot do such a thing as reminding their passwords to them , but in fact you should not even have a way to get to read / know / see your users ' passwords , no matter if you are the system administrator !
If one of your users loses his / her password , just reset it to a new value and send him / her a message to a verified email address with the new one , asking to change it as soon as possible .
Now that it is clear that password digesting is a must , which digest algorithm should we use ?
Well , there are several , and it largely depends on your needs .
The most used ones are :
MD5 algorithm
SHA family : SHA - 1 algorithm and SHA - 2 variants ( SHA - 224 , SHA - 256 , SHA - 384 and SHA - 512 )
In most cases , both MD5 or SHA - 1 will be adequate choices for password digesting , although applying these algorithms will not be enough , as we will see later on .
When we are told that we should use digests for password encryption , and given that digests are one - way techniques , the next question that arises to our minds usually is : ' If I can not decrypt passwords ... how will I check if my users entered the right one ?'
There is a very simple answer to this question , which we will adopt as our second rule :
II .
Match input and stored passwords by comparing digests , not unencrypted strings .
Which means that , once our users have entered their passwords at sign in , we will digest their input with the same algorithm we have previously used when storing the password , and then compare both digests .
As digest algorithms guarantee that two equal inputs will get equal digests ( which is not true in the opposite direction ) , if digests match we can then consider the password input by the user as valid .

There is a 50 percent chance Lake Mead , a key source of water for millions of people in the southwestern United States , will be dry by 2021 if climate changes as expected and future water usage is not curtailed , according to a pair of researchers at Scripps Institution of Oceanography , UC San Diego .
Without Lake Mead and neighboring Lake Powell , the Colorado River system has no buffer to sustain the population of the Southwest through an unusually dry year , or worse , a sustained drought .
In such an event , water deliveries would become highly unstable and variable , said research marine physicist Tim Barnett and climate scientist David Pierce .
Barnett and Pierce concluded that human demand , natural forces like evaporation , and human - induced climate change are creating a net deficit of nearly 1 million acre-feet of water per year from the Colorado River system that includes Lake Mead and Lake Powell .
This amount of water can supply roughly 8 million people .
Their analysis of Federal Bureau of Reclamation records of past water demand and calculations of scheduled water allocations and climate conditions indicate that the system could run dry even if mitigation measures now being proposed are implemented .
The paper , “ When will Lake Mead go dry ? , ” has been accepted for publication in the peer - reviewed journal Water Resources Research , published by the American Geophysical Union ( AGU ) .
“ We were stunned at the magnitude of the problem and how fast it was coming at us , ” said Barnett .
“ Make no mistake , this water problem is not a scientific abstraction , but rather one that will impact each and every one of us that live in the Southwest . ”
“ It ’s likely to mean real changes to how we live and do business in this region , ” Pierce added .
The Lake Mead / Lake Powell system includes the stretch of the Colorado River in northern Arizona .
Aqueducts carry the water to Las Vegas , Los Angeles , San Diego , and other communities in the Southwest .
Currently the system is only at half capacity because of a recent string of dry years , and the team estimates that the system has already entered an era of deficit .
“ When expected changes due to global warming are included as well , currently scheduled depletions are simply not sustainable , ” wrote Barnett and Pierce in the paper .
Barnett and Pierce note that a number of other studies in recent years have estimated that climate change will lead to reductions in runoff to the Colorado River system .
Those analyses consistently forecast reductions of between 10 and 30 percent over the next 30 to 50 years , which could affect the water supply of between 12 and 36 million people .
The researchers estimated that there is a 10 percent chance that Lake Mead could be dry by 2014 .
They further predict that there is a 50 percent chance that reservoir levels will drop too low to allow hydroelectric power generation by 2017 .
The researchers add that even if water agencies follow their current drought contingency plans , it might not be enough to counter natural forces , especially if the region enters a period of sustained drought and / or human - induced climate changes occur as currently predicted .
Barnett said that the researchers chose to go with conservative estimates of the situation in their analysis , though the water shortage is likely to be more dire in reality .
The team based its findings on the premise that climate change effects only started in 2007 , though most researchers consider human - caused changes in climate to have likely started decades earlier .
They also based their river flow on averages over the past 100 years , even though it has dropped in recent decades .
Over the past 500 years the average annual flow is even less .
“ Today , we are at or beyond the sustainable limit of the Colorado system .
The alternative to reasoned solutions to this coming water crisis is a major societal and economic disruption in the desert southwest ; something that will affect each of us living in the region ” the report concluded .

I ’m in touch with Mike Gravel ’s campaign manager , I have a good relationship with the Gravel Campaign and I believe that I have a good shot at getting him to come on my radio show at the following ; http://www.blogtalkradio.com/liberalpro.
You can see an interview I had with Sen .
Gravel that I posted on OpEdNews.com at called " An Exclusive Interviw with Mike Gravel " .
This was before the campaign for 2008 really started to get moving .
I saw in Mike Gravel a voice that echoed my concerns as well as many other people that believe in the Progressive movement .
Mike Gravel needs a fresh look and we need to reevaluate his candidacy now that he is the only Progressive voice left .
We can pretty well agree that Sen .
Gravel does n’t have too much of a chance to capture the Democratic nomination .
However , his candidacy leaves other options on the table for the Progressive community .
A strong showing by Gravel could lead the way for a third party candidate .
The thought of a third party provokes many Democrats to decry such an idea , believing that a Progressive bid would throw the election to the Republicans .
Well that may be true , but if it indeed happened to become a reality , the Democrats have nobody to blame for that but the Democrats .
The nasty business of excluding Kuchinich and Gravel from the debates is something that they must own .
They can punish Florida for moving up their Primary date , but they willingly went along with the networks when they excluded two of their own .
That was unconscionable .
Let them reap the benefits .
If an independent run by a Progressive would actually spoil the chances of the Democrats gaining the Presidency , they should have thought about that when they excluded the voice of the Progressive wing of the party .
Either we have a Democratic election or we do n’t .
Party politics have tainted this election as so many elections that have come before this one .
If Gravel can garner enough delegates to bring the fight for delegates to the convention floor , we might see someone other than Obama and Clinton , the two corporate candidates , lead the Democratic ticket .
They have both led nasty campaigns that foreshadow a possible nasty administration .
We have already lived through eight years of dirty tricks and lies told to the American people on a daily basis , I do n’t believe that Americans are looking for another four to eight years of dirty politics .
I surely do n’t believe that we are ready to accept 28 years of two families sharing the White House .
We must keep Senator Mike Gravel in this race .
We need to make it known that we want him included in future debates .
The corporate media should not have the last word on which candidates we should be allowed to hear .
We have let them get away with far too much already .
Gravel emerging as the last Progressive voice now gives us a focal point in regards to which candidate we should support ( at least his right to be heard ) .
We need to support Gravel regardless of which candidate actually gets our vote .
As I said before , either we have a democracy or we do n’t .
We should press the issue and answer this question that we all have thought about at one time or another .
That ’s the way I see it .
A religion that supposedly embraces pain , and specifically its release through crying , as a means to move to a higher state of being .
This religion is supposedly practiced by all the members of the heavy metal group
Tool , but since it is nearly impossible to find any writings about Lachrymology that are n't related to Tool , it is obvious that Lachrymology was a hoax made up by Tool .
Since several of Tool 's songs attack the cult Scientology , it is likely that Lachrymology was made up as a satire of Scientology , especially since Tool has claimed that Scientology has drawn many followers away from Lachrymology .
Fibromyalgia is a real disease .
Or so says Pfizer in a new television advertising campaign for Lyrica , the first medicine approved to treat the pain condition , whose very existence is questioned by some doctors .
For patient advocacy groups and doctors who specialize in fibromyalgia , the Lyrica approval is a milestone .
They say they hope Lyrica and two other drugs that may be approved this year will legitimize fibromyalgia , just as Prozac brought depression into the mainstream .
But other doctors  including the one who wrote the 1990 paper that defined fibromyalgia but who has since changed his mind  say that the disease does not exist and that Lyrica and the other drugs will be taken by millions of people who do not need them .
As diagnosed , fibromyalgia primarily affects middle - aged women and is characterized by chronic , widespread pain of unknown origin .
Many of its sufferers are afflicted by other similarly nebulous conditions , like irritable bowel syndrome .

So , did the “ Obama Girl ” actually vote for Barack Obama on Tuesday ?
Actually , no .
Last summer , the music video “ I Got a Crush on Obama ” was a Web hit , splashing a seductive performance by a 26 - year - old model named Amber Lee Ettinger across millions of screens and prompting deep thoughts about candidates and sex appeal , the YouTube generation of voters , viral marketing and so forth .
On Tuesday night , City Room ran into Ms. Ettinger at an election - watching party in Greenwich Village and asked how things went at the polls .
“ I did n’t get a chance to vote today because I ’m not registered to vote in New York , ” she said .
So where is Obama Girl registered to vote ?
“ New Jersey . ”
Um , but did n’t New Jersey also hold a primary ?
True .
The problem , she explained , was that she was sick in New York City and was unable to get back across the Hudson River to the polls in Jersey City .
“ I was in Arizona for the Super Bowl — every time I get in the airplane I get sick , ” said Ms. Ettinger , who did manage to make it to the Svedka Fembot election returns party at Chinatown Brasserie .
( The Fembot campaign for the White House , the Svedka marketing manager assured us , is not a commentary in any way on Hillary Rodham Clinton , who defeated Mr. Obama in both New York and New Jersey . )
Ms. Ettinger said she had dragged herself out Tuesday night under duress only because she was scheduled to perform at the Bowery Poetry Club .
The previous day she had hit the streets of New York to interview voters , where a Daily News photographer snapped her picture on Park Avenue .
And how did she feel about missing the opportunity to cast her ballot for her one and only ?
“ I ’m a little upset but I really could n’t help it today , ” she said mournfully .
Well , she might get another chance in November .
Or not .
Jefferson opposed a central bank ( Bank of the United States ) , central planning of money , and paper ( fiat ) currency ; Paul opposes a central bank ( Federal Reserve ) , central planning of money , and paper currency .
Jefferson opposed deficit spending and warned of the dangers of national debts ;
Paul opposes deficit spending , warns of the dangers of national debts , and never voted for an unbalanced budget .
Jefferson was hostile to restrictions of individual liberty ( Alien and Sedition Acts ) ;
Paul is hostile to restrictions of individual liberty ( Patriot Act , MCA , spying , etc. ) .
Jefferson was hostile towards federal taxation ;
Paul has never voted to raise federal taxes and desires the abolishment of the federal income tax .
Jefferson believed in the doctrine of enumerated powers and a strict construction of the Constitution ; as does Paul .
Jefferson opposed a consolidated central government ; as does Paul .
Jefferson opposed government social engineering and federal redistribution of wealth schemes ; as does Paul .
Jefferson opposed imperialism and entangling alliances ; as does Paul .
Jefferson supported a non-interventionist foreign policy ; as does Paul .
Jefferson opposed the Hamiltonian vision of blending political and financial power ( corporatism ) ; as does Paul .
Jefferson supported an armed citizenry ( pro firearm ) ;
Paul has never voted for a federal restriction on gun ownership .
Jefferson supported a citizen legislature ;
Paul refuses his congressional pension , supports the abolishment of the congressional pension program , votes against congressional pay raises , and supports a major reduction in congressional salary .
Jefferson wrote patriotism was defending liberty ; as does Paul .
I 've heard a few Republican and Democratic party loyalists confused by conservative and liberal support for the Ron Paul campaign say , " How is that possible ? "
How can apparent polar opposites across a broad range of varying issues support the same presidential candidate ?
I think the answer can be found in early American politics with the Hamiltonian vs Jeffersonian political divide .
What is the Hamiltonian vs Jeffersonian divide ?
Hamiltonians favor interventionism , domestic and international .
A strong national government , central planning , flexible limitations on political power , taxation , foreign entanglements , and a penchant for military adventurism - all the hallmarks of collectivism .
An aggrandized central government is necessary for a Hamiltonian nation .
Jeffersonians favor non-interventionism , domestic and international .
A weak federal government , defense of individual liberty and property rights , strict limitations on political power , anti-taxation , and a foreign policy of neutrality and peace - all the hallmarks of individualism .
A limited central government is necessary for a Jeffersonian republic .
This early American philosophic divide is consistent : interventionism vs non-interventionism .
The modern " conservative " vs " liberal " paradigm , which has divided liberty into multiple parts , has evolved into a hod podge of domestic and international interventionism and non-interventionism with conservative Americans frequently supporting economic Jeffersonianism and international Hamiltonianism , and liberal Americans frequently supporting the opposite , economic Hamiltonianism and international Jeffersonianism .
Political liberties are divided along these lines as well .
Conservatives defend the enumerated 2nd Amendment Right of self - defense against liberal intervention .
Liberals defend the enumerated 4th Amendment Right of privacy against conservative intervention .
However , in Washington , D.C. , both parties are , to a large degree , the two wings of Hamilton .
The Bush Administration and congressional Republicans endorse economic intervention , as well as political intervention like the Patriot Act , while their Democratic counterparts favor economic intervention and give halfhearted speeches in favor of civil liberties before voting with the Republicans .
Washington Democrats endorse international intervention , albeit a kinder gentler version than the Republicans .
The Washington establishment rarely questions if the central government should intervene .
The overwhelming majority of debates are over which central plan to implement .
A Hamiltonian vision of government .
Ron Paul , unlike the Washington establishment and any major party presidential candidate for decades , is a true Jeffersonian .
Conservative and liberal support for Ron Paul is based on Jeffersonian issues in both parties .
Small government fiscal conservative Republicans may support Paul .
The ardent defenders of the Iraq War will not .
Liberal Democrats most concerned with civil liberties and foreign military adventurism may support Paul .
The ardent defenders of welfarism , social engineering , and redistribution of wealth will not .
Paul 's candidacy remains a long shot simply because Ron Paul is a Jeffersonian living in a Hamiltonian world .

1. The Monowheel
In 1869 , French craftsman Rousseau of Marseilles built the first in history 's line of unsuccessful monocycles .
Sitting inside the monowheel , a rider steered the contraption by shifting his or her weight in the desired direction .
As if that was n't difficult enough , the massive outer wheel remained directly in the rider 's line of sight at all times .
Braking was also potentially hazardous , as stopping too abruptly would cause the rider to be propelled forward along with the outer wheel .
But perhaps the biggest strike against the monowheel was the immediate comparison of any rider to a gerbil — something even the French would n't tolerate .
2. The Daihatsu Trek
It 's a car !
It 's a bed !
It looks suspiciously like a child 's toy !
For the outdoorsman who has everything except a really expensive Big Wheel , there was the Daihatsu Trek .
A single - passenger off - road vehicle , the Trek not only allowed drivers to travel to remote areas , it also gave them a place to bed down for the evening .
With its collapsible seat , steering wheel , and roll bar , the boxy monstrosity from 1990 offered all the comforts of a really cheap motel room .
And while we can't be sure why the car never made it past the concept stage at Daihatsu , we can only guess members of the off - road focus groups felt silly driving a Transformer .
3. The Avrocar
Much more after the jump .
A quasi hot potato of international engineering , the Avrocar was initially funded by the Canadian government , designed by a British engineer , and eventually assumed by the U.S. Defense Department as part of the Cold War weapons race .
The UFO - like contraption was 18 feet in diameter , but only 3 feet thick .
It featured vertical takeoff and landing and was designed to reach speeds up to 300 mph while remaining elusive to radar .
Unfortunately , the two - person craft was never able to stabilize at heights above 8 feet , nor travel faster than 35 mph .
After eight years and more than $ 10 million , the project was abandoned in 1960 .
4. The Dymaxion
Buckminster Fuller was many things — inventor , philosopher , Nobel Peace Prize nominee , and bearer of a name that makes Frank Zappa 's kids feel average .
Among his many architectural and engineering creations , Bucky tried his hand at automobiles .
In 1933 , using a V - 8 engine loaned to him by Henry Ford , Fuller built the Dymaxion car .
Truly a wonder to behold , the Dymaxion was nearly 20 feet long , got 30 - plus miles to the gallon , held up to 12 people , had a maximum speed of 120 mph , and could do a U - turn in 20 feet , thanks to a single rear wheel that controlled the steering .
Unfortunately , the car 's steering appears to be at fault for a fatal accident at the 1933 World 's Fair , when the Dymaxion was rubbernecked by another car .
Although later evidence placed fault on the driver of the other car , negative publicity surrounding the wreck caused investors to pull away from the project , and Fuller was freed up to build geodesic domes and work on his friendship with John Denver .
The fortunate outcome of the Dymaxion 's failure ?
Denver 's hit tune , " What One Man Can Do , "  which was written for Fuller .
5. Da Vinci's Clockwork Car
Leonardo da Vinci is renowned for his forward - thinking sketches and intricate designs , which included blueprints for a bicycle , a submarine , and a helicopter .
But you can't win 'em all .
Da Vinci also designed a three - wheeled wagon - like device — often referred to as the clockwork car — that never really lived up to the hype .
Its spring - operated design makes it the first - known concept for a self - propelled vehicle .
And because it was designed without a driver 's seat ( though a secondary steering column was present ) and was meant to be programmed along a specific course , the clockwork car is also thought to be one of the world 's first robots .
Some speculate that faulty interpretations of da Vinci 's notes prevented the success of his ideas , but there 's plenty of evidence to the contrary .
When engineers finally constructed a working model of the car in the late 1990s , it only traveled 40 feet .
6 . The KAZ
Originally designed in 2001 to push the limits of electric automotive technology , the KAZ ( Keio Advanced Zero-emission ) vehicle is part science - fiction , part sports car , part limousine , and entirely unattractive .
But the beauty of the KAZ lies in its eight wheels , each powered by its own battery , which allow the luxury concept car to reach speeds in excess of 190 mph without emitting any pollution .
The car 's design also makes for a safe ride because what would normally be the engine compartment is a crushable zone , reducing risk to the driver .
Sadly , the KAZ came off as less luxury automobile and more cartoon , sending the designers back to their drawing boards .
7. The Bell Rocket Belt
Everyone who grew up watching " The Jetsons "  and playing with the Steve Austin action figure dreamed of a day when people travelled to and from work via jet pack .
The tease : a rocket belt developed under military contract by Bell Aerosystems in 1959 .
The hydrogen peroxide - powered Small Rocket Lift Device ( SRLD ) , also known as the Bell Rocket Belt , was flown successfully throughout the 1960s .
Unfortunately , the contract was later dropped , due largely to its limited flight duration ( it held only 21.5 seconds worth of fuel ) .
Although the belts are still used occasionally for entertainment ( the opening of the 1984 Olympics and , most memorably , in the film " Thunderball "  ) , our adolescent dreams of rocket - powered backpack flight will be confined to the silver screen and the funny pages for a while longer .
8. The Amfibidiver
If you 've been looking to practice your spy skills , this is your toy .
The Amfibidiver is a car that 's also a boat that 's also a submarine .
All you have to do is find a way to fit your tuxedo underneath your scuba suit .
Of designing the 007 - mobile , Belgian inventor RenÃ© Baldewijns says it was easy .
" Just take one dream , the fuel tank of an airplane , two bicycles , the motors from five electric wheelchairs , the hull of a sailing boat , seven drink containers ( a real justification for that empty bottle collection ) , several kilos of resin , a few garden seats , and several miles of electrical cables . " 
VoilÃ !
You 've got an Amfibidiver !
Baldewijns built a prototype for the machine , but his health problems caused the project to be shelved before it found commercial realization .
9 . The Superbus
In 1988 , Czech - born architect Jan Kaplicky attempted a feat that flew in the face of all odds : bringing change to Britain .
The Superbus was a sleek , aluminum - bodied craft that charged itself at bus terminals and had the ability to lower its frame at stops to make it easier for passengers to enter and exit .
The design was rejected in favor of the traditional red , double - decker Routemaster buses long associated with London 's public transportation system .
Was the Superbus truly hideous , or was it just one step closer to the 20th century and a decent dental plan ?
We may never know .

In recent years , Bishop Verot Catholic High School in Fort Myers had raised as much as $ 200,000 by selling goods at a dinner auction .
Michael Pfaff , a Cape Coral mortgage broker , used to donate a weekend cruise on his 40 - foot catamaran .
But Mr. Pfaff ’s business has all but disappeared , and he recently sold the boat .
This year , the school canceled the auction and is deferring building maintenance .
The county school district ’s decision to cancel construction of new public schools reflects a broader diminishing of resources .
Developers have to pay so - called impact fees to the district to help fund new facilities .
Two years ago , the district took in $ 56 million in such fees .
Next year , it expects only $ 25 million .
New schools are no longer needed anyway , says the schools superintendent , James W. Browder .
Many families connected to construction and real estate have moved away , so school enrollments are growing more slowly than expected .
This could generate a snowball effect all its own : the new schools were to cost as much as $ 60 million each to build , so canceling them could mean further job cuts for the already reeling building industry .
Mr. Browder points out an upside of the housing downturn : Hiring people has become easy .
In recent years , the school system struggled to find bus drivers , given the abundance of jobs at twice the pay driving dump trucks in home construction .
“ Now , we get 14 applicants for every job , ” he says .
The county government depends on property taxes for a third of its general funding .
Since taxes are assessed based on the previous year ’s real estate values , it has yet to feel a dent .
But agencies are under significant pressure to pare back in anticipation of a dip in next year ’s funds .
Tax - cutting advocates cheer this prospect .
Governments have gotten fat on the boom , they say .
A constitutional amendment facing Florida voters in January would expand tax caps for many residences statewide .
“ All the local governments were drunk with money , ” says Mr. Kest , the finance professor .
“ Now , they ’re going to have to cut back and learn how to manage . ”
This is a list of the origins of 10 slang words or phrases that we all use regularly .
From insults to idiomatic expressions , these are common in virtually all English speaking nations .
1. Idiot
Idiot originally comes from the Greek word Idiotes which was used to refer to a person who was a private individual – or more specifically , one who was so preoccupied with their own personal life that they would not take part in the democratic process .
In the biblical sense , the word referred to an uneducated person .
By the fourteenth century , it could also refer to a clown , a layman ( non-religious ) , or an individual .
Later , however , the Oxford English Dictionary gave it the following definition which has stuck : “ A person so deficient in mental or intellectual faculty as to be incapable of ordinary acts of reasoning or rational conduct ” .
When IQ tests arrived , a person scoring less than 20 was regarded to have earned the “ idiot ’s score ” .
2. Moron
Another Greek word , Moron meant foolish or stupid .
It was first propagated in English by an American psychologist Henry Goddard ( 1886-1957 ) .
In his report to the Journal of Psycho - asthenics about his study of the feeble - minded , he argued for the adoption of the word which he defined as : “ One who is lacking an intelligence , one who is deficient in judgement or sense . ”
It was originally used to refer to an adult with a mental age of between 8 and 12 .
The term has not really made its way into high literature .
3. Cool
Who has n’t used this word at least once in their life when speaking highly of something ?
This meaning of the word is relatively new in English , but not as new as you might think .
The earliest record found so far is from 1884 in the phrase ‘ Dat ’s cool !’.
After that the next is 1902 from the lyrics of a song from the Black and White minstrel show : “ de way we dress is cooler ” .
4 . Third degree
To get the third degree means to be thoroughly questioned .
The third degree of something has been regarded as the upper limit ( or extreme ) even since the time of Shakespeare when he wrote : “ For he ’s in the thirde degree of drinke , he ’s drown ’d ” – referring to a very drunk man .
Therefore , it is a natural progression that when referring to the most extreme type of questioning , it would be referred to as the third degree .
5. Slut
This unpleasant term is used these days to refer to an immoral woman .
But the origin of the term had a far less sinister meaning .
It actually meant a woman who did not keep her room tidy – though it is easy to see that this could be a metaphor for immorality of a sexual type .
In Thomas Hoccleve ’s 1402 Letter to Cupid , we read : “ The foulest slutte of al a toune ” .
This meaning eventually crossed to the word slattern which retains its original meaning of being an untidy woman .
In Victorian English , sluts wool referred to the little piles of dust that gather on the floor if it is not swept .
6. Well Heeled
According to the Chambers Dictionary , well heeled means “ comfortably supplied with money ” and states that it comes from the word heeled , meaning provided with a heel .
Heeled also used to refer to being armed with a revolver .
A person carrying a set of guns was said to be long - heeled .
Despite the Oxford English Dictionary saying otherwise , it appears that the origin of the term actually comes from Cockfighting .
In the early days of cockfighting , the owners would sometimes add spurs to the feet of their birds , putting them at an advantage .
If you did not add spurs to the bird it was said to be naked - heeled .
The use of the term well - heeled in this context is first seen in print in 1866 in a story by Mark Twain .
7. Kick the Bucket
This means “ to die ” .
Many people consider the term to have come from a condemned man standing on an upturned bucket which was then kicked out from under his feet leaving him to hang , but there is no written evidence that this is the case .
In fact , it is more likely from a different type of bucket entirely .
In butchery , when a pig was slaughtered it would be hung from a piece of timber called the bucket beam .
It is mostly likely that in his death throes , the pig ’s feet would bang against the rail to which they were tied .
Therefore , kicking the bucket was a term referring to the last actions of the pig before he finally died .
8. Kinky
Originally this word simply meant something with a bend or twist , probably coming from the Icelandic word meaning to bend your knees .
In time the word was adopted by the criminal world to mean something that was illicit – for example a stolen car may have been referred to as a “ kinky car ” .
But then in 1959 , Colin MacInnes changed the meaning of the word for ever .
In his book Absolute Beginners , he says : “ Suze [ … ] meets lots of kinky characters [… ] and acts as agent for me , getting orders from them for my pornographic photos . ”
From that time on the word was associated with the steamy side of sex .
9. Underhand
Underhand means “ surreptitious ” or on the sly .
The Chambers Dictionary also adds “ with the hand below the elbow or shoulder ” which would suggest doing something on the sly with your hand while distracting the eye .
But the actual origin of the term most likely comes from Archery .
A well known lover of archery , Roger Ascham ( c1515-1568 ) wrote : “ Thus the underhande [ shaft ] must have a small breste , to go cleane awaye oute of the bowe . ”
To shoot underhand was and is a common archery term .
10 . Bob ’s Your Uncle
Bob ’s your Uncle generally means that something is simple or easy or a “ job done ” .
It is most likely that this phrase came about as a result of nepotism ( family favoritism ) .
In the late 1800s , Lord Salisbury ( first name Robert ) was prime - minister of Great Britain .
After his third term he was succeeded by his nephew Arthur .
Arthur had been made Chief Secretary of Ireland in 1886 which caused some scandal .
Suspicions arose that Robert was favoring his nephew Arthur .
The term “ Bob ’s your uncle ” could be used at the time as a sly reference to this charge of nepotism .
Facebook has become the latest website to be found pushing services that deliver highly deceptive security warnings designed to trick users into buying software .
Purveyors of this scam are making use of Facebook Flyers , small ads that get posted on Facebook pages associated with a specific region .
At 5,000 impressions for just $ 10 , it 's a bargain .
We spotted a Flyer targeted at Facebook users in the San Francisco region that purportedly advertised a dating service .
When clicked , the ad delivered a warning that our machine could be infected .
Those who click through are taken to a site for a product called Malware Alarm which informs their machine is " infected with spyware ! "
The site then urges the user to download Malware Alarm .
Clicking on the Flyer that says " Join for Free " brings up this popup .
The warning is part of a scam designed to trick Facebook users into buying unneeded security software .
Security vendors say Malware Alarm 's free version gives bogus security warnings designed to con end users into buying a premium version of the program .
The software has been reported to flag common Windows files and innocuous programs as malware .
Facebook is n't the only site that 's been found to push such " crudware , " as we 've come to call programs such as Malware Alarm .
Last week , a security researcher 's blog hosted on Blogspot was found to also found to redirect users to a site associated with Malware Alarm .
MSN and MySpace have also been found promoting the programs , which also go by the term scareware .
While there are no reports showing Malware Alarm steals passwords , sends out spam or engages in other malicious activity , the program is considered a pariah in security circles .
The ability of its purveyors to infiltrate Facebook 's advertising system raises questions about what else may be slipping through the cracks at the social networking site .
We contacted a Facebook representative to see if they were even aware of the problem but did n't get a response . ®
According to fundamental laws of physics , time is just another coordinate – hash marks along a line with scarcely a preferred direction or flow .
Yet the mind perceives time as an irreversible stream , moving from past to future , experienced in the present .
Manipulating time may make for good science fiction , but it 's hardly conceivable to those unfortunates who do n't have a Tardis or H.G. Wells ' secret recipe .
How can science bridge the gaping gulf between these two versions of time ?
This week , about 50 scientists gather in the Slovakian town of Tatranska Lomnica for a four - day workshop to explore this issue .
Addressing psychological , mathematical , physical and " borderline " research , the event is a crossroads of disciplines and paradigms .
For instance , Metod Saniga of the Slovak Academy of Sciences combines mathematical models and pathology reports of schizophrenic , drug - induced and other abnormal perceptions of time .
Studying patients with a disjointed sense of time , akin to the protagonist in the movie Memento , may seem an odd way to unveil the nature of space - time .
But to Saniga , co-director of the conference with Rosolino Buccheri of the Instituto di Astrofisica in Palermo , Italy , this is one of the most promising roads forward .
Saniga discovered the brain is hard - wired to perceive space and time as interconnected .
" Pathology in time is always accompanied with a pathology of space , in a sense that space either loses dimensions or acquires other dimensions , " he said .
" When time seems to stop , people often feel as if space becomes two - dimensional .
On the other hand , when the subject feels they perceive the past , present and future ( all at once ) , they simultaneously have the impression that space has infinite dimensions . "
In his 1999 presentation ( appendix here ) at the first Nature of Time workshop , Saniga described these states as two forms of what he calls a " pure present " experience .
In one case the present is indefinitely frozen , while in the other the present seems to encompass both past and future events as well .
He illustrates both pathologies with case studies published in Italian , German and English psychological journals .
His current work also encompasses studies of near - death experiences .
He found that most of those who 've crossed over to the other side and back tell similar tales .
For that brief moment of near - death , time loses its meaning .
" A great fraction describes their feelings as beyond any concept of time and space , " he said .
Perhaps similar to the pure awareness that some experienced meditators report , this brief atemporal moment often drastically changes the life of the person who experiences it .
" What is shocking for them is what they believed before to be absolute – three - dimensional space and time flowing at a constant rate – all of a sudden , this belief is shaken , " Saniga said .
Yet incorporating these varied experiences into a larger model is another matter entirely .
Mathematics professor Jonathan D.H. Smith of Iowa State University said he has n't seen a satisfactory mathematical framework so far .
Neither Saniga 's analysis nor conventional models of the mind nor even the quantum consciousness approach of workshop participant Stuart Hameroff of the University of Arizona quite fits .
" I 'm skeptical at the moment – but I 'm willing to be convinced , " Smith said .
On Tuesday , Dick Bierman of the University of Amsterdam presented a report that shook a few foundations .
He repeated and amplified earlier work that studies emotional responses to shocking or erotic imagery , seconds before the subject sees the randomly timed stimulus .
Bierman 's first study , published in 2000 in the book Toward A Science of Consciousness III , found his subjects ' skin conductance change one or more seconds before the disturbing or sexually explicit images appeared .
Yet when mundane images randomly mixed in with the shocking ones were shown , subjects ' skin " presponded " differently .
Bierman 's work may have revealed a crude ability to sense the future , much like the " precogs " in the forthcoming Steven Spielberg movie Minority Report , even if this skill only spans a few heartbeats .
On Tuesday he presented new magnetic resonance imagery from a similar experiment that confirms this result .
More strikingly , he also found the same " pre-sentiment " effect when he re-examined two related studies performed by other independent research teams .
Although neither team set out to study this temporal anomaly , Bierman discovered that an anomaly was indeed there .
Presenting these studies last month at a conference on consciousness in Tucson , Arizona , Bierman said scientists cannot ignore such results , simply because they run afoul of current models of the mind .
" I 'm willing to explore any theoretical framework , " he said .
" I 'm completely driven by the data . "

Each one can hold a SATA - standard hard drive mechanism ( which are as cheap and plentiful as greed and avarice ) .
Just buy some and slide them right in .
Installing drives in the Drobo is no more complicated than inserting a frozen waffle into a toaster .
No screws , no mounting brackets … just push it into the slot until the bay ’s retaining clip clicks into it .
You can mix and match capacities , leave some of the drive bays empty … it does n’t matter .
Dump the storage in and close the door .
Drobo figures everything out all out on its own .
Plug it into your computer and it appears as a standard , single USB storage device ready for formatting .
“ Big deal ! ” you ’re sneering , because you did n’t have a decent breakfast and my mention of waffles has made you cranky .
“ It ’s a RAID storage array .
What ’s different about that ? ”
What ’s different about it is that Drobo is n’t a RAID .
Adding capacity to a RAID is a huge production .
I remind you that Drobo is a cartoon device .
You need more capacity ?
Fine .
Buy another drive mechanism and slide it into a vacant slot .
Presto : your computer now sees the exact same drive with the exact same contents … only it ’s larger .
Please note the things you did not need to do :
You did n’t need to reformat anything .
Drobo saw a new , unformatted mechanism and automatically prepared it and added it to the pool of available storage .
You did n’t need to back up all of your data first .
With a RAID , adding another mechanism means erasing the volume and starting all over again is often a much bigger production , depending on which RAID you bought and how you set it up .
With the Drobo , there ’s really no need to think in advance or understand how any of this works .
You did n’t even need to unmount the volume .
The Drobo and its contents were “ live ” throughout the whole procedure .
If you start a backup of your notebook ’s internal hard drive and you suddenly notice that ( holy crud ! ) you ’re going to run out of free space on the Drobo , you do n’t need to click “ Cancel . ”
You can actually dash to the store , come home with a new mechanism , and slide it in .
Whoops …all four drive bays are already filled .
No problem : just yank out that tiny 160 gig mechanism there on the bottom and replace it with the 500 gig one you ’ve just bought .
Yes , while the Drobo is up and running .
Yes , while the backup is in progress .
Drobo uses cartoon physics , remember ?
Incredible , but true .
Drobo stores your data redundantly , across all of its mechanisms ; in a sense , it acts both as an external hard disk and its own backup .
If you have more than one mechanism in there and one of them fails , absolutely nothing happens .
The green light next to that drive bay turns red ( to encourage you to replace the faulty mechanism before the fire spreads to the rest of the office ) , but your computer will be blissfully ignorant .
This redundancy does create one drawback : if you load up the Drobo with ( for example ) two 250 gig mechanisms plus a 500 and a 750 , you do n’t wind up with 1750 gigs of storage .
As a rule of thumb , the capacity of the largest mechanism becomes overhead , so this example volume would be closer to about a thousand gigabytes .
But it ’s a terabyte of damned - near bulletproof storage that can be expanded on the fly with zero effort .
I insist that it ’s more of a quirk than a drawback .
To remove all confusion , an optional desktop utility as well as a long bar of blue LEDs on the device itself make it clear how much free space is available .
Drobo ’s been out for a few months now , but DroboShare is a brand - new accessory that boosts it from Mega- to Giga - awesome range .
It ’s a flat base that sits under the Drobo and turns it into an network storage device .
If you have the aforementioned desktop utility installed , your Drobo will just magically become available to every Mac or PC in the whole house or office .
But it ’s a standard Samba fileserver .
The software is n’t required … it just automatically locates and mounts the Drobo for you .
Drobo does to conventional hard drives what the iPod did to portable CD players .
It ’s a revolution that was desperately needed and it ’s such a vast improvement over the old way of doing things that thirty minutes after your first flight , you ca n’t imagine traveling by foot ever again .
Howard Dean to the rescue ?
Following up on yesterday ’s reports hinting at the likelihood of a brokered Democratic convention in August , it ’s worth keeping in mind that DNC Chairman Howard Dean apparently has some kind of plan to intervene .
The narrow margin in delegates , and the growing likelihood that it will remain close , prompted concern on Wednesday from the chairman of the Democratic Party , Howard Dean , who said Tuesday night that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton should avoid taking the nominating fight all the way to the party convention in August .
“ I think we will have a nominee sometime in the middle of March or April , ” Mr. Dean said Wednesday on the NY1 cable news channel , “ but if we do n’t , then we ’re going to have to get the candidates together and make some kind of an arrangement .
Because I do n’t think we can afford to have a brokered convention ; that would not be good news for either party . ”
An adviser to Mr. Dean said Wednesday that he had not discussed the idea with either candidate .
“ He was essentially laying down a marker that if need be , he is prepared to step in and try to help resolve the situation , ” the adviser said .
Dean added , “ The idea that we can afford to have a big fight at the convention and then win the race in the next eight weeks , I think , is not a good scenario . ”
That certainly sounds right to me , but I have n’t the foggiest idea what Dean could do .
This is not to say the DNC chair is some kind of figurehead ; he ’s not .
In fact , I think Howard Dean has done a great job implementing an important 50 - state strategy , raising lots of money for the party , helping recruit some great candidates , etc .
But , as a practical matter , Dean can sit down with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , aiming for “ some kind of arrangement , ” but what kind of deal could he offer ?
Obviously , both candidates want the Democratic nomination , and there are n’t any substitutes .
The next best thing , of course , is being the vice presidential nominee , but I ’m still skeptical this could happen , especially in “ the middle of March or April . ”
Even if we put aside the fact that the two candidates do n’t appear to like one another , and have little incentive to pick the other as a running mate , I think there ’s a more practical problem .
By April , Obama and Clinton will probably still be about tied .
Given this , I suspect both would tell Dean , “ Why should I give up and accept the # 2 slot when I ’m this close to winning the nomination ? ”
In short , they should n’t .
If one candidate seems to be dominating by mid-March or April , Dean may find it easier to push one way or another .
But if the landscape looks like it does now , I do n’t see a lot of room for making an “ arrangement . ”
Am I missing something ?
What could Dean and the DNC actually tell these two that would compel one of them to give up and take the VP slot ?
Fluoride , Teeth , and the Atomic Bomb
Introduction : " .... The report offers a glimpse into the history of fluoride , a bio-accumulative toxic that Americans ingest every day .
The authors , Griffiths and Bryson , spent more than a year on research .
With the belief that the information should be withheld no longer , the authors gave their report to Waste Not , and others , with a short note : " use as you wish . "
The science of fluoridating public drinking water systems has been , from day one , shoddy at best .
As we learn from this report , the basis of that science was rooted in protecting the U.S. Atomic bomb program from litigation .
Americans have been convinced that fluoride will save their teeth and we drink more fluoridated water than any other nationality on earth .
We learned about the dirty politics involved in the science and selling of fluoridation to a trusting public .
We spent three months researching fluoride which resulted in the longest newsletter we 've ever produced : Waste Not # 373 .
We learned that fluoride is a poison that accumulates in our bones .
It has been associated with cancer in young males ; osteoporosis ; reduced I.Q. ; and hip fractures in the elderly , to name a few .
George Orwell would have been dazzled by the promotion of this toxic by dental and public health officials and concurrently , the avoidance of this issue by the environmental community .
We think it has a lot to do with the sordid 50 - year history of the promotion of fluoridation by the U.S. Department of Public Health and the American Dental Association .
Rather than acknowledge the accumulating evidence of fluoride 's threat to human health , they have en-trenched themselves in a position that has produced tactics that include the harassment of scientists and dentists who speak out . "
Introduction to " Fluoride , Teeth , and the Atomic Bomb " from Waste Not # 414 ( September 1997 ) where the article was first published
FLUORIDE , TEETH , AND THE ATOMIC BOMB
By Joel Griffiths and Chris Bryson
Some fifty years after the United States began adding fluoride to public water supplies to reduce cavities in children 's teeth , declassified government documents are shedding new light on the roots of that still - controversial public health measure , revealing a surprising connection between fluoride and the dawning of the nuclear age .
Today , two thirds of U.S. public drinking water is fluoridated .
Many municipalities still resist the practice , disbelieving the government 's assurances of safety .
Since the days of World War II , when this nation prevailed by building the world 's first atomic bomb , U.S. public health leaders have maintained that low doses of fluoride are safe for people , and good for children 's teeth .
That safety verdict should now be re-examined in the light of hundreds of once - secret WWII documents obtained by Griffiths and Bryson  including declassified papers of the Manhattan Project , the U.S. military group that built the atomic bomb .
Fluoride was the key chemical in atomic bomb production , according to the documents .
Massive quantities of fluoride  millions of tons  were essential for the manufacture of bomb - grade uranium and plutonium for nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War .
One of the most toxic chemicals known , fluoride rapidly emerged as the leading chemical health hazard of the U.S atomic bomb program - - both for workers and for nearby communities , the documents reveal .
Other revelations include : Much of the original proof that fluoride is safe for humans in low doses was generated by A - bomb program scientists , who had been secretly ordered to provide " evidence useful in litigation " against defense contractors for fluoride injury to citizens .
The first lawsuits against the U.S. A - bomb program were not over radiation , but over fluoride damage , the documents show .
Human studies were required .
Bomb program researchers played a leading role in the design and implementation of the most extensive U.S. study of the health effects of fluoridating public drinking water -- conducted in Newburgh , New York from 1945 to 1956 .
Then , in a classified operation code - named " Program F , " they secretly gathered and analyzed blood and tissue samples from Newburgh citizens , with the cooperation of State Health Department personnel .
The original secret version - - obtained by these reporters -- of a 1948 study published by Program F scientists in the Journal of the American Dental Association shows that evidence of adverse health effects from fluoride was censored by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC )  considered the most powerful of Cold War agencies  for reasons of national security .
The bomb program 's fluoride safety studies were conducted at the University of Rochester , site of one of the most notorious human radiation experiments of the Cold War , in which unsuspecting hospital patients were injected with toxic doses of radioactive plutonium .
The fluoride studies were conducted with the same ethical mind - set , in which " national security " was paramount .
The U.S. government 's conflict of interest -- and its motive to prove fluoride " safe "  has not until now been made clear to the general public in the furious debate over water fluoridation since the 1950's , nor to civilian researchers and health professionals , or journalists .
The declassified documents resonate with growing body of scientific evidence , and a chorus of questions , about the health effects of fluoride in the environment .
Human exposure to fluoride has mushroomed since World War II , due not only to fluoridated water and toothpaste , but to environmental pollution by major industries from aluminum to pesticides : fluoride is a critical industrial chemical .
The impact can be seen , literally , in the smiles of our children .
Large numbers of U.S. young people -- up to 80 percent in some cities -- now have dental fluorosis , the first visible sign of excessive fluoride exposure , according to the U.S. National Research Council .
( The signs are whitish flecks or spots , particularly on the front teeth , or dark spots or stripes in more severe cases . )
Less - known to the public is that fluoride also accumulates in bones 
" The teeth are windows to what 's happening in the bones , " explains Paul Connett , Professor of Chemistry at St. Lawrence University ( N.Y . ) .
In recent years , pediatric bone specialists have expressed alarm about an increase in stress fractures among U.S. young people .
Connett and other scientists are concerned that fluoride  linked to bone damage by studies since the 1930's  may be a contributing factor .
The declassified documents add urgency : much of the original proof that low - dose fluoride is safe for children 's bones came from U.S. bomb program scientists , according to this investigation .
Now , researchers who have reviewed these declassified documents fear that Cold War national security considerations may have prevented objective scientific evaluation of vital public health questions concerning fluoride .
" Information was buried , " concludes Dr. Phyllis Mullenix , former head of toxicology at Forsyth Dental Center in Boston , and now a critic of fluoridation .
Animal studies Mullenix and co-workers conducted at Forsyth in the early 1990 's indicated that fluoride was a powerful central nervous system ( CNS ) toxin , and might adversely affect human brain functioning , even at low doses .
( New epidemiological evidence from China adds support , showing a correlation between low - dose fluoride exposure and diminished I.Q. in children . )
Mullenix 's results were published in 1995 , in a reputable peer - reviewed scientific journal .
During her investigation , Mullenix was astonished to discover there had been virtually no previous U.S. studies of fluoride 's effects on the human brain .
Then , her application for a grant to continue her CNS research was turned down by the U.S. National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , where an NIH panel , she says , flatly told her that " fluoride does not have central nervous system effects . "
Declassified documents of the U.S. atomic - bomb program indicate otherwise .
An April 29 , 1944 Manhattan Project memo reports : " Clinical evidence suggests that uranium hexafluoride may have a rather marked central nervous system effect ....
It seems most likely that the F [ code for fluoride ] component rather than the T [ code for uranium ] is the causative factor . "
The memo  stamped " secret "  is addressed to the head of the Manhattan Project 's Medical Section , Colonel Stafford Warren .
Colonel Warren is asked to approve a program of animal research on CNS effects : " Since work with these compounds is essential , it will be necessary to know in advance what mental effects may occur after exposure ... This is important not only to protect a given individual , but also to prevent a confused workman from injuring others by improperly performing his duties . "
On the same day , Colonel Warren approved the CNS research program .
This was in 1944 , at the height of the Second World War and the nation 's race to build the world 's first atomic bomb .
For research on fluoride 's CNS effects to be approved at such a momentous time , the supporting evidence set forth in the proposal forwarded along with the memo must have been persuasive .
The proposal , however , is missing from the files of the U.S. National Archives .
" If you find the memos , but the document they refer to is missing , its probably still classified , " said Charles Reeves , chief librarian at the Atlanta branch of the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration , where the memos were found .
Similarly , no results of the Manhattan Project 's fluoride CNS research could be found in the files .
After reviewing the memos , Mullenix declared herself " flabbergasted . "
She went on , " How could I be told by NIH that fluoride has no central nervous system effects when these documents were sitting there all the time ? "
She reasons that the Manhattan Project did do fluoride CNS studies  " that kind of warning , that fluoride workers might be a danger to the bomb program by improperly performing their duties -- I can't imagine that would be ignored "  but that the results were buried because they might create a difficult legal and public relations problem for the government .
The author of the 1944 CNS research proposal was Dr. Harold C. Hodge , at the time chief of fluoride toxicology studies for the University of Rochester division of the Manhattan Project .
Nearly fifty years later at the Forsyth Dental Center in Boston , Dr. Mullenix was introduced to a gently ambling elderly man brought in to serve as a consultant on her CNS research -- Harold C. Hodge .
By then Hodge had achieved status emeritus as a world authority on fluoride safety .
" But even though he was supposed to be helping me , " says Mullenix , " he never once mentioned the CNS work he had done for the Manhattan Project . "
The " black hole " in fluoride CNS research since the days of the Manhattan Project is unacceptable to Mullenix , who refuses to abandon the issue .
" There is so much fluoride exposure now , and we simply do not know what it is doing , " she says .
" You ca n't just walk away from this . "
Dr. Antonio Noronha , an NIH scientific review advisor familiar with Dr. Mullenix 's grant request , says her proposal was rejected by a scientific peer - review group .
He terms her claim of institutional bias against fluoride CNS research " farfetched " he adds , " We strive very hard at NIH to make sure politics does not enter the picture . "
Fluoride and National Security
The documentary trail begins at the height of WW2 , in 1944 , when a severe pollution incident occurred downwind of the E.I. du Pont du Nemours Company chemical factory in Deepwater , New Jersey .
The factory was then producing millions of pounds of fluoride for the Manhattan project , the ultra-secret U.S. military program racing to produce the world 's first atomic bomb .
The farms downwind in Gloucester and Salem counties were famous for their high - quality produce  their peaches went directly to the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York .
Their tomatoes were bought up by Campbell 's Soup .
But in the summer of 1943 , the farmers began to report that their crops were blighted , and that " something is burning up the peach crops around here . "
Poultry died after an all - night thunderstorm , they reported .
Farm workers who ate the produce they had picked sometimes vomited all night and into the next day .
" I remember our horses looked sick and were too stiff to work , " these reporters were told by Mildred Giordano , who was a teenager at the time .
Some cows were so crippled they could not stand up , and grazed by crawling on their bellies .
The account was confirmed in taped interviews , shortly before he died , with Philip Sadtler of Sadtler Laboratories of Philadelphia , one of the nation 's oldest chemical consulting firms .
Sadtler had personally conducted the initial investigation of the damage .
Although the farmers did not know it , the attention of the Manhattan Project and the federal government was riveted on the New Jersey incident , according to once - secret documents obtained by these reporters .
After the war 's end , in a secret Manhattan Project memo dated March 1 , 1946 , the Project 's chief of fluoride toxicology studies , Harold C. Hodge , worriedly wrote to his boss Colonel Stafford L. Warren , Chief of the Medical Division , about " problems associated with the question of fluoride contamination of the atmosphere in a certain section of New Jersey .
There seem to be four distinct ( though related ) problems , " continued Hodge ; " 1 . A question of injury of the peach crop in 1944 . "
" 2 . A report of extraordinary fluoride content of vegetables grown in this area . "
" 3 . A report of abnormally high fluoride content in the blood of human individuals residing in this area . "
" 4 . A report raising the question of serious poisoning of horses and cattle in this area . "
The New Jersey farmers waited until the war was over , then sued du Pont and the Manhattan Project for fluoride damage  reportedly the first lawsuits against the U.S. A - bomb program .
Although seemingly trivial , the lawsuits shook the government , the secret documents reveal .
Under the personal direction of Manhattan Project chief Major General Leslie R.Groves , secret meetings were convened in Washington , with compulsory attendance by scores of scientists and officials from the U.S War Department , the Manhattan Project , the Food and Drug Administration , the Agriculture and Justice Departments , the U.S Army 's Chemical Warfare Service and Edgewood Arsenal , the Bureau of Standards , and du Pont lawyers .
Declassified memos of the meetings reveal a secret mobilization of the full forces of the government to defeat the New Jersey farmers :
These agencies " are making scientific investigations to obtain evidence which may be used to protect the interest of the Government at the trial of the suits brought by owners of peach orchards in ... New Jersey , " stated Manhattan Project Lieutenant Colonel Cooper B. Rhodes , in a memo c.c.'d to General Groves .
27 August 1945 Subject : Investigation of Crop Damage at Lower Penns Neck , New Jersey
To : The Commanding General , Army Service Forces , Pentagon Building , Washington D.C.
" At the request of the Secretary of War the Department of Agriculture has agreed to cooperate in investigating complaints of crop damage attributed ... to fumes from a plant operated in connection with the Manhattan Project . "
Signed , L.R. Groves , Major General U.S.A
" The Department of Justice is cooperating in the defense of these suits , " wrote General Groves in a Feb. 28 , 1946 memo to the Chairman of the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Atomic Energy .
Why the national - security emergency over a few lawsuits by New Jersey farmers ?
In 1946 the United States had begun full - scale production of atomic bombs .
No other nation had yet tested a nuclear weapon , and the A - bomb was seen as crucial for U.S leadership of the postwar world .
The New Jersey fluoride lawsuits were a serious roadblock to that strategy .
" The specter of endless lawsuits haunted the military , " writes Lansing Lamont in his acclaimed book about the first atomic bomb test , " Day of Trinity . "
In the case of fluoride , " If the farmers won , it would open the door to further suits , which might impede the bomb program 's ability to use fluoride , " said Jacqueline Kittrell , a Tennessee public interest lawyer specializing in nuclear cases , who examined the declassified fluoride documents .
( Kittrell has represented plaintiffs in several human radiation experiment cases . )
She added , " The reports of human injury were especially threatening , because of the potential for enormous settlements  not to mention the PR problem . "
Indeed , du Pont was particularly concerned about the " possible psychologic reaction " to the New Jersey pollution incident , according to a secret 1946 Manhattan Project memo .
Facing a threat from the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to embargo the region 's produce because of " high fluoride content , " du Pont dispatched its lawyers to the FDA offices in Washington , where an agitated meeting ensued .
According to a memo sent next day to General Groves , Du Pont 's lawyer argued " that in view of the pending suits ... any action by the Food and Drug Administration ... would have a serious effect on the du Pont Company and would create a bad public relations situation . "
After the meeting adjourned , Manhattan Project Captain John Davies approached the FDA 's Food Division chief and " impressed upon Dr. White the substantial interest which the Government had in claims which might arise as a result of action which might be taken by the Food and Drug Administration . "
There was no embargo .
Instead , new tests for fluoride in the New Jersey area would be conducted  not by the Department of Agriculture  but by the U.S. Army 's Chemical Warfare Service because " work done by the Chemical Warfare Service would carry the greatest weight as evidence if ... lawsuits are started by the complainants . "
The memo was signed by General Groves .
Meanwhile , the public relations problem remained unresolved  local citizens were in a panic about fluoride .
The farmer 's spokesman , Willard B. Kille , was personally invited to dine with General Groves  then known as " the man who built the atomic bomb "  at his office at the War Department on March 26 , 1946 .
Although he had been diagnosed with fluoride poisoning by his doctor , Kille departed the luncheon convinced of the government 's good faith .
The next day he wrote to the general , wishing the other farmers could have been present , he said , so " they too could come away with the feeling that their interests in this particular matter were being safeguarded by men of the very highest type whose integrity they could not question . "
In a subsequent secret Manhattan project memo , a broader solution to the public relations problem was suggested by chief fluoride toxicologist Harold C. Hodge .
He wrote to the Medical Section chief , Col .
Warren : " Would there be any use in making attempts to counteract the local fear of fluoride on the part of residents of Salem and Gloucester counties through lectures on F toxicology and perhaps the usefulness of F in tooth health ? "
Such lectures were indeed given , not only to New Jersey citizens but to the rest of the nation throughout the Cold War .
The New Jersey farmers ' lawsuits were ultimately stymied by the government 's refusal to reveal the key piece of information that would have settled the case  how much fluoride du Pont had vented into the atmosphere during the war .
" Disclosure ... would be injurious to the military security of the United States , " wrote Manhattan Project Major C.A Taney , Jr. The farmers were pacified with token financial settlements , according to interviews with descendants still living in the area .
" All we knew is that du Pont released some chemical that burned up all the peach trees around here , " recalls Angelo Giordano , whose father James was one of the original plaintiffs .
" The trees were no good after that , so we had to give up on the peaches . "
Their horses and cows , too , acted stiff and walked stiff , recalls his sister Mildred .
" Could any of that have been the fluoride ? " she asked .
( The symptoms she detailed to the authors are cardinal signs of fluoride toxicity , according to veterinary toxicologists . )
The Giordano family , too , has been plagued by bone and joint problems , Mildred adds .
Recalling the settlement received by the Giordanos , Angelo told these reporters that " my father said he got about $ 200 . "
The farmers were stonewalled in their search for information , and their complaints have long since been forgotten .
But they unknowingly left their imprint on history  their claims of injury to their health reverberated through the corridors of power in Washington , and triggered intensive secret bomb - program research on the health effects of fluoride .
A secret 1945 memo from Manhattan Project Lt. Col. Rhodes to General Groves stated : " Because of complaints that animals and humans have been injured by hydrogen fluoride fumes in [ the New Jersey ] area , although there are no pending suits involving such claims , the University of Rochester is conducting experiments to determine the toxic effect of fluoride . "
Much of the proof of fluoride 's safety in low doses rests on the postwar work performed by the University of Rochester , in anticipation of lawsuits against the bomb program for human injury .
Fluoride and the Cold War
Delegating fluoride safety studies to the University of Rochester was not surprising .
During WWII the federal government had become involved , for the first time , in large - scale funding of scientific research at government - owned labs and private colleges .
Those early spending priorities were shaped by the nation 's often - secret military needs .
The prestigious upstate New York college , in particular , had housed a key wartime division of the Manhattan Project , studying the health effects of the new " special materials , " such as uranium , plutonium , beryllium and fluoride , being used to make the atomic bomb .
That work continued after the war , with millions of dollars flowing from the Manhattan Project and its successor organization , the Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) .
( Indeed , the bomb left an indelible imprint on all U.S. science in the late 1940's and 50's .
Up to 90 % of federal funds for university research came from either the Defense Department or the AEC in this period , according to Noam Chomsky 's 1996 book " The Cold War and the University . " )
The University of Rochester medical school became a revolving door for senior bomb program scientists .
Postwar faculty included Stafford Warren , the top medical officer of the Manhattan Project , and Harold Hodge , chief of fluoride research for the bomb program .
But this marriage of military secrecy and medical science bore deformed offspring .
The University of Rochester 's classified fluoride studies  code - named Program F  were conducted at its Atomic Energy Project ( AEP ) , a top - secret facility funded by the AEC and housed in Strong Memorial Hospital .
It was there that one of the most notorious human radiation experiments of the Cold War took place , in which unsuspecting hospital patients were injected with toxic doses of radioactive plutonium .
Revelation of this experiment in a Pulitzer prize - winning account by Eileen Wellsome led to a 1995 U.S. Presidential investigation , and a multimillion - dollar cash settlement for victims .
Program F was not about children 's teeth .
It grew directly out of litigation against the bomb program and its main purpose was to furnish scientific ammunition which the government and its nuclear contractors could use to defeat lawsuits for human injury .
Program F's director was none other than Harold C. Hodge , who had led the Manhattan Project investigation of alleged human injury in the New Jersey fluoride - pollution incident .
Program F's purpose is spelled out in a classified 1948 report .
It reads : " To supply evidence useful in the litigation arising from an alleged loss of a fruit crop several years ago , a number of problems have been opened .
Since excessive blood fluoride levels were reported in human residents of the same area , our principal effort has been devoted to describing the relationship of blood fluorides to toxic effects . "
The litigation referred to , of course , and the claims of human injury were against the bomb program and its contractors .
Thus , the purpose of Program F was to obtain evidence useful in litigation against the bomb program .
The research was being conducted by the defendants .
The potential conflict of interest is clear .
If lower dose ranges were found , hazardous by Program F , it might have opened the bomb program and its contractors to lawsuits for injury to human health , as well as public outcry .
Comments lawyer Kittrell : " This and other documents indicate that the University of Rochester 's fluoride research grew out of the New Jersey lawsuits and was performed in anticipation of lawsuits against the bomb program for human injury .
Studies undertaken for litigation purposes by the defendants would not be considered scientifically acceptable today , " adds Kittrell , " because of their inherent bias to prove the chemical safe . "
Unfortunately , much of the proof of fluoride 's safety rests on the work performed by Program F Scientists at the University of Rochester .
During the postwar period that university emerged as the leading academic center for establishing the safety of fluoride , as well as its effectiveness in reducing tooth decay , according to Dental School spokesperson William H. Bowen , MD .
The key figure in this research , Bowen said , was Harold C. Hodge  who also became a leading national proponent of fluoridating public drinking water .
Program F's interest in water fluoridation was not just ' to counteract the local fear of fluoride on the part of residents , ' as Hodge had earlier written .
The bomb program needed human studies , as they had needed human studies for plutonium , and adding fluoride to public water supplies provided one opportunity .
The A - Bomb Program and Water Fluoridation
Bomb - program scientists played a prominent  if unpublicized  role in the nation 's first - planned water fluoridation experiment , in Newburgh , New York .
The Newburgh Demonstration Project is considered the most extensive study of the health effects of fluoridation , supplying much of the evidence that low doses are safe for children 's bones , and good for their teeth .
Planning began in 1943 with the appointment of a special New York State Health Department committee to study the advisability of adding fluoride to Newburgh 's drinking water .
The chairman of the committee was Dr. Hodge , then chief of fluoride toxicity studies for the Manhattan Project .
Subsequent members included Henry L. Barnett , a captain in the Project 's Medical section , and John W. Fertig , in 1944 with the office of Scientific Research and Development , the Pentagon group which sired the Manhattan Project .
Their military affiliations were kept secret : Hodge was described as a pharmacologist , Barnett as a pediatrician .
Placed in charge of the Newburgh project was David B. Ast , chief dental officer of the State Health Department .
Ast had participated in a key secret wartime conference on fluoride held by the Manhattan Project , and later worked with Dr. Hodge on the Project 's investigation of human injury in the New Jersey incident , according to once - secret memos .
The committee recommended that Newburgh be fluoridated .
It also selected the types of medical studies to be done , and " provided expert guidance " for the duration of the experiment .
The key question to be answered was : " Are there any cumulative effects  beneficial or otherwise , on tissues and organs other than the teeth  of long - continued ingestion of such small concentrations ...? "
According to the declassified documents , this was also key information sought by the bomb program , which would require long - continued exposure of workers and communities to fluoride throughout the Cold War .
In May 1945 , Newburgh 's water was fluoridated , and over the next ten years its residents were studied by the State Health Department .
In tandem , Program F conducted its own secret studies , focusing on the amounts of fluoride Newburgh citizens retained in their blood and tissues - key information sought by the bomb program : " Possible toxic effects of fluoride were in the forefront of consideration , " the advisory committee stated .
Health Department personnel cooperated , shipping blood and placenta samples to the Program F team at the University of Rochester .
The samples were collected by Dr. David B. Overton , the Department 's chief of pediatric studies at Newburgh .
The final report of the Newburgh Demonstration Project , published in 1956 in the Journal of the American Dental Association , concluded that " small concentrations " of fluoride were safe for U.S.citizens .
The biological proof  " based on work performed ... at the University of Rochester Atomic Energy Project "  was delivered by Dr. Hodge .
Today , news that scientists from the atomic bomb program secretly shaped and guided the Newburgh fluoridation experiment , and studied the citizen 's blood and tissue samples , is greeted with incredulity .
" I 'm shocked  beyond words , " said present - day Newburgh Mayor Audrey Carey , commenting on these reporters ' findings .
" It reminds me of the Tuskegee experiment that was done on syphilis patients down in Alabama . "
As a child in the early 1950's , Mayor Carey was taken to the old firehouse on Broadway in Newburgh , which housed the Public Health Clinic .
There , doctors from the Newburgh fluoridation project studied her teeth , and a peculiar fusion of two finger bones on her left hand she had been born with .
Today , adds Carey , her granddaughter has white dental - fluorosis marks on her front teeth .
Mayor Carey wants answers from the government about the secret history of fluoride , and the Newburgh fluoridation experiment .
" I absolutely want to pursue it , " she said .
" It is appalling to do any kind of experimentation and study without people 's knowledge and permission . "
Contacted by these reporters , the director of the Newburgh experiment , David B . Ast , says he was unaware Manhattan Project scientists were involved .
" If I had known , I would have been certainly investigating why , and what the connection was , " he said .
Did he know that blood and placenta samples from Newburgh were being sent to bomb program researchers at the University of Rochester ?
" I was not aware of it , " Ast replied .
Did he recall participating in the Manhattan Project 's secret wartime conference on fluoride in January 1944 , or going to New Jersey with Dr. Hodge to investigate human injury in the du Pont case -- as secret memos state ?
He told the reporters he had no recollection of these events .
A spokesperson for the University of Rochester Medical Center , Bob Loeb , confirmed that blood and tissue samples from Newburgh had been tested by the University 's Dr. Hodge .
On the ethics of secretly studying U.S citizens to obtain information useful in litigation against the A - bomb program , he said , " that 's a question we cannot answer . "
He referred inquiries to the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) , successor to the Atomic Energy Commission .
A spokesperson for the DOE in Washington , Jayne Brady , confirmed that a review of DOE files indicated that a " significant reason " for fluoride experiments conducted at the University of Rochester after the war was " impending litigation between the du Pont company and residents of New Jersey areas . "
However , she added , " DOE has found no documents to indicate that fluoride research was done to protect the Manhattan Project or its contractors from lawsuits . "
On Manhattan Project involvement in Newburgh , the spokesperson stated , " Nothing that we have suggests that the DOE or predecessor agencies  especially the Manhattan Project  authorized fluoride experiments to be performed on children in the 1940's . "
When told that the reporters had several documents that directly tied the Manhattan Project 's successor agency at the University of Rochester , the AEP , to the Newburgh experiment , the DOE spokesperson later conceded her study was confined to " the available universe " of documents .
Two days later spokesperson Jayne Brady faxed a statement for clarification : " My search only involved the documents that we collected as part of our human radiation experiments project  fluoride was not part of our research effort .
" Most significantly , " the statement continued , relevant documents may be in a classified collection at the DOE Oak Ridge National Laboratory known as the Records Holding Task Group .
" This collection consists entirely of classified documents removed from other files for the purpose of classified document accountability many years ago , " and was " a rich source of documents for the human radiation experiments project , " she said .
The crucial question arising from this investigation is :
Were adverse health findings from Newburgh and other bomb - program fluoride studies suppressed ?
All AEC - funded studies had to be declassified before publication in civilian medical and dental journals .
Where are the original classified versions ?
The transcript of one of the major secret scientific conferences of WW2 - - on " fluoride metabolism " -- is missing from the files of the U.S. National Archives .
Participants in the conference included key figures who promoted the safety of fluoride and water fluoridation to the public after the war - Harold Hodge of the Manhattan Project , David B . Ast of the Newburgh Project , and U.S. Public Health Service dentist H.Trendley Dean , popularly known as the " father of fluoridation . "
" If it is missing from the files , it is probably still classified , " National Archives librarians told these reporters .
A 1944 WW2 Manhattan Project classified report on water fluoridation is missing from the files of the University of Rochester Atomic Energy Project , the U.S. National Archives , and the Nuclear Repository at the University of Tennessee , Knoxville .
The next four numerically consecutive documents are also missing , while the remainder of the " MP - 1500 series " is present .
" Either those documents are still classified , or they 've been ' disappeared ' by the government , " says Clifford Honicker , Executive Director of the American Environmental Health Studies Project , in Knoxville , Tennessee , which provided key evidence in the public exposure and prosecution of U.S. human radiation experiments .
Seven pages have been cut out of a 1947 Rochester bomb - project notebook entitled " Du Pont litigation . "
" Most unusual , " commented chief medical school archivist Chris Hoolihan .
Similarly , Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests by these authors over a year ago with the DOE for hundreds of classified fluoride reports have failed to dislodge any .
" We 're behind , " explained Amy Rothrock , FOIA officer for the Department of Energy at their Oak Ridge operations .
Was information suppressed ?
These reporters made what appears to be the first discovery of the original classified version of a fluoride safety study by bomb program scientists .
A censored version of this study was later published in the August 1948 Journal of the American Dental Association .
Comparison of the secret with the published version indicates that the U.S. AEC did censor damaging information on fluoride , to the point of tragicomedy .
This was a study of the dental and physical health of workers in a factory producing fluoride for the A - bomb program , conducted by a team of dentists from the Manhattan Project .
The secret version reports that most of the men had no teeth left .
The published version reports only that the men had fewer cavities .
The secret version says the men had to wear rubber boots because the fluoride fumes disintegrated the nails in their shoes .
The published version does not mention this .
The secret version says the fluoride may have acted similarly on the men's teeth , contributing to their toothlessness .
The published version omits this statement .
The published version concludes that " the men were unusually healthy , judged from both a medical and dental point of view . "
Asked for comment on the early links of the Manhattan Project to water fluoridation , Dr Harold Slavkin , Director of the National Institute for Dental Research , the U.S. agency which today funds fluoride research , said , " I was n't aware of any input from the Atomic Energy Commission . "
Nevertheless , he insisted , fluoride 's efficacy and safety in the prevention of dental cavities over the last fifty years is well - proved .
" The motivation of a scientist is often different from the outcome , " he reflected .
" I do not hold a prejudice about where the knowledge comes from . "
After comparing the secret and published versions of the censored study , toxicologist Phyllis Mullenix commented , " This makes me ashamed to be a scientist . "
Of other Cold War -era fluoride safety studies , she asks , " Were they all done like this ? "

What is an Option Arm ?
It is an ARM on which the interest rate adjusts monthly and the payment adjusts annually , with borrowers offered options on how large a payment they will make .
The options include interest - only , and a “ minimum ” payment that is usually less than the interest - only payment .
The minimum payment option results in a growing loan balance , termed “ negative amortization ” .
Now a couple things to remember about Option ARMs :
They are not “ Subprime ” loans
The effect of Option ARMs has yet to fully hit the market
Owners are typically locked in and unable to refinance due to fine print
As BusinessWeek put it :
For cash - strapped homeowners , it was a pitch they could n’t refuse : Refinance your mortgage at a bargain rate and cut your payments in half .
New home buyers , stretching to afford something in a super - heated market , did n’t even need to produce documentation , much less a downpayment .
Those who took the bait are in for a nasty surprise .
While many Americans have started to worry about falling home prices , borrowers who jumped into so - called option ARM loans have another , more urgent problem : payments that are about to skyrocket .
…
The bill is coming due .
Many of the option ARMs taken out in 2004 and 2005 are resetting at much higher payment schedules — often to the astonishment of people who thought the low installments were fixed for at least five years .
And because home prices have leveled off , borrowers can’t count on rising equity to bail them out .
What ’s more , steep penalties prevent them from refinancing .
The most diligent home buyers asked enough questions to know that option ARMs can be fraught with risk .
But others , caught up in real estate mania , ignored or failed to appreciate the risk .
There was plenty more going on behind the scenes they did n’t know about , either : that their broker was paid more to sell option ARMs than other mortgages ; that their lender is allowed to claim the full monthly payment as revenue on its books even when borrowers choose to pay much less ; that the loan ’s interest rates and up - front fees might not have been set by their bank but rather by a hedge fund ; and that they ’ll soon be confronted with the choice of coughing up higher payments or coughing up their home .
The option ARM is “ like the neutron bomb , ” says George McCarthy , a housing economist at New York ’s Ford Foundation .
“ It ’s going to kill all the people but leave the houses standing . ”
Stories Of Those Who Have Faced Option ARM Nightmares
Gordon Burger
Gordon Burger is among the first wave of option ARM casualties .
The 42 - year - old police officer from a suburb of Sacramento , Calif. , is stuck in a new mortgage that ’s making him poorer by the month .
Burger , a solid earner with clean credit , has bought and sold several houses in the past .
In February he got a flyer from a broker advertising an interest rate of 2.2 % .
It was an unbeatable opportunity , he thought .
If he refinanced the mortgage on his $ 500,000 home into an option ARM , he could save $ 14,000 in interest payments over three years .
Burger quickly pulled the trigger , switching out of his 5.1 % fixed - rate loan .
“ The payment schedule looked like what we talked about , so I just started signing away , ” says Burger .
He did n’t read the fine print .
After two months Burger noticed that the minimum payment of $ 1,697 was actually adding $ 1,000 to his balance every month .
“ I ’m not making any ground on this house ; it ’s a loss every month , ” he says .
He says he was told by his lender , Minneapolis - based Homecoming Financial , a unit of Residential Capital , the nation ’s fifth - largest mortgage shop , that he ’d have to pay more than $ 10,000 in prepayment penalties to refinance out of the loan .
If he ’s unhappy , he should take it up with his broker , the bank said .
“ They know they ’re selling crap , and they ’re doing it in a way that ’s very deceiving , ” he says .
“ Unfortunately , I got sucked into it . ”
In a written statement , Residential said it could n’t comment on Burger ’s loan but that “ each mortgage is designed to meet the specific financial needs of a consumer . ”
Harold X
There ’s no way to camouflage what Harold , a former computer technician , is about to face .
He ’s disabled and has one source of income : the $ 1,600 per month he receives in Social Security disability payments .
In September , 2005 , Harold refinanced out of a fixed - rate mortgage and into an option ARM for his $ 150,000 home in Chicago .
The minimum monthly payment for the first year is $ 899 , which he can afford .
The interest - only payment is $ 1,329 , which he can ’t .
The fully amortized payment is $ 1,454 , which his lender , Washington Mutual ( WM ) , gets to count on its books .
WaMu , no fly - by - night operation , said it could n’t comment on Harold ’s case , citing confidentiality issues .
A spokesman says the bank “ accounts for its option ARM product in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles . ”
WaMu has about $ 12 billion in loans negatively amortizing right now , up from $ 2.5 billion in 2005 , estimates CreditSights ’ Hendler .
In a written statement , WaMu said “ borrowers who request an adjustable loan with payment options should understand those options and potential adjustments throughout the life of the loan .
We make detailed disclosures to customers that are designed to develop a more informed consumer of mortgage products and ensure that our customers are comfortable with the loan products they select . ”
The Shaws
Billy and Carolyn Shaw are among the growing ranks of borrowers who have taken out loans they say they did n’t understand .
The retired couple from the Salinas ( Calif . ) area needed to tap about $ 50,000 in equity from their $ 385,000 home to cover mounting expenses .
Billy , 66 , a retired mechanic , has diabetes .
Carolyn , 61 , has been caring for her grandchildren , 10 - year - old twins , since her daughter ’s death in 2000 .
The Shaws have a fixed income of $ 3,000 a month that will fall by about $ 1,000 in November after Billy ’s disability benefits run out .
Their new loan ’s minimum payment of about $ 1,413 is manageable so far , but the fully amortized amount of about $ 3,329 is out of the question .
In a little over a year , they ’ve added some $ 8,500 to their loan balance and now face a big reset if they continue to pay only the minimum .
“ We did n’t totally understand what was taking place , ” says Carolyn .
“ You have to pay attention .
We did n’t , and we ’re really stuck here . ”
The Shaws ’ lender , Golden West , says it routinely calls customers to ask them if they are happy and understand their mortgage loan .
The Hinz’s
Compulsive hoarding is defined , in part , by clutter that so overtakes living , dining and sleeping spaces that it harms the person ’s quality of life .
A compulsive hoarder finds it impossible , even painful , to part with possessions .
It ’s not clear how many people suffer from compulsive hoarding , but estimates start at about 1.5 million Americans .

Dr. Tolin recently studied compulsive hoarders using brain - scan technology .
While in the scanner , hoarders looked at various possessions and made decisions about whether to keep them or throw them away .
The items were shredded in front of them , so they knew the decision was irreversible .
When a hoarder was making decisions about throwing away items , the researchers saw increased activity in the orbitofrontal cortex , a part of the brain involved in decision - making and planning .
“ That part of the brain seemed to be stressed to the max , ” Dr. Tolin said .
By comparison , people who did n’t hoard showed no extra brain activity .
While hoarders are a minority , many psychologists and organization experts say the rest of us can learn from them .
The spectrum from cleanliness to messiness includes large numbers of people who are chronically disorganized and suffering either emotionally , physically or socially .
Cognitive behavioral therapy may help : a recent study of hoarders showed that six months ’ therapy resulted in a marked decline in clutter in the patient ’s living space .
Although chronic disorganization is not a medical diagnosis , therapists and doctors sometimes call on professional organizers to help patients .
One of them is Lynne Johnson , a professional organizer from Quincy , Mass. , who is president of the National Study Group on Chronic Disorganization .
Ms. Johnson explains that some people look at a shelf stacked with coffee mugs and see only mugs .
But people with serious disorganization problems might see each one as a unique item  a souvenir from Yellowstone or a treasured gift from Grandma .
Many clients have already accumulated numerous storage bins and other such items in a futile attempt to get organized .
Usually the home space is adequate , she says , but the challenge is in teaching them how to group , sort , set priorities and discard .
When science teacher Michael Arquin started educating students about wind power , he had no idea his curriculum would come to influence thousands of teachers and students all across the country .
After earning his B.S. in Biology and Environmental Studies from UC Boulder and a M.A.T. in Science Education from Cornell , Arquin , 37 , taught for five years in Santa Catalina School in Monterey California .
He left teaching in 2003 to pursue a fellowship at Tufts University .
There he found his passion for wind energy coalescing into a bona fide project .
As a fellow at the Wright Center for Science Education , Arquin formally founded the KidWind Project with the goal of developing curricula and simple wind turbine kits to improve the quality of wind energy science education throughout the U.S. .
As KidWind evolved , Arquin began to see a dearth of classroom - appropriate wind energy hardware .
“ There were a lot of products out there but they were like 300 , 500 dollars , ” Arquin said .
“ Not anything you ’d want to bring into a classroom . ”
As a result , he began making and selling more basic kits .
One project requires students to modify and arrange the blades of a turbine , and measure the electrical output with a volt meter to determine the ideal configuration .
Another tips its hat to windmills of old by seeing how much weight can be hoisted by wind power alone .
While not developing hardware , KidWind organizes workshops to help teachers develop their own science curricula .
“ During the summer we ’ll hold 10 workshops all over the US , ” Arquin explained .
“ We ’ll go to , like , New York and for a day take 40 teachers and teach them about wind power , what goes on in the classroom , and take them on a tour of a wind farm . ”
He estimates KidWind has held over 60 workshops and other educational events with in excess of 1,800 attendees .
Most of these have been teachers who have gone on to influence tens of thousands of students .
While his primary audience has been teachers , Arquin has made a point of finding out what appeals to students .
He has separate lesson plans for elementary , middle school and secondary students , providing challenges for each age range without being too difficult .
One welcome discovery was that wind energy ’s humanitarian nature is particularly appealing to female students .
Arquin noted that girls ’ participation rates in technological subjects is traditionally very low .
However , he found that framing challenges in terms of societal improvement , rather than technological prowess , appealed to these students .
“ Instead of saying , make the car go faster , ” Arquin explained , “ say make the ambulance travel in a more efficient way to pick up people , the girls will get into it .
We have really high percentage of participation by girls . ”
These days , KidWind ’s online store takes up the majority of the organization ’s time .
It sells dozens of kits not only of wind projects but also related eco-friendly technologies like solar and fuel cell projects .
He also features a small assortment of books .
Arquin estimates over 5,000 kits of various types have been sold or distributed through workshops in the past two years .
In addition , the KidWind store sells individual parts in a manner Arquin likens to a surplus store .
For instance , he developed a Tinker Toy - like turbine hub that allows students to quickly and safely swap in various types of turbine blades .
Called a “ crimping hub , ” it locks down and prevents the blades from flying off .
Ultimately , however , the KidWind Project website is much more than an online store .
With science fair ideas , lesson plans , pre-made presentations and bibliographies , Arquin ’s organization aims to influence as many people as possible as early as possible to the possibilities of wind energy .
昨 年12月22日の日経新聞の記事などによると、2008年度税制改正ではエンジェル税制について思い切った改正が予定されているとのこと。
2004 年に書いた記事で、「エンジェル税制ってイマイチ」という趣旨のことを申し上げたんですが、今度の改正はかなり「太っ腹」な改正ですし、「ホントにイケてるベンチャー投資」をする個人の投資家にとっては、相当なメリットになり(え)ます。
一方で、（ベンチャーに良かれと思ってこの制度を作っていただいているのは間違いないんでしょうけど）、ホントにこの税制がベンチャービジネスの振興につながるのかどうかについては、引き続きギモンなのであります。
改正の概 要
今まではベンチャーへの投資額が株式の譲渡益からしか差し引けませんでしたが、新聞報道によると、改正後は寄付金として、なんと 総所得から 差し引ける！・・・・という、かなりの太っ腹な改正が行われるとのこと。
以前の記事で申し上げましたが、普通のお金持ちというのは上場株式の売買はしても、未公開株の売却で譲渡益が出るというのはかなりレアケースでしょうから、節税額は（投資額に対して上場株式の譲渡益に対する税率10%程度、つまり）最高100万円程度にしかならないだろうし、その程度の額のために、わざわざややこしい申請書類を作成するというのは割に合わないと感じる企業や投資家がほとんどではないか、ということでした。
ところが、今度の改正では、なんと累進税率で課税される総所得から最高1000万円が控除できるわけであります。
新聞記事では地方税についての扱いがよくわかりませんが、年収数千万円の人なら
( 国税だけでも ) 最高400万円程度の節税、地方税上も適用されるなら
500 万 円もの節税 になりえます。
ちょっとしたスポーツカーが買える額ですから、ニューリッチ層の方々なんかは、機会があればベンチャー企業に投資してみたいと思われるかも知れません。
また、これも記事からは詳細が読み取れませんが、仮に投資時に税率50%で節税ができて上場後売却して10%しか税金が取れないとすると、差引40%分については
課税繰り延べではなく、永久に減税になる 、というところも大変太っ腹であります。
投資税制は、配当や利息も含めて すべて分離課税で一本化の方向 にあるわけですが、 総合課税される累進課税の総所得から投資額が差し引けるというのはこのトレンドから大きく逸脱する、租税理論上も「 画期的な」出来事 だといえるのではないかと思います。
ベンチャーにとって個人は本当に「 エンジェル」なのか？
一方で、ベンチャー企業の側から見て、「個人」に投資してもらう、というのは本当に「いいこと」なんでしょうか？
確かに、シリコンバレーのベンチャーのように、「 Sun Microsystemsのco-founderが個人で10万ドル投資した！」てなことになれば、ベンチャー企業として「ハクが付く」ことこの上ないわけです。が、投資してもらってそんなカッチョイイことになる人は、日本全体でも100人いるのかしらん？という感じではないかと思います。
アメリカで見かけた例ですが、創業時の資金に困って、何十人もの個人投資家からポロポロと資金を集めたベンチャー企業が、「この資本構成じゃ、VCも投資しないし、上場もできない」と言われてました。
日本でも、増資のときに公募の規制に引っかかるとか、株主総会の手続きや説明コストが増加するなど、「フツウの金持ちのオッサン」が投資した場合に、デメリットで苦しんでいる企業も結構たくさん見かけます。
もっとはっきり申し上げると、 「 ベンチャー企業は、(原則として)個人投資家からの資金は受け付けるべきではない。 」 と思います。
個人投資家というのは、（よっぽど「イケてる人」はともかく）、一般にはプロの投資家よりは、企業の内容についての審査能力は弱い（というか、審査能力が無いに等しい人がほとんどな）わけです。上場企業については、そもそも以前から、それなりの企業情報が開示されているし、公開審査を経てコーポレートガバナンスのしくみもそれなりに整っているし、特に金融商品取引法の施行後は説明義務もガチガチになったのに対し、未公開のベンチャー企業なんてのは、そもそもそうした投資家保護の仕組みはほとんど存在しないわけで、デューデリもしない個人にちゃんとリスクを認識して投資してもらうというのは極めて例外的なケースに限られるわけです。
お金を集めるベンチャー企業は、当然、「上場を目指してます」てなことを口にするわけですが、そのリスクの実態については、誤解して受け止められる可能性は極めて高い。（金持ちほど、都合のいいことしか覚えていないことが多いこともあり。）
つまり、お金をもらう分にはいいように思えますが、後でトラブルになる可能性が極めて高いわけです。実際。
また、VCなどのプロと違って、経済合理的な行動をしないことも多い。うまく行っているときはいいとして、ちょっと曲がり角で何かしないといけないときに、感情的にヘソを曲げられて非常に大変なことになることも往々にしてあります。
「 ダラダラした」資本政策に陥る危険性
株式というのは 「返さなくていい」資金なので、適切なコーポレートガバナンスが構築されていない環境下ではモラルハザードが発生する可能性が非常に高い。
「 ちょっとカネが足りない」という場合に、個人からダラダラと株で「お金を無心」して、取り返しの付かない資本構成になってしまっているベンチャー企業というのをたまに見かけるんですが、上述のとおり、VCファンド等が乱立してベンチャー向けの資金がジャブジャブいってる環境下で、なぜその企業は個人から資金を調達する必要があったのか？という目で見られてしまう可能性については十分考える必要があります。
投資額の50%もが所得から控除できるようになった場合、
そうしたお金にイージーに手を出してドツボにはまる
企業は、ますます増えるんじゃないでしょうか。
個人投資家にとっても、ホントにいいことなのか？
「 1000 万 円投資したらその50%が節税できます！」と言われれば、「おっ」と思うかも知れませんが、
そもそもその1000万円が適正な価格なのかどうか
、はわからない。（わかるとは限らない。）
つまり、企業価値1億円しかない企業で500万円投資してもらうのと、企業価値2億円と評価して1000万円投資（500万円節税）するのとでは、ベンチャー企業に資金が潤沢に供給される分、後者の方がいいようにも思えますが、投資家からしてみると、「半分節税できて得した！」というよりは、
「半分の価値しかない株を倍の価格で買わされただけ」、にもなりえる わけです。
金商法の 「集団投資スキーム」に対する規制じゃないですが、「一人でもVCなどのプロが入っている」増資と「（節税をエサに）個人ばかり49人かき集めました」という増資では、今後は特に、意味合いが大きく違ってくるかも知れません。
「 市場型間接金融」的な投資も期待できるんでしょうか？
新聞記事では、2006年度のエンジェル税制による投資実績が13億円しかなかった、と書いてありました。（仮に13社だったとしたら、1社1千万円ぽっち。）
今までのエンジェル税制でも、認定投資事業組合経由で投資したものについても控除が認められていたはずなので、VCさんもこの制度は全く利用してこなかった、ということなんでしょう。
今後、最高50%も節税ということになれば、VCがニューリッチ層から資金調達する場合に大きなプラスになる可能性はありますし、個人側からしても、「プロの目利き」が仲介するのはいいことかと思います。一方で、投資対象企業の資本構成上の制限や、「ハンズオン」が義務付けられていることなど、なぜ、今までVCさんがこの制度を活用しなかったか？ということを考えると、やはり今後もあまり一般的にならないのかも知れません。
「 ハンズオンするイケてるブティック型のVC」が増えればこんなうれしいことはないですが、比較的小規模なブティック型のファンドで金商法上のコンプラやドキュメンテーションの態勢を（コスト上、能力上）どこまで構築できるのかと考えると、そういうファンドが何十も設立されるというのは絶望的にも思えます。
節税をウリにする怪しげな投資スキームにだまされる人が増えるだけになったら・・・・イヤですね。
— — — — — — —— ——

以上、資金がこれからもジャブついている前提で悲観的なお話をしてまいりましたが、今後（また）「ベンチャー冬の時代」が到来する可能性もないではなく、資金調達スキームの選択肢は多ければ多いに越したことはないので、思い切った改正はありがたいお話ではありますので、念のため。

Commit , Recover & Transactions in Ruby
The spec says ‘ transactions ’ , we immediately think ‘ InnoDB ’ .
But what if you ’re not using a database , working on a light - weight application , or simply want to ensure a graceful recovery process ?
In the past that usually meant layers of additional logic , variables to keep and capture intermediate state , and all the other associated headaches .
That is , until Gregory Brown and Austin Ziegler published Transaction : : Simple - a gem , both literally and figuratively , which makes transaction support in Ruby a walk in the park .
Transaction : : Simple provides a generic way to inject transaction support into any object - that ’s right , any Ruby object .
All the magic happens directly in memory , and thus there are no dependencies on additional backends .
Your only theoretical limit is the memory of your machine , as object versions are created transparently and on the fly .
In addition , the gem offers nested transactions , named transactions , transaction groups , commit and recovery procedures .
Talk about fully featured !
An example is due :
require ' rubygems ' require ' transaction / simple ' # Create a Ruby hash to store the balance bank = { " Bob " => 100 , " Jon " => 50 } # Add tranasction support to our Ruby hash bank .
extend ( Transaction :: Simple ) bank .
start_transaction ( : deposit ) bank [ ' Bob ' ] += 25 # -> 125 bank .
commit_transaction ( : deposit ) # block - form usage Transaction :: Simple . start ( bank ) do | t | # v has been extended with Transaction : : Simple and an unnamed t .
transaction_open ?
# -> true bank [ ' Bob ' ] -= 25 # -> 100 # Hmm , I think we made an error , let 's abort !
t . rewind_transaction t . transaction_open ?
# -> true bank [ ' Bob ' ] -= 25 # -> 100 puts " Bob 's balance : #{ bank [ ' Bob ' ] } , expecting : 100 " # Break out of the transaction block and abort the transaction t .
abort_transaction end puts " Bob 's balance : #{ bank [ ' Bob ' ] } , expecting : 125 " # ->
Bob 's balance : 100 , expecting : 100 # ->
Bob 's balance : 125 , expecting : 125
Advanced Commit and Recovery
Applying similar patterns as we saw above , we can greatly simplify our recovery procedures in almost any Ruby program with minimal intervention :
# applying to arbitrary objects obj = SomeObject .
new obj .
extend ( Transaction :: Simple ) #
Recover , rewind , and retry use - case begin v .
start_transaction if v . do_work v . commit_transaction else v . abort_transaction rescue Exception v . rewind_transaction v . recover retry end
And as if this is not enough , make sure to explore transaction groups once you dive into the documentation .
Named transactions , in conjunction with transaction groups will allow you to easily manage a group of objects as if they were a single object .
Man , I love Ruby .
What is your ( most recent ) favorite gem ?
Britain's top law societies have issued a stinging missive to the Canadian government concerning its complicity in the upcoming war crimes trial of Guantanamo detainee Omar Khadr .
The heads of the five legal organizations sent a letter to Prime Minister Stephen Harper saying he must take " urgent action " in securing Khadr 's release and criticizing Canada for violating international laws that protect juveniles .
" The lengthy detention , and putting on trial for war crimes , of someone who appears to be a `child soldier ' is contrary to the special protection to which Khadr is entitled , " the letter stated .
" We regret to see Canada appearing to be complicit in such breaches of fundamental international standards of conduct in relation to children . "
Khadr was 15 when he was captured in Afghanistan on July 27 , 2002 , following a firefight with U.S. forces .
The Pentagon has charged him with murder in violation of the laws of war for allegedly throwing a grenade that fatally wounded army Delta Force Sgt. Christopher Speer .
He also faces charges of attempted murder , conspiracy , providing material support for terrorism and spying .
He is expected to go to trial sometime next year .
Now 21 , Toronto - born Khadr remains the only Western detainee at the U.S. naval facility in Cuba and one of the first who would be tried before modern - day war tribunals .
British detainees were repatriated due to their government 's efforts by 2005 .
Intense lobbying by Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's government has also secured the release of British residents , three of whom returned home Wednesday after almost six years in custody .
" We do not believe that Canada , a Commonwealth partner , should remain silent while the U.S. subjects its citizen to such a process .
Every other ally of the United States , including the United Kingdom , France , Germany and Australia , has acted to protect their citizens detained at Guantanamo Bay , " stated the letter to Harper .
Andrew Holroyd , president of the Law Society of England and Wales , said in an interview yesterday he was amazed to discover Canada supported the U.S. military commissions his association has denounced as " illegitimate and irreparably flawed . "
" We have been making a consistent point to our government that they should use all their diplomatic efforts to urge the U.S. administration to ensure everybody who 's being held went through proper due process of the law , " he said .
Khadr 's military lawyers , Lt. - Cmdr .
Bill Kuebler and Rebecca Snyder , met with the senior lawmakers and human rights activists last month to ask for support in lobbying the Canadian government .
While the law groups , which include the Bar of England and Wales , Criminal Bar Association , Bar of Human Rights Committee and Commonwealth Lawyers '
Association , often appeal to foreign governments on legal issues , Holroyd said this was the first time they have raised concern with Canada .
Concern about Khadr 's case seemed to be growing in Canada this summer after the Canadian Bar Association intervened and Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion called on the government to demand Khadr be charged in U.S. federal courts or released .
But the Harper government has been unwavering in its support of Guantanamo .
In a year - end interview with OMNI Television , Harper was asked why Canada has not intervened .
" Mr. Khadr is accused of extremely serious , serious crimes , " Harper said , noting Canada provides Khadr with consular assistance .
" He 's not accused of anything in Canada .
There 's no basis on which , according to what I understand , that we would have any basis detaining him or trying him here so I think it 's appropriate that we work through the consular process and let the judicial process take its course . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Fidel Castro ’s departure will not change the Bush administration ’s Cuba policy and an embargo and other restrictions will remain as long as Castro ’s brother -- dubbed a “ dictator lite ” -- is in charge .

U.S. officials and Cuba experts said with Raul Castro carrying on his brother ’s 49 - year reign , there would be little chance of a shift in the isolation policy and hostile rhetoric that has marked U.S. - Cuba ties for nearly half a century .
The United States has been preparing in recent years for the departure of Castro , 81 , dusting off a transition plan it hoped would lead to a new era in ties as the communist island moved toward democratic rule .
But the handover to Raul , whom the State Department calls a “ dictator lite ” , has dampened hope of any major changes in Cuba that could lead to an opening with Washington .
“ This is a succession from one tyrant to another .
We should n’t kid ourselves , while Fidel is alive , he ’s running the show , ” Cuban - born U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez , said in an interview with Reuters .
Cuba experts said the Bush administration , whose own term ends in January , 2009 , was also in a wait - and - see mode and any changes would come from the next U.S. president rather than the current White House .
“ I do n’t think there will be any political opening in the short term under Raul , ” said Peter DeShazo , director of the Americas program for the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a Washington think - tank .
Democratic presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have suggested they might lift the decades - old trade embargo if the island country set up democratic reforms , while Republican front - runner John McCain said the United States must keep the pressure on Cuba ’s government .
Washington broke off diplomatic relations with Havana in 1961 , two years after Fidel Castro seized power in a revolution and turned Cuba into a Soviet ally .
EMBARGO REMAINS
Communications were restored with the opening of low - level diplomatic missions called interest sections in 1978 .
However , a strict sanctions regime is in place .
Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte was emphatic that the current economic sanctions would remain .
“ I ca n’t imagine that happening any time soon , ” he said when asked whether the Bush administration would lift the blockade .
Angel Rabasa , a senior policy analyst at the RAND organization , said Raul Castro was highly unlikely to undertake any significant reforms in the near or medium term .
“ Therefore , we are not likely to see any meaningful policy changes in Cuba .
In fact it could be the opposite , given the uncertainty of Cuba ’s future , the regime is more likely to favor a very cautious and conservative approach , ” said Rabasa .
Even if the administration wanted to ease restrictions , experts said there was a tangled mass of U.S. laws that needed to be unraveled and the anti-Castro lobby in Congress would resist any concessions .
The United States has laid down a list of goals that have to be met for there to be any change in policy .
These include freeing political prisoners , a guarantee of human rights , allowing independent trade unions and a “ pathway ” created to elections .
“ Freeing of Cuban political prisoners is one thing that we ’ve insisted on but it ’s so much more than just the prisoners who get put in jail -- it ’s the tremendous oppression that exists in Cuba , the tremendous abuse of power that takes place in Cuba ... it ’s quite remarkable that that happens 90 miles away from our country , ” said Gutierrez .
Rabasa said while the United States might not immediately change its policy , it needed to be prepared for any violent uprising and a predictable exodus of Cubans to U.S. shores if that happened .
“ We ca n’t predict how Cuba will evolve but what is certain to happen is that the current system cannot be sustained , ” said Rabasa .

California regulators are expected to announce today that they are seeking as much as $ 1.33 billion in penalties from Cypress - based PacifiCare as a result of widespread problems stemming from its takeover two years ago by healthcare giant UnitedHealth Group Inc .
In an investigation prompted by widespread complaints , the state Department of Insurance uncovered 133,000 alleged violations of state laws and regulations regarding payments for medical care .
Each violation carries a maximum penalty of $ 10,000 for a possible total of $ 1.33 billion .
Separately , the state Department of Managed Health Care alleged that 30 % of the medical claims it reviewed were improperly denied .
That agency is seeking an additional $ 3.5 million in fines .
“ These were very serious violations , ” said Cindy Ehnes , executive director of the Department of Managed Health Care .
“ The most fundamental promise of insurance is that they will pay when you are sick , and they will pay those physicians and hospitals in a fair manner . ”
Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner expressed frustration at efforts to get the company to make changes .
“ After years of broken promises to California regulators , it became crystal clear that PacifiCare simply could not or would not fix the meltdown in its claims - paying process , ” he said .
“ We ’re going to put an end to that .
If PacifiCare ca n’t understand the ABCs of basic claims payment , maybe it will understand the dollars and cents of regulatory action . ”
The problems stem from the $ 9.2 - billion purchase of PacifiCare by Minneapolis - based UnitedHealth in January 2006 .
The deal added more than 3 million Californians to UnitedHealth , which now has about 27 million enrollees nationwide .
The company ’s regional executives acknowledged that the merger was bungled in many ways .
In a meeting with Times reporters and editors Monday , David Hansen , UnitedHealth ’s regional chief executive , apologized for the problems that the transition caused physicians , hospitals and patients .
Hansen said the company made a mistake in attempting to make too many changes too quickly , and also was tripped up by unforeseen problems such as the loss of a 9,000 - member physicians network contract .
“ Our integration issues and challenges should n’t affect our providers , and they should n’t affect our members , ” he said .
“ We ’re very regretful about that . ”
At the same time , UnitedHealth executives downplayed the effect on members and patient care , characterizing the problems largely as administrative errors .
Still , they said , the company was taking the allegations seriously .
“ We have conducted a top - to - bottom review of PacifiCare of California ’s operations , procedures and policies and are working closely with state regulators to ensure that we resolve any outstanding performance issues , ” spokesman Tyler Mason said .
The potential fines are the latest black eye for UnitedHealth .
Longtime Chief Executive William McGuire resigned in 2006 .
Last month , in the first settlement of its kind under post - Enron corporate reforms , he agreed to pay $ 468 million to avoid trial on charges that he secretly padded his paycheck by manipulating stock options .
The company stressed Monday that most PacifiCare members were in health maintenance organization plans , which were largely unaffected by the problems uncovered by state regulators .
Regulators said they found problems primarily in preferred - provider and point - of - service type plans , which serve about 200,000 members .
The two regulators planned to make an unprecedented joint announcement of their findings today in an effort to underscore the import they attach to the alleged problems .
UnitedHealth executives stressed their cooperation with regulators and said they expected the final amount due to be substantially less .
Physician and hospital groups praised the action .
Richard Frankenstein , president of the California Medical Assn. , the state ’s largest physicians organization , said many doctors were still having to fight to get paid on time and what they are owed .
UnitedHealth “ may claim this is an administrative issue , ” he said .
“ But that does n’t help someone who needs their heart surgery approved in a hurry . ”
Regulators said some patients faced delays in getting in to see physicians who were supposed to be available to PacifiCare members but who were incorrectly dropped from computerized network lists maintained by the parent company .
They also said some patients were forced to pay out of pocket for all or part of such visits .
And some physicians and hospitals considered dropping PacifiCare patients after the merger because it was too difficult to collect payments from UnitedHealth .
Dr. Ted Mazer , a San Diego ear , nose and throat specialist , said the time he and colleagues spend fighting for fair and timely payment from UnitedHealth had cut into the time they spent with patients .
“ This really all boils down to access to care for everybody by maintaining the infrastructure of a medical delivery system , which is falling apart under government underpayment , health plan underpayment and health plan profiteering , ” Mazer said .
The slow payments caused big problems for the hospitals operated by the University of California .
“ Our ability to care for our patients rests on our ability to be paid timely and accurately , ” said Santiago Munoz , a UC associate vice president .
UnitedHealth spokesman Mason said many of the problems were identified and brought to the attention of regulators by the company .
In addition , he said , the company , which announced plans to lay off more than 500 Orange County employees in late 2005 and 2006 , was hiring 50 people to help correct payment problems and improve physician services .
Mason also noted that both PacifiCare and UnitedHealth continue to earn good marks from members in surveys and from a private oversight organization .
Hansen said some employers had dropped PacifiCare from their benefit offerings as a result of the payment problems .
They are among a host of service problems affecting membership nationwide that UnitedHealth executives recently discussed with Wall Street analysts .

Without a doubt , the United States of America possesses the most powerful military in the world .
No armed force on Earth will likely achieve our level of might today for many a year .
Technologies that to us seem to be yesterday ’s innovations such as nuclear bombs , stealth fighters , and bunker busters are unrealizable dreams for most nations in any era .
Our soldiers are amongst the best trained in the world and willing to do anything required to defend America .
Yet , somehow the United States military faces a daily struggle to maintain control in Iraq .
How can we be so omnipotent and so inept at the same time ?
The blame is not to be laid upon any soldier fighting , or any general conducting the war .
These men follow the orders of the commander - in - chief ’s and congress ’s wishes to remain in Iraq .
The real issue is the unlikeliness of final victory in Iraq .
Consider this .
Our overall objective is to build up local Iraqi forces to the point where they can police and defend their own country .
We are constantly told how well the Iraqi government prepares its forces .
Some months , the Iraqis are on schedule but some months not .
The U.S. agenda sets quotas of troop levels which do n’t speak to the quality , loyalty , or readiness of these forces .
So , here lies the problem : if our troops who are the most powerful in the world are having trouble with insurgents , how strong must the Iraqi military be when coalition forces leave ?
The Iraqi army would have to be as gargantuan and as powerful as the U.S. military only to maintain current levels of stability which can hardly be considered firmly secure .
The only solution would be to make the Iraqi army even stronger than our own .
Not only is this strategy not humanly possible , it is outright dangerous to long term stability in the Middle East .
This armament will only lead to training the next Osama bin Laden .
These logical inconsistencies lead to an inconvenient question , " Is there any real pull out strategy … ….ever ? "
No .
Not for tomorrow , or five years from now , not even 20 years hence ; there is no real strategy for departing Iraq at all .
And indeed , given present policies , why should there be ?
After all , our country now has some 700 military bases in about 130 countries , some of them ( Europe , Japan , Korea ) for almost half a century .
Why should Iraq be any different ?
But U.S. taxpayers can’t afford to finance our soldiers ’ stay in Iraq forever , and that unhappy country cannot pay the costs of garrisoning an army the size of the United States ’ in its wildest dreams .
This conundrum leaves the United States between a rock and a hard place since no one can afford to keep fighting the war .
The Canadian dollar is now worth more than our currency .
The U.S. dollar has lost out in comparison with the Euro , the yen , and many other currencies .
This is just plain embarrassing .
Under these unfortunate circumstances , it would appear we have only two options .
Either the U.S. leaves Iraq right now , risking the temporary chaos that may well ensue , or withdraw from Iraq in 20 years or so completely bankrupt with our own economy destroyed watching chaos envelope that country anyway .
Iraq will never have an army like ours no matter how much we build it up .
Nor will anything less suffice .
There is a third option , however ; we stay in Iraq forever .
This would lead to the deaths of countless Americans and the bankrupting of our entire economy .
We assume only patriotic Americans are reading this article , not Islamo - fascists who would support option three .
If you truly think that we should stay in Iraq indefinitely , then please report yourself to the Department of Homeland Security , because you could only support such a policy if you hated America and were in league with the Islamo - fascists .
But wait Mr. Vuk and Dr. Block , are n’t we winning ?!
Is n’t the troop surge working ?
Who can say for sure , but we can tell you the difference between propagandist rhetoric and logical rationale .
First , how do you determine whether you ’re winning in a war like this ?
There are certainly no battle fronts or capitals to ransack .
Well , many of our presidential candidates have a measure .
According to news reports , fewer soldiers than usual have died in the past few months .
And this statistic is supposed proof of the troop surge ’s efficiency .
But wait one second , since when do fewer casualties mean that we ’re winning ?
According to this logic , the Allies lost the battle of D - Day during WWII .
Thousands of men died on Omaha Beach .
Surely this means America lost .
Someone should also send the Russians a memo alerting them to the historical failures of battles both at Stalingrad and Berlin where hundreds of thousands of their soldiers fell , many more than the Germans lost .
It is obvious that the American people are being misled regarding the actual status of the conflict .
The amount of dead has nothing to with whether a nation is strategically succeeding in warfare .
Absolutely nothing !
In fact , victory often comes at the expense of more lives not fewer .
In reality , there is no real way to tell whether you are winning or not in such conflicts .
Some claim that " we ’re fighting them over there ; so that we do n’t have to fight them over here . "
For a fuller analysis of this fallacious line of thinking read here .
What can we do under these dire circumstances ?
There is only one option :
Let ’s get out of Middle East affairs entirely .
The United States should no longer intervene in Middle Eastern countries and only maintain mutually beneficial trade .
The terrorists do n’t hate us for our freedom .
The fundamentalists revile the U.S. for four reasons : our alliance with Israel ; our imperialist presence in the Middle East in general ; our occupation of their Holy Land in particular , Saudi Arabia ; and the fact that we have for over a decade been bombing and blockading Iraq .
With regard to this last atrocity , then - Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was asked if the U.S. sanctions against Iraq , which were responsible for killing some half a million children , were " worth it . "
She replied in the affirmative .
See on this here and here .
If Hillary , John , or Obama are elected from the Democratic side , or Rudy , Mitt , the Huck , John or Fred from the Republican , they will continue all four hated policies and will continue to make the United States of America a prime target .
Leaving any troops will still make the U.S. a target .
Both Democrat and " mainstream " Republican non-withdrawal plans would be a disaster for our soldiers .
If US troops are actually reduced , those remaining in the region will be weakened with fewer numbers .
Both parties have a " helpless and stranded " evacuation plan .
Only one candidate , Ron Paul , offers the option of exiting the Middle East entirely and changing the ultimate target in the eyes of the terrorists .
Another line of thinking says that the terrorists attack us for our freedom and prosperity .
If you believe this , then our course in the war thus far is correct .
America should remain in Iraq , because staying any longer will ensure the United States is neither free nor prosperous .
According to this theory , the terrorist should thereafter cease their aggression , a " brilliant " strategy .
One wonders , then , why the terrorists have not targeted other countries that are rich and relatively free , and also feature mini-skirts and rock - and - roll music , such as Norway , or Japan .
The United States of America is in a tough jam .
Our only alternative is to get out of the Middle East entirely .
Not one half the troops out , not one quarter , all !
And not in a decade , nor even a year nor yet six months .
Our exit should be measured in hours , not even days .
We are the most powerful military in the world .
If the U.S. ca n’t win a war , it is good evidence that the war was unwinnable in the first place .
The conflict will not be won , because it simply cannot be won .
Our ultimate choices are between withdrawing our troops now with America as an intact nation or doing so years from now broken and bankrupt .

You in the West may have missed it , but last week the Lakota Indians declared independence from the United States of America by formally withdrawing from treaties its defeated ancestors were forced to sign .
Just like the Kosovars no longer recognize Belgrade , the descendants of Sitting Bull no longer recognize Washington .
" We are no longer citizens of the United States of America and all those who live in the five - state area that encompasses our country are free to join us , " said a Lakota representative .
He noted that Lakota men have been oppressed for centuries and have one of the lowest life expectancies in the world — 44 years .
The once proud Sioux peoples who make up part of the Lakota nation have been reduced to sub-Moldovan levels of poverty and despair , with no hope for the future .
Like the Kosovars before they were rescued by a NATO - led force , the Lakota appear to have legitimate historical grievances .
All they lack is a great nation to take up their cause in the name of humanitarianism .
While Americans may have found the Lakotan declaration grist for the email - forward humor mill , out here in Russia , we are n’t laughing .
Instead , we ’re drooling .
We look at the history of Lakota Indians ' suffering , including genocide and landgrabs , and then we compare it to the recent American bombing of Serbia on behalf of the Kosovar Albanians , and we see a golden opportunity for Russia to go beyond the realm of mere irony .
The Lakota people ’s rightful ( and legal ) declaration of independence from the United States offers Russia the chance to take a principled stand on the world stage , one that does n’t merely involve “ Russia ’s national interests , ” but rather , “ the interests of a downtrodden and forgotten people who just happened to be getting oppressed by America , though that has nothing to do with our decision to defend their rights . ”
In a word , Russia has the chance to unleash a Diplomatic Skull - Fuck on its rival , the dream of every vengeful international player since the days of Cardinal Richelieu .
Yes , President Medvedev , it is time for you to demand that the Lakota people be given their own homeland , in accordance with international rights and guarantees .
Kosovo is a done deal ; rather than fight against Albanian independence in the Serbian province , it would be better to hold up Kosovo as a model for resolving America 's century - long occupation and genocide of the Lakota Nation people .
Let ’s face it : NATO socket - fucked Russia in 1999 .
Now it ’s Russia ’s turn to skull - fuck America in return .
The Russian government must demand that the United States withdraw its forces from the five - state territory that the Lakotan people claim is theirs .
American forces must be given no more than 10 days to act , or else Russia and its allies will take all appropriate measures , including a prolonged bombing campaign , to drive occupying American forces out of the Lakota nation .
Afterwards , America must accept a Russian - led peacekeeping force to oversee the transition to Lakota ’s independence .
Of course , Russia should not go at this alone .
It should work with a coalition of like - minded authoritarian countries , and luckily such an organization already exists : the Shanghai Cooperation Organization .
Ideologically , the SCO nations stand for exactly the kind of sovereign democracy , stability , and economic growth that the fledging Lakota nation will need .
Just as French , British , and Belgian blue - helmets brought peace and stability to Kosovo , so too can Uzbek , Tajik , and Kyrgyz peacekeepers , in an operation overseen by Russian commanders , bring peace to the simmering tribal lands of north - midwestern America .
The SCO must demand that the Lakota nation adhere to the principles of a multiethnic society combined with sovereign democratic principles .
At the same time , the SCO should help the Lakota Nation rebuild its institutions , and “ Lakotize ” their homeland .
Today , for example , there are not nearly enough cheap liquor stores in Lakota selling “ firewater , ” but with Russian technical know - how , we believe that this problem could be solved within months , or perhaps even hours after an SCO force moves in .

U.S. Officials Begin Crafting Iran Bombing Plan
Wednesday , September 12 , 2007
By James Rosen

WASHINGTON —
Germany — a pivotal player among three European nations to rein in Iran 's nuclear program over the last two - and - a - half years through a mixture of diplomacy and sanctions supported by the United States — notified its allies last week that the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel refuses to support the imposition of any further sanctions against Iran that could be imposed by the U.N. Security Council .
The announcement was made at a meeting in Berlin that brought German officials together with Iran desk officers from the five member states of the Security Council .
It stunned the room , according to one of several Bush administration and foreign government sources who spoke to FOX News , and left most Bush administration principals concluding that sanctions are dead .
The Germans voiced concern about the damaging effects any further sanctions on Iran would have on the German economy — and also , according to diplomats from other countries , gave the distinct impression that they would privately welcome , while publicly protesting , an American bombing campaign against Iran 's nuclear facilities .
[ German Embassy spokesman Ulrich Sante told FOX News on Wednesday that Germany fully supports the ongoing U.N. process , saying the meeting in Berlin " was evidence we are seeking further progress … .
The issue is being moved ahead . " ]
Germany 's withdrawal from the allied diplomatic offensive is the latest consensus across relevant U.S. agencies and offices , including the State Department , the National Security Council and the offices of the president and vice president .
Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns , the most ardent proponent of a diplomatic resolution to the problem of Iran 's nuclear ambitions , has had his chance on the Iranian account and come up empty .
Political and military officers , as well as weapons of mass destruction specialists at the State Department , are now advising Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that the diplomatic approach favored by Burns has failed and the administration must actively prepare for military intervention of some kind .
Among those advising Rice along these lines are John Rood , the assistant secretary for the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation ; and a number of Mideast experts , including Ambassador James Jeffrey , deputy White House national security adviser under Stephen Hadley and formerly the principal deputy assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs .
Consequently , according to a well - placed Bush administration source , " everyone in town " is now participating in a broad discussion about the costs and benefits of military action against Iran , with the likely timeframe for any such course of action being over the next eight to 10 months , after the presidential primaries have probably been decided , but well before the November 2008 elections .
The discussions are now focused on two basic options : less invasive scenarios under which the U.S. might blockade Iranian imports of gasoline or exports of oil , actions generally thought to exact too high a cost on the Iranian people but not enough on the regime in Tehran ; and full - scale aerial bombardment .
On the latter course , active consideration is being given as to how long it would take to degrade Iranian air defenses before American air superiority could be established and U.S. fighter jets could then begin a systematic attack on Iran 's known nuclear targets .
Most relevant parties have concluded such a comprehensive attack plan would require at least a week of sustained bombing runs , and would at best set the Iranian nuclear program back a number of years — but not destroy it forever .
Other considerations include the likelihood of Iranian reprisals against Tel Aviv and other Israeli population centers ; and the effects on American troops in Iraq .
There , officials have concluded that the Iranians are unlikely to do much more damage than they already have been able to inflict through their supply of explosives and training of insurgents in Iraq .
The Bush administration " has just about had it with Iran , " said one foreign diplomat .
" They tried the diplomatic process .
China is now obstructing them at the U.N. Security Council and the Russians are tucking themselves behind them .
" The Germans are wobbling … There are a number of people in the administration who do not want their legacy to be leaving behind an Iran that is nuclear armed , so they are looking at what are the alternatives ?
They are looking at other options , " the diplomat said .
Vice President Cheney and his aides are said to be enjoying a bit of " schadenfreude " at the expense of Burns .
A source described Cheney 's office as effectively gloating to Burns and Rice , " We told you so .
( The Iranians ) are not containable diplomatically . "
The next shoe to drop will be when Rice and President Bush make a final decision about whether to designate the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) and / or its lethal subset , the Quds Force , as a terrorist entity or entities .
FOX News reported in June that such a move is under consideration .
Sources say news leaks about the prospective designation greatly worried European governments and private sector firms , which could theoretically face prosecution in American courts if such measures became law and these entities continued to do business with IRGC and its multiple financial subsidiaries .
If the Bush administration moves forward with such a designation , sources said , it would be an indication that Rice agrees that Burns ' approach has failed .
Designation of such a large Iranian military institution as a terrorist entity would also be seen , sources said , as laying the groundwork for a public justification of American military action .
Monks are absent , but people in Rangoon are going about their lives
About 4,000 monks have been rounded up in the past week as the military government has tried to stamp out pro-democracy protests .
They are being held at a disused race course and a technical college .
Sources from a government - sponsored militia said they would soon be moved away from Rangoon .
The monks have been disrobed and shackled , the sources told BBC radio's Burmese service .
There are reports that the monks are refusing to eat .
The country has seen almost two weeks of sustained popular unrest , in the most serious challenge to the military leadership for more than two decades .
Their eyes are on the international community , their only hope is that the world will see their plight and help them

The authorities said 10 people were killed as the protests were dispersed , though diplomats and activists say the number of dead was many times higher .
The banned opposition broadcaster Democratic Voice of Burma has issued a picture which they say shows the body of a monk floating near the mouth of the Rangoon river .
Last week several monasteries were raided , and there were reports of monks being beaten and killed .
With many monks behind bars , the demonstrations have now died down .
On Monday , the centre of Rangoon was almost back to normal , a reporter , who cannot be identified for security reasons , told the BBC .
Most shops and temples have reopened and people appear to be getting on with their lives .
But there seemed to be a group of soldiers around every corner , and very few monks about , the reporter said .
This is notable in a city where monks can usually be spotted going in and out of temples , shopping at street stalls and chatting in tea shops .

The atmosphere in Rangoon is tense , the reporter said .
Local people are well aware that the monks have been locked away and are afraid that they will be next .
The crackdown , in which unarmed protesters were beaten , tear - gassed , and shot at , has attracted condemnation from abroad , and even from Burma 's neighbours in the Association of South East Asian Nations ( Asean ) .
Envoy still waiting
As well as preventing the demonstrations , the military junta has tried to block news of the unrest filtering out .
Troops are stopping young men on the streets and in cars , searching for cameras that may be used to smuggle out images .
Most internet links are still down and mobile phone networks disrupted .
Foreign news outlets are scorned by Burmese state TV
Official media has been warning Burmese people against co-operating with or using foreign news outlets .
A TV message on Monday referred to the BBC , Voice of America and Radio Free Asia as " assassins on air " .
UN special envoy Ibrahim Gambari was set to meet Burma 's military leader General Than Shwe on Tuesday , officials said .
On Saturday , when Mr Gambari travelled to the new capital Naypidaw , he was allowed to meet only more junior members of the government .
On Sunday , Mr Gambari held talks with detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Rangoon - the first foreigner to be permitted to do so for 10 months .
Fluoridation 's Evaporating Support February 10 , 2008 First published by The Ester Republic , January 2008 By Douglas Yates
In October , Alaska ’s third - largest city asked voters to consider using fluoride to medicate the town ’s water supply .
The issue required a simple up or down vote , one that local water users were eminently qualified to make .
The Chicago - based American Dental Association , an advocacy organization , did n’t see it that way .
The ADA shipped in consultants , hired gofers , and purchased ad space in all the media outlets .
The advertising barrage , however , had little sway with capital - city residents ; they failed to see the virtues of fluoride .
In a landslide fashion , Juneau voted to ban the chemical , keeping its water some of the purest in the state .
Despite spending $ 167,000 , the pro-fluoride forces garnered a feeble 38 percent .
The clean water folks , polling 62 percent , spent only $ 7,000 in media , relying on word of mouth and the Internet to spread the word .
Juneau ’s vote demonstrates that fluoride has overstayed its welcome in many American municipalities .
As a mandatory drug , fluoride is facing buyer ’s remorse and outright refusal in a growing list of cities .
For sixty years this reactive chemical and highly poisonous substance has been touted to communities , the publicity cloaked in good intentions .
The message has been : “ Poor folks ’ teeth need a quick fix to assure they enjoy the benefits of healthy teeth , just like rich folks .
Fluoride is the ticket . ”
The fluoride campaign began in the late 1930s and continues to this day .
It was hatched at the highest levels of Alcoa , the aluminum mining and smelting corporation .
Fluoride is a waste product produced during aluminum processing and requires special handling and disposal .
Treating it as a hazardous material is expensive and eroded Aloca ’s bottom line .
Today , Alcoa has been joined by US Steel , DuPont , Alcan , Reynolds Metals , Kaiser Aluminum , Allied Chemical , and the Florida phosphate fertilizer industry .
Each contributes a share of the 155,000 tons of fluoride waste sold to municipal water systems nationwide .
The operation is so sophisticated that its influence extends to academia , media , and government .
The net result is that three generations of Americans have been used as industrial waste filters .
The vast majority of fluoride is then dumped into the environment via water treatment outfalls .
In the case of Fairbanks , the chemical waste ends up in the Tanana River .
Fluoride ’s political history is recounted in a recent book , The Fluoride Deception , by Christopher Bryson ( published 2004 ) .
A former BBC reporter , Bryson investigated the origins of fluoride ’s use in water systems and documents how an obscure finding purporting dental benefit was hijacked by major corporations to avoid the cost of doing business .
As reported by Bryson and others , the revolving door between industry and government , a research project faking fluoride ’s effectiveness , and the perception - management wizardry of Edward Bernays allowed Alcoa and other fluoride - producing industries to begin shunting the waste into water systems .
Bernays was Sigmund Freud ’s nephew and familiar with Freud ’s psychological research .
Historians believe this understanding was a critical element in selling fluoride to the American people .
With its reputation as a commercial rat poison and use in Nazi and Soviet prison camps ( it makes inmates docile ) , Bernays had an uphill climb .
However , using psychological hot buttons ( fear , greed , envy , guilt ) , and a compliant media , Bernays engineered fluoride ’s social acceptance .
As it turns out , fluoride ’s use in Soviet - era prison camps has a local connection .
During World War II , President Roosevelt supported the Soviet Union with tons of military and industrial material .
Called the Lend - Lease program , it was aimed at helping defeat the German army at Russia ’s front door .
Cargo airlifted from the Lower 48 was staged in Fairbanks at what is now Ft. Wainwright , where it was turned over to Russian pilots for flights over the Bering Strait .
Among the cargo manifests are thousands of pounds of sodium fluoride .
It ’s not known what Bernays thought of using fluoride for prison control .
However , it ’s clear from the following passage that he counted himself among the invisible elite :
The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society .
Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country .
[ Propaganda , reissued in 2004 by Ig Publishing ]
For his success with fluoride , and earlier work for pork producers ( “ bacon and eggs for breakfast ” ) and cigarettes ( " torches of liberty " ) , Bernays is considered the father of the public relations industry .
In many parts of the world , Bernays ’ fluoride spin has been rejected .
New science about how it alters body chemistry as well as a growing number of studies that show dental health in communities with fluoride fares no better than those without it , have canceled earlier support .
Such was the justification offered by Zurich , Switzerland officials when fluoride was discontinued several years ago .
Similar data has caused fluoride to be banned in Japan , China , India , and most of Europe .
Fluoride ’s strongholds are the United States , Canada , Australia , and New Zealand .
While fluoride proponents still have affiliates in national health organizations , many have withdrawn support .
Among the health advocates opposing fluoride are : the American Academy of Allergy and Immunology , the American Academy of Diabetes , the American Cancer Society , the American Diabetes Association , the American Nurses Association , the American Psychiatric Association , the National Kidney Foundation , and the Society of Toxicology .
Some of the most effective anti-fluoride campaigners are former supporters .
Consider Hardy Limeback , BSc , PhD , DDS , head of the Department of Preventive Dentistry for the University of Toronto and president of the Canadian Association for Dental Research .
In an April 1999 interview , Limeback , once a vocal advocate of the drug , stated , “ Children under three should never use fluoridated toothpaste or drink fluoridated water .
And baby formula must never be made up using Toronto tap water .
Never . ”
Seven years later , in 2006 , the ADA , followed by the CDC , issued advisories calling on mothers to stop using tap water to mix baby formula .
The ADA has also recently acknowledged that fluoride has no value when used systemically , that its only effectiveness comes from topical applications .
Nevertheless , the federal health bureaucracy calls fluoride a major advancement , apparently in denial about the schizophrenic nature of its policies .
Adding further momentum to calls to end fluoridation , a study released last year by the National Academies ' National Research Council ( NRC ) , sponsored by the US Environmental Protection Agency , found that the current maximum levels of fluoride allowed by the EPA in drinking water should be lowered due to concerns over adverse health effects .
The current maximum contaminant level of fluoride is 4 mg / L .
The NRC found that these levels are too high and " not protective " of the population .
Numerous studies reviewed by the NRC report that fluoride is linked to subclinical or malfunctioning thyroid glands .
This is " associated with increased cholesterol concentrations , increased incidence of depression , diminished response to standard psychiatric treatment , cognitive dysfunction , and in pregnant women , decreased IQ of their offspring . "
The NRC study says that sources for internal fluoride exposure include inhalation and dermal absorption .
This means that when you bathe or shower fluoride is entering your body via breathing and contact .
The NRC panel then examined numerous reports showing an association between fluoride ingestion and a range of physical complaints that included thyroid disorder , brittle bones , kidney failure , arthritis , and cancer .
Some of the most telling science of fluoride ’s effects comes from the work of Roger Masters , an emeritus researcher at Dartmouth College .
Masters directed research that found an insidious connection between fluoride and lead .
The study compared children ’s blood in communities using fluoride - treated water with communities using nonfluoridated water .
Drawing from samples of more than 400,000 children , increased blood lead levels were always associated with fluoride - treated water .
According to Masters , fluoride leaches lead from the water system ’s pipes and fixtures .
In light of this work and other new data , the justification for using fluoride in water systems evaporates .
No one can rationally contend that its benefit exceeds its cost .
Who disputes the fact that chronic lead poisoning lowers IQ and promotes criminal behavior ?
Yet in the presence of fluoridated water , small amounts of lead are are disabling generations of Americans .
The evidence continues to mount against fluoride .
This month Scientific American magazine carries a major article that assembles much of the data in one place .
“ Scientific attitudes toward fluoridation may be starting to shift , ” writes author Dan Fagin .
Fagin , the Director of New York University ’s Science , Health and Environmental Reporting Program , says , “ There is no universally accepted optimal level for daily intake of fluoride . ”
Fagin reports that some researchers wonder whether the 1 mg / L ( 250 times more fluoride than breast milk ) added to drinking water is too much .
Fagin ’s Scientific American article highlights total consumption because fluoride is also found in foods , beverages , medicines , and dental products .
With fluoride coming from a variety of sources , experts fear we are overdosing ourselves .
Fluoride overconsumption is visible first in children as dental fluorosis — white - spotted , yellow , brown and / or pitted teeth .
This is a sign of too much fluoride .
Depending on location , estimates of childhood fluorosis in the US range between 30 to 80 percent .
Before class - action lawsuits are filed , before the weight of science crushes the bureaucracy , let ’s take heed of the accumulated facts and make the necessary adjustments .
Even if it ’s sixty years late , the precautionary principle remains a valid guide .
Further damage will end with a moratorium on fluoride .

Insurer must pay $ 9 million for canceling policy Health Net dropped coverage for woman undergoing cancer treatment
A Southern California woman who had her medical coverage canceled as she was undergoing treatment for breast cancer was awarded more than $ 9 million Friday in a case against one of California 's largest health insurers .
Patsy Bates , 52 , a hairdresser from Lakewood ( Los Angeles County ) , had been left with more than $ 129,000 in unpaid medical bills when Health Net Inc. canceled her policy in 2004 .
The insurer contended Bates failed to disclose a heart condition and lied about her weight when she applied for the policy in July 2003 .
But arbitration judge Sam Cianchetti ordered Health
Net to pay her medical bills , plus $ 8.4 million in punitive damages and $ 750,000 for emotional distress .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
" It 's hard to imagine a situation more trying than the one Bates has had to endure , " Cianchetti wrote in his findings .
" The rug was pulled out from underneath , and that occurred at a time when she is diagnosed with breast cancer , one of the leading causes of death for women . "
Health insurers have come under fire from state regulators , attorneys and advocates for using mistakes or omissions in a member 's application to justify canceling coverage after a policyholder becomes ill .
Friday 's award marked the first punitive damages ordered by a judge in a case against an insurer for rescinding policies .
Hundreds of cases in California have been settled quietly in confidential agreements .
" This punitive award will do more than anything to stop the shameful practice of post - claiming underwriting , " said Bates ' attorney , William Shernoff .
" Other health insurers will obviously have to hear the message that the practice of canceling people 's health insurance after they become sick will not be tolerated by the public . "
Health
Net officials released a statement Friday saying the insurer will rescind no policies in the future without a binding , third - party review process .
Health
Net also said it would conduct a review of its practices and the way its brokers and agents are trained .
The company said it is working with state regulators and will make additional announcements in the coming weeks .
Friday 's award capped a difficult week for the insurer , which included being sued by the Los Angeles city attorney on claims of unlawful and deceptive business practices in connection with its rescission practices .
City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo also said the company illegally ran an incentive program in which it paid bonuses to an administrator for meeting policy - cancellation targets .
Bates , a mother of two , said she screamed when she heard about the damage award .
" I do n't have anger toward the company , " said Bates , whose cancer is in remission but who has some health problems .
" I hope what they 're saying is true , and that they 're going to change their policies and take care of the people they insure . "
Bates had previously been insured with another company but was persuaded to switch to a Health Net policy after an agent suggested she could save money .
She said she had undergone surgery to remove a tumor and had received her first two chemotherapy treatments when doctors stopped treating her because her bills were going unpaid .
A friend of Impeach for Peace just sent us this news release :
The Chatham Peace Initiative is sponsoring a rally at the County Court House , 401 Union St. , Hudson NY on February 26 , 2008 at noon in support of a petition by the town of Brattleboro , Vermont asking their Selectboard to have the town attorney draft indictments against President Bush and Vice President Cheney for crimes against our Constitution .
The town of Brattleboro secured sufficient signatures ( minimum of 5 % of Brattleboro voters ) to present to the select board which voted to allow it to be put on the ballot March 4 , 2008 .
The petition reads in full : “ Shall the Selectboard instruct the Town Attorney to draft indictments against President Bush and Vice President Cheney for crimes against our Constitution , and publish said indictments for consideration by other authorities and shall it be the law of the Town of Brattleboro that the Brattleboro Police , pursuant to the above - mentioned indictments , arrest and detain George Bush and Richard Cheney in Brattleboro if they are not duly impeached , and prosecute or extradite them to other authorities that may reasonably contend to prosecute them ? ”
The Chatham Peace Initiative is pursuing other avenues through NY State government to determine how it could take an action analogous to the town of Brattleboro’s .
In addition , since Vermont and New York are both in the 2nd Federal Court District , if the petition passes there is a possibility that any subsequent legal action would be conducted in the Federal Court House in Syracuse , NY .

Idaho authorities confirm arrest warrant for Senator Larry Craig 's daughter
Jason Rhyne
Published : Friday September 7 , 2007

When Senator Larry Craig 's daughter went public on ABC's Good Morning America to defend her father , she may have gotten a bit more publicity than she bargained for .
Following the show 's airing , a reader of Idaho 's Boise Guardian tipped the website that there was a warrant for Shae Suzanne Howell 's arrest .
" We checked with officials at the jail and according to their records the contempt of court warrant is active , " the Guardian reported .
" Chances are she may not have been aware of the warrant and until she became a television personality , few people ( including the coppers ) linked her name to Craig . "
The ABC News blog Political Punch says the appearance may have reawakened Idaho authorities ' interest in the case , reporting yesterday that Howell was charged with " unlawful entry " and " malicious entry to property " in November of 2006 , according to Boise 's Ada County Courthouse .
" But she missed her court date on April 9 of this year .
The arrest warrant was issued as a result of her failing to appear in court , " the blog 's Jack Tapper wrote .
Howell told ABC that her arrest warrant " has nothing to do with my dad 's job , " and said her charges were related to re-entering her own home during a " very difficult divorce . "
Caught " going into a house without permission and damaging property , " according to a Boise Police Department spokesman , Howell was given a summons but was not originally arrested or booked .
The contempt warrant for Howell 's arrest and other documents can be viewed at The Smoking Gun .
WASHINGTON – Barack Obama ’s ascendancy comes with a popular affirmation : “ Yes we can . ”
Maybe it should be “ Yes we click , ” as his presidential campaign takes online politics to new levels .
Obama became the front - runner for the Democratic nomination this month after a string of primary and caucus victories , and his inspirational appeal and effective campaign organization are getting most of the credit for his stunning success .
But there is another major factor : smart use of new technology , from record - breaking fundraising to Facebook widgets attracting new supporters and mass texting to keep his backers connected .
While every candidate in this year ’s presidential contest has used the Internet far more effectively than anyone who ran in 2004 , Obama is so far ahead of other candidates in Web traffic , social networking and user - generated video that he ’s in a class by himself .
“ Barack Obama is successful because he is Barack Obama , and his message is spot - on with Democrats , ” said David All , a Republican strategist specializing in new media .
“ But he is leveraging that with the most effective , comprehensive online strategy of any campaign .
He ’s using the tools that help you find and mobilize new voters . ”
Andrew Rasiej , a leading analyst of online politics , said the Obama campaign “ has come the closest to achieving the Holy Grail of politics on the Internet – converting online enthusiasm to offline action . ”
Other candidates also have struck gold on the Web this election cycle : Obama ’s lone remaining Democratic rival , Hillary Clinton , has mobilized an army of social - networking contacts into an outreach campaign of cell phone callers .
Democrat John Edwards developed a fervent following in the liberal blogosphere , and was one of the first candidates to hire popular bloggers .
‘ Money bombs ’
Republican Ron Paul ’s backers pioneered “ money bombs , ” and set a one - day mark with a fundraising haul online of $ 6 million last year .
Republican Mike Huckabee , on a shoestring budget , generated high Web traffic on his site by welcoming user - generated videos , many of them inspired by Huckabee ’s tongue - in - cheek Internet ad with Chuck Norris .
And John McCain , the likely GOP nominee who showed how online fundraising could fuel a campaign in 2000 , has been a leader in search advertising .
His campaign bought thousands of keywords on Google and Yahoo portals designed to lure users to McCain ’s Web site .
Eric Frenchman , an Internet strategist for McCain , estimated the campaign brought in $ 3 to $ 4 for every $ 1 spent on search ads .
But the extent of Obama ’s online fundraising prowess – $ 28 million in January , with signs that total will be exceeded this month – has outstripped all competitors and stunned many political analysts .
About 90 percent of that money came in donations of $ 100 or less , allowing donors to give again every few weeks – up to the limit of $ 2,300 each for the primary and general elections .
GOP strategist
All said he knew Obama was onto something during a summer visit last year to a friend in Ohio who planned to contribute $ 10 or $ 15 a month to Obama .
“ That campaign understood ahead of everyone else that you do n’t need to rely on megabucks and bundlers , and I ’m afraid some Republicans still do n’t get that , ” All said .
Obama ’s huge donor base , now approaching 1 million , allowed a long - shot campaign to grow into a national force , outspending Clinton in state after state .
And it freed up Obama to campaign while Clinton had to spend time with fundraising events .
“ This is a wonderful , new development , ” said Zephyr Teachout , a leader of the Howard Dean campaign in 2004 , which raised a total of $ 27 million online over many months .
“ Instead of calling rich people for money , you can concentrate on your campaign . ”
The campaign invested early in Internet infrastructure , spending $ 2 million in 2007 on software and hardware .
Some of Obama ’s new - media leaders , such as Joe Rospars , came from the Dean campaign and Blue State Digital , a consulting firm .
Tech - savvy backers
Steve Westly , a former eBay executive and California co-chair for Obama , said the campaign counted on tech - savvy supporters to “ put together the very best online fundraising tools , ” which really kicked in as Obama gained momentum .
In California , the Obama campaign used the Web - management tools of Central Desktop to organize its field operation .
But the Clinton campaign , using online networking and more traditional campaigning , relied on its army of cell phone users to make 2 million calls in the weekend before the primary .
Clinton won California by 9 percentage points .
The Obama campaign has gone beyond fundraising in its use of other new technologies .
The goal is to foster a community that does more than give money – writing e-mails and letters to superdelegates , attending house parties and other events , making phone calls and going door to door .
It helps that many supporters are younger voters who are digital natives .
They helped make Obama speech clips and a “ Yes We Can ” music video as popular as Britney Spears on YouTube .
Internet activists were also attracted to Obama ’s early support for the free use of video content such as TV networks ’ campaign debate clips .
“ Friends ” of Obama on Facebook get automatic news feeds from the campaign sent to their profiles , which are then seen by other friends .
The campaign mass - texts news updates ( “ CNN just projected Obama wins Wisconsin ” ) and reminders of where to vote in upcoming primaries .
“ The use of texting is a big thing , a very effective way to communicate and give people a way to take action , ” said Julie Germany , director of the Institute for Politics , Democracy & the Internet .
A survey by the Pew Internet and American Life Project last month found 27 percent of those under 30 had received campaign news through social - networking sites .
Rasiej and All said many campaigns are just discovering the value of social networks .
“ A primary means of political persuasion has always been people talking to each other – at the dinner table , over the water cooler , ” Rasiej said .
“ Now with these tools it ’s like having conversations on steroids . ”
Traffic leader
The Obama campaign Web site , www.barackobama.com, has attracted more traffic than others , according to several surveys , and makes an effort to keep supporters engaged .
Amy Fried , a political science professor at the University of Maine , conducted an experiment last year , signing up with the Obama and Clinton campaigns online .
“ There was a higher volume of messages from the Obama campaign , and they were doing more , ” Fried said .
That ’s a reflection of the Obama campaign ’s efforts at meshing online and offline activities .
A quick survey by Micah Sifry , Rasiej ’s colleague at the techPresident Web site ( www.techpresident.com), showed there were many more locally organized house parties and other events for Obama than the other two Democrats .
One example from mid-January : 189 in San Francisco for Obama , 29 for Edwards and nine for Clinton .
Teachout , the Dean campaign veteran who has done some volunteer work for Obama , said Obama ’s organizers learned from both the Dean and the George W. Bush campaigns of 2004 about ways to use the Internet to supplement field organizations .
One Dean veteran who competed fiercely with the Obama campaign – Joe Trippi , chief strategist for Edwards – praised Obama for building the best Internet - driven , “ bottom - up ” campaign he has seen in politics .
“ We were like the Wright Brothers ( in 2004 ) , a flimsy little thing with propellers , ” Trippi told a New Democrat Network gathering last week in Washington .
“ Just four years later , they ’re landing on the moon . ”

Fewer than half of American teenagers who were asked basic questions about history and literature during a recent telephone survey knew when the Civil War was fought , and one - quarter thought that Christopher Columbus sailed to the New World sometime after 1750 , not in 1492 .
The results of the survey , released Tuesday , demonstrate that a significant proportion of American teenagers live in “ stunning ignorance ” of history and literature , according to the group that commissioned it .
Known as Common Core , the organization describes itself as a new , nonpartisan research and advocacy organization that will press for more teaching of the liberal arts in American public schools .
The group argues that President Bush ’s No Child Left Behind law has impoverished America ’s public school curriculum by holding schools accountable for student scores on annual tests in reading and math but in no other subjects .
Politically , the group ’s leaders are strange bedfellows .
Its founding board includes Antonia Cortese , the executive vice president of the American Federation of Teachers , the union that is a powerful force in the Democratic Party , and Diane Ravitch , an education professor at New York University who was assistant secretary of education under George H.W. Bush .
Its executive director is Lynne Munson , a former deputy chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities and former special assistant to Vice President Dick Cheney ’s wife , Lynne .
The Internet humor piece variously entitled “ The L.A. Math Proficiency Test ” or “ The City of Los Angeles High School Math Proficiency Exam ” has been part of online lore since at least 1993 , and some of our readers recall having seen photocopied versions of it as far back as the mid-1980s :
City of Los Angeles
High School Math Proficiency Exam
Name:__________________________
Gang:__________________________
1 . Johnny has an AK - 47 with an 80 - round clip .
If he misses 6 out of 10 shots and shoots 13 times at each drive - by shooting , how many drive - by shootings can he attempt before he has to reload ?
2 . Jose has 2 ounces of cocaine and he sells an 8 - ball to Jackson for $ 320 and 2 grams to Billy for $ 85 per gram .
What is the street value of the balance of the cocaine if he does n’t cut it ?
3 . Rufus is pimping for three girls .
If the price is $ 65 for each trick , how many tricks will each girl have to turn so Rufus can pay for his $ 800 - per- day crack habit ?
4 . Jarone want to cut his 1/2 pound of heroin to make 20 % more profit .
How many ounces of cut will he need ?
5 . Willie gets $ 200 for stealing a BMW , $ 50 for a Chevy , and $ 100 for a 4X4 .
If he has stolen 2 BMWs , 3 4X4s , how many Chevies will he have to steal to make $ 800 ?
6 . Raoul is in prison for 6 years for murder .
He got $ 10,000 for the hit .
If his common law wife is spending $ 100 per month , how much money will be left when he gets out of prison and how many years will he get for killing the bitch that spent his money ?
7 . If the average spray can covers 22 square feet and the average letter is 3 square feet , how many letters can a tagger spray with 3 cans of paint ?
8 . Hector knocked up 6 girls in his gang .
There are 27 girls in the gang .
What percentage of the girls in the gang has Hector knocked up ?
9 . Thelma can cook dinner for her 16 children for $ 7.50 per night .
She gets $ 234 a month welfare for each child .
If her $ 325 per month rent goes up 15 % , how many more children should she have to keep up with her expenses ?
10 . Salvador was arrested for dealing crack and his bail was set at $ 25,000 .
If he pays a bail bondsman 12 % and returns to Mexico , how much money will he lose by jumping bail ?
Over time the “ exam ” has gone through some changes , notably the inclusion of questions 9 and 10 ( which were not part of the earlier versions ) .
Its humor is obvious : it simultaneously deplores the state of education in large urban centers and furthers the myth that teens from such regions are thoroughly steeped in a drugs , guns , gangs , and promiscuity culture by asserting that even the math questions directed towards them have to be framed in that context to be relevant to their lives .
None of the Norman Rockwellian “ Johnny has three apples ; if he sells two to Ben , then Becky gives him five , how many does he now have ? ” innocence appears here — even the test ’s header furthers the jape by asking for the student ’s name and gang affiliation , presenting the casual presumption that all the high schoolers being given the test are gang members .
Obvious humor or not , the “ test ” has landed a number of educators into trouble over the years .
The Canadian National Post reported that a teacher at the Juniper School in Thompson , Manitoba , was suspended from her duties in June 2002 for distributing this test to students :
A Manitoba school district has barred a Grade 8 instructor from classroom teaching for a year after she distributed a math quiz that used pimps and cocaine trafficking to illustrate questions of arithmetic .
The 10 - question quiz asked how much Willie would make for stealing a number of luxury cars , the distance a thief could travel on a stolen skateboard before he gets “ whacked , ” and how many “ tricks ” a day three prostitutes must turn to support their pimp Rufus ’s cocaine habit .
The School District of Mystery Lake in Thompson , Man. , suspended the veteran Juniper School teacher on June 5 , two days after irate parents brought the “ joke ” test to the district ’s attention .
This week the district disciplined her further by assigning her to non-classroom teaching until June , 2003 .
The teacher has not been identified .
“ I do n’t know where she got the idea to give this to kids .
We were outraged , ” one student ’s father , who asked not to be identified , told The Winnipeg Sun .
The father saw the “ Juniper School Math Proficiency Exam ” after his young son brought his copy home from school .
( Diana Hiscock , general manager of the Thompson Citizen , said that the controversial quiz was n’t given out as an official school assignment or test :
“ The teacher gave it to a few of her grade 8 students to read as a fun thing .
They took it home , and one of the parents saw it and complained to the school board . ” )
In 2007 , Will Klundt , a teacher at Moriarty High School in Moriarty , New Mexico , incorporated the following question into the final exam he administered to his fall semester algebra freshman class :
Smoky J. sells meth .
Smoky ’s source says he has to sell a G ’s worth of meth by the end of the month .
If Smoky sold $ 240 the first week and $ 532 the second week , how much money must Smoky make if he wants to avoid the beat down from his connection ?
Wayne Marshall , the school ’s principal , declined to discuss whether any disciplinary action would be taken against the teacher .
In 2008 , a Barrie , Ontario , police officer was suspended from duty for forwarding a version of the “ L.A. Math Test ” to other officers via e-mail :
A Barrie police inspector in charge of professional standards has been relieved of his duties after sending an e-mail containing racially inappropriate material to fellow officers .
James Farrell , a 30 - year police veteran , admitted to forwarding the inappropriate message to officers under his command .
The offensive e-mail with the subject line “ Afrocentric MATH for Toronto ’s new black only school ” was initially addressed to three officers and the entire street crime unit .
It was then forwarded and passed along within the organization eventually coming to light when an officer contacted The Toronto Star .
The message resembles a school math test with 10 “ problems ” based on firearms use , drug deals , pimping , theft and other criminal offences .
In 2016 , an Alabama teacher on the verge of retirement was put on leave after she reportedly gave the test to a middle school math class :
On the eve of retiring from her long career as an educator at Burns Middle School in Mobile , Ala. , a teacher gave a math test that students and parents say had racist overtones and references to inappropriate subject matter .
Questions included :
Tyrone knocked up 4 girls in the gang .
There are 20 girls in his gang .
What is the exact percentage of girls Tyrone knocked up ?
Those named in these later examples are far from the first persons to have been disciplined for distributing the “ L.A. Math Test . ”
In 1997 , six teachers at the Elsie Robertson High School in Lancaster , Texas , and another at the Norte Vista High School in Riverside , California , were suspended for doing the same thing .
Likewise , in 1994 , a Chicago elementary school teacher who gave a similar test was suspended for thirty days without pay and then resigned .
Also in 1994 , an Indiana high school teacher who gave the test apologized but was suspended anyway .
And in 1993 , a similar test was printed on phony school letterhead and passed around at workplaces in Redwood City , California .
The subsidized insurance program at the heart of the state 's healthcare initiative is expected to roughly double in size and expense over the next three years - an unexpected level of growth that could cost state taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars or force the state to scale back its ambitions .
State projections obtained by the Globe show the program reaching 342,000 people and $ 1.35 billion in annual expenses by June 2011 .
Those figures would far outstrip the original plans for the Commonwealth Care program , largely because state officials underestimated the number of uninsured residents .
The state has asked the federal government to shoulder roughly half of the program 's cost from 2009 through 2011 , but there is no guarantee of that funding .
Commonwealth
Care provides free or subsidized insurance for low - and moderate - income residents .
" The state alone cannot support that kind of spending increase , " said Michael Widmer , president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation , a business - funded budget watchdog group .
Even with federal backing , the state may not be able to afford the insurance initiative as designed , because the law did not make any attempt to trim wasteful health spending , said Alan Sager , a Boston University professor who specializes in healthcare costs .
Currently , 169,000 people have enrolled in the program , which is expected to cost $ 618 million in the fiscal year ending June 30 .
When it authorized the program in 2006 , the Legislature estimated that about 215,000 people would eventually be enrolled at a cost of $ 725 million .
State officials in late 2006 reduced that estimate to between 140,000 and 160,000 - a number that was surpassed last year .
" We 're paying the price of our own success , " said Widmer .
The administration of Governor Deval Patrick produced the new estimates to launch negotiations for federal funding , and has shared them with some state health leaders at closed - door meetings .
Patrick is seeking about $ 1.5 billion over three years , half the cumulative cost for Commonwealth Care .
The administration declined to discuss the numbers or the assumptions behind them , citing the ongoing negotiations .
In a statement , however , the governor 's spokesman , Joseph Landolfi , said , " It is clear that paying for healthcare reform will pose a much greater fiscal challenge than was anticipated by the previous administration .
We are committed to making health reform a success by aggressively pursuing cost savings and efficiencies in the healthcare system , as well as working with legislative leaders to review options for additional state revenues so that we can continue to afford this important initiative . "
The expanding need for new state and federal money is in sharp contrast to the statements made by former governor Mitt Romney , when he proposed the initiative in 2004 and as he campaigns for president .
He has repeatedly suggested that the state could insure low - income residents largely by reallocating money paid to hospitals and health centers that serve the uninsured .
" The bill that I submitted to the Legislature did n't cost $ 1 more than what we were already spending , " he said Wednesday night during a GOP debate .
" However , the Legislature and now the new Democratic governor have added some bells and whistles . "
In fact , Romney signed the law in 2006 as modified by the Legislature , approving most of the changes , but vetoing a few provisions that were overridden .
Lawmakers then estimated that the initiative would cost the state only a small amount of new money in the first few years .
It is now apparent that both Romney and lawmakers underestimated the cost of insurance subsidies as well as other parts of the initiative , largely because they based their projections on low estimates of the number of uninsured and the rising price of insurance .
When the law was passed , neither Romney nor the Legislature estimated the costs beyond next year because they believed the enrollment growth would be all but complete .
From the beginning , many health policy specialists said the initiative would cost the state more than expected .
Now , some say , the benefits of reaching near - universal insurance coverage may counterbalance the financial pain .
" I would n't say there 's an imminent danger that the whole thing is going to collapse , " said Robert Seifert , senior associate at the Center for Health Law and Economics at the University of Massachusetts Medical School .
" It 's challenging , but if it 's a priority for the administration , then I think it 's doable .
There are benefits that do n't appear in the budget numbers , " including healthier residents , who are less of a financial drain in the long run .
Government - funded costs of another part of the insurance initiative - expansion of the state 's Medicaid program , called MassHealth - are also projected to grow significantly .
The state is also seeking federal reimbursement for half of those expenses .
MassHealth covers the poor and disabled who have minimal financial assets .
Commonwealth
Care provides free or subsidized insurance to those who do n't qualify for MassHealth but have low to moderate incomes and no access to insurance through work .
Overall , spending on the healthcare initiative will total about $ 1.95 billion this year .
Slightly less than half of that will be funded by the federal government , with the rest coming from state taxpayers and other sources .
If the state does n't get all of the federal funds it is seeking , policy makers could face difficult choices : spend more state money or cut back the two programs by reducing enrollment , cutting subsidies , or eliminating benefits .
" We need that [ federal money ] to be able to continue the effort to provide MassHealth and Commonwealth Care to everyone who is eligible , " said Thomas Dehner , director of MassHealth .
Dennis Smith , the federal official who will negotiate the details of the federal contribution , declined to comment about the state 's request for more money .
RUNNING as a conserva tive , John McCain rolled up huge victories last night in New York , New Jersey and beyond .
But if history is any guide , the McCain we ’ve seen of late on the campaign trail is the most conservative McCain we ’ll ever see .
He has taken a commanding lead in the GOP primary by packaging himself as the “ true conservative ” committed to limited government , to slashed federal spending and to an avowedly conservative Supreme Court .
He claims the mantle of Ronald Reagan .
He even claims the mantle of Barry Goldwater , conservatism ’s crack version of Reagan .
But as McCain clinches the GOP nomination , he will begin his usual leftward lurch .
He will return to his lifelong positions as soft on illegal immigration , skeptical of tax cuts and favoring strong federal control over things like campaign financing .
McCain ’s appeal to independents and even the left is what makes him such a powerhouse in the general election .
It is also precisely what has so many in the Republican base so wildly fearful of handing him the keys to the kingdom .
If the Republican Party expands “ because we have a candidate who ’s going out trying to attract liberals by being like them , then the party ’s going to be around but you wo n’t recognize it , ” thundered radio king Rush Limbaugh .
The Republican Party will “ be over as it exists now , ” he warns .
To understand just how McCain has managed to limp to the front of the GOP field , look no further than the outcome of yesterday ’s West Virginia Republican Convention .
At the outset , victory was in the air for Mitt Romney , the flip - flopping former Massachusetts governor .
He is universally loathed by all the other GOP candidates , who banded together to give all their votes to Mike Huckabee – simply to deny Romney a win .
The depressing GOP field that has paved a path to victory for McCain also gave surprising wins last night to Huckabee in Georgia , Alabama and Tennessee , as well as in his home state of Arkansas .
Still , McCain has so radicalized key conservatives that some have vowed to turn themselves into suicide voters next November by pulling the lever for Hillary Rodham Clinton over him .
This last - minute blitz against McCain by Limbaugh and others , however , comes far too late .
But if those conservatives sit out the general election , they will help Democrats make history by electing either the first black president or the first female president next November .

Bush attacks Obama
For a while , the GOP leadership appreciated Obama for the headache he was giving Hillary Clinton .
But since Iowa , they 've begun to consider him a likely nominee , and his wins last night produced the clearest outline yet of a GOP strategy against him :
He 's not ready , they say , to be commander in chief .
If that sounds a bit familiar , it 's because it's what public polling , and presumably Mark Penn 's polling , also says is his biggest vulnerability , and it 's been Hillary 's consistent line of attack .
But the fact that it has n't sunk him in the primary does n't mean it wo n't work in the general against a candidate whose experience , unlike Hillary 's , is hard to contest .
Last night , GOP chairman Mike Duncan put out some statements on Obama'ss wins , including this line on the Louisiana primary : " If he wins the nomination , Barack Obama ’s liberal positions and thin record of experience will prevent him from being our nation ’s Commander in Chief .
Recent elections have proven that voters in Louisiana want strong Republican leadership – not liberal inexperience – and it will be proven once again this November . "
And this morning on Fox , President Bush himself echoed the attack , adding the ( also familiar ) hint that we do n't know enough about Obama .
" I certainly do n't know what he believes in .
The only foreign policy thing I remember he said was he 's going to attack Pakistan and embrace Ahmadinejad , " Bush said .
Of course , attacks from the other party can elevate a candidate in a primary , and Obama eagerly engaged , sending Bush 's words to reporters with a rejoinder .
" Of course President Bush would attack the one candidate in this race who opposed his disastrous war in Iraq from the start .
But Barack Obama does n't need any foreign policy advice from the architect of the worst foreign policy decision in a generation , " said Obama spokesman Bill Burton .
LONGYEARBYEN , Norway ( Reuters ) - Norway launched a Noah ’s ark of the plant kingdom on Tuesday to protect crop seeds , among mankind ’s most valuable resources , from cataclysm inside an Arctic mountainside .
Blasted out of icy rock 1,000 km ( 600 miles ) from the North Pole , the air - locked vaults would stay frozen for 200 years even in the worst - case scenario of global warming and if mechanical refrigeration were to fail , officials said .
Initially 100 million seeds from more than 100 countries have been sent for safekeeping at the $ 10 million facility which holds 268,000 seed samples , each from a different farm or field .
“ Biological diversity is under threat from the forces of nature ... and from the actions of man , ” Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said at the opening ceremony .
“ The seed vault is our insurance policy ” against threats such as war , natural disasters or climate change , he said .
Dubbed a doomsday vault , the cavern in the Svalbard archipelago off the northern tip of Norway is a backup storage for seeds from gene banks around the globe .
The deposits range from major African and Asian staples such as rice , maize , wheat , cowpea and sorghum to European and South American varieties of eggplant , lettuce , barley and potato .
Genetically modified varieties will not be included .
“ We will have a major ( seed ) collection here , one of the biggest in the world , from the opening day , ” Cary Fowler , head of the Global Crop Diversity Trust which is funding the operations of the vault , told Reuters .
Stoltenberg and 2004 Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai , a Kenyan environmentalist , put the first box of rice seed in the vault at an inauguration ceremony also attended by European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso .
CLIMATE TREATY
“ We hope and work for the best but have to plan for the worst , ” Barroso said .
He hoped international cooperation in setting up the vault could be matched by efforts to agree a new U.N. treaty to fight climate change at a meeting in Copenhagen due in late 2009 .
“ The conditions down here in the vault are perfect , ” Fowler said inside the gently sloping steel tube tunnel leading down to the three vault rooms that will be able to house 4.5 million samples , some 2 billion seeds .

“ In the past , when accidents or natural disasters or war intervened and destroyed samples , then that was it -- they were as dead as a dinosaur , extinct , ” Fowler said .
“ But we are going to put an end to extinction with this vault because we are going to have a safety backup , a Plan B . ”
Seeds deposited in the vault remain the property of the depositors , which include the world ’s major gene banks in developing countries .

During a visit to the site on Monday , whirring freezer equipment added an extra chill to the first vault room to be opened .
The seeds will be kept at a storage temperature of minus 18 - 20 degrees Celsius ( minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
Barley can survive 2,000 years , wheat 1,700 and sorghum almost 20,000 years under such conditions , the Trust said .
If the freezers failed , the permafrost would keep the cavern at around minus 4 Celsius , allowing time for repairs .
“ I like having a Plan B to our Plan B , ” Fowler said .
The rushing floodwaters in Evan Almighty , the heaving seas of the latter two Pirates of the Caribbean movies and the dragon 's flaming breath in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire all featured computer - generated fluids in spectacular action .
The science behind those splashy thrills will be recognized Feb. 9 with an Academy Award for Ron Fedkiw , associate professor of computer science at Stanford , and two collaborators at the special effects firm Industrial Light and Magic ( ILM ) .
" The primary work started a few years ago when we developed a system designed for the female liquid terminator in Terminator 3 , " Fedkiw said .
" Almost immediately after that it was used in the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie to simulate the wine that the pirate skeleton was drinking out of the bottle in the moonlight .
Things like the sinking ship in Poseidon and the large water whirlpool in Pirates of the Caribbean 3 are good examples of the system in action . "
The system , co-developed with ILM scientists Nick Rasmussen and Frank Losasso Petterson ( a former doctoral student of Fedkiw's ) , uses a method of simulating low - viscosity fluids such as water and fire , as in the explosions in Star Wars : Revenge of the Sith .
Contributing to a Star Wars movie was a particular honor for Fedkiw .
" George Lucas made Star Wars and , well , that changed the world for a lot of us , " he said .
" It 's amazing what a movie can do to a civilization .
I can only be grateful that he made three more of them and that I started working with ILM just in time to get a screen credit on the last one . "
Lifelike liquids
Computer graphics experts typically have used particles and complex blobs to represent water , but these can give rise to unrealistically lumpy or grainy surfaces .
Alternatively , they have used a technique called " the level set method " that gives a smooth surface representation , but some water is " under - resolved " and simply disappears when it breaks down into small volumes , as in a crashing wave .

The key innovation behind Fedkiw and former doctoral student Douglas Enright 's novel " particle level set method " was to mix the use of particles and level sets so that studios could maintain smooth surfaces wherever possible and still keep all the fluid via the particle representation .
" As an added bonus , the method automatically generates spray particles and bubbles in under - resolved regions where the level set [ method ] loses mass and volume , " Fedkiw said .
Fedkiw gives a lot of the credit to his colleagues for the system used to make the movies : " Nick made the system and Frank made it rock . "
The effect 's power is clearly evident in a movie on Fedkiw 's website .
There , gigantic waves crash against a lighthouse and produce huge sprays .
In addition to incorporating the particle level set method , the rendering also uses an additional method to simulate how the spray interacts with itself and the surrounding water .
Such integrations are indicative of a future direction of Fedkiw 's computer graphics research .
" This year we built a system that allows two - way coupling between rigid and deformable bodies , so we can fully physically simulate bones moving around under flesh — interacting with the environment , " he said .
" Another main result is a two - way , solid - fluid coupling method that can be used with it , so the environment can be water ; that is , we 're going to be simulating people swimming . "
Of course the more immediate future calls for a trip to the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills for the Scientific and Technical Academy Awards presentation Feb .
9 . Fedkiw says he 'll probably go to pick up his plaque .
" After wearing sandals for the last two years — even in the Lake Tahoe snow — it 's going to be tough to go black tie , " he said .
A US District Court judge in Oregon has reaffirmed a magistrate 's award of attorneys ' fees and the dismissal of exonerated RIAA defendant Tanya Andersen 's counterclaims against the RIAA without prejudice so that her class - action lawsuit against the record labels can move ahead .
Andersen , a disabled single mother who resides in Oregon , was sued by the RIAA in February 2005 for distributing gangster rap over KaZaA using the handle " gotenkito . "
She denied all of the RIAA 's allegations and filed the now - dismissed counterclaims in October of that year .
After over two years of contentious filings and allegations of misconduct by the RIAA 's investigators , Atlantic v. Andersen was dismissed with prejudice after the record labels decided to drop the case .
Andersen was awarded attorneys ' fees by the magistrate overseeing the case in September of last year , a decision that was quickly appealed by the RIAA .
In a ruling noticed this morning by copyright attorney Ray Beckerman , Judge James A. Redden agreed with the magistrate 's findings , writing that " the court 's order dismissing Andersen 's claims without prejudice provide a sufficient ' judicial imprimatur ' on the ' alteration of the legal relationship of the parties ' to justify conferring prevailing party status on Andersen . "
Tanya Andersen
Judge Redden also upheld the magistrate 's decision to dismiss her counterclaims without prejudice so that they could be heard as part of a malicious prosecution lawsuit filed by Andersen last June after the RIAA 's case was dismissed , citing the " interests of judicial economy and comprehensive litigation . "
Andersen 's malicious prosecution lawsuit accuses the RIAA of invasion of privacy , deceptive business practices , libel , slander , and a host of other misdeeds , saying that the RIAA has " engaged in a coordinated enterprise to pursue a scheme of threatening and intimidating litigation in an attempt to maintain its music distribution monopoly . "
Her complaint contains some very disturbing allegations , including one that labels attempted to contact her then eight - year - old daughter under false pretenses without Andersen 's permission .
Andersen is seeking class - action status for her lawsuit , which would allow anyone who was " sued or were threatened with sued by Defendants for file - sharing , downloading or other similar activities , who have not actually engaged in actual copyright infringement " to join the lawsuit .
The RIAA has denied any wrongdoing and has moved for dismissal of the lawsuit .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush shocked world energy producers in 2006 when he pledged to slash America ’s reliance on Middle East oil .
But today one of every two barrels of oil consumed in the United States still comes from foreign suppliers like Saudi Arabia , and that picture is not likely to change much through 2030 .
With Bush entering the final months of his presidency , the challenge of loosening the vise of U.S. import reliance will fall to his successors .
Bush entered the White House in 2001 as a Texas oil man with several energy experts on his Cabinet -- Vice President Dick Cheney was chief executive of oilfield services company Halliburton Co HAL.N and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice served on Chevron Corp 's CVX.N board of directors until early 2001 .
As oil prices rose ever higher , Bush sought to distance himself from the industry , insisting that oil companies did not need tax breaks from Uncle Sam with crude oil prices soaring .
But he has been unable to silence attacks from Democrats and others that his administration is cozy with Texas oil giants like Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N , which reported the highest - ever profit for a U.S. company in the fourth quarter of 2007 .
A DRY HOLE
One of Bush ’s first acts as president was to convene a secret panel of industry executives to help draft an energy policy blueprint .
But by many metrics , the security of U.S. energy supplies has gone from bad to worse during Bush ’s administration .
A major power outage hit the Northeast in 2003 , leaky pipelines shut down the biggest U.S. oil field in Alaska in 2006 , and Venezuela President Hugo Chavez stopped oil exports to Exxon this week in a nasty contract dispute over seized assets .
“ On Bush ’s watch , Big Oil drilled a gusher of profits , while promises to address energy security and costs were as empty as a dry hole , ” said Daniel Weiss , a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress , a Washington think tank .
When Bush took office in 2001 , average U.S. retail gasoline prices were around $ 1.70 a gallon .
Seven years later they average near $ 3 a gallon , offering U.S. consumers a constant reminder of the pain in their pocketbooks .
Oil prices more than doubled to above $ 90 a barrel -- adding more stress to a faltering U.S. economy - and profits for the biggest five oil companies doubled , setting off new calls in Congress for punitive tax measures on the industry .
To be fair , U.S. crude oil imports soared 33 percent during former President Bill Clinton ’s administration , as Americans took advantage of an unprecedented drop in crude oil prices .
As well , the Asian economic boom led by China and India also has a lot to do with soaring crude .
Though “ energy independence ” is a catchphrase for 2008 presidential candidates on both sides of the party divide , the real numbers paint a darker picture than , say , a television commercial for General Motors touting the virtues of ethanol - burning automobiles .
“ The story is that we ’re still going to remain heavily dependent -- over 50 percent certainly -- on oil imports to meet our consumption , ” said Doug MacIntyre , senior analyst for the U.S. government ’s Energy Information Administration .
In his annual address to Congress in 2006 , Bush said the United States should “ make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past . ”
In 2007 he followed through with a plan to boost fuel - efficiency of cars and require more ethanol use , to cut U.S. gasoline use by 20 percent in a decade .
Later that year , Congress passed a modified version of Bush ’s plan that required a five - fold boost in ethanol use by 2022 and the first increase in vehicle fuel - efficiency standards since 1975 .
Those actions , if successful , will have some effect on U.S. oil use , MacIntyre said .
But about two - thirds of the 20 million barrels of oil used in the United States every day go to fuel cars , trucks and airplanes .
“ I do n’t think even in the grandest schemes will ethanol replace gasoline , ” he said .
Current EIA data shows the share of imported crude oil and refined products holding fairly steady at about 60 percent through 2030 -- dropping briefly to about 55 percent in 2015 as new U.S. fields in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico give some temporary respite .
To be sure , U.S. oil supply could see a boost if Congress decides to speed up action on automobile efficiency rules , or find other ways to cut U.S. transport demand -- which accounts for about half of total oil usage .
But for now , the picture is decidedly bleak .
SUCKED DRY
With oil production in the United States , Mexico and the North Sea set to decline , the fate of world crude oil supply will be increasingly in the hands of OPEC suppliers like Saudi Arabia , Iran and Venezuela .
World oil demand will rise to 118 million barrels per day in 2030 from 83 million bpd in 2004 , and new OPEC production is expected to fill about 60 percent of the extra demand , according to EIA data .
Expenditures for crude oil and refined product imports are set to soar to $ 316.77 billion in 2030 from $ 264.68 billion in 2006 , according to the EIA .
With oil prices near $ 100 a barrel and the U.S. economy teetering on the edge of recession , oil executives have joined the list of doomsayers , and even Bush ’s fellow Republicans are wary about the country ’s precarious energy future .
“ We are being sucked dry by the amount of money we have to pay to other countries to buy their oil , ” Sen .
Pete Domenici , a New Mexico Republican , told Energy Secretary Sam Bodman at a recent hearing .
“ We are becoming a weaker nation by the day . ”
At a high - profile oil conference in Houston hosted by Cambridge Energy Research Associates , Hess Corp HES.N Chief Executive John
Hess predicted this week that " an oil crisis is coming , and sooner than people think . "

Once again , I am obliged to mention George Orwell and his novel , 1984 .
In the novel , Orwell describes the Youth League and the Spies , children in cahoots with the state who turn in their neighbors for all manner of imagined crimes .
Winston Smith , Orwell ’s protagonist , is called a “ Eurasian ” traitor and thought criminal by these heavily indoctrinated children , who would on the drop of a dime turn in their own parents to the thought police for the crime of unorthodoxy or nonconformity .
In 1984 , fear is rule of the day , as Big Brother is continually watching , not only through the eyes of children and omnipresent telescreens but through the acquiescence and sheepish compliance of the populace at large .
It would seem the Michigan State Police have taken a chapter from Orwell ’s book .
As the video above reveals , the cops in Michigan are encouraging citizens to snoop on all who “ do n’t belong ” and who might engage in “ suspicious behavior . ”
In the video , we are presented with a white homegrown terrorist in sunglasses and parka hood who wants to blow up a bridge with a backpack .
Thanks to the diligence of ever watchful citizens , this fictional character , essentially a cartoon , is prevented from carrying out his attack and is arrested by the police .
Of course , as should be obvious by now , there are no homegrown terrorists inspired by al - Qaeda .
In fact , the only putative terrorists about are created by the FBI , as the absurd case against a gang of impoverished black kids in Miami revealed well enough .
And then there was the FBI contrived plot to blow up pipelines at Kennedy Airport in New York , and the one at Fort Dix , where “ CWs , ” short for “ cooperating witnesses , ” or rather federal informants , a euphemism for agents provocateurs , framed Muslims who worked for a pizzeria .
The Michigan State Police “ educational ” video is but another spin on the effort to convert neighborhood watch groups into antiterrorist informant cells .
“ I envision 100 million Americans looking for indicators of terrorism and promptly reporting it to a central database where it would get analyzed , ” Mike Licata , a high school teacher and retired Air Force office who created CAT Eyes , told Carl Takei of the Boston Globe in 2003 .
“ If Licata comes even close to his stated goal of 100 million informers , CAT Eyes would dwarf the citizen informer programs of the most repressive totalitarian states , making them appear amateurish by comparison . ”
One third of the population snooping and informing on the other two thirds ?
Not even East Germany ’s notorious Stasi had such ambitions , as only about one of every 50 East Germans collaborated with the Stasi , at the time in the 1980s one of the most extensive police infiltrations of a society in history .
In America , naturally , we do things bigger and better .
Well before September 11 , 2001 — on December 4 , 1981 , to be exact — Presidential Executive Order 12333 was signed by Ronald Reagan .
It allowed the FBI , the military , and the CIA to infiltrate and “ influence ” domestic political groups and organizations , in other words it provided a legal green light for what was previously illegal under COINTELPRO , the program to subvert the constitutional rights of Americans .
“ The CIA ’s expanded role is especially ominous , ” writes Brian Glick .
“ In the 60s , while legally banned from ‘ internal security functions , ’ the CIA managed to infiltrate the Black , student and antiwar movements .
It also made secret use of university professors , journalists , labor leaders , publishing houses , cultural organizations and philanthropic fronts to mold US public opinion .
But it apparently felt compelled to hold back — within the country — from the kinds of systematic political destabilization , torture , and murder which have become the hallmark of its operations abroad .
Now , the full force of the CIA has been unleashed at home . ”
As the Associated Press noted in October , 2002 , the CIA “ is increasing its presence at FBI field offices by assigning intelligence officers to domestic anti-terrorism teams , ” a clear violation of its “ legislative ” charter , not that charters are of significance , as everything changed on September 11 , 2001 , at least according to our rulers and their minions .
Of course , everything changed well before that date , as even a cursory glance at the CIA ’s “ family jewels ” reveals .
As the above mentioned cases indicate , the FBI — with the assistance of the CIA , now ensconced in FBI field offices — is in the business of creating terrorism or the false impression of terrorism , never mind how fallacious or even absurd the examples are .
All of this ridiculous hoopla , dutifully covered by the corporate media , itself long ago penetrated and co-opted by the CIA under Operation Mockingbird , results in the impression we are under siege , lately by al - Qaeda inspired blond haired and blue eyed terrorists with European surnames .
Thus it should not come as a surprise the Michigan State Police is in the “ public relations ” business of indoctrinating us against the fictional threat .
As there are no al - Qaeda sleeper cells about , short of a handful of demented individuals posting on internet forums , it stands to reason there is no shortage of people ready to snoop , tattle and go after their neighbors for “ suspicious behavior , ” for instance insisting that the attacks of September 11 were an inside job .
In America , circa 2008 , supporters of non-sanctioned political candidates fall victim to having their car tires slashed and are molested at political rallies for the crime of not enthusiastically supporting candidates selected by our rulers .
In order to underscore the danger present , corporate media hacks such as Glenn Beck and Bill O’Reilly , reading from their Mockingbird scripts , warn of danger and violence to come , equating such people with homegrown terrorists and potentially violent lunatics .
Finally , it should be noted that the Michigan State Police ’s “ Seven Signs of Terrorism ” video was “ originally sent out to police and then to students .
But , the response by community groups that have seen the tape has been so good , authorities are trying to free up some homeland security money to distribute it to even more people , ” WZZM 13 reported in January , 2005 .
In short , the Ministry of Homeland Security pays to inculcate the masses in the bogus notion that white guys in parka hoods with bomb - stuffed backpacks are on the loose , ready at the drop of a hat to blow up bridges and presumably kindergarten classrooms .
It is all nonsense , but nonsense bought by millions of people who have spent the last few years supping up an unending stream of ludicrous propaganda , never mind the complete and glaring absence of any terrorist threat , from the CIA ’s own bastard creation al - Qaeda or any other terrorist organization .

Yusuf Garaad Omar , head of the BBC's Somali Service , explains the meaning of the robes .
These are the normal clothes that nomadic people wear .
The head turban is especially used by elderly people as a suggestion of respect .
It is something that has no meaning whatsoever in Somalia culture .
If you see someone dressed like that in Somalia , you think it is a nomadic person - that is all .
There is no religious significance to it whatsoever .
It is mainly the nomadic people who use it .
Some of them are religious , some are not .
It is simply a tradition of the place where they are from .
In this particular place , Wajir in north - east Kenya , the community is majority ethnic Somali .
They have a council for Peace and Development , and when they get delegates they dress them as a nomadic person .
I have been trying to track down the old man in the photo with Mr Obama , and I have been told he is Mohammed Hassan , the chair of the council itself .
But he is not in town today , and we could not get hold of him .
This debate reminds me of people back home in Somalia , who say that women should not wear trousers , or other cultures who say men should not wear a tie .
I just do n't think it makes sense .
The White House is in full - panic mode .
In fact , the falling stock market has the administration so worried that they 've concocted a “ stimulus package ” to rev-up flagging consumer spending and keep the economy on life - support .
The desperation is palpable .
Fed chairman Ben Bernanke 's appearance on Capital Hill on Thursday turned out to be a total bust .
Bernanke was supposed to calm jittery investors with promises of rates cuts and easy credit but , instead , his gloomy predictions put the Dow Jones into a 306 point tailspin .
Now it 's up to Bush to try to restore confidence in Wall Street and allay fears of a recession .
Since we first reported on the proposed “ stimulus package ” ( Bush 's Voodoo Stimulus Package ” ) the size of the rebates have increased dramatically .
The Democratic - led Congress was only calling for $ 250 per taxpayer or $ 500 per married couple , but under the White House plan , taxpayers could receive rebates of up to $ 800 per individual or $ 1,600 per couple .
The rebates will accompanied by additional cuts to the Fed Funds rate ( estimated 50 basis points ) which will provide more liquidity to the banking system and easier credit for consumers .
The administration 's desperate actions should remove all doubt that the main problem facing the economy is inflation .
It is not .
The moves are intended to forestall a deflationary spiral that is the corollary of 7 years of intensive neoliberal policies .
Ironically , now that Bush has achieved his goal of crushing the middle class and destroying the foundation of America 's consumer - based economy ; he has decided to change directions and shower those same over - extended , subprime people with a $ 150 billion gift from the government .
It makes no sense at all .
The negotiations on the stimulus package have given the Democrats their first victory over Bush .
The president has agreed “ not to push for a permanent extension of his 2001 and 2003 tax cuts . ”
Whoopee .
Unfortunately , the Dems do n't seem to grasp how dire the economic predicament really is or they would have asked for much more .
For example , they could have made the rebates contingent on troop withdrawals from Iraq or the closing Guantanamo Bay .
But that means that they would have to actually know something about the state of economy , which they do n't .
They 'd rather spend their time groveling for campaign contributions or applying tooth - whitener than following the collapse in the housing and stock markets .
Earlier today , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson emphasized the urgency of the situation on CBS's “ The Early Show ” saying :
“ What President Bush believes is that we 've got to do something that is robust .
It 's going to be temporary and get money into the economy quickly .
It 's going to be focused on consumers , individuals , families — putting money in their pocket .
And it 's going to be focused on giving businesses the incentive to hire people , to create jobs . "
Can you sense the panic ?
It 's funny in a way .
The Bush administration had been warned repeatedly about the disastrous effects of their supply side theories , but they just shrugged it off and carried on with the plundering .
Now that consumer spending is drying up , unemployment is rising , manufacturing is down , and foreclosures are soaring ; the Bush troupe is running in circles trying to find a way to stop the bleeding .
Good luck .
Remember the $ 2 trillion wars ( Iraq and Afghanistan ) that could be paid for with “ unfunded ” tax cuts to the rich ?
Remember the cuts to capital gains and corporate taxes that were supposed to “ trickle down ” to working class Americans creating more jobs and making us all more prosperous ?
Remember the low interest rates that were supposed to create Bush 's “ ownership society ” that , in fact , generated the greatest speculative frenzy in real estate in American history ?
Remember Dick Cheney 's brusque assurance that , “ deficits do n't matter ” ?
Remember the myriad corporate giveaways , the lavish “ no bid ” contracts , and deregulated subprime shenanigans that were supposed to “ grow the economy ” and strengthen our markets ?
The system is failing because it was designed to fail .
The impending economic crisis is no accident , but the predictable outcome of deeply flawed policies that are pushing the country towards a 1930s - type catastrophe .
Still , even disaster has its brighter side ; like watching the most - reviled , least - credible President in American history try to stop a crashing market with his miserable offers of “ cash rebates ” .

Bolton : US ' helped precipitate ' conditions for Bhutto's assassination Mike Aivaz and Nick Juliano

The US has seen its options for dealing with Pakistan crumble with Benazir Bhutto's assassination Thursday , and a former diplomat says American foreign policy decisions helped " precipitate " the former prime minister 's death .
John Bolton , former US ambassador to the United Nations , said it was a mistake to collaborate with Bhutto's " desire to get back into the game in Pakistan " and view her as an alternative to the country 's current leader , Pervez Musharraf .
" We in effect helped -- helped -- precipitate this dynamic that led to her tragic assassination , " Bolton said Thursday on Fox News ' Hannity & Colmes .
" It 's hard to see how that was the road to success . "
Bolton said the primary concern of the US needs to be the security of Pakistan 's nuclear arsenal .
With Bhutto's death plunging the country into chaos , there is now a " very grave danger " the weapons will fall under control of radical Islamist militants within the Pakistani military .
" What we have now is a prescription for chaos , " Bolton said .
Another foreign policy expert told RAW STORY Thursday that the death of the opposition leader likely has caused the so - called atomic " Doomsday Clock " to tick closer to midnight .
Thursday night , Bolton told Fox viewers that Musharraf is " the person to put our money on " in hoping for an acceptable resolution to the crisis in Pakistan , although even he faces the threat of assassination .
As soon as Bhutto returned to Pakistan in October -- part of a deal brokered by the US -- she was targeted by assassins in another suicide bombing .
US diplomats viewer her as the only hope for maintaining stability and promoting democracy , but Bolton argued perhaps the US acted to quickly in attempting to reform the country .
" You can't say this was n't foreseeable , and it 's obviously led to her death , " Bolton said .
" Hardly a successful strategy . "
The following video is from FOX's Hannity and Colmes , broadcast on December 27 , 2007
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Years before Melinda French met and married Bill Gates , she had a love affair - with an Apple computer . �
She was growing up in Dallas in a hard - working middle - class family .
Ray French , Melinda 's dad , stretched their budget to pay for all four children to go to college .
An engineer , he started a family business on the side , operating rental properties .
" That meant scrubbing floors and cleaning ovens and mowing the lawns , " Melinda recalls .
The whole family pitched in every weekend .
When Ray brought home an Apple III computer one day when she was 16 , she was captivated .
" We would help him run the business and keep the books , " she says .
" We saw money coming in and money going out . "
Of all the tricks that life can play , it 's hard to imagine any stranger than what befell Melinda French .
Today she is living in a gargantuan high - tech mansion on the shores of Lake Washington , married to the richest man in America - and giving billions of dollars away .
When she married Bill Gates 14 years ago , she bought into a complex bargain .
On the one hand , she became half of what has turned out to be the world 's premier philanthropic partnership .
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has assets of $ 37.6 billion , making it the world 's largest .
In that total is $ 3.4 billion that Warren Buffett has already given , and still to come are nine million Berkshire Hathaway B shares , currently worth $ 41 billion , that he has pledged to contribute in coming years .
Assuming that Berkshire ( BRKA , Fortune 500 ) shares continue to rise and that the Gateses continue to bestow their own wealth on their foundation , Melinda and Bill will very likely give away more than $ 100 billion in their lifetimes .
Already the foundation has disbursed $ 14.4 billion - more than the Rockefeller Foundation has distributed since its creation in 1913 ( even adjusted for inflation ) .
Along the way , Melinda has sacrificed privacy , security , simplicity , and normalcy .
In the late 1990s , during the Microsoft antitrust trial , her husband was widely regarded as the biggest bully in business .
And is n't anyone married to Bill Gates susceptible to losing her identity - to being perceived as the ultimate accessory ?
Forgive her if she overcompensates .
One day this past fall she spent many hours at her children 's school ( the Gateses have two daughters , ages 5 and 11 , and a son , 8 ) and then hosted a dozen dinner guests , including four African health ministers who were in Seattle for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Malaria Forum .
By 10 P.M. , after everyone had left , she was feeling frazzled and panicky about her speech the next morning .
" Just go to bed ! "
Bill told her .
" You know so much about malaria . "
Melinda dreads the spotlight , but the following morning she faced more than 300 scientists , doctors , and health officials .
She unveiled an audacious plan to eradicate malaria - a disease that kills more than one million people annually and has eluded a cure for centuries - and then answered questions with Bill .
Afterward the crowd buzzed about this woman whom even they , recipients of the Gateses ' billions , hardly know .
Today , at 43 , Melinda Gates is ready to reveal her full self - to go public , so to speak .
" I had always thought that when my youngest child started full - day school I 'd step up , " she says , sitting down with Fortune for her first - ever profile .
Although she admits she would prefer to stay out of public view forever , her older daughter got her thinking .
" I really want her to have a voice , whatever she chooses to do , " she says .
" I need to role - model that for her . "
She is spending more time on foundation work , up to 30 hours a week .
" As I thought about strong women of history , I realized that they stepped out in some way . "
She is stepping up also because her husband is doing the same .
Beginning in July , Bill , who is nine years older than Melinda , plans to spend more than 40 hours a week on philanthropy , leaving 15 or so for his duties as chairman of Microsoft .
Friends of the couple say that he would n't be shifting gears if it were n't for Melinda .
Moreover , they say , she has helped Bill become more open , patient , and compassionate .
" Bullshit ! " he bellows .
Nicer , perhaps ?
" No way ! " he shouts , grinning because he knows it 's true .
One thing he admits readily :
Thanks to Melinda , he is easing comfortably into his new role .
About the philanthropic work he says , " I do n't think it would be fun to do on my own , and I do n't think I 'd do as much of it . "
This is not exactly a marriage of equals .
Melinda is better educated than Bill , having graduated from Duke University with a BA ( a double major in computer science and economics ) and an MBA .
Harvard 's most celebrated dropout , Bill was awarded an honorary degree last June .
Melinda also outperforms him athletically .
She runs once a week with a few friends - seven miles in an hour , a brisk pace - and tries to exercise five days a week .
She has completed the Seattle marathon and climbed , with ropes and crampons , to the peak of 14,410 - foot Mount Rainier .
As for Bill , Melinda says , " He 's finally started to run in the last year . "
To give him credit , he is an aggressive tennis player and a decent golfer - sometimes playing with Melinda .
Beyond that , though , running on the treadmill while watching DVDs three nights a week is all Bill can do to keep up with his fit wife .
Melinda also understands people better than he does , Bill admits .
In fact , he uses her as a sounding board , sometimes for personnel matters at Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) .
In 2000 , when Steve Ballmer , with whom Bill has worked for 28 years , replaced him as CEO , Melinda helped ease the awkward transition .
" Melinda and I would brainstorm about it , " Bill says .
" You always benefit from your key confidante telling you , ' You think so - and - so stepped on your toes ?
Well , maybe he did n't mean to .
Maybe you 're wrong . ' "
Says the couple 's close friend Warren Buffett , who has known them since 1991 : " Bill really needs her . "
When it comes to investing their philanthropic assets , Melinda wields even greater influence .
Early on she and Bill agreed to focus on a few areas of giving , choosing where to place their money by asking two questions :
Which problems affect the most people ?
And which have been neglected in the past ?
While many philanthropists take the same tack , the Gateses , who love puzzles , apply particular rigor .
" We literally go down the chart of the greatest inequities and give where we can effect the greatest change , " Melinda says .
So while they do n't give to the American Cancer Society , they have pumped billions into the world 's deadliest diseases - most importantly AIDS , malaria , and tuberculosis - and failing public high schools in the U.S .
And while Bill is drawn , naturally , to vaccine research and scientific solutions that may be decades away , Melinda is interested in alleviating suffering right now .
" You can't save kids just with vaccines , " she says .
" I 'd go into rural villages in India and think , ' Okay , we saved this child .
But the cows are defecating in the stream coming into the village .
There are other things we need to be doing . ' "
Those other things include funding insecticide - treated bed nets to ward off malaria - carrying mosquitoes , providing microbicides to prevent the transmission of AIDS , and offering microloans and insurance to help the poorest of the poor start businesses and farms .
The Gateses ' latest mission , which developed out of a trip Melinda took to Kenya two years ago , is to recreate for Africa a green revolution similar to the program that increased crop yields in Latin America and Asia beginning in the 1940s .
In 2006 the Gates Foundation formed a $ 150 million alliance with the Rockefeller Foundation .
" Melinda is a total - systems thinker , " says Rockefeller president Judith Rodin .
" She and Bill dive into issues .
They care deeply , deeply , deeply about making a difference , but they do n't get starry - eyed .
They demand impact . "
The impact comes from the combination of Melinda 's holistic vision and Bill 's brainpower .
Bono , the rock star - humanitarian who is both a friend of the Gateses and a grantee ( through his One antipoverty campaign ) , calls their relationship " symbiotic . "
Noting Bill 's fierceness , Bono says , " Sometimes I call him Kill Bill .
Lots of people like him - and I include myself - are enraged , and we sweep ourselves into a fury at the wanton loss of lives .
What we need is a much slower pulse to help us be rational .
Melinda is that pulse . "
Buffett also believes that Melinda makes Bill a better decision - maker .
" He 's smart as hell , obviously , " Buffett says .
" But in terms of seeing the whole picture , she 's smarter . "
Would Buffett have given the Gates Foundation his fortune if Melinda were not in the picture ?
" That 's a great question , " he replies .
" And the answer is , I 'm not sure . "
“ Today man believes that there is nothing in him , so he accepts anything , even if he knows it to be bad , in order to find himself at one with others , in order not to be alone . ”

It has been nearly two weeks since the last reported cable failure in the Middle East , but questions continue to swirl regarding the cause ( or causes ) of the failures .
For those of you who have n't followed the story , here 's the quick rundown : From January 30 to February 6 , various undersea cables responsible for much of the Internet traffic into and out of the Middle East were cut or broken .
This led to major traffic congestion , created communications problems , and cut some areas off the Internet entirely .
Repair ships were dispatched immediately , with the twin goals of repairing the damage and gathering information on what might have caused it .
Reports from those vessels have apparently indicated that the may not have been caused by accident or through natural events .
According to the ITU's ( International Telecom Union ) head of development , Sami al - Murshed , " We do not want to preempt the results of ongoing investigations , but we do not rule out that a deliberate act of sabotage caused the damage to the undersea cables over two weeks ago , "
" Do not rule out , " does n't carry quite the same weight as " have proof of sabotage , " but of the five cable cuts , only one ( the link between the UAE and Oman ) is definitely established to have been an accident .
There are doubts regarding the others , as some experts feel that the cables were too deep to be cut and lie outside of normal shipping lanes .
The short period of time between the other four failures may also be indicative of deliberate action , as its unusual for multiple critical cable breaks to occur that close together .
Four of the five cables have been repaired at this point ; the repair status of the fifth cable is unknown .
Regardless of whether or not the tinfoil - hat conspiracy theorists actually managed to get one right , these cable - cutting incidents highlight just how dependent vast areas of the world are on a series of ( relatively ) thin cables stretched over thousands of miles of ocean .
Cable redundancy and satellite communications were able to keep certain businesses online throughout the Internet brownout , but it would n't be surprising if the nations affected push for the development of better redundant systems in the wake of the crisis .
Ironically , if the cable cuts were the result of sabotage , the saboteurs may have set in motion a chain of events that will strengthen the very global communication network they meant to disrupt .

We are Danny 's boys - and Danny 's girls - and according to the Times yesterday , there are 633 of us .
Somewhere back in 2007 we were the lucky ones who got our act together to buy tickets for the whole of Daniel Barenboim 's eight - concert cycle of the complete Beethoven piano sonatas at the Festival Hall .
Over the past three weeks , tickets to each concert have become some of the hottest must - haves in town .
The hall has been turning hopeful buyers away in droves .
Already the cycle is being lauded as London 's musical event of the year - and even , according to the Evening Standard , of the decade .
And now there is just one final concert and four more sonatas before it is all over .
For years , it was at the back of my mind to listen to a complete cycle of the 32 Beethoven sonatas .
Somehow it never happened .
But when the Barenboim cycle was announced - and all to be played in an unusually concentrated timetable of less than three weeks - I needed no second invitation .
These weeks have been ringfenced in my diary for months .
Right now , all my waking hours are dominated by Beethoven .
Before each concert I have studied the sonatas hard .
My iPod is crammed with recorded performances from Artur Schnabel to Mitsuko Uchida ( I like Claudio Arrau best ) .
Not everything in life lives up to expectation - but these concerts have exceeded my dreams .
When the last recital finishes tomorrow afternoon , I will be bereft .
I will find it hard not to cry as Barenboim begins the final movement of opus 111 , the one piece I cannot bring myself to study in advance .
Part of the rich emotional reward of these concerts has of course been to do with Barenboim himself .
London and Barenboim go back a very long way .
There has always been a special affection for him here .
Nowadays there is massive respect too , piling up from every direction for all his varied cultural and political achievements .
These recitals have therefore been special affirmations .
Each time Barenboim has stepped on to the platform he has been greeted with some of the warmest receptions I have heard .
If he does n't get a standing ovation even before he plays a note tomorrow , I will be amazed .
Actually , the real hero of these three weeks is not Barenboim .
It is Beethoven himself .
I am painfully aware that anything I try to write about the 32 sonatas is bound to be banal , because no one 's words can do justice to the imaginative range of the music that Beethoven conjured for the keyboard over his lifetime .
So I will take refuge in something that the pianist Louis Kentner once wrote .
The Beethoven piano sonatas , said Kentner , should be presented to the first Martian visitor to our planet as proof of what human civilisation is capable of .
Here , friend , we should say to the little green men .
This is the best of us .
Kentner belonged to a generation of Europeans who had no difficulty thinking about Beethoven in such respectful , even worshipful , terms .
Beethoven stood at the summit of musical culture until well into the second half of the 20th century .
Everything in music was to some extent conditioned by him .
But is that still true ?
Our age is suspicious of cultural hierarchy .
It celebrates cultural relativism .
Beethoven is certainly not in eclipse , but his music has become one choice among others .
On an iPod his sonatas are just another set of songs .
Listening to Barenboim play Beethoven throws down a challenge to that modern eclecticism .
The quality and intensity of these eight recitals insist on the uniqueness of Beethoven 's vision .
Of course , creative art cannot be entirely reduced to an absolute hierarchy .
But is there any greater musical achievement than these sonatas ?
If so , do tell me .
Music of this quality calls on us to be worthy of our inheritance - and pass it on , Alan Bennett - style , to others .
Years ago , when I was a history boy at Bennett 's own school , our teacher was challenged by a pupil who assured him that some rock star of the moment was better than his beloved opera , and that it was only the teacher 's opinion that opera was better .
" I will not allow you to say that all opinions are as good as one another , " the teacher reprimanded him .
" If someone tells me The Chocolate Soldier is better than Don Giovanni , that 's not an opinion .
That 's wrong . "
It is just not possible to disagree with that statement .
Some things are just better than others .
full stop .
In music , few things are better than the Beethoven piano sonatas .
Is that an elitist view ?
Yes it is .
But is there anything wrong with it ?
Not at all .
It 's not the audience that is an elite for liking the music .
It is Beethoven for writing it in the first place .
Barenboim has been performing these sonatas in a week when the culture secretary , Andy Burnham , has ordained that young people at school must get five hours of high - quality artistic and cultural activity a week .
This is an admirable decision in principle , as long as it can be sustained in practice for all .
But it will be sustainable only if we believe in it , and if it is not subverted by the insidious and widespread belief that Shakespeare or Beethoven or Cezanne are somehow too difficult or , even worse , not " relevant " enough for today .
The best art is not the only art , but it can be uniquely ennobling and it ought to be available to everyone .
If that smacks of a belief in educational " improvement " , I plead guilty as charged .
I think musical taste and public values need improving .
This would be a lot easier if the BBC was willing to put classical music or theatre on its main channels , as it once did .
But those days are gone , sadly .
Better reverence than irreverence .
Lenin once explained that he could not listen to the Appassionata sonata too often because , wonderful and immortal though it was , the sonata might make him falter in his task of smashing his enemies ' heads without mercy .
Does n't that sum up why the world is so much better off with Beethoven than with bolshevism ?
There are few things I know with any confidence .
One is that , in these piano sonatas , Beethoven went further towards expressing the vast scope of the human spirit in sound than anyone before or since .
The last movement of the final sonata takes that process as far as even he was able .
Both it and the edifice of 32 sonatas on which it rests are Beethoven 's imperishable achievement .
And yet , in an immensely significant way , the achievement belongs to us all .

The referenced bill , HR 1955 , does not define " force " per se , but if the President or some other government officials ever define force the way some dictionaries define it ( as illustrated in this YouTube video ) , we are closer to absolute tyranny than most of us probably thought we would be at this juncture in history .
I do not believe that the majority of our representatives who voted for this bill understood the possible implications of what they were doing when they signed this bill , but we all know now that our representatives have at times , voted for bills they did not read , study , or understand .
This kind of negligence could cost any of us our personal freedom , just as it has already cost hundreds of thousands of innocent people their lives , their homes , their health , and their happiness .
If the President were to take you off the street based on his own definition of " force " we might never hear from you again .

If you thought [ Johnny Lee ] was done making us all buy Wiimotes , you were wrong .
Now he ’s back showing off a simple , but incredibly effective VR head tracker .
He swapped out the LED ’s on a pair of LED light safety glasses with a set of IR LEDs and used his PC / Wiimote combo to do the work .
The demo is just fantastic .
As usual , you can download the software from his project page .
Some developers love working with relational databases , and other developers can't stand to touch them .
Either way - if your application uses a database , you have to treat the database with some respect .
The database is as much a part of an application as the code and the models inside the software .
Here are three rules I 've learned to live by over the years of working with relational databases .
1 . Never use a shared database server for development work .
The convenience of a shared database is tempting .
All developers point their workstations to a single database server where they can test and make schema changes .
The shared server functions as an authoritative source for the database schema , and schema changes appear immediately to all team members .
The shared database also serves as a central repository for test data .
Like many conveniences in software development , a shared database is a tar pit waiting to fossilize a project .
Developers overwrite each other 's changes .
The changes I make on the server break the code on your development machine .
Remote development is slow and difficult .
Avoid using a shared database at all costs , as they ultimately waste time and help produce bugs .
2. Always Have a Single , Authoritative Source For Your Schema
Ideally , this single source will be your source control repository ( see rule # 3 ) .
Consider the following conversation :
Developer 1 : It 's time to push the app into testing .
Do we copy the database from Jack 's machine , or Jill 's machine ?
Developer 2 : Ummmmmmmm , I do n't remember which one is up to date .
Developer 1 : We 're screwed .
Everyone should know where the official schema resides , and have a frictionless experience in getting a fresh database setup .
I should be able to walk up to a computer , get the latest from source control , build , and run a simple tool to setup the database ( in many scenarios , the build process can even setup a database if none exists , so the process is one step shorter ) .
How you put your database into source control depends on your situation and preferences .
Any decent O/R mapping tool should be able to create a database given the mappings you 've defined in a project .
You can also script out the database as a set of one or more files full of SQL DDL commands .
I generally prefer to keep database views and programmatic features ( including functions , triggers , and stored procedures ) as separate files - but more on this in a later post .
There are plenty of tools to help .
Leon Bambrick has a long list ( albeit one year old list ) of tools and articles that can help , while Jeff Atwood gushes over the virtues of Visual Studio for Database Professionals .
3. Always Version Your Database
There are many ways to version databases , but the common goal is to propagate changes from development , to test , and ultimately to production in a controlled and consistent manner .
A second goal is to have the ability to recreate a database at any point in time .
This second goal is particularly important if you are shipping software to clients .
If someone finds a bug in build 20070612.1 of your application , you must be able to recreate the application as it appeared in that build - database and all .
In a future post , I 'll describe an approach I 've used for database versioning that has worked well for many years of commercial development .
In the meantime , if you are looking for more database rule , then Adam Cogan and SSW maintain an excellent list .
The Republicans sounded as if they were reading old copy from Ronald Reagan ’s debate book .
They reminded us of Senator John McCain ’s quip during a visit to The Times when we asked why none of his party ’s candidates wanted to be seen as George W. Bush ’s heir .
“ We ’re all still trying to be Reagan ’s heir , ” he said .
On domestic policy , the Republicans offered trickle - down bromides , with the exception of Mr. Paul , who wants to scrap the tax code .
The others touted the power of tax cuts to boost the economy , an odd dissonance when Americans see economic woes all around them .
They spoke reverently of unregulated business , when Americans know the Bush administration ’s failures to regulate are at the root of the mortgage crisis that is driving the economy toward recession and are the reason they have to worry about lead in their children ’s toys and poison in pet food .
The Democrats fell over each other proclaiming their opposition to continuing those tax cuts .
Unlike the Republicans , who never mentioned it , the Democrats took on the mortgage crisis , saying it demonstrated the need to regulate the banks that made irresponsible loans and the investment firms that profited from them .
Except again for Mr. Paul , the Republicans tried to outbid the others ’ commitment to staying the course in Iraq .
That included Mike Huckabee , who defended his criticism of Mr. Bush ’s foreign policy as “ arrogant , ” but offered no new ideas on how to manage Mr. Bush ’s arrogantly mismanaged war .
We hardly expected calls for withdrawal , but none of the five who support the war offered the slightest sense of how to achieve the victory they said they wanted .
The four Democrats debated ideas for ending the war , a service to American voters who overwhelmingly want it to end .
Hillary Clinton , struggling for purchase against Barack Obama , who now owns the “ change agent ” mantle , came to life over this issue .
She called for withdrawal but sensibly said it must be done carefully , and that Americans have to accept the consequences .
SilverBrook Research has developed a new type of “ Memjet ” printer technology .
The devices use a printhead that consists of individual microchip segments , with each measuring 20 mm and containing 6400 nozzles .
This enables them to print at speeds of up to 2 pages per second .

This flu season , as always , many people will be reaching for the thermometer to see whether their temperature has surpassed that familiar , call - out - sick , stay - home - from - school benchmark : 98.6 degrees .
That number became the norm thanks to the work of a single German doctor working in the 1800s -- even though more recent studies show that it ’s probably too high .
In 1851 , Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich decided to start using a new instrument in his clinic : the thermometer .
He was among very few using the device , although he was n’t the first :
Thirty years earlier , a pair of French doctors had shown that inflamed body parts and exercising muscles were hotter than the rest of the body .
( They showed the latter by sticking a heat - sensitive needle in a man ’s arm while he sawed wood . )
They had also suggested that the average human body temperature was about 98.5 degrees .
Advertisement
Wunderlich set out to prove it .
Using a foot - long thermometer that took more than 15 minutes to give a reading , he took the underarm temperature of 25,000 patients several times over -- a total of more than a million readings .
( That ’s more than 250,000 hours , or 10,000 days , of temperature - taking , for those who are counting . )
In an astounding feat of patience ( given that calculators were unimaginable at the time ) , Wunderlich then averaged the temperatures and came up with 98.6 degrees .
The number stuck -- although it ’s starting to give way .

Since Wunderlich ’s day , doctors and researchers have observed that normal body temperature varies from person to person and changes depending on the time of day .
In 1992 , three doctors working at a Veterans Affairs hospital in Baltimore took several daily temperature measurements of 148 men and women over three days .
In a now oft - cited paper , they published their results :
The average temperature was 98.2 .
But the doctors , led by Dr. Philip Mackowiak , now a professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine , were hesitant to put too much stock in this average .
Like Wunderlich more than a century before , they found that body temperature rose and fell during the day , from a low at 6 a.m. to a peak at around 6 p.m .
Mackowiak ’s team found other influences on temperature variation .
Women in the study were slightly hotter than men ( 98.4 versus 98.1 ) , and blacks were slightly warmer than whites ( 98.2 versus 98.1 ) .

Other researchers have shown that age also matters : Children are warmer than adults , thanks to their rapid metabolism , and that cooling trend appears to continue throughout life .
A 2005 study showed that in 150 seniors , the average temperature was 97.3 degrees early in the morning and 97.8 just before bed .
All this has left many puzzled as to how Wunderlich came up with the number 98.6 .
One answer seems plausible .
After Mackowiak announced his results , he was contacted by a museum of medical artifacts in Philadelphia , which had a centigrade thermometer thought to have been used by the German doctor for his experiments .
Tinkering with the unwieldy instrument , Mackowiak noticed something :
The antiquated thermometer used to calculate a norm that the field of medicine has relied on for more than a century was calibrated 1.5 degrees Celsius ( roughly 3 degrees Fahrenheit ) too high .
Jan 30 ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential front - runner John McCain and his chief rival Mitt Romney clashed over Iraq and their conservative credentials during a debate on Wednesday in California at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library .
The candidates also faced questions on economic stimulus , immigration and other issues .
Here are some quotes .
MITT ROMNEY , FORMER MASSACHUSETTS
GOVERNOR :
" I do not propose nor have I ever proposed a public or secret date for withdrawal ( from Iraq ) .
It 's just simply wrong . "
" Raising it a few days before the Florida primary when there was little time for me to try to correct the record , when the question most frequently asked is ' Oh , you 're for a specific date of withdrawal ? ' sort of falls in the kind of dirty tricks that I think Ronald Reagan would have found to be reprehensible . "
" If you get endorsed by The New York Times , you 're probably not a conservative . "
( McCain was endorsed by the Times )
JOHN MCCAIN , ARIZONA SENATOR :
" I am proud of my record , and I am proud of reaching across the aisle and getting things done .
That 's what the American people want us to do . "
" I think my friend Gov. Huckabee , sir , will attest to the millions of dollars of attack ads and negative ads you ( Romney ) leveled against him in Iowa , the millions of dollars of attack ads you have attacked against me in New Hampshire , and have ever since .
A lot of it is your own money .
You 're free to do with it what you want to .
You can spend it all .
But the fact is that ... ... your negative ads , my friend , have set the tone , unfortunately , in this campaign . "
" We have an obligation to try to stem these greenhouse gas emissions .
And one of the ways is through the use of nuclear power .
The French generate 80 percent of their electricity with nuclear power .
I think that -- by the way , we now have a pro-American president in France , which shows if you live long enough , anything is possible in this world . "
MIKE HUCKABEE , FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR :
" I think what Americans are looking for is somebody to just be honest with them and straight with them and tell them that , no , it 's not better and it's not going to get better unless we have some serious leadership in Washington that says that we 're going to have to start having policies that touch the people not just at the top , but the people at the bottom .
" If we end up with the ( tax ) rebates , we 're going to borrow the $ 150 billion from China .
And when we turn it into rebates , most people are going to go out and buy some consumables like a pair of shoes that they probably do n't even need , but they 're going to buy them , and they 're most likely an import from China .
My point is , whose economy are we stimulating when we do that ? "
RON PAUL , TEXAS CONGRESSMAN :
" It 's ( Iraq ) an undeclared war .
And we have these silly arguments going on about who said what when .
I think it 's time to debate foreign policy and why we do n't follow the Constitution and only go to war with a declaration of war . "
" No , no , we 're not better off .
We 're worse off , but it 's partially this administration 's fault and it's the Congress .
But it also involves an economic system that we 've had for a long time and a monetary system that we 've had and a foreign policy that 's coming to an end and we have to admit this . "

Such mathematical discoveries do seem to be borne out in the real world .
Biological populations often exhibit erratic booms and busts that cannot be explained by any external cause .
Long - term weather patterns defy prediction by the most powerful supercomputers .
And a whole class of chemical reactions has been discovered in which the chemicals do not merely react and create a product , as they did in high school chemistry class , but oscillate back and forth between reactants and products .
( Some especially nice ones cause color changes in the solution , so you can sit there and watch the stuff in the beaker go back and forth every few seconds . )
The consistent story in all these discoveries is that the components of the system and their interactions themselves -- rather than any external cause -- give rise to the nonlinear behavior of the system as a whole .
A rough analogy is a dozen dogs standing on a water bed .
If one dog moves , he starts the bed sloshing around , which causes another dog to lose his balance and shift his weight , which sets up another wave of disturbance , until true chaos is reached .
IN the case of traffic , the German physicists -- principally Dirk Helbing and Boris Kerner , of Stuttgart -- found that given a certain combination of vehicle density and vehicle flow rate along a highway , the solution to their equations undergoes a sudden phase shift from freely moving traffic to what they call " synchronized traffic . "
Cars in all lanes abruptly slow down and start moving at the same speed as the cars in adjacent lanes , which makes passing impossible and can cause the whole system to jam up for hours .
In the traditional picture of traffic flow and congestion , the number of cars per minute that pass a given point on the highway at first steadily increases as the density of cars on the highway increases .
( As long as everything keeps moving freely , the more cars there are on a mile of a highway , the more flow by per minute . )
Eventually , however , further increases in density will cause a decrease in flow , as drivers begin braking to maintain a safe distance from the cars in front of them .
A graph of flow versus density thus forms an inverted V shape .
The uphill side corresponds to free flow , the downhill to congested flow .
The Germans found , in effect , that under the right ( or , rather , wrong ) circumstances the solution to the equations can tunnel right through this hill without ever reaching the top , jumping from a state of ( submaximal ) free flow straight to congestion .
Such a leap from one state to another is like what happens when a chemical substance changes phase from vapor to liquid .
It often happens that water in a cloud remains in the gas phase even after temperature and density have reached the point where it could condense into water droplets .
Only when a speck of dust happens along , providing a surface on which condensation can take place ( a " condensation nucleus " ) , does the transition finally occur .
Helbing and Kerner basically found that free flow and synchronized flow can occur under the same conditions , and that under such " metastable " conditions a small fluctuation in traffic density can act as the speck of dust causing the shift from one to the other .
Last week my husband brought me a " Pluto - Never Forget " shirt from Y - Que in LA .
It got me thinking - what is going on with Pluto ?
I went out on a Pluto fact finding mission ...
1. Pluto was demoted in August of 2006 on the last day of the International Astronomical Union meeting
2. Only ~428 of the 10,000 members were on hand to vote on the new definition of a planet ( ~4 % )
3. Prominent astronomers quickly launched a petition saying , " We as planetary scientists and astronomers do not agree with the IAU 's definition of a planet , nor will we use it .
A better definition is needed . "
Over 300 astronomers and scientists signed it within five days .
4. NASA 's Principal Investigator for the New Horizons mission to Pluto ( arriving in 2015 ) , Alan Stern , said of the process used to create the new definition " it 's sloppy science and it would never pass peer review "
5 . The IAU meets every three years , thus the next opportunity for them to revisit the issue wo n't be until 2009
6. Mark Sykes of the Planetary Science Institute is
organizing a conference in May 2008 call the Great Planet Debate to look at the issue critically and scientifically
7. Hayden Planetarium had already demoted Pluto in their exhibits even before the ruling , other museums and textbooks are being re-done now .
8 . The " When I was your age , Pluto was a planet " group on Facebook has over a million members and is one the 3rd or 4th largest groups on the site .
There has been a lot of cultural and public reaction for Pluto
( " Pluto - huggers " ) , and a lot of heated feelings against it
( " Pluto - haters " ) .
All the commotion raises an interesting point : where is the science ?
Professor Gingerich , who was running the planet definition vote at the IAU conference , said :
" In our initial proposal we took the definition of a planet that the planetary geologists would like .
The dynamicists felt terribly insulted that we had not consulted with them to get their views .
Somehow , there were enough of them to raise a big hue and cry , " Professor Gingerich said .
" Their revolt raised enough of a fuss to destroy the scientific integrity and subtlety of the [ earlier ] resolution . "
Although I am a self - confessed Pluto - hugger and sentimentalist ( and member of the Facebook group ) , I also have a deep interest in maintaining the integrity of science and of our use of science .
Once we have bent science to fit our wishes we will no longer have an objective process to use .
As Dr. Mark Sykes put it , " is science about getting your truth from an authoritative institution speaking ex cathedra from its belly button ? "
" Science is a process , it 's about finding what works , what explains things , what is useful , " he went on .
Sykes is one of the people hosting the conference in May 2008 that will give scientists the space to talk through all the data , the models , the options and to come up with a definition that is useful , that works and that fits the dynamicists needs as well as the geophysicists .
And if Pluto does n't win its way back into the planet column ?
At least I 'll have a way to explain it scientifically and know that I have the well thought out work of the whole astronomical community behind it .
Besides I can always tell kids that the really interesting thing is working out the details of the 250 + extra solar planets out there that we have never send a spacecraft to go study .
Maybe the debate could help demonstrate that science is not facts memorized out of a book , it 's a process for distilling new facts out of the universe - and that most of them are still out there waiting to be found .

As regular readers know , I sometimes like to make arguments for positions I do n’t hold , just to test my viewpoint .
Today I will argue that President George W. Bush will be regarded by historians as among the best presidents ever , and might get a place on Mt. Rushmore .
Reiterating :
This is not my view .
To judge the greatness of a president , you are allowed to consider only his top priorities .
For example , no one remembers Abe Lincoln ’s position on , well , anything except the Cvil War .
For the purposes of choosing a greatest president , you can round up all the little issues and toss them away .
For example , while critics might say restricting government funding for stem cell research is boneheaded , history has its own way of evaluating things .
If no stem cell breakthrough based on human embryos ever happens , despite all the private funding , President Bush ’s position will seem irrelevant to history .
If a privately funded research group makes a breakthrough , it will also make Bush ’s opposition of public funding seem irrelevant .
People might argue that public funding would have made it happen faster , but that issue will seem trivial over time .
The same can be said of all the smaller disagreements President Bush ’s critics have with him .
In a hundred years , they will not be part of what historians use to judge him .
So let ’s look at the big stuff .
President Bush famously promised to do something about the Axis of Evil : Iraq , Iran , and North Korea .
That was a top priority .
How ’s he doing so far ?
Iraq did n’t have any weapons of mass destruction , but by restricting inspectors , it acted as if it did .
That is almost as dangerous as having a nuclear weapon because it causes your neighbor ( Iran ) to build its own nukes , just to be safe .
It turns out they were doing just that .
Recently we learned that Iran stopped its nuclear bomb program in 2003 .
That ’s about the same time the U.S. was disemboweling its next door neighbor based on the suspicion of having a nuclear weapons program .
Iran probably noticed .
History will credit President Bush for removing the threat of nuclear war from the Middle East .
North Korea has also discontinued its nuke program , thanks in part , history might acknowledge , because when the U.S. invaded Iraq , it went after the leadership first , including sons .
That ’s the sort of thing that gets your attention if you are a dictator .
As with Reagan ’s Star Wars defense plan , the U.S. under President Bush seemed crazy enough to attack North Korea .
The threat was entirely credible .
That , plus China ’s pressure , neutralized North Korea .
Meanwhile , Libya surrendered its nuclear ambitions without even being asked .
Credit President Bush for that one too .
Terrorism was a priority during the Bush administration .
History wo n’t blame him for the first attack on 9/11 , but it certainly might credit him for the fact no other attacks happened during his two terms .
That ’s a perfect record on homeland security .
Also , as I have argued before , the war in Iraq might turn out to accidentally be the death of Al - Qaeda .
By showing a willingness to attack Muslims , any goodwill the organization had gained by attacking the United States began to erode .
Iraq became flypaper for terrorists .
They came in to Iraq , pissed off the locals , and the locals exterminated them in large numbers .
While the number of wannabe terrorists might have increased , you only have to kill the smart ones near the top several times before management is comprised of mostly the dumb ones by default .
History might record that Iraq was the turning point in the war on terror .
Al - Qaeda bet everything on Iraq , and lost .
President Bush did indeed “ fight them there so we do n’t have to fight them here . ”
While it did n’t happen exactly the way he envisioned it , history might credit him for moving the fight and winning it .
Then there ’s global warming .
Assuming it ’s real , the only solution is massive improvements in alternative energy .
Thanks to oil being over $ 100 a barrel , every time you read the news another huge corporation is installing solar panels in the desert , or synthesizing algae for biofuels , or harnessing the wind .
President Bush is a free market guy , and the free market seems to be stepping up .
Success in these alternative energy movements is not assured , but it seems likely , given all the venture capital flowing in that direction .
History will record that President Bush and his free market views saved the world from global warming .
The economy is n’t great , but it is n’t bad enough to detract from President Bush ’s place in history .
The same is true for crime , health , pollution , education , and any number of problems that wo n’t factor into his legacy one way or the other .
What do you think ?

AUGUSTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Walking into the Colur Tyme Tattoo Parlor is a lot like walking into a head shop .
One wall is lined with gang monikers and symbols , the other with bongs for smoking marijuana and other drugs -- one even shaped like a skull .
The Colur Tyme Tattoo Parlor was set up by authorities to get at the heart of gang members .
Only this head shop was a setup .
It was a police front in a sting operation to bust gangs in this Georgia river city that most people associate with the Masters Tournament -- not violent thugs with high - powered weapons .
Authorities said some guns sold to the shop were used in crimes just hours earlier .
The tattoo parlor was the brainchild of Richmond County Sheriff Ron Strength , who wanted to snuff out gangs carrying out violent crimes in his east Georgia community .
The idea was to create a place where the gang members would feel right at home , said sheriff 's Lt. Scott Peebles .
And that they did .
" We put the idea in their heads that there 's no way these guys are in law enforcement , " he said .
On Wednesday , more than 100 sheriff 's officers , state investigators and agents with the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives carried out a major bust after an 18 - month joint investigation into the gang activity .
Watch cops set up tattoo parlor »
Sixty - eight suspects were arrested on charges ranging from trafficking of illegal weapons to serious drug offenses .
Authorities seized more than 300 weapons , including high - powered assault rifles .
Rich Marianos , a special agent with the ATF , said such gang activity is spreading across the nation , with small - town gangs increasing their ties with gangs in major cities .
For instance , New York gangs have begun moving as far south as the Carolinas , where they set up operations to buy and sell guns and drugs , he said .
Chicago gang activity extends more than 60 miles into the Illinois city 's suburbs for narcotics and weapons trading .
In fact , Marianos said the ATF has begun seeing some Chicago gangs establishing a " pipeline " for illegal arms more than 500 miles away in Mississippi .
" It 's not just an urban problem , " Marianos said .
" We 're seeing it all over the country . "
The ATF , he said , has seen one of the most dramatic increases in gang activity in the last three years and is cracking down .
" We want to look at a way to go after these offenders and prevent it before it happens , " he said .
" [ We 're ] making the community safer by disarming the bad guys -- not taking guns away from the American citizen , but going after the people who should n't have them in the first place . "
That 's why setting up a tattoo parlor in Augusta was key .
Strength , the Richmond County sheriff , said he remembers when the worst crimes in these parts were lawn mower thefts and vandals pushing over birdbaths .
But those days are long gone , with gangs such as the Georgia Deadly Boys and Fairington Gangster
Thugs causing mayhem on a regular basis .
" In the past 2 1 / 2 years , we 've noticed some major changes , " he said , " with the type of criminal offenses they were involved in . "
So he devised the undercover business .
The Colur Tyme Tattoo Parlor on Tobacco Road was set up on the outskirts of Augusta .
It 's a location not heavily patrolled by police , but staffed 100 percent by undercover agents .
Do n't Miss Cops find themselves in arms race
Business was slow at first , but then things took off .
Gang members soon began dropping in to sell guns , drugs and even stolen cars , authorities said .
Every transaction was recorded by surveillance cameras around the store .
Soon the shop had so much business the Richmond County Sheriff 's Office had to call in reinforcements from the ATF .
Four federal agents helped the sheriff 's deputies man the counters ; others worked behind the scenes .
Vanessa McLemore , ATF special agent in charge , said the teams had to coordinate their behaviors so it seemed like they fit in the store .
" They spent a lot of time together learning each other 's mannerisms , learning each other 's body language .
It had to be a brotherhood , " she said .
On the store counter was a jar of colored markers to invite clients to write their favorite gang affiliation on the wall .
Peebles said agents used the wall for intelligence .
" At the very least we got names , " he said .
The shop even put up its ' own MySpace page .
" You think it , we ink it " was the MySpace slogan .
It featured the back of a tattooed man , and below in large red letters agents told visitors to the site , " We buy what others wo n't . "
Authorities said the guns came rolling in , and then came this week 's bust .
" Today marks the end of one era and the beginning of another , " McLemore said .
" The era that is ending is one that has brought destruction and decay to the streets of Augusta . "

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced today his support for a national carbon tax .
In what his aides called one of the most significant policy addresses of his second and final term , the mayor argued that directly taxing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change will slow global warming , promote economic growth and stimulate technological innovation — even if it results in higher gasoline prices in the short term .
Mr. Bloomberg presented his carbon tax proposal in a speech this afternoon at a two - day climate protection summit in Seattle organized by the United States Conference of Mayors .
( A copy of the speech was provided to The New York Times by aides to the mayor ; the full text is below . )
The summit ’s other keynote speaker , former President Bill Clinton , on Thursday announced an effort by his private foundation and the mayors ’ conference to help 1,100 American cities buy energy - efficient products as groups and qualify for volume discounts .
In calling for a carbon tax , Mr. Bloomberg was again speaking out on national issues , as he has on gun control and public health matters like smoking and obesity .
The mayor , who was elected in 2001 , left the Republican Party in June of this year and declared himself a political independent , fueling speculation that he might run for president .
While the presidential talk has simmered down lately , today ’s environmental address could revive it .
At the least , the tone and scope of Mr. Bloomberg ’s proposal suggested that he is eager to maintain a national profile on major issues and determined not to be seen as a lame duck for the remaining two years of his term .
( He is barred by term limits from seeking re-election in 2009 . )
Mr. Bloomberg ’s speech accused the federal government of failing to develop a meaningful response to global warming and asserts that both major political parties have dodged the issue .
In 1993 , President Clinton persuaded the House to adopt a B.T.U. tax ( a tax on the heat content of fuels ) , but the effort died in the Senate .
Many American politicians have considered endorsing a carbon tax politically suicidal ; among the few who publicly support the concept are Senator Christopher J. Dodd , a Connecticut Democrat and presidential candidate who has called for a corporate carbon tax , and former Vice President Al Gore , who won the Nobel Peace Prize last month for his work on climate change .
The idea of a carbon tax has slowly been gaining support , not only among scholars and environmentalists , but also in an unlikely quarter : business groups and even the companies that emit carbon dioxide and would be the most directly affected .
Earlier this year , several businessmen formed the Carbon Tax Center to argue for a revenue - neutral carbon tax .
Under that proposal , the revenue from a carbon tax could be used to reduce the deficit or to finance cuts in income taxes or the alternative minimum tax .
Most economists consider a carbon tax a more effective instrument for reducing greenhouse gas emissions than the other major policy alternative , a cap - and - trade system that would require plant - by - plant emission measurements and could prompt companies to cheat .
Mr. Bloomberg ’s staff cited research by Gilbert E. Metcalf , a Tufts University economist who is on leave to work with the National Bureau of Economic Research , and Kenneth P. Green , a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute , in support of that argument .
Mr. Bloomberg ’s speech called on political leaders to make necessary if unpopular choices — citing , as an example , his call for a congestion pricing plan that would tax vehicular traffic in Manhattan during the busiest weekday periods .
Despite the support of the Bush administration , which has offered to help finance the effort as a model for traffic mitigation , the plan has been controversial , and it is being studied by a commission made up of state and city lawmakers .
In today ’s speech , Mr. Bloomberg called for four key measures on climate change : a vast increase in energy - related research and development ; an end to certain agricultural subsidies , especially that of corn - based ethanol ; an increase in federal fuel efficiency standards for vehicles ; and laws to make pollution more expensive for companies .
He acknowledged that a cap - and - trade system is politically more feasible , but argued that it obscures costs and is less effective than a carbon tax .
Based on his decades in Wall Street and as head of his financial services company , Bloomberg L.P. , Mr. Bloomberg argued that “ the certainty of a pollution fee — coupled with a tax cut for all Americans — is a much better deal . ”
The full text of Mr. Bloomberg ’s prepared speech follows .
The mayor delivered the speech at 12:30 p.m. in Seattle ( 3:30 p.m. in New York ) .
I ’ve had the pleasure of working with Mayor Palmer , Mayor Nickels , Mayor Diaz — and many others in this room — through our coalition of Mayors Against Illegal Guns , which now includes more than 240 mayors from all around the country —
Republicans , Democrats , and independents .
If you have n’t joined yet , we ’d love to have you — and I think illegal guns and climate change are two of the best examples of cities leading where Washington has not .
On both issues , those in Washington prefer talk to action .
On illegal guns , they extol the virtues of the Second Amendment , which is all well and good , but let ’s get serious : protecting the Second Amendment does not stop you from keeping illegal guns out of the hands of criminals .
It ’s just a political duck - and - cover that allows legislators to escape responsibility for fixing a serious problem .
And innocent people — and police officers — are dying as a result .
On climate change , the duck - and - cover usually involves pointing the finger at others .
It ’s China - this and India - that .
But wait a second .
This is the United States of America !
When there ’s a major challenge , we do n’t wait for others to act .
We lead !
And we lead by example .
That ’s what all of us here are doing .
This conference has highlighted just how much local leadership there is on the issue of climate change and how many innovative new projects are going on in cities around the country : Seattle ’s incentives for greening existing buildings , Los Angeles ’s million tree initiative , Miami ’s bus rapid transit program — and the list goes on .
When we developed our long - term sustainability plan in New York , which we call PlaNYC , we made no apologies for stealing the very best ideas — and we came up with some of our own , including converting our 13,000 taxis to hybrids or high - efficiency vehicles .
This will not only help clean our air and reduce greenhouse - gas emissions , it will save each driver about $ 4,500 a year in gas costs .
Cities and states are both taking action , but the fact is , no matter how far we push the boundaries of the possible , there will be no substitute for federal leadership .
Leadership is not waiting for others to act , or bowing to special interests , or making policy by polling or political calculus .
And it ’s not hoping that technology will rescue us down the road or forcing our children to foot the bill .
Leadership is about facing facts , making hard decisions and having the independence and courage to do the right thing , even when it ’s not easy or popular .
We ’ve all heard people say , “ It ’s a great idea , but for the politics . ”
And let me give you just one example from New York .
Last spring , as part of our PlaNYC initiative , we proposed a system of congestion pricing based on successful programs in London , Stockholm and Singapore .
The plan would charge drivers $ 8 to enter Manhattan on weekdays from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. , which would help us reduce the congestion that is choking our economy , the pollution that has helped produce asthma rates that are twice the national average , and the carbon dioxide that is fueling global warming .
Now , the question is not whether we want to pay , but how do we want to pay .
With an increased asthma rate ?
With more greenhouse gases ?
Wasted time ?
Lost business ?
Higher prices ?
Or do we charge a modest fee to encourage more people to take mass transit and use that money to expand mass transit service ?
When you look at it that way , the idea makes a lot of sense , but for the politics , because no one likes the idea of paying more .
But being up front and honest about the costs and benefits , we ’ve been able to build a coalition of supporters that includes conservatives and liberals , labor unions and businesses , and community leaders throughout the city .
There is no problem that ca n’t be solved if we have the courage to confront it head - on — and put progress above politics .
Mayors around the country are doing it — and those in Washington can , too .
I believe it ’s time for both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to come together around a national strategy on climate change and to lead the way on an international strategy .
And I believe that until they do , it ’s our job as mayors to point the way forward .
That ’s why right after this conference , several of us will be testifying before a House committee that is holding a hearing on climate change here in Seattle .
It ’s why I ’m pleased to announce that New York City has recently joined a new campaign being launched by The Climate Group called “ Together . ”
It will unite businesses , think tanks , advocacy groups , faith - based organizations , and cities — and I urge all of the cities in this room to join , and to invite your neighbors .
It will be a national effort to help all Americans make a difference in the fight against climate change .
And it ’s why next month , I will go to the U.N. climate change summit in Bali , in the South Pacific , as a guest participant , and to support our delegation .
It ’s time for America to re-establish its leadership on all issues of international importance , including climate change .
Because if we are going to remain the world ’s moral compass — a role that we played throughout the 20th century , not always perfectly , but pretty darn well — we need to regain our footing on the world stage .
That means ending the “ go - it - alone ” approach to foreign affairs that has never served America well .
It did n’t work in the 1920s , when we tried to isolate ourself from the world , and it has n’t work in recent years , when we ’ve tried to stand above it , pretending that vital international treaties can simply be ignored .
The fight against global warming is a test of America ’s leadership — and not just on the environment .
Climate change presents a national security imperative for us , because our dependence on foreign oil has entangled our interests with tyrants and increased our exposure to terrorism .
It ’s also an economic imperative , because clean energy is going to fuel the future .
Jobs are on the line here — good jobs of every kind : Farm jobs .
Factory jobs .
Engineering jobs .
Sales jobs .
Management jobs .
If we do n’t capture these jobs , they ’ll just move overseas .
Green energy is going to be the oil gusher of the 21st century , and if we ’re going to remain the world ’s economic superpower , we ’ve got to be the pioneers — just as America always has been .
How do we do it ?
I think we need a strategy that embraces four basic principles , and I ’d like to briefly outline them today .
First , we need to increase investment in energy R & D .
Right now , we ’re spending just one - third of what we were in the 1970s .
If we really want to be able to manufacture competitively priced biofuel and solar power , if we really want to sequester the carbon dioxide released from coal , we have to be willing to make the commitments that will drive private capital to these projects — and right now , we ’re just not doing that .
Second , we have to stop setting tariffs and subsidies based on pork barrel politics .
For instance , Congress is currently subsidizing corn- based ethanol at 50 cents a gallon — and you can argue that ’s good agricultural policy , but you ca n’t argue that it ’s good for consumers or the environment .
Because it is n’t .
Consumers pay more for food , and producing corn - based ethanol results in much more carbon dioxide than producing sugar - based ethanol .
But are we subsidizing sugar - based ethanol ?
No !
We ’re putting a 50 - cent tariff on it .
Ending that tariff makes all the sense in the world , but for the politics .
Everyone knows that politically driven policies are costing taxpayers billions while providing only marginal carbon reductions — but we need leaders who will do something about it !
Third , we have to get serious about energy efficiency — and the best place to start is with our cars and trucks .
In 1975 , Congress passed a law requiring fuel efficiency standards to double over 10 years , from 12 miles a gallon to 24 , with incremental targets that auto manufacturers were required to meet .
But since 1985 , Washington has been paralyzed by special interests .
If the same incremental gains had been adopted for the last two decades , think of where we would be now !
We ’d all be saving money at the pump , we ’d be producing less air pollution and greenhouse gas , Detroit would be in a stronger competitive position and the “ Big Three ” may not have lost so many more jobs .
( Just yesterday , Chrysler announced another 12,000 job cuts . )
Those job losses hurt hard - working Americans , and we have to ask ourselves :
Do we want even more middle - class factory workers to be handed pink slips and left to look for service jobs at half the wages ?
Because that ’s the direction we ’re heading in if we continue to fall further and further behind other countries in producing fuel - efficient vehicles .
The current Senate energy bill would raise Corporate Average Fuel Economy ( CAFE ) standards from 27.5 to 35 miles per hour by 2020 .
That ’s nowhere near the leap we made from 1975 to 1985 , and many foreign cars are already getting 35 miles to the gallon .
Even so , U.S. automakers are trying to water down the Senate bill — and if Congress caves , you can bet the loudest cheers will be heard in Japan .
Raising fuel efficiency standards is the best thing we could do for U.S. automakers — and it would ’ve been done years ago , but for the politics .
Fourth and finally , we have to stop ignoring the laws of economics .
As long as greenhouse gas pollution is free , it will be abundant .
If we want to reduce it , there has to be a cost for producing it .
The voluntary targets suggested by President Bush would be like voluntary speed limits — doomed to fail .
If we ’re serious about putting the brakes on global warming , the question is not whether we should put a value on greenhouse gas pollution , but how we should do it .
This is where the debate is moving , and I ’d like to briefly touch on the pros and cons of the two approaches that are most often discussed : creating a cap - and - trade system , and a putting a price on carbon .
Both of these ideas share the same goal : raising the cost of producing greenhouse gas pollution .
If you want less of something , every economist will tell you to do the same thing : make it more expensive .
Of course , none of us wants to pay more for electricity or gas or anything else .
Rising energy costs , rising health costs , rising college tuition — the middle class is getting squeezed left and right .
But raising the cost of pollution can actually save taxpayers money in the long run — and I ’ll explain how in a minute .
But first , you might be thinking : “ Wait a second .
Five years ago , oil was selling at $ 30 a gallon .
Now it ’s selling at more than $ 90 , and we ’re not buying any less of it .
So why would raising the cost of carbon make any difference ? ”
The answer is :
It would and it would n’t .
People are going to keep buying gas whether it costs $ 1 a gallon or $ 2.75 a gallon — or even more — because the demand for gas is inelastic .
But the demand for coal is far more elastic than oil , and so if its price goes up , many power plants would likely switch to natural gas , which is much cleaner , and the 100 coal plants that are now on the drawing boards would likely convert to natural gas as well .
Raising the cost of carbon would also make alternative energy sources more cost - competitive , which would lead more consumers and property owners to make the switch .
To raise the cost of carbon , we can take either an indirect approach — creating a cap - and - trade system of pollution credits — or a direct approach : charging a fee for greenhouse gas pollutants .
The question is : Which approach would be more effective ?
I ’ve talked to a number of economists on this issue , people like Gilbert Metcalf at the National Bureau of Economic Research , and every one of them says the same thing : A direct fee is the better approach — but for the politics .
There ’s that phrase again : “ But for the politics ! ”
Cap - and - trade is an easier political sell because the costs are hidden — but they ’re still there .
And the payoff is more uncertain .
Because even though cap - and - trade is intended to incentivize investments that reduce pollution , the price volatility for carbon credits can discourage investment , since an investment that might make sense if carbon credits are trading at $ 50 a ton may not make sense at $ 30 a ton .
This price volatility can also lead to real economic pain .
For instance , if 100 companies release higher emissions than they had planned for , they all have to buy more credits , which can create a very expensive bidding war .
That ’s exactly what ’s happening in parts of Europe right now , and it ’s going to cost companies there billions of dollars .
There are also logistical issues with cap - and - trade .
The market for trading carbon credits will be much more complex and difficult to police than the market for the sulfur dioxide credits that eliminated acid rain .
And there are political issues — because the system is subject to manipulation by elected officials who want to hand out exemptions to special interests .
A cap - and - trade system will only work if all the credits are distributed from the start — and all industries are covered .
But this begs the question :
If all industries are going to be affected , and the worst polluters are going to pay more , why not simplify matters for companies by charging a direct pollution fee ?
It ’s like making one right turn instead of three left turns .
You end up going in the same direction , but without going around in a circle first .
A direct charge would eliminate the uncertainty that companies would face in a cap - and - trade system .
It would be easier to implement and enforce , it would prevent special interests from opening up loopholes and it would create an opportunity to cut taxes .
I was in England a month ago talking to the Conservative Party , which has proposed a series of revenue - neutral “ green taxes ” that would be offset by reductions in other taxes .
I believe that approach merits consideration — and the most promising idea I ’ve heard is to use the revenue from pollution pricing to cut the payroll tax .
After all : Employment is good , pollution is bad .
Why should n’t we lower the cost of the good and raise the cost of the bad ?
Studies show that a pollution fee of $ 15 for every ton of greenhouse gas would allow us to return about $ 500 a year to the average taxpayer .
And a charge on pollution would be less regressive than the payroll tax , because the more energy you consume , the more you would pay .
That would give us all of us an incentive to reduce our energy use — whether that ’s buying a more fuel efficient appliance , or making the switch to compact fluorescent light bulbs , as we ’ve done in New York ’s City Hall – and as I ’ve done in my own home .
Under this approach , even though energy costs would rise , the savings from tax cuts and energy efficiencies could , over the long run , leave consumers with more money in their pockets .
Creating a direct charge for greenhouse gas pollution would also incentivize the kinds of innovation that a cap - and - trade system is designed to encourage — without creating market uncertainty .
To do this , a portion of the revenue from the pollution charge would be used to create an innovation fund , which would finance tax credits for companies that reduce their greenhouse gas pollution .
As a result , companies would have two big incentives to reduce their pollution : minimizing the charges they would have to pay and maximizing their tax savings .
And unlike a cap - and - trade system , the certainty of tax credits would be more likely to lead companies to make the long - term investments in clean technology that will allow us to substantially reduce greenhouse gas pollution .
Both cap - and - trade and pollution pricing present their own challenges — but there is an important difference between the two .
The primary flaw of cap - and - trade is economic — price uncertainty .
While the primary flaw of a pollution fee is political , the difficulty of getting it through Congress .
But I ’ve never been one to let short - term politics get in the way of long - term success .
The job of an elected official is to lead – not to stick a finger in the wind .
It ’s to stand up and say what we believe — no matter what the polls say is popular or what the pundits say is political suicide .
From where I sit , having spent 15 years on Wall Street and 20 years running my own company , the certainty of a pollution fee — coupled with a tax cut for all Americans — is a much better deal .
It would be better for the economy , better for taxpayers and — given the experiences so far in Europe — it would be better for the environment .
I think it ’s time we stopped listening to the skeptics who say , “ But for the politics ” and start being honest about costs and benefits .
Politicians tend to prefer cap - and - trade because it obscures the costs .
Some even pretend that it will lower costs in the short run .
That ’s nonsense .
The costs will be the same under either plan — and if anything , they will be higher under cap - and - trade , because middlemen will be making money off the trades .
( I happen to love middlemen .
They use Bloomberg terminals and support my daughters .
But what ’s right is right ! )
For the money , a direct fee will generate more long - term savings for consumers , and greater carbon reductions for the environment .
And I do n’t know about you , but when the economists say one thing and the politicians say another , I ’ll go with the economists .
Of course , I also understand that you ca n’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good .
Whether it ’s a direct fee or cap - and - trade , we ca n’t be afraid to try something — to do something — to act .
As mayors , we ’re all familiar with those who respond to every problem by saying , “ Do another study , ” or by scaring voters with doom - and - gloom predictions .
That approach is why we have health care costs that have spiraled out of control , it ’s why we have public school systems that were allowed to collapse , and it ’s why we ’re still fighting poverty with the same old programs that have n’t worked .
But remember , this is America !
We ca n’t be afraid to lead , to innovate , to experiment .
Cities are n’t afraid .
We ’re showing that we can do better , we can make progress , and we can do it in a way that is good for the environment and the economy .
It ’s time for Washington to do the same and to show the world that America is ready to be a leader .
When our representatives run for re-election or higher office , they talk about “ a chicken in every pot . ”
But why not tell us who ’s going to pay , how it ’s going to work , when it ’s going to be implemented , and if it does n’t work , what ’s Plan B ?
We need our leaders to have the courage to talk about and implement real climate change solutions , not just because it ’s good for the world , but because it ’s good for America , our environment , our national security and our economy .
Make no mistake : Real jobs are on the line here — because cleaner energy sources are going to be a cornerstone of the 21st - century economy .
If we ’re going to remain the world ’s economic superpower , we have to create predictable incentives that will drive technological innovations and allow us to lead the world in developing clean , reliable and affordable energy .
We can do it !
If we stop saying : But for the politics !
In the weeks and months ahead , our job is not just to continue innovating — but to demand that those in Washington join us .
Tell them that it ’s O.K. to stand up and be honest about the costs and benefits of real solutions .
We ’ve done it — and we ’ve not only lived to tell the tale , we ’ve won support and respect from our constituents .
They can , too .
And we ’ve got to hold them accountable for doing it .
So let ’s get to work .
Jan. 6 , 2007  --
Last year 's wildly popular Beyond Belief 1.0 scientific conference primarily focused upon and championed irreligion .
The Beyond Belief 2.0 conference held at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , Calif. , this past November was wider in scope .
Rather than aiming to be another undiluted atheist lovefest , it attempted to consider changes in the ideas of the Enlightenment that are necessary given advances in various disciplines since the 18th century .
At least that was the stated aim , but any gathering that included the diverse luminaries in attendance would be guaranteed to roam all over the intellectual landscape .
Despite the roaming and the diversity , however , the conference remained -- pardon the adolescent alliteration -- an unbeliever 's utopia , a heathen 's heaven , a pagan 's paradise .
The complete video of the conference proceedings is available online HERE , and I urge readers to view it and related material for themselves .
The video 's marquee names include philosophers Daniel Dennett , David Albert and Patricia Churchland , physical scientists Stuart Kauffman , Sean Carroll and Harold Kroto , biologists and cognitive scientists V.S. Ramachandran , David Sloan Wilson , Lee Silver and host Roger Bingham , writers Rebecca Goldstein , David Brin and Robert Winter , various stars , such as Sam Harris , P.Z. Myers and Michael Shermer , and a host of others .
Some of the Contributions
I was fortunate enough to be invited because of my new book , " Irreligion -- A Mathematician Explains Why the Arguments for God Just Don't Add Up . "
Since the book has just come out this month , I 'll take the liberty of noting that it briskly examines and succinctly deconstructs the 12 most common arguments for God .
If I may quote myself and continue with the entertainment metaphor , these arguments range from " what might be called golden oldies to those with a more contemporary beat .
On the playlist are the first cause argument , the argument from design , the ontological argument , arguments from faith and biblical codes , the argument from the anthropic principle , the moral universality argument , and others . "
Along the way , I digress and insert impious observations and whimsical musings on a variety of irreligious themes , ranging from the nature of so - called miracles , creationist misuse of probability , and an imaginary conversation with a sort of minimalist " divinity " to cognitive illusions , Thai Internet Web cams , and prudential wagers .
With that bit of shameless self - promotion out of the way , I note that many of the conference 's participants did try to broaden the approach to religion beyond the irreverent chest - thumping of the BB 1.0 meeting .
Biologist David Sloan Wilson , in particular , urged people to consider how religion functions in a society .
It does n't do , he claimed , to simply label it irrational and ignore its adaptive role .
Unfortunately , he went on to make some points about group selection that were , to my mind , a bit less reasonable .
Psychologist Jonathan
Haidt also took a more charitable view of religion and its positive impact in binding people together and blunting their more selfish tendencies .
( The latter point has always seemed more than a bit dubious to me , considering that studies on crime rates , divorce , alcoholism and many other measures of social dysfunction show that non-believers in the United States are extremely under - represented along each of these dimensions . )
Stuart Kauffman , who 's worked extensively on complex systems , argued against the reducibility of all science , much less all knowledge , to physics .
Higher - level phenomena must be consistent with physics , of course , but are too complex to be derived from it .
Kauffman , although an atheist / agnostic like most of the conferees , even went so far as to tentatively propose introducing the term " God " to describe these unpredictable emergent consequences of physical laws .
Psychological foibles and failings were discussed and , since cognitive scientists were in attendance , some of the discussion was pleasantly data - rich .
Neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran explained his work on a particular kind of synesthesia , the ability to see numbers or letters as having different colors , 4 as green , 5 as red , et cetera .
People have questioned whether the phenomenon is real , but in an experiment in which many 5's and a few 2's , which are similar - looking but reversed , are intermixed on a screen , synesthetes are immediately able to pick out the 2's .
Everyone else takes a while to locate them .
The explanation for this ability is , roughly , that the areas of the brain dealing with color are close to those dealing with letters and numbers and occasionally these two areas bleed into each other .
Adam Kolber spoke on the legal and ethical implications of neurotechnology , in particular the use of drugs to dampen or even eliminate traumatic memories .
More generally , he discussed techniques to measure aspects of our subjective experience and assess how iffy and malleable our mentality is .

Pat Churchland discussed mirror neurons and unconscious mimicry and the role such mimicry plays in evolution and the social interactions that are a big part of religious practice , and Daniel Dennett supplied new stories and wise counsel regarding " Darwin 's dangerous idea " and its implications for religion and science .
Jonathan Gotschall , a literary theorist , argued convincingly that literary scholars could benefit from a more hard - headed tack when studying texts , one that took advantage of elementary mathematical notions , scientific principles and common sense .
The alternative to not doing so is more hoaxes like that perpetrated by physicist Alan Sokal when he submitted a paper full of arcane but , in the context , meaningless scientific terms to a literary journal whose editors , impressed with the paper 's seeming profundity , accepted it .
There were also informative talks by two novelists , a musician , a lawyer , two economists , a couple of historians , and several other humanists of one flavor or another .
Despite some efforts to broaden the approach to religious matters , most attendees did not seem particularly intent on deepening Enlightenment ideas .
Chemistry Nobel - prize winner Harry Kroto spoke of his global educational efforts in science and scoffed at the efforts by the Templeton Foundation and others to find some kind of rapprochement between religion and science .
He also noted that though very large majorities of Americans say they believe in God , only a bit more than 5 percent of the members of the National Academy of Sciences do .
Chemist Peter Atkins made similar remarks .
There was little talk of politics at the conference , but no one held out much hope that any presidential candidate would come courting the group .
It certainly would n't be former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , who believes in the biblical creation story , but not evolution , nor former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , who has said , somewhat frighteningly , that " freedom requires religion , " nor any of the others who seem to tout their religious faith even when asked about the policies of the Federal Reserve .
Near end of the conference , Sam Harris reiterated the critical importance of evidence and rationality and also addressed the question of whether science and religion can be reconciled .
I agree with him and probably most of the other attendees that , though there is much to be gained by considering different approaches to knowledge and life , the answer is no .
Since religions ( except possibly a couple that are devoid of dogma ) make many significant factual claims -- historical , biological , and cosmological -- that are simply and egregiously false , science and religions do not deal with separate realms and cannot be reconciled .
Again I urge readers , especially those with a different perspective , to browse through the hours of video of the conference proceedings at http://thesciencenetwork.org/BeyondBelief2/.
It 's a good show .
John Allen Paulos , a professor of mathematics at Temple University , is the author of the best - sellers " Innumeracy " and " A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper , " as well as of the just - released " Irreligion : A Mathematician Explains Why the Arguments for God Just Don't Add Up . "
His " Who 's Counting ? " column on ABCNEWS.com appears the first weekend of every month .
The choice of Java as a first programming language in computer science courses is undermining good programming practice , according to two leading academics .
In a withering attack on those responsible for setting the curriculum for computer science courses , doctors Robert Dewar and Edmond Schonberg of New York University ( and principals of Ada language specialist Adacore ) have said the lack of mathematical rigor and formal techniques is producing " replaceable professionals " more suited to the outsourcing industry than software development .
They singled out Java for specific criticism and note that its restricted use in the development of web applications stunts novice programmers ' potential .
Referring to their experiences at New York University , the duo said : " Students found it hard to write programs that did not have a graphic interface , had no feeling for the relationship between the source program and what the hardware would actually do , and ( most damaging ) did not understand the semantics of pointers at all , which made the use of C in systems programming very challenging . "
While the good doctors acknowledge that " real programmers can write in any language " , they specifically laud the virtues of C , C++ , Lisp and Ada .
All of which makes the criticism of Java somewhat odd .
Java syntax is derived from C++ and both languages have their flaws and virtues .
Java 's close association with web applications probably influences the way the language is taught in universities - but this is not a flaw in the language rather in the way it is presented to students .
It would be equally valid to criticize Lisp because it is closely associated with the fruitless pursuits of the artificial intelligentsia or Ada because it is used to build weapons systems .
Academics , though , do have something of a habit of descending from the ivory tower to vent on specific programming languages and their users .
Renowned computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra described those exposed to Basic as " mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration " while Tony Hoare famously lambasted Ada for its limitations in his Turing award speech in 1981 . ®
How do you build a team that trusts each other to speak their mind and take risks ?
How do you make it possible for the team to engage in passionate and sometimes emotional debate , knowing that they will not be punished for saying something that might otherwise be interpreted as destructive or critical ?
It 's not about trusting that your team members will behave in a certain way .
It 's about building vulnerability - based trust , where it 's safe to take risks and face conflict on the team rather than fear it .
In The Five Dysfunctions of a Team : A Leadership Fable , Patrick Lencioni writes about building vulnerability - based trust and overcoming the fear of conflict .
Vulnerability - Based Trust is the Place to Be
I 've been on many teams throughout my career and there 's a big difference between a team that trusts each other to take risks and speaks their mind versus a team that trusts each other in terms of predicting behavior .
Having experienced both , I know that vulnerability - based trust is the place to be .
I also know that it comes from shared experience over time and through the right behaviors .
My personal favorites for building vulnerability - based trust include going out to lunch and taking the team off - site .
I prefer to do the off - site earlier versus later so that the team can learn each others ' styles and learn the rhythms in a low overhead way .
It 's actually a working off - site , where as a team , we kick off the project together in a shared room .
Building the shared experience really helps humanize the relationships and improve understanding across the team .
Vulnerbility - Based Trust
Lencioni writes :
" In the context of building a team , trust is the confidence among team members that their peers ' intentions are good , and that there is no reason to be protective or careful around the group .
In essence , teammates must get comfortable being vulnerable with one another . "
Standard Definition of Trust
Lencioni writes :
" This description stands in contrast to a more standard definition of trust , one that centers around the ability to predict a person 's behavior based on past experience .
For instance , one might ' trust ' that a given teammate will produce high - quality work because he has always done so in the past . "
Trust and Great Teams
Lencioni writes :
" As desirable as this may be , it is not enough to represent the kind of trust that is characteristic of a great team .
It requires team members to make themselves vulnerable to one another , and be confident that thei respective vulnerabilities will not be used against them .
The vulnerabilities I 'm referring to include weaknesses , skill deficiencies , interpersonal shortcomings , mistakes and requests for help .
As ' soft ' as all of this might sound , it is only when team members are truly comfortable being exposed to one another that they begin to act without concern for protecting themselves .
As a result , they can focus their energy and attention completely on the job at hand , rather than on being strategically disingenuous or political with one another . "
Achieving Vulnerability - based Trust
Lencioni writes :
" Achieving vulnerability - based trust is difficult because in the course of career - advancement and education , most successful people learn to be competitive with their peers , and protective of their reputations .
It is a challenge for them to turn those instances off for the good of a team , but that is exactly what is required . "
The Costs of Failing Are Great
Lencioni writes :
" The costs of failing to do this are great .
Teams that lack trust waste inordinate amounts of time and energy managing their behaviors and interactions within the group .
They tend to dread team meetings , and are reluctant to take risks in asking for or offering assistance to others .
As a result , morale on distrusting teams is usually quite low , and unwanted turnover is high . "
How to Build Vulnerability - Based Trust
Lencioni writes :
" Unfortunately , vulnerability - based trust cannot be achieved overnight .
It requires shared experiences over time , multiple instances of follow - through and credibility , and an in - depth understanding of the unique attributes of team members .
However , by taking a focused approach , a team can dramatically accelerate the process and achieve trust in relatively short order . "
Tools
Lencioni identifies some tools you can use :
Personal histories exercise .
Humanize the relationships by sharing your life stories and backgrounds .
.
Humanize the relationships by sharing your life stories and backgrounds .
Team effectiveness exercise .
Identify the single most important contribution that each of their peers makes to the team , as well as one area that they must improve upon or eliminate for the good of the team .
Focus on one person at a time , starting with the team leader .

Focus on one person at a time , starting with the team leader .
Personality and behavior preference profiles .
Some of the most effective and lasting tools for building trust on a team are profiles of team member 's behavioral preferences and personality styles .
These help break down barriers by allowing people to better understand and empathize with one another .
Lencioni recommends the Myers - Briggs Type Indicator ( MBTI ) for profiling .

360 - degree feedback .
These are riskier than the other tools because they call for peers to make specific judgements and provide one another with constructive criticism .
The key is divorcing it entirely from compensation and formal performance evaluation .
It should allow employees to identify strengths and weaknesses without any repercussions , otherwise it can take on dangerous political undertones .

Experiential team exercises .
This includes ropes courses and other experiential team activities .
While they do n't always translate directly to the working world , they can be valuable tools for enhancing teamwork as long as they are layered upon more fundamental and relevant processes .
Key Take Aways
Here 's my key take aways :
MOSCOW , Russia ( CNN ) -- Russian authorities are investigating the recent killing of a model - turned - bodyguard .
Anna Loginova in a photo shoot for the Russian edition of Maxim magazine .
Anna Loginova , a 29 - year - old former successful model , ran a private security firm of female bodyguards , highly trained in martial arts , demanding high prices to protect Russian billionaires .
One notable client was Russian boxer Kostya Tszyu .
A carjacker pulled Loginova out of her Porsche Cayenne Sunday in Moscow .
Loginova grabbed onto the door handle as the car picked up speed and she was dragged along the street before letting go as the car sped away .
" An intruder just threw her out of the car " Russian police stated , " She grabbed the door handle , but when the car picked up speed , she let go . "
Her fearlessness proved fatal .
Loginova died on the scene from serious cranial injuries .
The vehicle was later found abandoned in southern Moscow .
Luxury car theft is common in Moscow .
Loginova told Maxim magazine in a recently taped interview that she fought off a car thief just four months ago .
" I stepped out of my car and closed the door when I suddenly saw a young man near me .
He grabbed me by the arm in which I was holding the car keys , " she was quoted as saying .
" By reflex , I used a jiu - jitsu technique .
I twisted his arm and hit him on the face with my elbow .
The guy obviously was not expecting such a reaction .
He fell down on the rear windshield , which gave me enough time to grab my gun .
He immediately jumped into his Honda and drove away , "
Those who knew her said she was never deterred by danger .
For many Russians she was a feminine icon , bridging the glamorous world of modeling and the rough underbelly of Russian crime .
" I think she was kind and sweet , not like a terminator , not like Sigourney Weaver in ' Aliens ' " said Igor Cherski from Maxim magazine " but I feel that she was not afraid of anything , there was no fear in her eyes . "

錯視（visual illusion）とは視覚性の錯覚のことであり、錯覚（illusion）とは実在する対象の真の特性とは異なる知覚のことである。
このように、錯視の定義は簡単なのだが・・・

「 『顔ガクガク錯視』はさかさま顔では弱い」
左図を見ると、4つ目で口が2つの女性というよりは、観察者の目が落ちつかないかのように、図がガクガクして見える。
すみませーん、この錯視、名前はありますか？
知っている方は文献を教えて下さい。 →北岡にメールする この 「顔ガクガク」錯視は、さかさま顔では弱い（右図）ので、顔特有の錯視であろう。
Copyright Akiyoshi Kitaoka 2007 ( December 10 )
上下で目の大きさが違って見えるのは、ジャストロー錯視。なお、上下で口の大きさが違って見える錯視は、ジャストロー錯視とは言いにくい。
サッチャー錯視のページはこちら
さらに分析： 「 顔ガクガク錯視」は目だけでは起こらないようであるが、口を正しい位置につければ起こるようである。さらに顔の輪郭をつけると錯視量が増大するようである（下図参照）。
---------
「 顔ガクガク錯視」については、double vision と呼んでいる充実したサイトがあるという報告がありました（Sさん、ありがとう）。double vision あるいは diplopia は日本語では複視と訳され、ものが二重に見える病気のことです。
しかし、顔ガクガク錯視は病気ではないので、複視ではありません。複視ではなく、複視的錯視（illusion of double vision）とか呼ぶのなら、OKと思います。複視的錯視は、オオウチ錯視や蛇の回転などと同様の静止画が動いて見える錯視の一種です。
といずれにしましても、だれが最初にこの現象を発見したのかを知りたいので、さらに情報を求めます。よろしくお願い致します。

「 サッチャー錯視のイラスト版 」
左の図は笑顔の女性を描いたイラストをさかさまにしたもので、右の図は左の図の目と口をそれぞれ上下反転させたものである。右の図を見るとあまり奇妙な感じは受けないが、図をさかさまにして見る（下図）と、かなり奇妙な顔になっていることがわかる。この錯視はサッチャー錯視と呼ばれ、Peter Thompson先生が1980年（サッチャーが首相になった次の年）に発表した。Peterは自分自身の顔でもやっているが、ヒゲまでさかさまにするのは反則では（笑）。

First term Congresswoman Kristen Gillibrand ( D - NY20 ) , in a highly - vulnerable district in New York 's Hudson Valley , is being attacked , not for her politics , not for her stand against the Iraq war , not for the earmarks she 's bringing home including money for rural broadband development .
Nope ...
She 's being attacked because she and her husband have conceived a child .

" There are many occupations suitable for women and their physical attributes .
Carrying a weapon while serving in the Armed Forces and firefighting are not suitable lines of work for women to prove that they are physically equal to men .
How many male police officers feel comfortable with a 100 pound female backup ?
And now , I have to add serving in the U.S. House and Senate as an occupation that may not be suitable for women .
Ms. Gillibrand 's current pregnancy makes a strong case for my opinion .
Ms. Gillibrand was elected to serve her constituency , and while she is away from her elected office she cannot perform those duties .
The taxpayers who were duped into voting for her will have to pay for her medical benefits .
Yes , Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer , Ms. Gillibrand receives excellent health benefits , courtesy of her constituents .
We will be without representation in Congress for a time leading up to and following the child 's birth .
There will be times when she and the new baby will visit doctors .
You can add those days to the total that she will not be serving her constituents .
The current base salary ( 2006 ) for members of the House and Senate is $ 165,200 per year .
I wonder if Ms. Gillibrand will do the right thing and reimburse the U.S. Treasury in the amount of $ 452.60 , her daily salary , for each day that she is unable to perform her elected duties .
For some reason , I doubt it .

This year , thousands of Citigroup employees can expect bonuses based on their work in 2007 , when the bank ’s results have been less than stellar .
One , however , will get a bonus based largely on his performance in 2006 , which was a better year : Charles O. Prince III , who resigned under pressure as chairman and chief executive last week .
Mr. Prince , arguably the person most responsible for Citigroup ’s enormous problems , can expect at least a $ 12.5 million cash bonus , compared with last year ’s cash payout of $ 13.8 million .
And as he awaits his official retirement next month , Mr. Prince can rest assured that he will leave with $ 68 million , including his salary and accumulated stockholdings ; a $ 1.7 million pension ; an office , car and driver for up to five years — all in addition to the bonus .
That is on top of $ 53.1 million he has taken home in the last four years , a period when $ 64 billion in the company ’s market value has evaporated .
His $ 12.5 million bonus is based on a formula that adjusts the 2006 bonus for current stock performance , instead of simply awarding it on his performance during 2007 , as with most everyone else .
Pay experts say the unusual time - traveling maneuver effectively guarantees him a windfall .

I knew there was something afoot for Barack Obama about half an hour into the caucus I attended at Merrill Middle School in Des Moines , Iowa .
First of all , there was the turnout .
Democratic Precinct 72 had roughly 25 attendees in the 2004 caucus , according to precinct chair Louise Alcorn .
Today , it had 58 .
And even though the caucus represented a union - heavy neighborhood , which one might expect to turn out for John Edwards , the first count of the night identified 24 Obama supporters , 16 Edwards supporters , and just 12 Hillary Clinton supporters .
The caucus also included one Biden supporter , four Richardson supporters , and one undecided voter , all of whom later spread evenly to the larger groups .
The relatively small precinct only had two delegates to give , so the Clinton , Obama , and Edwards groups all tried convincing each other that they ought to switch camps .
Though the Edwards supporters in attendance were well - prepared ( they had pies and candy available for converts ) and committed ( they gave passionate speeches advocating for Edwards ) , the Obama supporters sat steadfast and quiet .
After some heated moments , including a long discussion of whether Elizabeth Edwards ’ cancer necessarily meant she would die while her husband was in office , the final count showed that Obama had actually grown in strength .
Obama 25 , Edwards 22 , and Clinton 11 — Obama and Edwards each took home one of the precinct ’s two delegates .
By the time the caucus wrapped , it was becoming clear that Thursday was Obama ’s night .
Anecdotal reports suggested that turnout was way up — the eventual turnout number would shatter all records — a fact that favored Obama significantly because it meant first - time caucus - goers , independents , and young voters were turning out big time .
Indeed , young voters in particular might be the story of the Iowa caucuses : notoriously hesitant to participate , they composed over 50 percent of Obama ’s support .
News reports even indicated that Obama had beaten Clinton among women .
The final results — Obama 38 percent , Edwards 30 percent , Clinton 29 percent — suggested that Iowans had responded to Obama ’s call for decreased partisanship and a renewed politics that left special interests and lobbyists behind .
In fact , they had answered it so fervently , and in such large numbers , that they had bested the best political machine in politics by nine points .
In his victory speech at the Hy - Vee Hall in Des Moines , where supporters hugged , cried , and hooted randomly , a grinning Obama struck almost grandiose tones .
He called the victory a “ defining moment in history , ” one that proved that “ in the face of impossible odds , people who love this country can change it . ”
Was Obama buying into his own legend , or simply displaying the confidence of a candidate who can finally call himself the sole frontrunner ?
Only time will tell , but Obama did n’t abandon his bread and butter .
“ We are one nation , ” he said .
“ We are one people .
And our time for change has come . ”
Those themes have worked so far , and are only getting stronger .
The real question is if the time for change has come for Hillary Clinton .
Obama will take this victory and its attendant glowing press coverage and rampage through New Hampshire the next five days .
The bounce he will see in the next round of polls should be considerable .
But Clinton took third here tonight .
She ca n’t go into New Hampshire with the same message and expect to compete with Obama ’s momentum .
But what can she change ?
It ’s a particularly difficult question considering the fact that she is operating with a stripped - down tool kit .
Inevitability is out the window , and Obama ’s strong showing amongst independents probably tossed electability out too .
She has only experience to point to now , and the recent Des Moines Register poll that got tonight ’s results so correct identified that as a falling stock .
It ’s possible that experience was never Clinton ’s strength , or at least not its main component .
It ’s possible that Clinton was the safe pick , the known quantity .
Like Romney on the Republican side , she would go before every sub - constituency in her party and tell them exactly what they expected to hear .
Every narrow interest in the Democratic Party would be satisfied by a President Hillary Clinton ; she was the establishment .
But Obama ’s appeal is somehow greater than the sum of those narrow interests , and now that Iowa has put its faith in him , it ’s hard to see how other states wo n’t follow .
That said , no one with Clinton ’s money and organization should be counted out .
John Edwards faces a different conundrum .
Beating Clinton allows him to see another day , but he has not cultivated a strong base of support in any of the other early states .
Either his second - place finish will provide him with enough of a bounce to perform competitively in New Hampshire , or Obama ’s megabounce will soak up all the voters willing to shift their preferences .
With New Hampshire less than a week away , we wo n’t have to wait long to find out .
One last note .
Polls are n’t useless , they are just usually so .
As I mentioned earlier , the Des Moines Register poll nailed the results : Obama winning by roughly seven , with Edwards and Clinton more or less tied .
But no other poll came close to this kind of prescience .
American Research Group predicted Clinton 34 , Obama 25 , and Edwards 21 in its latest poll .
CNN found Clinton 33 , Obama 31 , and Edwards 22 .
And so on .
As it turns out , polls have a tough time predicting historic nights with unprecedented levels of voter participation .

Philip Giraldi Slams the American MSM , Says Former FBI Translator 's Allegations of the Sale of U.S. Nuke Secrets to the Foreign Black Market ' Must be Heard ' ...
Brad Friedman Byon 2/4/2008 , 4:49 pm PT
Former CIA analyst and international security and counter - terrorism expert Philip Giraldi has filed some of the American media 's best reports ( even though we realize that 's not necessarily saying much ) on the Sibel Edmonds case .
If you missed it a week or two ago , Giraldi filed a detailed report on the latest of Edmonds ' allegations on the sale of U.S. nuclear secrets , on the foreign black market , to friend and foe alike , as aided and abetted by very high - ranking U.S. officials .
His article , published at American Conservative Magazine and titled " Found in Translation , " is a must read for both folks new to the issue and those who may have missed a beat or two along the way .
The case also , if you have n't noticed , ties in to the Valerie Plame Wilson / Brewster Jennings CIA Leak Case , and includes allegations that her cover company was outed to foreign agents by the # 3 in the State Department , Marc Grossman , years before Robert Novak wrote his infamous column blowing the cover of the previously covert Plame Wilson .
Giraldi has now posted a slightly more general read this morning at Huffington Post , in an article titled " Sibel Edmonds Must Be Heard . "
The piece offers both an easily readable summary of the case so far and another scathing ( and well - deserved ) condemnation of the American corporate mainstream media for all but ignoring the story .
He even notes , correctly , the failure of " so - called gadflies like Olbermann and Moyers " to cover this story , as we detailed ourselves several moons ago ...
Of course Huffington Post , whose current top headline on the " Politics " page is : " Goodfellas : DeNiro Backs Obama In Jersey , " has been less than stellar in its own coverage of these issues as well .
While they did feature a front page cross-posting of " Pentagon Papers " whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg 's recent op - ed on the American MSM 's failure to cover and report on the Edmonds case ( originally published at The BRAD BLOG here ) , so far Giraldi 's post has been buried to all but those who seek it out .
( FULL DISCLOSURE :
We also write for Huff Po ourselves from time to time . )
We hope you 'll read Giraldi 's latest Huff
Po story in full , so we 're loath to quote too much of it here .
The final graf , however , must be noted far and wide :
Article III of the Constitution of the United States defines treason as giving aid and comfort to the enemies of the United States .
This has been interpreted by US courts to include the selling or betrayal of defense secrets to foreign powers .
Sibel Edmonds is talking about treason at the highest levels of the United State government and it is clear that a cover up is going on orchestrated by the Bush Administration that is being aided and assisted by an acquiescent media .
It is time that Sibel 's voice be heard .
To quote from the musical 1776 : Is anybody there ?
Does anybody care ?

in response to Ke Jin Hi , This post made my day .
LOL :^)
To be fare to Java , it is not the only culprit here .
The same could be said of C#. Vendors have worked out that marketing technology to the mainstream has more to do with building on prior context ( the C language ) and reducing the learning curve ( by minimising the number of new unfamiliar concepts ) then fitness for purpose .
You would expect that academic institutions would be immune to this form of dumbing down , but apparently not .
With Vendors like Microsoft sponsoring Computer science departments and providing free / cheap software , it looks like many institutions have been bought .
Amongst Alan Kay 's many complaints about the current state of computer science is that most academic institutions no longer build their own stuff .
So there are few Universities that build their own processors , or their own operating systems , never mind creating their own programming languages .
So what are all those professors and post graduates out there doing ?
" what ever happened to the mighty Standford , the inventors of Lisp ? "
It would be interesting to here from such people .
From what I see most computer science under graduate courses tend to be little more then vocational training .
I just do n't know why this is .
Fortunately for me , my degree was in Electronic Engineering :^ ) .
Peace , Paul .

in response to Jess Holle I think to become a good " computer scientist " it is important to follow a learning path that feels natural .
By this I mean : first learn about algorithms , data structures .
Then go on to abstraction and later on : Object oriented programming .
During my education we started with a course of algorithms and data structures which we implemented and practised using Pascal .
Then the notion of abstract datatypes and pointers was introduced .
I think Pascal is one of the most appropriate languages to learn general CS concepts before going on to learn C , C++ and then languages like Java , C# and the like .
Also I think it is very important to also learn some logical and functional programing languages .

in response to T H Aside from the idiocy of basing your opinion of a language 's proponents based on knowledge of these three obscure concepts -- what makes you think that this particular individual has any larger significance ?
Also , the reference to BASIC is pretty obvious -- BASIC was based on the GOTO .
Java does not have that function and I fail to see how the ease of Java instills weakness in your CS graduates .
In fact , this whole article is a big deal over nothing .
This guy is very typical .
I can't write stories of 100 guys in one post .
See my previous reply .
Also , if these three concepts were obscure to a person who had used XSLT for four years and was criticizing its fundamental concept and paradigm , what other concepts would not be obscure ?
Would you consider OOP to be obscure to Java professionals , AOP to be obscure to AspectJ users , MVC to be obscure to JSF or Struts developers , and relational model to be obscure to SQL programmers ?
Thanks !

in response to Bostjan Dolenc Would you consider ... relational model to be obscure to SQL programmers ?
Definitely .
Are you referring to those guys who happen to write a line or two SELECT statements without even knowing what are primary key / foreign key / normalization / etc. ( sorry for these obscure concepts ) and then call themselves SQL programmers ?
Then , OO could also definitely be an obscure concept for Java professionals !
Anyone who could write a Java " hello world " example would be able to claim himself a Java programmer .
And using Java , you are definitly able to write out all code examples of any algorithm textbook without knowing OO at all ( without ever using interface , implements , extends , etc. ) .
You just proved my point , namely many " professionals " are so ignorant that is already harmful to this industry .

And using Java , you are definitly able to write out all code examples of any algorithm textbook without knowing OO at all ( without ever using , etc. ) .
You just proved my point , namely many " professionals " are so ignorant that is already harmful to this industry .

in response to Ke Jin Would you consider ... relational model to be obscure to SQL programmers ?
Definitely .
Are you referring to those guys who happen to write a line or two SELECT statements without even knowing what are primary key / foreign key / normalization / etc. ( sorry for these obscure concepts ) and then call themselves SQL programmers Nope , beginners get some leeway .
I was thinking about DB designers who consider their Excel spreadsheet a perfect database ( logical ) model , architects who " protect against change " with a key - value tables or query writers who are scared of different joins ( sometimes even natural ones ) and regress back to loops every few pages .
And we all know a programmer or two who thinks that you can " customize " a SELECT statement only in the WHERE clause .
Nope , beginners get some leeway .

Those things have nothing to do with programming ; I use data structures , lists , algorithms and yes even recursion in Java ; it 's the same regardless of what language it 's being done in .
Is someone actually complaining because doing it in Java is less error - prone and more fun ?

It seems we have some communication problem ...
You are correct we have a communication problem ( many of them , I think :-) . " I did n't snear at DSM .
In fact , I was telling one of our messaging developers to use it .
" On Mon , 2007 - 11 - 19 at 01:20 - 0500 , Ke Jin wrote : Adrian , it is my article .
Firstly , I apologize that my article wasted your precious time .
Not really .
I 've been advocating the idea ( if not your solution ) for some time now . :-) "
The topic was " usecase xml " which is a way to implement DSM and hide the implementation details without using preprocessors ( XSLT or otherwise ) .
Preprocessing was what I was arguing against .
I gave the example of JBoss 's DataSource configuration for why preprocessors are in general the wrong way to go .
" Specifically , he was not able to change values of XSLT variables . "
No the actual argument was that in general the mapping done by preprocessors does not preserve the original structure used by the user , meaning there is " cognitive dissonance " between the implementation details and what the user is defining .
e.g .
You can see such confusion in the three different names of the JBoss pooling strategy here : " A while ago , I had a conversation with a chief scientist of a Java consulting and service firm . "
Since you are talking about me ( Adrian Brock , Chief Scientist at JBoss a division of Redhat " ) .
I 'd like to set the record straight .
The discussion is public , you can find it here ( unfortunately the mail software has n't collected it all in one thread ) :
http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jboss-development/2007-November/thread.html scan for " usecase "
First , I got the meaning of " imperative programming " wrong .
Not being a CS graduate , you can sue me .
Which actually disproves the premise of this topic anyway . :-)
But like I said in that discussion : " If you read my posts regularly , you 'll know I hate names .
Ideas are much more important . "
In fact the whole argument was mainly due to a lack of understanding of what the other person said as we both agreed : " On Wed , 2007 - 11 - 21 at 00:46 - 0500 , Ke Jin wrote :

e.g .
You can see such confusion in the three different names of the JBoss pooling strategy here :
http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=JBossJCAPooling
And also that partial updates of the user structure do not get reflected in the backend without having to re-run the preprocessing to map it .
" He should change his mindset for this ( imperative to declarative ) "
No change in mindset is required .
I already strongly support declaritive programming . :-)
The point I was making was that you should n't have to sacrifice the programmatic ( imperative ) approach to use DSM .
Preprocessing makes the programmatic approach much harder than it needs to be .
DataSourceDSM dataSource = ... ; dataSource.setPoolSize( 100 ) ; implementationDetails = preprocessor.map(dataSource ) ; // Yuck !

Using names to represent complex abstractions is what brought the humankind here ( technologically speaking ) .

Hehe , actually names can be important as well as act as smokescreen .
Think of ESB , Middleware , SOA , Web 2.0 , Words where the Deutungshoheit sits with whoever vendor or consultant you actually talk .
Names can also be hijacked , like , say " MVC " for Web Applications .
And " object orientation " or " polymorphism " can have drastically different meanings depending on your current context ....

Precisely .
And one of the root causes of this lack of precision is the very idea that " names are not important " .
That concept is extremely counter productive and I fight it every single day where I work - specially because of the unending meetings to " establish common ground " where instead of creating real business value on top of existing concepts , time is spent discussing names and concepts that should be prerequisites for the conversation going on .
I apologize digressing from the main topic - but I have to fight this idea every time I see it .
It 's a useless battle , I know .

in response to Adrian Brock Solution :
Do n't use short cuts to thinking , say what you mean clearly and simply .
If I have to explain the meaning of every word I used , rather than use it , then I will never communicate with anybody - which some might say to be a good thing .
E.g. what do you mean by " smokescreen " ?
Anyways , going back to the original point , Dijkstra was obviously a genius and a major contributor to the art and ' science ' of CS .
However , he was not infallible and , presumably , was as liable as the rest of us to overstate his point in order to get the message across .
I for one , do not believe that it is impossible to teach good programming to students who have had exposure to BASIC .
Furthermore , I do not believe that they are " mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration " .
Unless damaged in some way , the human brain is almost infinitely malleable - for better or worse .
Dijkstra 's proposal is tantamount to saying that somebody who learns to ride a bicycle can never learn to drive a car ; or that children who begin by walking will never be able to run .
I realise that some people will say that programming is a vastly more complicated activity than walking .
Although this is true , I believe that the same basic principle applies .
Part of the issue comes back to the rather narcissistic assumption that exists in the programming community that this skill is somehow orders of magnitude more difficult than any other .
In this regard , I agree with the previous posting : to me at least , it is nowhere near as hard as some of the more ' pure ' sciences .
Also , speaking for myself , it 's far easier than playing ( any form of ) musical instrument .
I may be flamed that I 'm just not very good , or that I 'm probably a poor programmer .
This may be true , but , if so , I seem to have managed to fool several people for quite a long time ;-)
Finally , regarding the earlier posting which said that students should be taught using a programming language what was designed for teaching programming : was n't that what BASIC was meant to be ?
How fashions change ;-)

Should Java be banned from * US * schools ...

Posted by : Leif Ashley
Posted on : December 03 2007 10:28 EST
in response to Ke Jin Ok , you think that other countries outside the US are banning Java from schools ?
This whole debate it somewhat ridiculous , but I do see some gems in it .
It 's true , that people / kids tend to want easy mode and are n't willing to work for things .
When Joel Spolsky asks , " Whatever happened to hard work ? " , it 's clear to me that he has not been following US education .
" No kid left behind " has turned in to " no kid held back no matter what , or we 'll cut your funding " .
Kids are not trained to work hard now .
Do n't get a passing grade ?
No worries , they 'll pass you later .
It 's too easy to slide by .
I do agree that many Chief Scientists and CIOs do n't " get it " when it comes to language and other CS paradigms .
However , they did n't get those positions by understanding these concepts .
They understand the concepts of marketing themselves , and that 's why they hold those positions ( or they knew a friend that put them there ) .
For the rest of us , whether or not java is in or out of schools , or it's C++ , C# , Ruby , PERL , BASIC , or LOGO , those that do get it will have opportunities to explore and shine , and those that do n't get it , will become managers … or something else being my point .
The job of the education system is to educate .
When you pull opportunities , such as learning a software development language , out of the curriculum , then the system is not doing it 's job .
So if Java should be banned from schools , then why not Calculus , advanced Lit , and science ?
We do n't use those much day to day either .
For that matter , let 's just turn schools into to vocational skills training , and as long as you do n't kill someone or loose an arm , you pass .
Then countries can outsource their manufacturing to us so we can become an endless supply of cheap labor .

in response to Ke Jin Dijkstra 's comment was motivated by BASIC 's lack of structuring , presence of evil features like GOTO , and missing essential features like pointers / references and dynamic memory allocation ( so one could n't do any significant data structure programming ) .
It was NOT caused by BASIC being too easy .
Java is an easy language - compared to alternatives like C/C++ - and also expressive enough to code anything , at least in the domain of imperative languages .
So it 's only missing features to study other paradigms , like functional programming , but then , there is no single language that is good at all paradigms , not even hybrid ones .
My first natural conclusion is that a good CS course cannot use a single language .
We need enough languages to represent all paradigms , e.g. adding Scheme or Haskell for functional .
Even C is justified to allow low - level techniques , for example in an Operating Systems and advanced Compiler Writing courses .
I have used Delphi in the past to teach an introductory Programming course for CS , and I found it was a fine choice ( by 1996 - 97 anyway - Java was too new , other alternatives like C/ C++ or VB too inadequate ) .
Java is a better language and the fact that it commands a large share of the real world market certainly does n't hurt ; for one thing , the abundance of tools and libraries is a boon to teachers and students .

Hi Osvaldo ,
So how do you teach Java ?
Do you describe it as an OO language ?
or a procedural language ?
Or a bit of both ?
How do you reconcile the switch statement with OO polymorphism ?
How do you explain inner classes ?
Have you ever had a Smart Alex student point out that a virtual function call is not the same as an OO message send ?
Or that ploymorphism only requires a common Protocol and does not need a shared implementation through class inheritance or a common Interface ?
The problem for me as a student learning OOP through C++ was that C++ mixed up a number of concepts and ended up being a jack of all trades rather then the master of one .
To get to grips with OOP I had to go and learn Smalltalk .
How are students meant to understand this stuff through an hybrid like Java or C ++?
Is n't there an argument for teaching concepts in a pure form first , and then doing vocational training later ?
Paul .

in response to Paul Beckford So how do you teach Java ?
As a " mid- level " language that abstracts away the implementation details of individual processor architectures and operating systems , but does that does not abstract away most of underlying concepts on which they are based .
Do you describe it as an OO language ?
Yes , but I 'd give background on the history of the meaning of the term OO .
or a procedural language ?
I do n't think they are mutually exclusive concepts .
Or a bit of both ?
Yup .
How do you reconcile the switch statement with OO polymorphism ?
I 'd teach the assembly language concept on which switch statements are based ( abstracting away the machine details without abstracting away the machine ) , then generalize switch to pattern matching in functional languages and refer them to some of Martin Odersky 's writings on the trades involved in choosing between polymorphism and pattern matching .
How do you explain inner classes ?
As a useful mid-level abstraction on which higher level abstractions , such as closures , can be built .
Have you ever had a Smart Alex student point out that a virtual function call is not the same as an OO message send ?
Show them the Scala actors library .
Scala is a statically typed language with virtual methods in the Java / C++ tradition , but the actors library uses message sends ( similar to the smalltalk concept , only ansynchronous ) for communication with actors , and supplement it with a discussion of partial functions .
I 'd use this to point out the trades that must be made in determining how software components communicate .
Or that ploymorphism only requires a common Protocol and does not need a shared implementation through class inheritance or a common Interface ?
I 'd teach structural them structural typing , and then weaken it to duck typing and refer back to the discussion of message sends and how trades must be made .
How are students meant to understand this stuff through an hybrid like Java or C ++?
I agree .
In an academic setting I would teach more pure languages , like Haskell , Scheme , Lisp , Smalltalk , C , and Pascal first .
Then I would teach hybrids like C++ , Java , Scala , Python , and Ruby - and back to the theme of pragmatic trades .
Is n't there an argument for teaching concepts in a pure form first , and then doing vocational training later ?
Yes but I do n't think that works .
Think about the advantage of agile development - you receive rapid feedback on something tangible .
Teaching a lot of theory up front , and even dwelling on pure languages , leads to too long of a feedback loop before learning something that can be tangibly applied in a commercial setting .
I also think CS and Software Engineering should be separate majors , just like Chemistry and Chemical Engineering .
Paul , I do n't teach programming but I 'll take a shot as answering your questions .

So you 'd teach languages rarely used in commerce and expect your students to do what ?
Sell Big Macs for a living ?
I agree academic concepts must be covered but in a context that can be transferred to the real world , which means using the tools popular with commerce .
I learnt Pascal , Delphi , C , Java and Perl as part of my degree .
I worked with Delphi for a while but the sheer volume of Java jobs meant I would have been an idiot not to focus on Java .
I 've never seen a job ad asking for Haskell or Scheme .
I 've seen thousands asking for Java and C / C ++.

I 've never seen a job ad asking for Haskell or Scheme .
I 've seen thousands asking for Java and C / C ++.

So you 'd teach languages rarely used in commerce and expect your students to do what ?
Sell Big Macs for a living ?
If my students are so intellectually lazy and disinterested in their field that they will not take time outside of their own studies to learn a " useful " technology then I hope they do end up selling Big Macs instead of writing software .
But maybe real professors have lower expectations .
On a tangential note , I think statements like " What do you expect them to do ?
Sell Big Macs for a living ? " are extremely destructive .
My personal observation is that a person 's employability is as much or more determined by their willingness to apply their skills to something useful , and in a professional manner , than it is by the skills themselves .
The people I know who got " worthless " degrees who are willing to do something practical usually make almost as much money as those with " real " degrees , and are often far happier in their jobs .
Being an English major does not make one unemployable .
There 's tons of need for good writers .
It 's expecting to write poetry that no one understands and refusing to do anything else that makes one unemployable .
So I think as long as my hypothetical student who learned several obscure languages is willing to hunker down a learn Java so he can make a living , he will be fine .
Better off , in fact , than the person who received a vocationally targetted CS education , because when technologies change he will easily change with it .

in response to Erik Engbrecht Hello Erick , Hello Paul ( long time gone myself ) .
I actually learned Basic as my first language in a TRS - 80 , Tandy computer .
Later at university I officially learned programming using Pascal .
Recursion and pointer notion was a killer for many of the students , but it was a safe language .
The second course on programming introduced the OO concepts using C++ ( of course , they were not true O ) , but we had Abstract Data Types first implemented in Pascal and DOS .
You learned C in another course with concurrency and Unix machines .
Then came Prolog in logical programming plus LISP .
I special courses you learned Smalltalk or Eiffel .
Then I heard eve LogoWritter was an introductory course to teach naturally Recursion , and then I heard that Java is the languages you learn with .
So , I guess we need to learn using the correct language for what we are trying to learn .
If I need to learn first about flows and structure , I would go to flow charts .
When I understand what a process is and loops and that stuff , and I 've learned abstraction , I should go to a safe language , that reads like English and tell me when I go farther that I should in an Array .
If I need to go learn OO , first I would design in it .
Then I would go and learn using Smalltalk for instance .
At the end , I have the basic knowledge to get to Java and quickly learn how to use it , and also understand why it is not a truly OOL .
Right now , if you learn programing skill using Java , you may end up creating a Script pattern instance ( Richardson ) instead of a domain model ( OO ) .
The problem is learning schools try to teach you the language you are going to use in the street , and not actually teach you the notions of programming .
So , Java may be used , but not as the only language , nor the first one .
William Martinez .

Thank you , Frank .
I , too , started with BASIC in 1987 when I was a little older than your son , and I believe it is a perfectly reasonable starting point .
And so is Java -- as long as the developer , as you say , has the curiosity and motivation to keep learning new things .
By now , I know a host of interesting languages ( in multiple ' paradigms ' ) , but few languages are as suitable as Java for long - term maintenance where the code must pass through many hands .
The best code is usually the most verbose .

in response to Paul Beckford So how do you teach Java ?
Do you describe it as an OO language ?
or a procedural language ?
Or a bit of both ?
How do you reconcile the switch statement with OO polymorphism ?
How do you explain inner classes ?
Have you ever had a Smart Alex student point out that a virtual function call is not the same as an OO message send ?
Or that ploymorphism only requires a common Protocol and does not need a shared implementation through class inheritance or a common Interface ?
Come on !
What a bunch of elitist nonsense !
Being able to spell polimorfism does n't make your point valid .
Either you can solve real world problems , or you can't .
The former we refer to as computer scientists ; the latter we refer to as politicians .
These terms and concepts exist to describe the state of the art ; not to define it .
The terms are meant to serve us ; not vice versa .
We employ them in order to have meaningful conversation ; not to publicly prove our self worth .
One can teach Java by showing how most code in Java has a direct translation down to the operations that are typical of CPU instruction sets , and thus one can teach how Java is a high level language for doing relatively basic things .
And one can do the same with Smalltalk .
However , it would better profit the student to think in terms of the problems that one must solve , and how the language is designed to help provide elegant solutions to those problems .
The ability to compose complex data structures , to manage them with concurrent access from multiple threads and CPUs , the ability to aggregate them into more complex data structures and programs that solve real problems .. these are the benefits ( and the only benefits ) of computer languages .
Java is n't designed to make theorizing philosophers happy .
It 's designed to help solve age - old computer problems with a little less pain and in a little more manageable manner .
It does so quite admirably .
I think your later comment illustrates my distaste :
By the time you got around to teaching Java , your students would have gained sufficient insight into programming languages to write a useful critique of the Java language themselves , off the bat LOL !! " LOL " ?
Is there some private joke that only people who code in " Haskell , Scheme , Lisp , Smalltalk " are supposed to get ?
I do n't get it ..

in response to Cameron Purdy Hello Cameron .
I agree with some things you say , but I guess I defend the idea that programming is not actually writing in a language .
You see , the language is just the way you describe your solution .
The higher description of the solution ( up to structures and reasons to actually exist and co-exist ) , is the architecture .
The detailed design in UML diagrams is another description of the same solution .
The lines of code in Java are another description of your solution .
That is , the language per se is not driving the solution , it just allows you to describe it in an easy or not - so easy way .
There are some problems I would love to solve in Prolog , because they are more natural to solve there .
Some other I would use Pascal .
And for some other , Java .
Thus , I do programming but not with a language .
If you teach programming , you teach ways of thinking to solve a problem , strategies and theory , concepts , game trees , objects and data types .
Then you map to a language .
So , theory helps you to solve the problem , and you can learn multiple languages just by knowing how to describe your solution in them .
In other words , Java in wonderful for what it does , and that is describing solutions .
But it was not intended to teach programming , was it ?
So you can not use to do that .

Oracle Coherence : Data Grid for Java and .NET Hi Cameron ,
It is n't elitism .
It 's knowing your trade .
There is no such thing as a " golden hammer " that solves all problems in all situations .
As programmers we should be able to pick and choose the right tool for the job .
Sometimes that may be Java , at other times it could be Lisp .
This does n't make one language better than the other it just makes it more appropriate for a given problem .
Even if you code in Java all the time , knowledge of other programming styles is useful and will make you a better Java programmer .
An example that comes to mind is ORM for CRUD applications .
For most CRUD applications are not immune to type changes ( if you add a new column to a database record the changes will ripple through to the UI ) .
So why model database records as objects ?
The stable abstractions are in fact functions ( create , retrieve , update and delete ) so perhaps the database records should be modeled as hashmaps accessed using a functional programing style such as with LINQ .
What ever your views are , how can you compare these two approaches if you have n't been taught them both ?
Java should be just one tool in your toolbox .
The problem we have today in the Java world is the mentality that says that one tool fits all !
And some continue to think this way even when the resultant solutions are hopelessly complex and ridiculous when compared to other alternatives .
Regards , Paul .

Oracle Coherence : Data Grid for Java and .NET I agree .
It is a people problem or solution .
Or should I say personal .
I really wonder how many people are actually able to " think " even if you try to teach them .
They learn by rote .
Unfortunately , thinking is important .
But teaching others to do it is difficult for those to which i comes easily .
I was going to say this earlier in the day but I doubt it is the language that people learn first .
The problem I have seen is many people who " learn " to program or try to program probably have limited ability to learn more one language let alone more than one .

Well , being even more cynical , I´d say that you cant really teach people to think , you can only present the tools necessary to forge ones own view of reality .
But , then again , very little work in this industry actually requires you to _think_ , usually it is quite enough to pick the appropriate existing thought and apply it to your problem at hand .
Scalable , reliable , and in - order multicast - protocols excluded of course ...

The question is " stable against what ? " .
Consider your datamodel changes to introduce new required columns ( or worse changes to drop them ) , splits tables or changes the inheritance ( specialization ) model in the database .
There will likely be so many changes in the overall application that the " rippling through " does hardly create more impact .
Or consider the all to real world example of moving your application from a proper database to one without triggers , where you need to pull thousand of lines of ( largely declaratively programmed ) code up into the application .

Hi Karl , Stable against type changes .
You can add a new column to your database table and the functions that manipulate your hashmap ( database record ) do n't need changing .
Where as with an object you 've got to add a new getter and setter to expose each new property .
I could say more but it 's a bit off topic .
Suffice it to say that there is often more than one way to skin a cat :^ ) and ignorance of " other ways " does n't bode well !!

Right your are .
But still , looking at it from a day - day perspective , I often see that mixing different " programming paradigm " and flavors thereof in a system can create incredible instability against one of the most important changes that occur in the lifecycle of a piece of software - change of people .
Even if these people have been exposed to the concepts they will still need a huge effort to learn the respective tools that come which each technology and implement it with subtle changes to the original meaning .
Of course , this does not mean that a university should not teach functional programming or discard object orientation or declarative programming etc .

Have you ever had a Smart Alex student point out that a virtual function call is not the same as an OO message send ?
(...)
You raise a more specific question about picking a language to teach CS theory .
This is not what I taught at that time - it was an introductory course for people who had just entered faculty and never programmed in any language ( or at least I had to assume that ) .
I had to teach people to implement basic algorithms , use structured programming constructs ( no OO at all that stage ) , loops , variables and so on ... you may call that a bottom - up approach , some people will prefer a top - down one , starting with heavyweight programming language theory and " pure " languages .
I used the latter as a MSc student , I particularly liked pure and small languages like Pico because students could work with its full source code and implement new language constructs - I sweated a lot doing that , but this experience taught me some 50 % of everything I know about programming ( thanks Theo ! ) .
But then again , that was an advanced course .
I also taught Java , but in different contexts - training courses , or using Java just as a tool for courses on different subjects like CORBA .
I never had the experience of teaching an advanced university course ( frankly , teaching was never my forte and I abandoned this activity after a few years - I 'm much happier coding ) .
But if I had to give such a course , why not Java ?
Yes , it 's not a pure OOPL ( say like Smalltalk ) , it raises several hard questions .
Yes , it is an OO language , it 's just not radical enough to make a huge sacrifice of efficiency in the altar of simplicity and orthogonality ( e.g. representing integers as full - blown objects or going wild with dynamic dispatch and metaprogramming ) .
You may call Java a pragmatic OO language .
Of course , pragmatic designs are always bound to the technology that is mature by the time they are designed , so these languages get old , but all languages do for some reason or another ...
Your question about the switch statement is also very good : switch - less languages are typically those like Smalltalk , where people will sometimes add polymorphic double - dispatch methods to core library classes like String or Array , or resort to obscure MOP techniques .
I do n't know which option is worse , and IMHO both contributed to the doom of Smalltalk for real - world development .
The fact is that ' switch ' expresses a very useful and efficient technique : dispatch by value .
Polymorphism , in comparison , is dispatch by type , and there are many cases where representing each possible value as a type ( or as a class ) is not desirable and not elegant ; it 's just an horrendous hack to abuse polymorphism where it does n't belong .
More : most pure OOPLs were created many years before people discovered Design Patterns , Separation of Concerns etc. , which are better solutions for the same problems addressed by many old - school pure OO techniques .

in response to Ke Jin I remember how I learned how to program , and I now have a 7 - year old son that is getting into it , so blending these two perspectives has given me an intersting , err , perspective !
I started with BASIC , as most people my age ( mid 30's ) did .
I then moved to a number of years of straight Assembly .
I then moved on to a whole bunch of different languages including C/C++ , Pascal , Java , VB , Foxpro , LISP , and a couple more that I 've since forgotten .
I 'd have to consider myself a 95 % Java - only coder these days and for the past few years , mixing in some C/C++ , VB and C# here and there for the other 5 % .
My son has been playing with QuickBasic and Java a bit .
I 've also gotten him playing with some more abstract - type " not quite programming " things like game creators and those all - graphical " programming " languages floating around these days .
It worked perfectly for me , and it 's working for him .
The key when you 're just getting started is to start off gently and see some immediate results to get the interest level up .
For me it was making a guy do jumping jacks via a bunch of prints , a for - next loop for a delay , clearing the screen and drawing the next frame ( all with ASCII characters ) .
For my son , writing a simple Pong game did the trick .
I do n't believe it 's important to implement perfect habits right from the start .
I started with tons of GOTOs in my early coding and I 've had no trouble ridding myself of that habit .
For this reason , all the BASIC hate vexes me because I 've never found a gentler , more immediately rewarding way to get programming into the head of a young person .
Let 's face it , at the end of the day * ALL * programming boils down to a list of instructions telling the computer what to do .
It 's being able to logically order a series of steps to make something larger occur .
You can pile abstraction upon abstraction on top of that , but that 's ultimately what it is .
BASIC allows you to do that in a very human - readable form without being confused by abstractions that a learning brain probably can't handle yet .
Kids need concrete things to understand .
Hell , not just kids , people in general of any age I think this is true of .
Until the concept of a list of instructions , basic loops and branching constructs are second - nature , attempting to introduce layers of abstraction is counterproductive IMO .
My son has now just started played with VB a little because that 's a good introduction to " object - oriented " programming ... now , I do n't mean that in terms of OOP , it 's more basic than that ...
When you 're in a VB workspace , you click a button on a form , a code window pops up and you attach a few lines of code that does something when the button is clicked , change the background color of the form for example .
That 's introducing the idea of an object that has some behavior encapsulated within it , but it 's doing so in a way that is n't hard to grasp .
In fact , it 's almost subconscious conprehension .
It 's very concrete : here 's an object on the screen , here 's the code it contains and here 's the event that has to occur for that code to execute .
It 's very visual , very natural , specially for a young child .
Now , later on you can say " ok , now here 's a piece of code that is an object with behavior too " , and even though it 's not concrete like the button graphic on the screen was , the brain can make that abstract leap because it ties back to something concrete it understands ( assuming you explain it reasonably well of course ) .
I 'm also a * HUGE * believer in the thought that to be a really top - notch programmer , you have to have done some Assembly at some point .
There are of course exceptions , and I 'm in no way saying we should be using Assembly day in and day out for things we do in most of our work ( save truly low - level coding where it 's still a necessity ) , but in general I believe this to be the case .
You get such a fundamental understanding , in a very subconscious way , of how a program works .
It 's that ability to think , analyze and just * understand * program flow and structure that I do n't think you get from any other language .
For this reason , my son will get some Assembly time down the road .
I do n't think starting there would be productive though .
So , should Java specifically be banned from schools ?
No .
Should it be the * primary * language taught ?
No .
It 's too abstract to be useful for teaching someone new to programming how to code .
I still believe some variation of BASIC is the right choice as a first encounter with programming , and then move on to something more low - level , be it Assembly or C .
I 'm not sure if VB is the right answer either , but it 's probably a better choice than Java , and probably a better choice than C/ C++ , at least in the beginning .
Then again , it 's the underlying concepts of BEING ABLE TO THINK that someone has to learn to be able to program .
Some may argue that 's something that can't be taught , but I 'm not so sure .
I can't tell you how many " programmers " I 've met over the years that * appear * to know what they 're doing but in reality can't think their way out of a paper bag .
The sure test is to have someone troubleshoot a bug ... if they can't do it , or can't do so well ( which is subjective , but most of us know it when we see it ) then regardless of how they learned programming , they did n't learn the underlying concepts .
Someone can learn a programming langauge and be as solid in it as they want and they 'll be useful on some level , but they 'll never go beyond that , and we 've already got way too many of those types of people floating around .
But , I 've also seen some of those programmers improve over time with some mentoring , so I do n't think the ability to think is set in stone ( although I * do * believe there 's a certain degree of predetermined ability and much above that is never going to happen ) .
Also , in the end , anyone that thinks * whatever * you learn in school is going to be sufficient in the real world is fooling themselves .
How many times have you seen a CS grade who does n't know jack about development ?
How many 15 - year old kids have you seen that can code circles around them ?
How many coworkers do you know that can code a bit but do n't put in any effort outside work to improve and thus get past by without knowing it ?
I also believe programmers have to have a natural aptitude for it , have to have a natural curiosity and drive to learn .
Of course , it all comes down to simply being able to think underneath it all , which is an ingredient missing from too many people 's toolchest .
Dijkstra 's comment about BASIC is stupid as evidenced by all the legitimately good programmers out there that started with BASIC .
Spolsky 's view on Java is short - sighted because Java wo n't have the negative impact he thinks it will unless the student can't see the forest for the trees and thinks Java is the be-all and end - all of programming and does n't truly understand the underlying concepts .
And none of this makes any difference anyway if the programmer simply can't think logically , which is , at the end of the day , nearly always the problem , not the language or the learning methodology enployed .

It is not a problem of Java or C# .
Of course a good CS program should cover Data structures , Concept of Programming language ( imperative , declarative , functional , logical etc ) , OS , and some discrete mathematics ; the tools and languages they used to do this is trivial .
I blame the generation of what I called " shallow " programmers to the market demand as well as shallow managers and co-workers .
Look at the job boards and the technology buzz 's ( C# , java , XSLT etc ) employers and managers are looking for in an individual ; some times I joke ; if I add all the buzz 's and the number of years they are looking for in a programmer , his / her age should be around 200 years : -)
Now go back to this imperative and declarative things etc ; you will be amazed how many people in the programming world do n't have any clue about the basic paradigms and when to use what ; but guess what the very same folks are inventing a new framework every week ; to make thing worst they also argue hours on this forum why their framework is hollier than though : -) Reply to this Reply to original

in response to Ke Jin I remember having to learn a range of languages from assembly , to Fortran , to LISP , and C .
To say I understood anything about programming by the time I graduated would be a stretch .
I think the biggest wake up call after my undergrad degree was how little of the theory you used in day to day programming gigs .
Rarely did you write your own data structures or algorithms .
The real challenge was finding the right library for the job , understanding requirements and project management issues , dealing with clients instead of instructors , figuring out how to test the results .
I 'm not sure you can teach " good " programming .
I think it has to be absorbed over the years by exposure to both good and bad examples , successful and failed projects , and a wide - range of developers .
If you are smart you 'll make friends with those who are better than you are in a particular skill and learn from them .
I think it is silly to blame colleges for bad programmers .
I got a CS degree not a programming degree .
Huge difference .
One is knowledge , which can be taught , and the other is a skill , which has to be absorbed over time .
I could go to school and learn all about the parts of a guitar , how it makes its sound , materials , etc .
To learn how to play it means putting in the time .
I think it would be interesting to just teach the mathematical concepts and tell the students to code up the homework in whatever language they want .
Then discuss and compare the results between different approaches taken .

That 's funny because I would say the opposite was true for me .
All those libraries of data structures and algorithms are just packaging up the theory into something directly appliable , but I 've found people who do n't understand the theory simply do n't grok the libraries .

in response to Ke Jin Banning stuff does n't help .
The problem is that most computer science education is either obsolete or of dubious quality ( or both ) .
Obsolete is not so bad as it sounds because CS education in the seventies / eighties was quite good .
So what if you learn a few useless languages , you still pick up the skills to quickly learn something new .
I actually did some lisp and modula 3 in university during the mid nineties .
Completely pointless ( even at the time ) but it taught me that there are different ways of doing the same thing .
The dubious quality is a bigger issue .
In much of the world , CS teachers are severely underpaid relative to the stupid IT jobs they could probably do in their sleep .
In practice that means universities are a strange mix of idealistic and incompetent people mixed with overworked and inexperienced people who do all the hard teaching work that mostly move on to industry after a few years .
Think 50 year old professors of software engineering who have never worked on a software system of substantial size or worked in teams larger than 2 .
Java is not a bad language for education .
It 's reasonably popular ; has reasonably simple semantics ; you can do a hell of a lot of cool stuff with it ; tooling is excellent ; and most young teachers know it very well .
The last argument is pretty important because there is nothing worse than a teacher who does n't understand what he 's teaching .
So Java is an excellent language to teach all sorts of aspects of computer science and software engineering .
Of course a problem would be if this was the only language you ever learn .
These days I would say functional programming is still quite essential and actually getting more relevant .
My functional programming teacher in Utrecht University ( Eric Meyer ) now works for Microsoft and helped build LINQ for example .
This guy taught me a lot of useful things I promptly forgot but somehow helped me learn a lot of other stuff .
And you can do functional programming in lots of popular languages now : ( j ) ruby , groovy , python , etc .
Additionally logic programming is something that you just have to do at least once in your life .
If only to understand what it is about .
Sadly , commercial use of logic programming is rather limited these days ( pretty much limited to stupid business rule evaluation it seems ) .
And finally , at some point in your career you will just have to get your hands dirty with C and C++ ( if only to appreciate modern languages even more ) .
Also , no CS study is complete without some messing with machine level instructions , compilers & interpreters , algorithms , etc .
Forget about learning a language : a good CS student must be able to design and build language + tool set from scratch .
Here 's a CPU manual , go implement language foobar for it .
Do n't come back until its compiler can bootstrap itself .
The problem is that many so - called universities do n't teach all this stuff .
These second rate universities are popping up all over the world .
They 're called universities but they are just processing mediocre programmers into cubicle occupying , php / Java / VB hacking zombies .
A proper university trains you for a scientific career , which has the nice side effect of you learning the proper skills to learn pretty much anything you want to learn .
Besides , what you learnt 3 years ago is irrelevant in much of our industry .
You need to be able to keep pace with the rapid pace of development everywhere .
Some of the best programmers I 've seen had theoretical physics or electrical engineering backgrounds .
The courses they followed were irrelevant since they learned to think for themselves .

in response to Daniel Botelho " Is Java part of the problem , or is it the schools ' issues ? "
Maybe your " chief scientist of a Java consulting and service firm " , fouled many people to get that job .. or maybe he did n't have 4 years of experience but 1 year plus 4 ;)
Anyway I do n't think that this case has nothing to do with java being taught in schools ..
Maybe everyone needs to stop personally insulting this man , as most of you other than the original poster do n't know him personally and can't evaluate his intelligence .
There are many highly intellectual people in the software development field that did not graduate with a formal CS degree and there are many morons with advanced degrees .

Despite the fact that I think proper schooling is very important for software engineering I could not agree more with this post .
Usually , advanced degree means nothing or very little to me or to anyone I know in software engineering .
I guess we are not talking about the degree .
Now you can buy one of these papers in Internet .
We have here four Universities .
The one I work in has a Computer Science career ( average 5 years of study ) .
The other one is also CS but a Technical one , the other two specialize in the administrative side of IT and Education .
Then there are several private ones .
There are also IT schools .
There is one that gets you a Java Developer degree in six months , so you are ready to start coding .
When I tried to enter Music career , I learned that no one at university age that has been playing by ear the piano is accepted into the piano career , because you are too spoiled .
I guess the same happens here .
There are great , intelligent guys that missed the opportunity of getting the fundamentals of theory in an university and are condemned to spit Java code all day .
And there are others that took 10 years to pass all courses and cannot even structure an if construct .
So , add my vote to that .
But to the important discussion , schooling is important , it is , and proper tools to teach are too .

Hi William , Reasoned and balanced as always : ^)
You make some very good points in youe usual gentle style .
What attracted me to this post , was that the title made me laugh :^ ) .
What I 've found interesting is just how seriously some have taken it , literally responding to whether Java should or should not be banned in schools .
On reflection , I believe the thing that made it funny for me was seeing Java and Computer science in the same sentence .
The birth of Java had very little to do with Science .
I would describe Java more as a product , born out of the Marketing department .
It 's purpose was to create a middle ware platform ( OS ) to steal back / ring fence market share on the Server from Microsoft , and at this purpose it has been very successful .
Sun renaming it 's ticker symbol to JAVA is just one example of it's marketing success ( this news made me laugh too :^ ) ) .
In fact Java should be first on the list to be taught in Schools , but not in the Computer Science Department , but in the Business Department :^ ) .
As far as computer science is concerned , Java has added very little .
Alan Kay 's quote , that Java is the worst thing to happen to computer science since MSDOS " is perhaps a bit strong , but it has some truth to it .
The lesson to learn from Java is that to be successful as a mainstream programming language , has as much ( if not more ) to do with marketing a product then it has to do with Computer Science .
Basing Java on " C " , keeping it simple and giving it away for " free " was a master stroke of Marketing by Sun , which others like Microsoft have been quick to follow .
Once we stop taking ourselves so seriously , perhaps we can stop and ponder , just how our industry actually works .
Dominated by product marketing .
Is that the trait of an industry based on science ?
I love the honesty of the guy whose says he does n't care about CS because he 's earning $ 150 an hour peddling Java :^ )

I do n't know .
I do n't think I 've ever seen an industry based on science .
Can you name such an industry ?
The only other industry where I 've got a fair amount of experience is in the telecoms industry , and there they did a much better job of separating the " business " issues from the technology / science .
For example technical terms have a clear and precise meaning .
So everyone understands what Pulse Coded Modulation means or Frequency Division Multiplexing and there is n't the same level of confusion and different " meanings " like there is with terms like " Object Orientation " and " Type Safety " .
And there definitely was n't / is n't the same techno - marketing gobbledygook that you get in IT like " SOA " and " ESB " .
I think the computer industry has had a unique history , most of which has been dominated by FUD based marketing and big corporate monopolies .
Andy discussion about " the state of mainstream software development " , and how it relates to " Computer Science " that ignores this history is likely to miss the point IMO .

in response to Ke Jin Yet again , we have flame bait as an " article " .
I guess this serves to drive traffic / interest in the site , so they can sell more ads ( due to more ' eyeballs ' reading ) ?
At any rate ( though I should n't ) , I 'll grace this flame bait with a response .
First , if you read the linked article , the guy rants about how " difficult " pointers are and how that really separates the wheat from the chaff .
And he rambles on about how hard CS is as a major ( well , at least if pointers are taught ) , with the uber - difficult - to - learn pointers being what weeds people out .
LOL !
One of the reasons I majored in CS was because it was so much EASIER than majors like engineering or the hard sciences - I 'm not proud of that , but it 's true .
Well , and I enjoyed it and found it interesting .
But to say that it 's a hard major or that pointers are difficult , just makes me want to have a good belly laugh .
Sure , aspects of CS can be difficult - so much depends on your professor ; the wrong professor could make basket - weaving difficult .
And , there are aspects of CS like formal languages or various other things that can be challenging , but POINTERS ?
Gimme a break !
Sure , pointers can be a problem from a programming perspective - being somewhat error - prone and potentially causing grief from a maintenance / debugging perspective , etc. , but conceptually they are trivial to understand .
Second , the premise is that Java is ' easy ' and therefore not a good thing to learn .
At least the author admits somewhere in his rambling that this is actually more of a feature than a limitation .
After all , is n't simplicity ( e.g. being " easy " ) a good thing ?
Complexity ( making something difficult ) should be avoided , not encouraged !
Sure , there are times when complexity is unavoidable , but simplicity is a sign of good design .
If you give me two solutions to a problem , one simple and easy to understand and one complex and convoluted - which is the better solution ( all other things being equal ) ?
Of course , there is something to be said for learning the underlying principles - duh !
Any good CS program should teach thos

In 1984 and again in 1999 , the National Academy of Sciences , the nation ’s most eminent scientific organization , produced books on the evidence supporting the theory of evolution and arguing against the introduction of creationism or other religious alternatives in public school science classes .
On Thursday , it produced a third .
But this volume is unusual , people who worked on it say , because it is intended specifically for the lay public and because it devotes much of its space to explaining the differences between science and religion , and asserting that acceptance of evolution does not require abandoning belief in God .
“ We wanted to produce a report that would be valuable and accessible to school board members and teachers and clergy , ” said Barbara A. Schaal , a vice president of the academy , an evolutionary biologist at Washington University and a member of the panel that produced the book .
The panel , convened by the academy and the Institute of Medicine , its medical arm , was headed by Francisco Ayala , a biologist at the University of California , Irvine , and a former Dominican priest .

When the “ A - List ” stops being “ The A - List ”
So I was sitting at my local coffee shop this morning reading feeds , Twittering and writing .
Not an unusual morning , but like other times a person gets inspired , it came from a comment from someone .
This time from Jeremiah Owyang via Twitter .
While talking about a the new Egos site created by Guy Kawasaki he Tweeted :
My recommendations to you : somewhere in the middle , develop your own feedreader of high value blogs and alerts everyone is unique
What occurred to me is that I did n’t think much about the a - list much any longer .
While the semi-annual meme of beating on the a - list being a favorite sport for many bloggers , something any committed blogger will realize after awhile is that they develop their own a - list .
This is simply the list of bloggers that they read and are influenced by .
It becomes less about the celebrity status of the blogger and more about the value of their content .
I think it was Chris Brogan who started calling his personal list of favorites “ Rockstars “ , and it ’s an apt title for a list of people who continually influence you on a daily basis .
Hey I know good ‘ ol Diamond Dave did that back in the ’ 80s for a heck of a lot of people . 😉
I ’m sure a number of people are sitting back saying that I ’ve missed the point of “ The A - List ” .
They ’d point out that this group of high - profile bloggers control the topics on Techmeme , Tailrank , et al .
I do n’t see that – I see a * lot* of great bloggers moving that conversation all over the place .
At any rate , that ’s not the point of this post .
I ’m really just talking about building your own list of blogs and bloggers that influence you .
Here are some opinions I ’ve developed ( though some are obvious 😉 )
There is no one definition of the A - List – everyone ’s a list is different
“ The A - List ” everyone talks about are just bloggers – albeit with industry insight
The more time you spend reading in the blogosphere , the more important the content and less the celebrity status of the blogger
Your A - List will include high - profile bloggers , because of the value they bring to you , just like the lower - profile bloggers you read
I guess I just want to people to keep exploring and finding that content that has value to you .
Do n’t worry about if they are part of “ The A - List ” , there really are some great bloggers among them and many of their observations are relevant to the conversation that we ’re looking for .
So , the A - List stops being “ The A - List ” when the reader realizes that each blogger brings value to the conversation and you start looking beyond who they are and more at what they say .
What ’s your take on this ?

A tear of fluid streaks the condensation .
An alarm SOUNDS .
A monitor begins to scroll data .

Bland feminine voice of the ship 's computer , as the alarm continues to SOUND .

Auxiliary systems are now on line .
Course corrected .
Hardwired protocols prevent , repeat , prevent arming of nuclear warheads in the absence of Diplomatic Override , Decryption Standard Charlie Nine .

HYPERSLEEP VAULT -- LEADER'S POV
The chilly aisle of capsules .
Commandos move down the line , guns poised .
They peer in at Newt , Ripley , and Hicks , but the lid of Bishop 's capsule is pearl - white .
The Leader tries the controls at the foot of the capsule , where green and red indicators glow .
Nothing happens .
He opens a panel , finds an emergency lever , tries it .
The green indicators wink off .
The lid rises .
A dense pale mist flows out , spilling over the edges of the capsule , revealing the ovoid of a gray Alien egg .
Rooted in the center of Bishop 's synthetic entrails , the egg instantly ejaculates a Face - hugger , which strikes the leader 's faceplate in a spray of acid .
He screams , blinded by the acid , grappling with the thing as it begins to force its way into his helmet , its tail lashing furiously .
Clawing at it , he plunges blindly back down the aisle , stumbling , smashing into the empty capsules .
He vanishes through the entranceway , his screams giving way to frenzied gagging SOUNDS .
The First Commando scrambles after him .
INT .
CARGO LOCK
The Leader writhes on the deck beside the main cargo lock .
First Commando rushes in , crouches beside him , takes careful two - handed aim with her sidearm -- she FIRES , attempting to kill the face - hugger without hitting the Leader .
The face - hugger EXPLODES in a gout of acid ; ragged holes burn through the side of his helmet .
First Commando frantically works the lock controls .
As the inner lock opens , she shoves the leader over the edge with her foot .

ANCHORPOINT -- TULLY'S SLEEPING CUBICLE
A phone is RINGING .
The cubicle , terminally sloppy , resembles the nest of a high - tech hamster , not much larger than a berth of a train .
The walls are plastered with a wistful collage of posters , ads , photos torn from magazines : beaches , desert , the Grand Canyon , redwoods , blue sky -- a hedge against claustrophobia and the emptiness of space .
TULLY , sitting up in bed , knuckling sleep from his eyes , wincing at the light ; he slaps the phone console and the glum face of OPERATIONS OFFICER JACKSON ( female ) appears .
She wears a nylon baseball cap with a computer light - pen attached to the bill .
JACKSON ' Morning , Tully .
TULLY Morning ?
Jesus , Jackson , it 's the middle of my downtime ...
CLOSE ON THE CONSOLE SCREEN ANGLE
The room behind Jackson is Achorpoint 's nerve- center , the Ops Room .
JACKSON
None of us up here in the Ops Room have seen downtime for a while , Tully .
A Marine transport came in on automatic sixteen hours ago .
She bobs her head as she speaks , using the pen on her cap to move a cursor on a screen in front of her .
JACKSON ( continuing ) The Sulaco .
Departed gateway four years ago with a compliment of fifteen .
A dozen marines , an android , a company representative , and the former warrant officer of a merchant vessel ...
TULLY So ?
JACKSON
So , the bio - readout gives us the warrant officer , one -- count him -- marine , and a nine - year - old girl .
Makes you wonder what happened out there , does n't it ?
TULLY
So ask 'em .
Wake 'em up and ask 'em .

JACKSON
But that 's the good news , Tully .
Three hours before Sulaco turned up , we docked a priority shuttle out of Gateway .
Two passengers .
Milisci , Tully .

JACKSON
They want the ship pulled in , with full biohazard precautions , by oh - eight - hundred hours .
BioLab techs are priority for the deck squad .
That 's you Tully .
The phone screen goes blank .
TULLY ( heartfelt ) Shit .
He begins to fumble through his sleeping bag , looking for his clothes -- disturbing SPENCE , a young technician , who sits up groggily , hugging the bag to her breasts .
SPENCE

Soft SCUFF of their boots on the deck .

Lowers his sampler , hesitates .
The first Marine reaches Newt 's capsule .
He lowers his rifle .
MARINE ( something startled , almost gentle in his voice )
They 're here ...
Eight inches of razor - sharp serrated tail plunges out through the back of his suit as he 's lifted off his feet by something we can't see .
Ugly RIPPING noise as the ALIEN withdraws its stinger -- blood tidily contained by the translucent membrane of the biohazard envelope .
The stinger of a second Alien whips around the neck of one of the other two Marines ; the Alien is clinging to the ceiling .
He screams .
Tully 's Marine sags against the foot of Ripley 's capsule , his arm across the controls -- the green indicator lights go out -- as the first Alien lunges up INTO VIEW .

The first Alien and Ripley 's capsule vanish in a napalm fireball .
The Marine spins , screaming incoherently , and liquid fire hoses the second Alien , which drops its victim and falls burning into the deck .
The vault is an inferno .
Ripley 's capsule is sagging , melting .

HICKS
Yes , ma'am .
He takes a puff .
SPENCE I'm Spence .
I 'm not a medic , I 'm from the tissue culture lab .

She opens a small white case and takes out a gleaming cylinder .

HICKS ( leaning forward , still gripping Spence 's wrists )
Why have n't I been debriefed ?

SPENCE
All I know is , we 've all been sleeping short hours since your ship came in , soldier .
A CRASH from the corridor , a pained BELLOW , and Newt scuttles in , wearing a hospital gown .
She backs into a corner as a large ORDERLY rushes in , clutching his right hand .
Like Spence , he wears biohazard gear .
ORDERLY Goddamn it !

He starts for Newt .
Hicks comes off the bed like he 's mounted on springs , hand cocked for a trained blow .
The Orderly backs off .

They watch as a graphics program generates a detailed anatomical drawing of a face - hugger on a large monitor .
She says something short and emphatic in Vietnamese , repeats it : yes .

But we 're particularly impressed with your handling of the situation , the situation so far .
We 're impressed with you cooperation ...
ROSETTI ( flicking the cards down on his desktop with suppressed hostility )
We call it " following orders . "
WELLES Yes .
It would simplify things if everyone did , would n't it ?
Particularly the civilian component of that Deck Squad .
I think we may have a potential problem there ...
FOX
We 've been going over psyche profiles , Colonel .
Anchorpoint seems to be the kinds of project that attracts ... idealists .
ROSETTI ( with a thin grin ) Liberals .
WELLES
Let 's just say we 've noticed a certain antipathy to Military Sciences , Colonel .
A certain lack of sympathy with the goals of the Weapons Division ...
ROSETTI Anchorpoint is under Colonial Administration authority .
This is n't a military operation .
If it were , we'd be in violation of the Strategic Arms Reductions treaty .
FOX Looks great on paper , Colonel , but we want the civilians who boarded Sulaco sewn up .
Tight .
WELLES Forfeit of shares , for starts .
Anyone talks , they lose their shares .
We 've found it reasonably effective , in most cases ...
FOX ( taking a sheaf of printout from his attach_ )
But that 's a simple matter .
This is n't .
Sulaco 's data base indicates a boarding operation en route , Colonel .

Which is a great pity .
But the android , Bishop , was designed for scientific observation .

HICKS The U.P.P.?
What 's the U.P.P. got to go with this ?
ROSETTI Sulaco 's navigation system failed .
You were in disputed territory for something over eighty - five minutes , Hicks .
The U.P.P. would ordinarily respond to that as a violation of their space .
So far there 's been no protest .
Nothing .
( he hesitates ) Sulaco 's computer indicates a covert boarding operation ...
FOX " Indicates " ...
SHUMAN
To put it in diplomatic terms , Hicks , they 've got our ass in a sling .
If they want to regard the Sulaco incident as a hostile act -- and let me assure you that they will , eventually -- they can compromise our position in the current round of arms reduction talks .
We 're talking serious ramifications here .
Then we have the communications lag to and from Earth .
A week either way .
So we 're looking at a fourteen day wait for policy clarification .
We may have a major crisis on our hands .

We 're here to implement that brief .

A half - dozen ranking TECHNOCRATS are jammed along wither side in folding chairs , with Colonel - Doctor Suslov at the head .
BRAUN ( Rodina 's chief of R&D ) Obviously , Colonel Doctor , the purpose of their mission was to obtain specimens of this lifeform .
The android dissected a single specimen .
One of the pre-larval forms -- like the thing that killed Lenko .
AN OFFICER
And you believe that these creature are of potential military importance ?
BRAUN
Yes , provided it 's possible to clone the alien spores recovered from the android 's skin and clothing ...
SUSLOV
With the goal of programming these " machines " for use as weapons ?
BRAUN
The adult form , Colonel - Doctor , is evidently a killing - machine of great strength , extraordinary sophistication .
No evidence of intelligence .
Purely instinctual .
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
Our sources in the corporationist infrastructure are aware of the existence of a special project with Weyland - Yutani 's Weapons Division .
We have been unable to penetrate their security ...
SUSLOV
The Intelligence Officer suggests that this special project concerns the alien ?
DIPLOMATIC OFFICER
I remind you , Colonel - Doctor , that we experiment with the alien genetic material only if we are prepared to violate primary biological warfare limitations in the Strategic Arms Reduction treaty ...
BRAUN
An I reminds the Diplomatic Officer that the Weyland Yutani corporation is obviously prepared to do so -- that they may already be doing so ...
As ever , our level of technology lags slightly behind that of the capitalist cartels ...
But now , by chance -- MILITARY OFFICER
By chance ?
You refer to the proven bravery and constant initiative of our People 's Commando Division -- BRAUN ( smoothly , a seasoned political infighter covering his bases )
Not at all , Major .
Their courage is unquestioned .
Nonetheless , consider : we are in possession of a potential weapon -- a whole new technology , if you will -- which Weyland Yutani clearly intends to develop .
We are in , as they might put it , on the ground floor .
But only if we choose to be , if we choose to hold our advantage .
SUSLOV I agree .
We have no choice but to proceed .
DIPLOMATIC OFFICER
Then I go on record as strongly advising that the android be returned to Anchorpoint .
Are our technicians capable of repairing the thing ?
BRAUN Repairing it ?
Why ?
DIPLOMATIC OFFICER
You lack a sense of the importance of gesture , Braun .
Let us avoid their customary accusations of barbarism ...
And buy ourselves time ...
SUSLOV
Our technicians will repair the thing .
Return it to them ...
And we will proceed .
We will clone the alien ...

ANCHORPOINT -- TISSUE CULTURE LAB TRENT , head of BioLab , Rosetti , and Fox wait , seated , as Tully wheels a Holographic Display Module into position .
The lights dim .
A faint , ghostly cube shimmers in front of the three men .
TRENT
Initially this was merely routine , you understand .
We attempted to determine its compatibility with terrestrial DNA .
FOX
What kind of DNA exactly , Doctor ?
TRENT Human , of course .
Something shivers and shakes and takes form in the cube of light : a double helix threaded with green and red beads of light .
TRENT ( continuing )
Watch closely , please .
The alien genetic material looks like a cubist 's vision of an art deco staircase , its asymmetrical segments glowing Day - glo green and purple .
ROSETTI
That 's a biological structure ?
More like part of a machine ...
The alien form makes contact with the human DNA .
The transformation is shockingly swift , but its stages can still be followed : the thing seems to pull itself into and through the coils , and for an instant the two are meshed , locked , and then the final stage .
A new shape glows , a hybrid ; the green and red beads have been altered beyond recognition .
FOX
Like a high - speed viral takeover ...!
What 's the real - time duration on this , Trent ?
TULLY ( from the shadows beyond the glowing cube )
That was it .
What you see is what you get .
That 's how fast it is ...

ANCHORPOINT -- MACHINE SHOP
Hicks enters the cavernous shop , dodging out of the way of an emerging power - loader .
The place is an oily forest of steel ; machines of various kinds await repair .
WALKER is at a workbench , a big man in a grease - stained vest .
HICKS
Hicks .
Temporary duty assignment .
Walker works the joystick on a handheld remote control unit .
An unmanned power - loader comes to life and lumbers toward the bench .
He brings it to a halt expertly , exactly where he wants it , with few casual twiddles of the stick .
WALKER Walker .
Know how to blow out the hydraulic lines on a force - feedback system ?
HICKS No. WALKER
Never too late to learn .
He offers Hicks a cigarette , lights it for him with a micro - torch from the bench .
WALKER ( continuing )
You off the mystery ship , Hicks ?
HICKS Sulaco ?
What 's the mystery ?
WALKER ( lighting his own cigarette ) Popular question .
Whole thing 's triple - classified now and word 's getting around that two of the deck party never came back .
HICKS ( shrugs ) I was iced .
WALKER Sure ...
HICKS
You ready to show me his feedback system ?

SHUMAN Androids , by law , are afforded the status of persons .
Citizens .
DIPLOMATIC OFFICER
Under your system , yes .
We prefer to afford them the status of machines .
SHUMAN
You 're holding one of our citizens captive .
DIPLOMATIC OFFICER
The " citizen " in question , the synthetic , Bishop , has been held in regard to a treaty violation involving an armed vessel .
SHUMAN Sulaco was homing on Anchorpoint .
The so - called violation was the result of a malfunction .
DIPLOMATIC OFFICER
The matter is under investigation .
SHUMAN I repeat : you are holding one of our citizens .
DIPLOMATIC OFFICER
The incident is also being investigated with regards to an apparent violations of the Strategic Arms Reductions treaty .
SHUMAN Sulaco 's weapons - systems fall entirely within the prescribed -- DIPLOMATIC OFFICER I refer to those sections of the treaty concerned with biological warfare .
Beat .
The U.P.P. Diplomat has just scored , but Shuman maintains his poise .
SHUMAN
The allegation is false .
DIPLOMATIC OFFICER
We make no official allegations at this time .
The matter remains under investigation .
Bishop , however , is of no further use in the inquiry .
We are returning him to you .

Hicks has just come off shift ; the Mall 's bar catches his eye .
The facade says it all : ye olde pre-packaged genuine simulated wood - grain generic tavern and the only joint in town .
One wall is a screen showing a stale rerun of a Brazilian soccer match .
Some of the customers play hologram game - consoles .
Tully is seated at the bar .
Hicks takes a stool beside him .
HICKS Beer .
He fishes his dog tags out and detaches one , passes it to the bartender ; the bartender inserts it in a terminal , rings up the beer , hands it back .

HICKS ( grabbing Tully before he can slide off the stool )
You are n't going anywhere , buddy .
Tully , sudden energy , not so much at Hicks as at his whole situation : TULLY I did n't come out here to work on shit like that .
Came out here to help design ecosystems , not build designer for the next year ...

ROSETTI
He requested it himself .
FOX Results ?
TRENT
No irregularities so far .
No trace of the alien cellular material ...
WELLES Tampering , then ?
Reprogramming ?
Any new circuits in our Mr. Bishop ?
Any little surprises courtesy of the U.P.P.?
TRENT No. Nothing .
FOX
And his data on the Aliens ?
All there ?
Intact ?
TRENT
Yes , it seems to be .
But if his memory 's been tampered with , we'd have no way of knowing .
Neither would he ...
WELLES
In any case , we have to assume that the U.P.P. accessed Bishop 's memory .
That they have the data .
They may also have specimens of the alien genetic material ...
ROSETTI
In other words , you want to get on with your brief , do n't you ?
You want Trent to clone the cultures .
And you did n't want Shuman at this meeting .
FOX
This is n't a question of diplomacy , Colonel Rosetti .
ROSETTI
Is n't it ?
A violation of the S.A.R. treaty ?
FOX
Has anyone mentioned military applications , Colonel ?
Trent ?
TRENT ( smiles ) No . I think a very nice case can be made for applied exobiology .
We do have a standing order to study alien life - forms when we encounter them .
Preliminary analysis of the material from Sulaco reveals a remarkable adaptive capacity .
The potential for cancer research alone ...
WELLES Imagine , Colonel : if it can be programmed to only kill cancer cells ...
ROSETTI
And what exactly is it you propose to do , Trent ?
FOX ( before Trent can answer )
We 'll nourish the cells is stasis tubes , under constant observation .
We 'll terminate them before they become embryos ...
ROSETTI I see .
Cancer research .
And our motives are exclusively humanitarian .
Is that it ?
WELLES Colonel , when Shuman gets his reply from Earth , priority will go to military development of the Alien .
We know that because we know where our orders came from .
The decision has already been made .
FOX And potential U.P.P. research in the same direction only adds to the urgency , Colonel .
ROSETTI
The decision rests with me .
WELLES Perhaps you misunderstood , Rosetti .
The decision has been made .

They wo n't just break you , Colonel , they 'll see to it that it 's as though your career never happened .
They 're top people .

Small video cameras are mounted at intervals overhead , panning slowly form side to side .
As he continues , less of the tunnel is finished ; sections of tile are missing , revealing pipes , wiring , structural steel .

Bishop and Rosetti are beside her .

You 're sure it 's him ?
JACKSON
It 's his locator frequency , is n't it ?
No two alike .
Surgically implanted .

Dark .
The Jeep creeps along between stacks of prefab hull units , emerges into a open space , junctions of several corridors .
The deck is an inch deep in water .
JACKSON ( V.O. )
He 's there !
You 're right on top of him !
Walker stops the jeep .
Hicks stands up , plays the beam of a flashlight around the area .
Presses the mute button on his headset .
HICKS ( bellows ) Tully !
Tully !
Yo! ECHO . DRIP of water .
Hicks clips the flashlight beneath the barrel of his gun and jumps down .
Reflections ripple as he moves forward .
Swings the beam along the surface -- something there ...
The logo - patches down a sleeve of Tully 's ruptured , blood - soaked leather jacket .
Drifting shred of human tissue ...
JACKSON ( V.O. )
Can you see him ?
HICKS Yeah .
And the thing that was Tully launches itself from the top of one of the stacks of construction material .
Lands on top of the jeep , going for Walker , through the roll bars .
CLOSEUP ON JAWS CLOSEUP as the thing 's tail lashes past Walker 's face , taking a nick out of a steel bar .
on the controls , a pair of levers : he yanks one back , shoves the other forward , thumbs both drive buttons simultaneously .
ANGLE
The jeep ( separate drive - trains for each wheel ) pulls two three - sixties on a dime , hurling the thing toward Hicks .
It smashes into the desk , splash of water , leaps for Hicks instantly .
The charge from his pulse - rifle takes it in mid-air , hideous bile - yellow spurt of acid ...
And it hits the water again with a terrific EXPLOSION of steam .
The jeep lurches out through the steam , engines SCREAMING , wheels losing traction through the puddle , throwing up fantails of water , nearly overturning .
Hicks jumps , snags a roll bar , empties the pulse - rifle 's clip into the steam on full - auto as Walker hauls ass back down the corridor ...

Braun is dead , his rib cage gaping .
SCEAMS and the HAMMER of automatic weapons .
Station crew fleeing in panic enter through one door , crash into tables , scattering trays of food , claw at one another to escape through another door .
The Vietnamese commando and her partner are last into the room ; they spin in unison and FIRE back through the door .
SOUND of rending metal and loud inhuman RAGE .
The commandos scramble for the far door as the alien crashes into the mess : a new form , the result of Suslov 's genetic tinkering .

Able to reproduce more quickly .
The frantic crew are climbing a ladder .
The commandos start up the ladder .
They climb through a circular hatch .

ROSETTI
What do they have in the area ?
JACKSON ( taps up a fresh screen of data )
Not much .
Automated mining system working NC - 313 ...
Test module for a terraforming operation enroute MV - 45 ...
And , here we go , the battle cruiser Nikolai Stoiko .
Nine hours from Rodina if they push it .

We 're dealing with a new form , Colonel .
We know nothing of this new mode of reproduction .
Others may have already become hosts ...
ROSETTI
What are you suggesting ?
BISHOP
In order to be entirely certain , Colonel , it would be necessary to override the fusion package now .
Jackson looks up at Bishop ; he 's suggesting mass suicide .
HICKS
I thought you were programmed to protect human life ?
BISHOP ( with android blandness ) I 'm taking the long view .
Jackson 's console CHIMES , begins to display new data , ID shots of three crew members .

She falls silent as the screen clear , revealing a young Slavic madwoman -- one of Suslov 's lab assistants -- in blood - drenched coveralls .
Jerky handheld video , grainy transmission , indistinct background .
She clutches a sheet of paper , reads aloud from it in a foreign language .
SHUMAN

Right around the corner ...
HICKS Affirmative ...
They round the turn , weapons ready .
And stop , stunned .
GREENFIELD
Wha' 'th ...?
The tunnel , which widens here as it approaches the massive air - scrubber , has been transformed ; its lights are dimly visible through shrouds of resin .
Vast ribs of the stuff sweep up from a dim and monstrous shape that covers the deck at the base of the scrubber ; we 're looking into an Alien grotto , black and pearlescent , and obscene fairyland .
The shape 's symmetry suggest function .
Patient DRUMMING of the air - scrubber 's giant fans .

WALLACE Holy Christ .
The central shape is revealed as an enormous mutant queen .
The thing is splayed on its back , mortared into the mass of resin , its vestigial head toward Hicks and the Marines .
Its abdomen is arched like an inverted scorpion - tail , tipped with a swollen , semi- translucent sac that ripples and pulses in the glare of Hick 's lamp .
A biomechanical birth - factory .

Hicks has gotten hold of the light , struggles to keep it on the queen as he props the tube against his thigh .
SCREAMS .
Blue stutter of pulse - rifles .
A tongue of fire from Greenfield 's flamethrower , but an Alien jumps him ; the napalm - stream arcs wildly , splashing the resin structure -- and the Queen wakes .
The huge tail extends , lifts in the floodlight beam ...
Hicks is still trying to assemble his mortar .
As the swollen , podlike tail - tip splits open with a sickly , tearing SOUND , releasing a puffball cloud of dark mist -- we 've seen it before , in miniature , with Tully in the lab -- which begins to rise , drawn up toward the giant fans above the air - scrubber ...

She looks like a child now , moving through all this , small and alone .
But not helpless : she still moves with a cat 's wariness , her gun ready .
Three face - huggers scuttle across at an intersection of corridors , tails thrashing ...
She comes to a door that opens onto Rodina 's central hub , a large cylindrical space surrounding a core of equipment .
The door is ajar ; she edges through ...

Report Cites Holiday Abuse in Chinese Factory
A report alleges abuse in the making of holiday ornaments sold in the U.S .
Dec. 12 , 2007  --
Not only should parents be concerned about the made - in - China toys Santa puts under the Christmas tree but , according to a new report by a labor rights group , Scrooge is running at least one of the Chinese factories that makes their holiday ornaments too .
The National Labor Committee , which tracks working conditions in developing countries worldwide , released a report Wednesday titled " A Wal - Mart Christmas Brought to You from a Sweatshop in China . "
It documents with photos and video , workers -- some as young as 12 years old -- working at the Guangzhou Huanya Gift Co. , which produces ornaments sold in the United States at Wal - Mart and Target stores .
" Wal - Mart is glorifying the virtue of buying cheap goods in its stores , claiming this is the real holiday spirit , " said Charles Kernaghan , director of the National Labor Committee at a press conference outside Rockefeller Center , near the famous Christmas tree .
" But especially at this time of year , no American would knowingly purchase a product in Wal - Mart if they knew that bargain was based on the exploitation of children and teenagers forced to work grueling hours , seven days a week , who are stripped of their rights and paid pennies an hour , " Kernaghan said .
Wal - Mart would not comment directly on the report since it was just released today , but a spokesman said the company takes the allegations seriously .
In a written statement , Richard Coyle , Wal - Mart 's director of international corporate affairs said , " As soon as Wal - Mart learned about the Christmas tree ornament report , we contacted the National Labor Committee and they have not returned our call .
Now that we have a copy of their report , we have launched an immediate investigation .
Through our rigorous ethical standards program , Wal - Mart aggressively deals with any allegations of improper conditions at our suppliers ' factories .
Wal - Mart maintains a very strict supplier 's code of conduct , and employs over 200 people to monitor our suppliers and their designated factories ' adherence .
Our program is the largest of its kind in the world -- last year , we conducted more than 16,000 audits at over 8,700 factories . "
Other companies , such as Target , were not singled out in the report as selling ornaments from the factory .
However the report said Target was listed among a list of buyers from the factory .
A Target spokesman said the store was still " researching the issue related to the factory in China that was identified in the NLC report , but our initial findings indicate that Target does not have any relationship with this factory . "
Long Hours , Loose Labor Laws
Some 8,000 people work in the Chinese factory , working 10 - to 12 - to 15 - hour shifts with breaks only for lunch and dinner , seven days a week during the eight - month busy season , according to the report , which obtained most of its information from videos and documents smuggled out of the factory this summer .
They show that the factory hired 500 or more 16 year - old workers this summer , and some of those teenage workers said the factory employed children as young as 12 .
The smuggled video and photos released with the report seem to show startlingly young children hunched over large bags of shiny balls stringing the ornaments together .
Most of the workers are young women as the report details : " A young woman hand paints a Christmas ornament every 39 seconds and 93 an hour .
In the spray paint department , working without gloves or masks , a young man sprays rack after rack of 32 Christmas balls each , completing 64,000 to 76,800 ornaments a day . "
Congressional Outrage
Some in Congress are taking action .
" If this were happening down the street in Bismarck , N.D. , or Boston or Peoria , Ill. , and you had people down at the end of the block hiring 12 - year - olds , working seven days a week , 15 hours a day from 8 a.m. until 11 p.m. , without a day off for months ... you 'd get the country sheriff and run down there and close it , " Said Sen. Byron Dorgan , D - N.D. , at a news conference on Capitol Hill .
Dorgan , who called the working conditions " abuse , " has sponsored Senate legislation that would ban sweatshop products from store shelves in the United States by holding the companies that import the products accountable to U.S. laws pertaining to their production .
At the press conference , Dorgan displayed one large , sparkly ornament he said was bought at Wal - Mart and came from the factory , as well as a box of smaller , shiny , ball ornaments , whose production was depicted in the video and pictures that accompany the report .
The report alleges workers are at the factory an average of 84 hours per week and working 77 of those hours , and also that half the workers are at the factory 105 hours during the week and working 95 .
These 55 hours of overtime work exceed China 's legal overtime limit by 562 percent .
And , according to the report , the factory deems taking days off unacceptable , and that any worker who takes a Sunday off is docked 2½ days ' wages as punishment .
" Workers were pressured to sign a ' voluntary ' overtime application in which they " AGREE " to work more than three hours overtime a day , to work Saturdays , Sundays and holidays " with no guaranteed minimum wage or overtime premium , " read the report .
" I 'm just interested in deciding that if we 're part of this global economy -- and we are -- it is a global economy -- the question is , what are the rules and how do you enforce the rules ? " asked Dorgan , adding that there is finally a " great awakening " in the United States regarding the working conditions behind imported goods .
But he did note that there are obstacles to his anti-sweatshop legislation .
" Anybody who raises any questions is branded as an anti-free trader , as some sort of Neanderthal , xenophobic , isolationist stooge who just can't see over the horizon , " Dorgan said .

Large Binocular Telescope

Explanation :
With moonlight on the horizon , a starry sky and the northern Milky Way provide the background for this dramatic view of the World at Night .
The imposing structure in the foreground houses the Large Binocular Telescope ( LBT ) , on Mount Graham , Arizona .
Inside , the two 8.4 meter diameter mirrors of the LBT really are side - by - side on a common mount , an arrangement mimicking the design of more modest optical equipment usually carried around the neck .
While not exactly portable , the benefits of the large scale binocular configuration adopted include an increase in sensitivity over a single mirror telescope and high resolution imaging for faint objects over a relatively wide field of view .
An international collaboration operates the LBT Observatory .
Yesterday was the anniversary of the December 7 , 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor by the Imperial Japanese Navy .
For the individuals who died , for their families , it was a day in which the personal worlds of thousands were suddenly turned upside down .
When President Franklin Delano Roosevelt asked Congress for a declaration of war , the entire country 's political , economic , and social worlds turned upside down as 12 million men and women donned uniforms and women entered new jobs on the home front .
As I write this Thursday morning , December 6 , it has been about 100 hours since excerpts from the latest U.S. National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) on Iran 's nuclear capabilities became public knowledge around the world .
It is also about 75 hours since President Bush 's news conference on December 3 during which he declared the NIE 's findings changed nothing .
Quite the contrary , Bush insisted that the NIE reinforced the administration 's approach : hold low - level discussions in Bagdad between the U.S. and Iranian ambassadors to Iraq ; insist that Iran comply with UN Security Council demands that Tehran halt uranium enrichment as a precondition for any high - level direct negotiations with Washington ; and impose another round of stiff international sanctions on Tehran .
And it is roughly 50 hours since President Bush arrived in Omaha , Nebraska Tuesday and declared that Tehran must " come clean " about its nuclear weapons ambitions and programs .
The phrase " come clean " recalled to mind two essays written in July and September 2003 .
Unbeknownst to the public , press , and pundits at the time , this was the transitional period for the invading forces .
In these three months , the foreign soldiers lost the image of liberators and were saddled with the stigma of occupiers - their world turned upside down .
It was also the period during which the full extent of the administration 's tampering with intelligence began to be apparent to all but the most doctrinaire observers .
Next door in Iran , the ayatollahs saw new instability in an already instable region of the world .
Afghanistan and Iraq , two neighbors , had been invaded by U.S. forces , their governments overthrown and replaced by pro-western regimes , and now hosted 160,000 U.S. troops ..
And while the Afghanistan venture was obviously retaliation for the al - Qaeda terror attacks on September 11 , 2001 , the March 2003 assault on Iraq was an example of the " Bush Doctrine " of " preventive war " applied to regimes that , in addition to secretly pursuing nuclear technology and knowledge , were deemed by Washington to be unfriendly .
The challenge for the ayatollahs in 2007 is in many ways the same one that Saddam had faced in 2003 : how to prove a negative - that there were no weapons or programs to acquire weapons of mass destruction when the U.S. government incessantly insisted that there were .
The only way to do this was to expose the manipulation of intelligence by the Bush White House as it sought congressional support against first Iraq and now against Iran .
All the ayatollahs can offer in defense are the lessons of the Iraq confrontation .
In the four months before the invasion , UN inspectors had found no weapons and no programs for acquiring weapons of mass destruction - facts that at least denied the administration any official UN backing for attacking Iraq .
Similarly , during the six months after the invasion , the 1,400 hand - picked inspectors of the U.S. Iraq Survey Team also failed to find any of the nuclear , biological , or chemical weapons the Bush administration alleged Saddam possessed .
So it seems that Saddam had been playing an elaborate shell game right up to the end .
His nuclear weapons ploy not only kept regional enemies at bay but was convincing enough to fool western analysts that Iraq 's nuclear program remained potentially active .
Analysts succumbed to classic mirror imaging because they simply could not imagine why Saddam would endure harsh UN sanctions and scores of foreigners running around his country unless he had a hidden program he planned to restart after inspections ended .
Whether it's about Iraq in 2003 or Iran in 2007 , the Middle East is a rough neighborhood .
Any perception of weakness risks another country taking advantage of the situation .
Thus the best defense is the appearance of a strong offense , which Saddam tried to portray - and did until his son - in - law , Hussein Kemal , " betrayed " him to western and UN intelligence agents .
These , unfortunately , simply did not believe that the weapons of mass destruction had been destroyed in 1991 and programs stopped .
As is clearly evident with this new NIE on Iran , the intelligence professionals have relearned something about their craft : when everyone agrees on everything , start over and find the contradiction or the omission that , if pursued , " turns the world upside down . "
That is the message of the key findings of the NIE : the Intelligence Community finds with " high confidence " that Tehran " halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 " and further finds with " moderate confidence " that this program has not been restarted . "
The question remaining is for how long Tehran will sustain this hiatus - especially if the Bush administration refuses to change its stance .
The other fact -- highly dangerous -- the ayatollahs must weigh is Bush 's insistence that Iran " come clean , " a demand that indicates that Bush , unlike the Intelligence Community , still has learned nothing of the psychology of the Middle East .
In the end , it is the political professionals , not the intelligence analysts , who make policy and implement programs .
When the politicians let ideology override the facts , the mistakes of the past inevitably become the mistakes of the future .
How else can one explain the efforts by conservative fear - mongering pundits to embrace a tortured interpretation of the latest report of the IAEA on Iran 's nuclear programs ?
The moral is simple .
If one believes in witches and warlocks , one will be able to find evidence they exist and eventually the actual beings .
The administration and the world believed Saddam had weapons , and he obliged by dropping hints and acting as if he were hiding something .
The White House is trying to convince the public that Iran is another Iraq and is an imminent danger to the world .
But this time , the world is not buying .
The administration 's ploy this time will not turn anyone 's world upside down .

Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson today endorsed Sen. Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination .
Jackson used a campaign appearance by Obama 's wife , Michelle , at Cleveland State University as the forum to announce his choice .
Jackson said Obama understands the devastation of foreclosures caused by predatory lending as well as that urban centers can be the economic engines of job creation .
" He will help Cleveland , " Jackson said .
Jackson 's brief comments were followed by a fiery speech delivered by Michelle Obama to a cheering crowd of 500 at CSU 's University Center .
The Ohio primary is Tuesday , March 4 .
SIMI VALLEY , California ( CNN ) -- Front - runners John McCain and Mitt Romney attacked each other 's conservative credentials as they fought for their party 's top spot during the final showdown before the Super Tuesday contests .
The GOP candidates take the stage for Wednesday 's debate .
The sharpest exchange in the debate came when Romney , the former governor of Massachusetts , was asked about the McCain campaign 's charge that he once said he favored a strict timetable for removing troops from Iraq .
Romney has consistently denied ever having backed a timetable and said McCain was taking a small portion of a quote out of context .
" It 's simply wrong , " Romney said .
" By the way , raising it a few days before the Florida primary , when there was very little time for me to correct the record , falls in the kind of dirty tricks that Ronald Reagan would have found reprehensible . "
Watch the candidates trade barbs »
But McCain , the Arizona senator who has strongly backed President Bush 's Iraq policy , accused Romney of hedging after public support for the war waned .
" I was on the front lines with my friends saying we not only can't withdraw but we 've got to have additional troops over there in order for us to have a chance to succeed , " he said .
The debate -- sponsored by CNN , the Los Angeles Times and Politico.com -- took place at the Reagan Presidential Library .
The event came as the GOP 's four remaining candidates jockey for position going into next Tuesday , when more than 20 states will be holding primaries or caucuses .
Watch undecided voters ' real - time reaction »
McCain -- who has won primaries in New Hampshire , South Carolina and Florida -- hopes to solidify himself as the front - runner , while Romney , the winner in Michigan , Nevada and Wyoming , tries to stop McCain 's run to the nomination .
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , winner of the Iowa caucuses , hoped to position himself well among evangelicals and other conservatives to turn around several consecutive losses since Iowa .
Long - shot candidate Ron Paul , a representative from Texas , also participated in the debate .
The debate also came on a day when McCain scored a pair of major endorsements that could help deliver two of Super Tuesday 's richest prizes .
Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani dropped out of the race and endorsed McCain hours before the debate began .
And late Wednesday , CNN reported that California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who was in the audience for the debate , planned to endorse McCain Thursday .
California and New York have the two largest number of delegates up for grabs next week .
See what political analysts say about the showdown »
" If you look at the mega - states , these are major endorsements , " said CNN political analyst and former White House adviser David Gergen .
During discussion on how to best help the flagging economy , all four candidates said they support the stimulus package moving through Congress .
Hear some of the candidates ' key points »
But Huckabee said investment in infrastructure instead of tax rebates would best stimulate the nation 's economy .
" Infrastructure in this country has been neglected , " he said .
" I do n't think there 's a governor in this country that would n't tell you that you 'll create more jobs and you 'll build it with American workers , American concrete and American steel .
That 's stimulus . "
On immigration , Romney said those who have come to the United States illegally must return home and " get in line with everybody else that wants to come here . "
" People who come here legally are a great source of vitality and strength for our country , but illegal immigration -- that 's got to end , " he said .
McCain said securing the borders is the " responsibility and the priority " of the American people .
He said he would not vote for the pathway to citizenship part of his original immigration reform plan because the American people do not want it without securing the borders first .
" If we do n't have a secure fence and have just this open door that people can come in and out at will , we 're never going to deal with this issue effectively and responsibly , " Huckabee said .
" It 's not that we 're building a fence so we can keep our people in or keep people out , but that people who do come here would have to come legally . "
With former First Lady Nancy Reagan looking on , Paul disagreed with President Reagan 's choice of Sandra Day O'Connor as a Supreme Court justice , while Huckabee and McCain declined to say whether they would have tapped her for a spot on the high court .
Romney said he " would rather have " a different kind of justice on the bench .
The back - and - forth between McCain and Romney threatened to dominate the evening .
McCain sideswiped Romney 's credentials as a successful business leader while answering a question about who would best run the nation .
" I think he managed companies and he bought and he sold and sometimes people lost their jobs , " McCain said .
" That 's the nature of that business . "
Critics note that Romney 's tenure as CEO of the leveraged buyout firm Bain Capital resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs through layoffs and bankruptcies .
Romney , the wealthiest candidate in the 2008 presidential race , ran Bain Capital from 1984 to 1999 , during which time he earned the bulk of his fortune .
Bain Capital specialized in buying companies in distress and revamping them , often by cutting jobs and closing plants .
Some of Bain 's purchases became more efficient and successful businesses , while others , loaded with debt from Bain 's fees , were forced into bankruptcy , costing more jobs .
Earlier , Romney appeared to go after a perceived a gulf between McCain and the Republican party 's conservative base -- much of which has distrusted him since he ran against Bush in 2000 .
" He 's a good Republican ; I would n't question those credentials at all , " Romney said of McCain .
" But there are a number of pieces of legislation where his views are out of the mainstream , at least in my view , of conservative Republican thought . "
Romney hit McCain for his opposition to drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska .
He also noted that McCain twice voted against tax cuts pushed by President Bush and sponsored campaign - finance reform legislation that he claimed " took a whack at the First Amendment . "
McCain defended those stances , saying he wanted spending cuts to go along with the tax cuts .
CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said the heated exchange over Romney 's Iraq quote was one of the debate 's key moments -- and may have favored Romney .
" Romney made a very , very eloquent defense of himself that had some outrage in it , " said Schneider .
" I do not think McCain looked good in that exchange . "
While most analysts said Romney and Huckabee failed to score any major moments that could derail McCain 's momentum , Schneider said Huckabee had the best performance of the three .
McCain " may have lost some ground here , " Schneider said .
" He did not sound like a straight talker at all in this debate . "
Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama will face off Thursday at 8 p.m. ET on CNN .

It was called the sunshine cure , and in the early 20th century , before the era of antibiotics , it was the only effective therapy for tuberculosis known .
No one knew why it worked , just that TB patients sent to rest in sunny locales were often restored to health .
The same “ treatment ” had been discovered in 1822 for another historic scourge , rickets — a deforming childhood condition caused by an inability to make hardened bone .
Rickets had been on the rise in 18th - and 19th - century Europe , coinciding with industrialization and the movement of people from the countryside to the polluted cities , when a Warsaw doctor observed that the problem was relatively rare in rural Polish children .
He began experimenting with city children and found that he could cure their rickets with exposure to sunshine alone .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) -
The price of fruits and vegetables is climbing faster than inflation , while junk food is actually becoming cheaper , the findings of a new study suggest .
Using retail prices at major supermarket chains in Seattle , researchers at the University of Washington found that low - calorie , nutrient - rich foods -- mainly fruits and vegetables -- were far more expensive , calorie for calorie , than sweets and snack foods .
Moreover , the average price of the lowest - calorie foods -- including green vegetables , tomatoes and berries -- increased by almost 20 percent over 2 years .
In contrast , in the same time period there was a 2 - percent dip in the cost of the most calorie - laden fare , such as butter , potato chips , cookies and candy bars .
The findings , published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association , highlight a key obstacle to healthy eating .
And they may help explain why obesity rates are highest among the poorest Americans , according to the researchers .
“ Whereas ( calorie ) - dense foods remain the most affordable option , the price of the recommended healthful foods of lower ( calorie ) density has disproportionately increased , ” write Drs. Pablo Monsivais and Adam Drewnowski .
They add that , along with encouraging Americans to change their personal behavior , the government may need to make policy shifts that help people eat more healthful foods -- such as changes in the way the government subsidizes the agricultural industry .
In their study , the researchers examined the prices of 372 foods and beverages at Seattle supermarket chains in 2004 and 2006 .
They found that snack foods , sweets and fatty foods offered the most bang for a shopper ’s buck .
Whereas the price of the lowest - calorie fruits and vegetables was more than $ 18.16 per 1,000 calories , the most calorie - rich foods cost $ 1.76 per 1,000 calories .
The 20 - percent increase in the cost of the lowest - calorie foods may be putting healthful foods out of reach for those Americans who need these foods the most , according to the researchers .
“ The finding that ( calorie ) - dense foods are not only the least expensive , but also most resistant to inflation , may also help explain why the highest rates of obesity continue to be observed among groups of limited economic means , ” they write .

The Times of India is now reporting with corroboration from Stratfor that the American military is in control of all of Pakistan 's nuclear facilities , including weapons :
WASHINGTON : Pakistan 's nuclear weapons are already under American control even as analysts are working themselves into a lather on the subject , a well - regarded intelligence journal has said .
In a stunning disclosure certain to stir up things in Washington 's ( and in Islamabad and New Delhi's ) strategic community , the journal Stratfor reported on Monday that the " United States delivered a very clear ultimatum to Musharraf in the wake of 9/11 : Unless Pakistan allowed US forces to take control of Pakistani nuclear facilities , the United States would be left with no choice but to destroy those facilities , possibly with India 's help . "
The figures were released as the justice secretary , Jack Straw , announced a new package of reforms aimed at cutting prisoner numbers and confirmed he would press ahead with the construction of three " Titan " jails to create 7,500 extra prison places by 2014 .
Prisoners on the early release scheme committed 301 crimes between its introduction last June and December .
Of those released , 215 have reoffended and 117 are on the run after defying orders to return to jail .
If the same rate of release is maintained over the next six months , it will mean 31,000 criminals will have been freed in the scheme 's first year .
When it was launched , ministers said the annual figure would be 25,000 .
The end of the custody licence scheme creates a presumption that prisoners serving between four weeks and four years will be released 18 days before their sentences end .
The shadow justice secretary , Nick Herbert , said early release had " put the public at risk " but failed to deal with prison overcrowding , which he blamed on a refusal to build more jails .
The government had created " more than 300 unnecessary victims of crime " , he said .
" They should have been protected by the criminal justice system but have been let down by Labour 's incompetence
" This early release scheme must be scrapped immediately and sufficient prison places provided so that public safety comes first . "
Reforms announced by Straw today include involving more employers in training offenders and giving them jobs , drug treatment programmes in jails , and cracking down on the drugs trade in prisons .
Four more drug courts will be created , along the lines of pilots in west London and Leeds .
Straw said he was embarking on " a major drive to overcome some of the barriers to the rehabilitation of offenders " .
He had suggested yesterday that the " Titan " jails might not go ahead , but Gordon Brown later insisted they would be built after consultation .
The Liberal Democrat justice spokesman , David Heath , condemned ministers for " desperately trying to convince themselves they can simply build their way out of this crisis " .
" If the government really wants to reduce the number of people in prison it should focus its attention on increasing secure mental health provision and drug treatment places , " he said .
Jackie Worrall of the crime reduction charity Nacro said the initiatives were " certainly not new " .
" Opportunities for tackling drug addiction and making links with employers on the outside have existed for some time , but long - term overcrowding has severely hampered access to the programmes , " she said .
I ’ve been experimenting with making lots of cleaning supplies at home , but this one is by far the craziest – and the most successful .
Basically , I made a giant bucket of slime that works incredibly well as laundry detergent at a cost of about three cents a load .
For comparison ’s sake , a jumbo container of Tide at Amazon.com costs $ 28.99 for 96 loads , or a cost of $ 0.30 a load .
Thus , with each load of this stuff , I ’m saving more than a quarter .
Even better – I got to make a giant bucket of slime in the kitchen and my wife approved of it .
Homemade Laundry Detergent Recipe
Here ’s what you need :
– 1 bar of soap ( whatever kind you like ; I used Lever 2000 because we have tons of bars of it from a case we bought a while back )
– 1 box of washing soda ( look for it in the laundry detergent aisle at your local department store – it comes in an Arm & Hammer box and will contain enough for six batches of this stuff )
– 1 box of borax ( this is not necessary , but I ’ve found it really kicks the cleaning up a notch – one box of borax will contain more than enough for tons of batches of this homemade detergent – if you decide to use this , be careful )
– A five gallon bucket with a lid ( or a bucket that will hold more than 15 liters – ask around – these are n’t too tough to acquire )
– Three gallons of tap water
– A big spoon to stir the mixture with
– A measuring cup
– A knife

Make Your Own Laundry Detergent – Step by Step
Step One :
Put about four cups of water into a pan on your stove and turn the heat up on high until it ’s almost boiling .
While you ’re waiting , whip out a knife and start shaving strips off of the bar of soap into the water , whittling it down .
Keep the heat below a boil and keep shaving the soap .
Eventually , you ’ll shave up the whole bar , then stir the hot water until the soap is dissolved and you have some highly soapy water .
Step Two :
Put three gallons of hot water ( 11 liters or so ) into the five gallon bucket – the easiest way is to fill up three gallon milk jugs worth of it .
Then mix in the hot soapy water from step one , stir it for a while , then add a cup of the washing soda .
Keep stirring it for another minute or two , then add a half cup of borax if you are using borax .
Stir for another couple of minutes , then let the stuff sit overnight to cool , and you ’re done .
How Much Will You Save ?
When you wake up in the morning , you ’ll have a bucket of gelatinous slime that ’s a paler shade of the soap that you used ( in our case , it ’s a very pale greenish blue ) .
One measuring cup full of this slime will be roughly what you need to do a load of laundry – and the ingredients are basically the same as laundry detergent .
Thus , out of three gallons , you ’ll get about 48 loads of laundry .
If you do this six times , you ’ll have used six bars of soap ( $ 0.99 each ) , one box of washing soda ( $ 2.49 at our store ) , and about half a box of borax ( $ 2.49 at our store , so $ 1.25 ) and make 288 loads of laundry .
This comes up to a cost of right around three cents a gallon , or a savings of $ 70 .
Plus , you can make slime in the kitchen – and have a legitimate reason for doing so !
Modern technology depletes human cognitive abilities more rapidly than drugs , according to a psychiatric study conducted at King 's College , London .
And the curse of ' messaging ' is to blame .
Email users suffered a 10 per cent drop in IQ scores , more than twice the fall recorded by marijuana users , in a clinical trial of over a thousand participants .
Doziness , lethargy and an inability to focus are classic characteristics of a spliffhead , but email users exhibited these particular symptoms to a " startling " degree , according to Dr Glenn Wilson .
The deterioration in mental capacity was the direct result of the trialists ' addiction to technology , researchers discovered .
Email addicts were bombarded by context switches and developed an inability to distinguish between trivial and significant messages .
Incredibly , 20 per cent of trialists jeopardized their immediate social relations by rushing off to " check their messages " in the middle of a conversation .
Wilson 's research is no flash in the pan .
Computer technology in its modern , " interconnected " form is dumbing down the population more rapidly than television .
A study of 100,000 school children in over 30 countries around the world testified that non-computer using kids performed better in literacy and numeracy schools than PC - using children .
Education experts have dubbed it the " problem solving deficit disorder " .
Awash with facts , we 've forgotten how to think .
King 's College 's pioneering study focussed solely on messaging - but there are many other emerging technologies that could be dumbing down technologies too , and their consequences have n't been fully explored .
We look forward to studies that examine the IQ lossage involved in the many other unavoidable parts of everyday life .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Tax rebate checks will begin going out in May , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said after the House 's passage of a Senate - approved $ 167 billion economic stimulus package Thursday .
The House of Representatives voted 380 - 34 to send the measure to the president a few hours after Democratic and Republican senators reached accord and ended a dayslong stalemate over the legislation .
Earlier , two White House officials said President Bush would support the package .
The bill will be delivered Friday to the White House , with Bush 's signing likely sometime next week , Democratic aides said .
The package , which passed the Senate 81 - 16 , will send rebate checks to 130 million Americans in amounts of $ 300 to $ 600 for people who have an income between $ 3,000 and $ 75,000 , plus $ 300 per child .
Couples earning up to $ 150,000 would get $ 1,200 .
Article Correction
An earlier version of this report incorrectly described the federal tax rebate as an advance on 2008 tax refunds .
The rebate is an additional tax credit for 2008 , and it will not be taxed .
" My team will be sitting down with the IRS tomorrow , and the IRS , right in the middle of tax filing season ... will be working to get checks out , " said Paulson , who helped broker the deal .
Paulson said the process of sending the checks would be completed by the end of summer .
The leadership of both parties hailed the efforts that moved the package through Congress .
" You do n't see anybody up here gloating about being a winner , " Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R- Kentucky , said after the House vote .
" There were no winners or losers in this except the American people , who saw us rise above any differences we might have had and work to agreement on what is the No. 1 issue , and that is our slowing economy . "

Senate committee approves bill Senator wants seniors to get rebate checks
House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said , " The House gave a little , the Senate gave a little .
I think that 's what the American people expect of us -- to find some way to come together and deal with the problems the American people are facing . "
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , called the approval an " example of how government is supposed to work . "
Reid said , " Legislation is the art of compromise , and that compromise comes very hard sometimes .
It came very hard this time . "
After the House passed a stimulus package last week , Senate Democrats made a number of changes that Republicans would not accept , saying that they were too big and loaded with special - interest provisions .
After Democrats were unable to break a Republican filibuster threat , the leadership headed back to the negotiating table , finally agreeing to leave rebate check amounts at the House level .
( Senate Democrats had lowered them and raised the income caps . )
The Senate measure also added checks to more than 20 million Social Security beneficiaries and 250,000 handicapped veterans and their widows who were left out of the original House bill .
The Democrats dropped demands for an extension of unemployment benefits , energy assistance for low - income households and tax breaks for energy providers .
" This legislation is not everything that I wanted , " Reid said .
" But I am very happy . "
While the members of Congress and Paulson applauded the bill 's quick passage , a survey found that about one in four Americans ( 26 percent ) said they would spend their tax rebates .
Nearly half ( 46 percent ) said they plan to use the rebate to pay off debt and a quarter ( 28 percent ) would save the money , according to the International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS Securities , which jointly commissioned the study of 1,005 households between January 31 and Sunday .
" The money will go into the hands of lenders rather than retailers , " said Mike Niemira , chief economist of the International Council of Shopping Centers .
The crushing weight of Americans ' debt load was underscored Thursday when the Federal Reserve reported Americans owed a record $ 943.5 billion in credit card debt at the end of December .
Including loans other than mortgages and home equity lines of credit , Americans are shouldering a record $ 2.5 trillion in debt .
That amount increased during the month by a relatively modest 2.1 percent , an indication that Americans have been restraining their spending .

I 'd figure after Katrina the President would have to have had a better message than this .
Either CNN's Ed Henry is just being awful charitable or else there must have been a lot more that President Bush said that just was n't in the clip they showed .
What they did show sure did n't live up to Henry 's intro .
Henry :
The message from the President obviously was burned politically by Hurricane Katrina and the slow government response , was very simple :
The government is here to help .
Bush :
We 're sorry you 're going through what you 're going through .
You know life sometimes is unfair and you do n't get to play the hand you wanted to play but the question is when you get dealt the hand how do you play it , and I 've come away with this impression of the folks here in Macon county .
One , they 're down to earth good hard working people .
They have a respect for the Almighty , and this community is going to be as strong as ever .
That 's what I think .
So where was " the government is here to help " part ?
Part Three
Through Middle East Eyes
In order for the peoples of America and the West to understand what has been and is currently being done to the peoples of the Middle East we must envision ourselves as human beings living and going through life in that most troubled of regions .
We must exercise a humanist form of empathy that places us squarely inside the lands of desert and sand , the lands of the people of the Bible , of terrain full of mirages and complexities , of alien and unfamiliar cultures and languages and religions , of a history that predates any western beginning or thought , of a complexity we know almost nothing about .
We must see through the eyes of peoples we do not understand and are completely ignorant of , of peoples we have been conditioned through ceaseless propaganda to disdain and oftentimes hate .
We must , in order to see into resurrected Crusades , know the unknown , so that we cease to fear what is foreign and alien .
We must contemplate life as it currently exists for the people of the region , not the life we are made to believe in , nor the hazy reality imagined in our minds .
For the sake of the millions now dead and dying , for the sake of the dispossessed and the suffering , the maimed and mentally destroyed , we must have an understanding of life in the Middle East , life inside the fires of imperialism .
We must , in order to comprehend the catastrophe befalling the peoples of the Middle East , imagine ourselves as people living under tyranny , under occupation , under oppression and modern day colonialism , in lands where the devil ’s excrement abounds , where it makes blind monsters of men , where conflicts are born from the interpretations of fables and mythology , where theological differences succeed in both dividing and conquering , and where western colonialism has and continues to inflict great damage on millions of Arabs and Muslims .
If we are to understand the suffering and oppression of the Arab and Muslim people of the Middle East , we must confront the Empire and its omnipresent grip over the region ; a powerful nation with omnipotent control over lands whose resources are needed to run the engines of hegemonic power ; a hegemonic Goliath that methodically and calculatedly rules over dozens of little David ’s by proxy , intimidation and through puppets .
Indeed , to fully understand the 21st century ’s version of yesteryear ’s crusades , we must journey to the lands where greed and petroleum mix , where neoliberal capitalism and market colonialism fuse , where economic genocide and hegemonic drive intermingle and where the grand pieces of the global chess match collide .
For this present Crusade is not about reclaiming Jerusalem or the Holy Land , or of converting the heathens and barbarians into good Christians .
It is not about conquest in the name of a god or a religion , nor a crusade to determine a clash of civilizations .
No , this Crusade is about conquering and controlling petroleum , a resource unknown by past Crusaders .
This Crusade is about conquering and controlling geo-strategic land , about appropriating for the Empire the region ’s vast fields of oil and natural gas and the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates .
This Crusade is a neoliberal one , designed to inject American style debauched democracy and corrupt capitalism into the Middle East .
This Crusade , this invasion and occupation , this folly into mass murder and mass destruction , this criminal enterprise to appease the gods of greed and of the Almighty Dollar , is an ideological struggle initiated by the masters of neoliberal economics , who , together with those enamored with American Manifest Destiny , have for decades decimated the lives of the people who inhabit this condemned region .
As such , as much as we must see ourselves through Arab and Muslim eyes , we must also look inwards , towards our own selfish way of life , searching our self - centered egos and our ethnocentric bubble of delusion .
We must learn to see and accept the role we have in the great damage done in our name .
We must learn to understand , and acknowledge , that so much of the Crusade of Surge and Siege is a direct consequence of our gluttony and greed , our insatiable hunger for wealth and materialistic goods , our addictions to comfort and convenience and our complete and utter abandonment of humanist values as death and destruction is rained down on Arab and Muslim peoples .
In many ways , we , with our ever - expanding demands for better and greater standards of living , for more complete comfort and luxury , are the engine that runs the Empire ’s economy and thus its power , and that of its rulers .
It is the People that give sustenance to the Empire ’s actions , and it is us who inevitably depend most on Middle Eastern petroleum .
Indeed , every engine needs energy to give it life , to keep it operational , to maintain its many parts in harmony , to make sure of sound performance and of engine health .
This energy , of course , the energy we depend on for the continued survival of our “ way of life ” and our “ values , ” — by which we naturally mean greed , comfort , gluttony and the standard of living no other nation enjoys – the energy that helps guarantee our “ democracy and capitalism , ” — by which we mean the exploitation of the people of undeveloped nations and the market colonialism holding them hostage , all to maintain our “ way of life ” — as well as our addictions of mass consumption and materialism , comes directly from the black gold that permeates beneath the surface of the lands we inhabit , mostly from the nations of the south , whether it is the lands of Arabs or Muslims or Latin Americans or Africans .
The Crusade of Surge and Siege is thus a natural manifestation of our own vices and sins , of our unwillingness to part ways with a life no other people can claim to possess , and which becomes ever harder to simply abandon the longer it lasts and the more it continues to grow .
Our gluttony has continued its devastation on the peoples of the region , decade after decade , because those living inside the Empire refuse to part ways with an unsustainable way of life due to an uncontrollable addiction to greed and a plague - like , insatiable appetite for materialistic goods .
In the end , while we can feel good by blaming corporations or leaders , it is We the People who ultimately shoulder the blame for an indifference and a gluttony that stoke the flames that grant life to the engine of the Pax Americana .
Region Condemned
At the crossroads of humanity , connecting east and west , located in vitally geo-strategic positions , the Middle East has long been a prize for any aspiring Empire .
Many powers have invaded and occupied these lands and peoples , only to inevitably be violently thrown out over time .
History is saturated with the hubris and folly of Empires long since disappeared , whose arrogance and wealth ended up but rotting , decaying carcasses when their adventures with the Middle East came to a less than triumphant conclusion .
The Middle East has always been resistant and hostile to invasion and occupation , with its people using the accumulated wisdom of generations , and that of thousand years old civilizations , together with a silent patience that buys time and studies how best to defeat its enemies , preying on its victim like stealthy lions on a hunt .
Over time , these peoples have developed guerrilla warfare and the experience of multiple occupations , slowly , and methodically , castrating the invader , one soldier , one supply line at a time .
In a region that has seen much suffering , destruction and death , a war of attrition against these peoples cannot be won .
Ideas of time , of black and white thinking , of the definition of victory , of analysis and reason , of the necessity for vengeance , of death , and of war and battle are interpreted and seen differently from western views .
The failure to understand this reality has ruined the armies of powerful empires .
Many of the now defunct powers , it seems , failed to learn and understand human history , only to repeat the mistakes and the delusions of predecessors .
They failed to read between the lines , failing to see a cornucopia of red flags .
The region is as dynamic and as complicated as it is tempting , with theology , history , culture , society , territorial claims , commerce , ethnic and tribal affiliations mixing in a cocktail of fiery anger , aggression and turmoil against those powers that have tried to tame such a varied and mysterious land .
With the short - sighted machinations and the complete ignorance of the region of the last century ’s western European powers the fate of the modern day Middle East was sealed .
Like Africa , the Middle East we know today is one of artificiality , one that never before existed until the west imported the fictions of imaginary lines of division .
Western , colonial power exceptionalism , with its belief in Judeo - Christian superiority and its belief that it was civilizing the inferior , “ sub - human ” Arab and Muslim peoples , created imaginary borders out of thin air , as always in its ignorance and hubris and geopolitical self - interest , carving nations where none dared exist , and where none should ever have been birthed .
Dividing lands , sects , ethnicities , tribes and peoples based on colonial powers ’ interests and intentions was a mistake that condemned millions of people and resulted in a contemporary Middle East whose volatility , and importance to the world ’s powers , makes it a region of immense conflict and of potential danger to the world entire .
Colonial follies have led to the region ’s greatest animosities and injustices , together with its greatest crimes against humanity , fating millions to live inside a geopolitical puzzle carved by the hands of the west .
Failing to take into consideration tribal , sectarian , ethnic and cultural dynamics , or the realities of Islamic theological differences , or centuries - old territorial claims to land , or the longstanding resistance to foreign invasions and occupations , or the injustice of claiming and stealing the land of continuously native peoples , or the sensitivity of the Islamic faith to and resentment in foreign entities occupying lands deemed sacred and holy , European powers set in motion the inevitable clash between the rich north and the resource rich , geopolitically necessary Middle East .
Of course the indigenous peoples of these lands had their destinies , and that of their descendants , decided for them by yesteryear ’s colonizers .
Today ’s Crusade of Surge and Siege owes its genesis to Europe ’s indifference and ignorance , to its catastrophic errors .
In its short - sighted appetite for power , the long - term volatility of the region has been compromised .
Yet since only sub - human infidels would feel the consequences , the west continued adding fuel to the fire .
Claws of Control
When the volatile liquid of petroleum , together with that of natural gas , are included into the Middle East cauldron — a reality that escaped all previous powers exerting force in the region before the turn of the 20th century — what emerges is a geopolitical and geostrategic prize on a scale not seen by emerging Empires before .
Indeed , control of the region and of its resources — for oil , natural gas and water are today and will invariably be into the future of great strategic importance — will decide the fate of the present Empire , as well as those waiting in line to rise when America begins her decline , as she is presently doing .
It is in this region where the destiny of the modern world will be decided , and it is those who dwell there who will be forced to endure the grand chess match played between powerful competitors .
Control of the region , while signifying control of its resources , also means control of the spigot , of the pipelines feeding and fueling economies , of access to these same resources by other nations , as well as control of the waterways granting passage to tankers headed to all corners of the globe .
Control the Middle East ’s oil fields and you control the world .
Controlling the Middle East , especially having a firm grip on those lands where oil and gas abound , virtually guarantees that the Empire ’s oil and gas companies , today gorging on the profits that war , insecurity and control engender , will assume major investments in , and the enormous profits from , extracting , refining , transporting and selling the Middle East ’s resources .
It guarantees the continued plunder of the Middle East ’s oil by American energy giants .
Through control of resource - rich nations , the Empire ’s energy conglomerates are granted access to and possession of these precious and finite resources , such as oil and gas , that would otherwise escape their colossal grasp .
Such was the purpose of illegally and aggressively invading and occupying Iraq , where , years prior to invasion , the state and the industry unilaterally , and in secret , carved up Iraq ’s existing and potential oil fields .
This symbiotic relationship between the state and the corporate world , whereby the muscle and the power of the state are used to protect and further the interests of the energy industry , at great detriment to the people of the resource - rich nation , along with the knowledge , capital and resources of the industry being used to impregnate the Empire with cheap and abundant oil and gas , to the great benefit of its economy and hegemony , to the great detriment to all other potential rivals , is a classic example of corporatism , the fusion of state and profit .
The state thus secures for the energy industry those nations possessing large amounts of tapped and untapped oil reserves , only to later receive the benefits from conglomerates in the form of subsidized petroleum prices , control of oil and gas supplies , along with tax revenues from these companies and their products which , thanks to rising petroleum prices , further enhance the state ’s coffers and further enable a transfer of resources , in the form of paying exponentially higher prices at the pump , away from the pocketbooks of the American people and towards the corporate and establishment world .
With a government saturated with corporate executives , lawyers and lobbyists , many from the energy and defense industries , and a revolving door of opportunity between the halls of power and the halls of profit that never seems to stop and in fact only continues to gain momentum , it is easy to see why America ’s foreign policy in many ways mirrors the interests of the corporate world , especially those of the energy - industrial complex .
Thus , the Crusade of Surge and Siege is a reflection of a corporate world swarming the Middle East like vultures ready to feast on the spoils of war .
It is easy , too , to foresee where America will be focusing its muscle and its might in the near future , for one simply needs to follow the trail of black gold , the trail of greed and money .
As such , Central Asia , with its collection of despotic Stans , together with Iran , with its vast oil and gas fields , will most likely follow in the footsteps of Iraq — with her oil — and Afghanistan — with her strategic location and pipeline route — as the next targets of the Empire , whether militarily , through buying off of leaders or through market colonialism .
Already on the radar screen are the countries of Western Africa , with valuable proven and potential oil reserves , with nations such as Nigeria already feeling the strain of possessing the devil ’s excrement , already reeling both from western energy conglomerates meddling in the domestic affairs of these governments and through the pillage of their natural resources .
It is the people of these lands which are at present already feeling the effects of oil and its many vices and corruptions .
As usual , it is the native people inhabiting oil rich lands that will never see one drop from the massive profits oil creates .
The thirst and addiction for oil is also the reason Venezuela has become of such importance , for Hugo Chavez has become the exception , not the rule , to the Empire ’s demand that a nation ’s oil not be used for the good of the people .
He has not sold out his nation , and his people , to the dictates of the Empire .
With enormous reserves of proven oil , said to rival or even surpass those of Saudi Arabia , Venezuela is an obvious choice for American intervention , and will most likely become a victim of the Empire ’s hegemony before too long .
Its intransigence against the Empire ’s commands will not be tolerated much longer .
Its crime , indeed , Hugo Chavez ’s crime , which no oil - rich nation or leader is allowed to commit , is redistribute the nation ’s oil profits to its citizens and to the state ’s growing treasury .
Venezuela ’s crime , and why she is now a target of the Empire , is having the audacity to use its own resources for the betterment of the population , and the state itself .
What has made the Bolivarian state a pariah of the Empire , placed in the waiting line for the Empire ’s firing squad , is that it refused to comply or sacrifice its people to the demands of America .
Her great error , in the minds of the American establishment , was to destroy the cancer of neoliberal economics , the so - called Washington Consensus , the disaster of debauched capitalism and market colonialism .
For this indiscretion , together with its decision to keep oil revenues within the interests of the nation , instead of allowing American energy conglomerates to pillage oil and revenues , Venezuela is now a target of American hegemony .
The lessons to be learned from the harsh teachings of the Empire have been absorbed by the Middle East ’s kings and dictators .
The oil beneath your sand belongs to the Empire , not your people .
It belongs to America ’s energy - industrial complex .
You will sell your oil at the prices selected by the Empire , at the supplies it seeks , as always in American dollars .
You will increase or decrease supply as the Empire sees fit , as always to the benefit of America .
The spigot ultimately is under the control of the Empire and , if your oil supply is threatened by an enemy of the Empire , your nation will be invaded and occupied by America ’s legions .
You will be protected only because the Empire protects its lifeblood .
If you obey and remain loyal to the Empire , not your people , you will be rich beyond your wildest dreams , allowed to rule over your lands , allowed to remain a viable Middle East leader .
If you fail to learn the lessons of those who no longer rule , or those no longer alive , you will cease to rule , cease to exist and cease to be a friend .
You will be overthrown , replaced and forgotten .
From Mossadegh to Saddam , from Iran to Iraq , to question or challenge the Empire is to seek the wrath of blood and the full might of America ’s military .
To even think of nationalizing your oil , or of retaining its wealth for the benefit of your people will unleash shock and awe on your land .
These lessons have been memorized and incorporated , never to be broken , never to challenge the dictates of Empire and never to interfere with its unquenchable thirst for the devil ’s excrement .
Empire Unhinged
What is transpiring in the Middle East is , more than anything else , a symptom of a disease a long time in the making , of the natural tendencies of Empire to accumulate for itself the blood that grants it life and the oxygen that makes it grow .
Empires old and new have always sought to maintain and indeed expand their power , their hegemony , their standards of living , their “ way of life . ”
They never seek to reduce their influence or minimize their footprint on the world ; they can never lower the expectations of their population nor slow down the engine that has brought them to such power .
They almost always seek to expand their economies and their domain , always trying to increase growth .
As such , with sustainability being anathema to their chosen path , with Empires becoming victims of their own hubris and success , with greed and thirst for power consuming its elite , with comfort , laziness and gluttony possessing its people , the Empire , either willingly or forced , must stay on the present course and must retain and ratchet up the same machinations that have for decades assured supremacy .
Thus , caught in a vicious circle of its own making , the Empire must increase its power and domination and must continue its path of imperialism , of conquest and of pillage , all in order to satiate its people , its elite , its economy and its own power - induced , greed addicted ego .
Failure to maintain the ever - more difficult course of Empire would allow rivals the fresh air to grow and challenge , it would result in the growing unease of its people , and it would open the door for maturity and decline .
The Empire is akin to a massive corporation succeeding under a neoliberal capitalist model , where to survive and thrive , expansion and dictatorial power are the rule , not the exception , where return on investment is demanded , with expectations of profit and returns higher every year , with market share growth part of the formula , with success ultimately lying in the exploitation of worker and Earth , of the uncompromising , merciless crushing of competition , and the buying , or acquisition of , smaller potential rivals .
By placing high barriers to entry , by possessing unmatched capital and profit , by integrating vertically and horizontally , by accumulating the infrastructure , resources and relationships its challengers need to grow , by dominating the market through its sheer size and strength , and by securing the unilateral power of monopoly a corporation can maintain its dominance and power , thereby keeping potential rivals at bay , and its stockholders happy .
Failure to grow and expand exponentially usually means failure to survive , with investors fleeing what is perceived to be a sinking ship , and competition ready to cannibalize a dying company .
Without growth on an almost annual basis , decline is sure to follow .
Such is the reality of empire , much to the detriment of the empire itself , much to the detriment of humanity , and much to the detriment of Earth .
Empires continuously seek to maintain and grow , not slow down and shrink .
For this reason America will not slow down its imperial ambitions , just as it will only demand that its hegemony be allowed to expand .
It will seek to crush all competition , just as will try to grow at the expense of the rest of the world .
The Middle East , the breadbasket of the world ’s energy needs , is a region , and a prize , that no modern empire can be without , and thus , of paramount importance to those elite for whom imperialism and Empire is the next logical step in the evolution of America .
The pursuit , protection and control of Middle East oil and gas is the only logical answer to the question of why America has established permanence in the region , why she invaded and occupied Iraq and Afghanistan , why she seeks to impose her will on Iran , and why she supports , finances and helps maintain in power the cadre of puppet kings , princes , sheiks , generals and dictators that rule the nations of the region .
What is occurring today , and will continue to intensify well into the future , is the expropriation of the Middle East directly into American hands , with the Empire planting the seeds of hegemony and control over the region ’s vitally important natural resources , as well as its vitally important geostrategic terrain , for a permanent — or “ enduring ” in Orwellian speak — and unchallenged stay .
Every new military installation or base already or presently being built confirms to the thinking world , which excludes the American masses , that the United States seeks not only complete control of the Middle East , but the exclusion of all potential rivals .
Through its actions , America has let it be known that the Middle East is off limits to Russia and China , with Europe allowed inside the fringes , that it is the sole domain of the Empire , and that she will be in the region for as long as oil and gas flow freely from the inner organs of the Arab and Muslim underground .
The American flag has firmly been planted in the great majority of Middle East nations , with the Empire ’s military establishing permanent Crusader castles and garrisons and bases , in dozens of countries , to secure for the realm the spoils and rewards of the region .
At present , in the Middle East is where the lifeblood of the Empire lies , along with that of the industrialized world , where its energy for the foreseeable future is secured .
Naturally , then , it is this region , more than any other , that must be protected and defended and taken off the grand chessboard before emerging rivals rise and old challengers think themselves resurrected .
It is in the Middle East where a permanent footprint must be established , where the Empire must claim the divine right to plunder , rape , destroy and subjugate .
The great catastrophe of the Middle East will thus continue well into the future .
It is the black energy that lies below humanity ’s feet that propels the Empire and its people to unmatched wealth and power .
And so , in order to understand the Crusade of Surge and Siege , in order to give prominence inside the conscious mind of billions to the genocide inside Iraq , the crimes against humanity in Afghanistan and the human rights violations throughout the Middle East , we must come to an understanding that as long as petroleum fuels the human condition , as long as carbon - based engines and products dominate our civilization , wars and invasions and occupations and the oppression of entire peoples will continue unabated by today ’s present Empire , with its corresponding brutality and barbarity and violence and destruction and mass murder continuing to haunt us until either we put an end to our insatiable thirst for oil , or our insatiable thirst for oil puts an end to us .

Obama campaign claims " irregularities " in Louisiana
Per the campaign 's blog , under the headline : " After Widespread Reports of Voting Irregularities Obama Campaign Submits Urgent Request for Assistance : "
BATON ROUGE , LA --
The Obama campaign submitted an urgent request for assistance to the Secretary of State ’s Division of Elections today , after receiving widespread reports from Democrats across Louisiana who reported that they were not allowed to vote because their party affiliation had been switched .
Hundreds of Louisiana democrats went to the polls to vote in today ’s presidential primary and found that they were now on registration lists as Independent or Unaffiliated voters .
Obama faced a similar hurdle in California , where some poll workers appear to have misinformed independents seeking to vote in the Democratic primary .
Choosing to go public with complaints , though , is always a political as well as a practical move , and it may increase the sense among some Obama supporters of Clinton dirty tricks -- something the Obama campaign is n't alleging in either case .
This primary , with its huge turnout and surging independent cadre , is really straining very creaky elections systems around the country .
Dell claims that organizations doling out domain names have deployed a network of shell businesses that profit from fat - fingered people who make typos while entering URLs .
The company 's federal suit , filed in October with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida , names three registrars -- BelgiumDomains , CapitolDomains , and DomainDoorman -- and claims they have set up a string of Caribbean - based shell corporations that gain rights to typo domain names and take in the pay - per- click revenues , according to The Washington Post .
People making the typing errors wind up on sites crammed with advertising , and the advertisers pay the shell companies for the hits , according to the Post 's account of the lawsuit .
Because the typo sites ' names are similar to those of legitimate , trademarked Dell sites , Dell claims the dummy corporations are illegally profiting from the company 's assets .
Not only did the accused businesses engage in this typo - squatting , they managed to dodge paying anything for the typo URLs , the suit says .
They would sign up a URL , use it on a free trial for five days and return it .
Then another of the dozen or so shell companies would immediately scoop it up for another free trial .
By passing URLs around among themselves , the companies could avoid paying anything , at least until they decided whether it was worth the US $ 6 it costs to register the name for a full year .
Dell 's attorney claims the accused companies sampled 30 million to 60 million sites per month , paying for a full year 's rights for 50,000 to 200,000 of them , according to the Post story .
If found guilty , the companies could be fined $ 1,000 to $ 100,000 per infringed domain name under federal cybersquatting laws .
Dell is trying an unproved tactic : charging the defendant companies with counterfeiting .
If that sticks , the potential penalties soar to $ 1 million per infraction , the Post says .
This story , " Dell Sues Alleged Cybersquatters " was originally published by Network World .
Obama and Clinton both did well , once again , in their debate in Ohio on MSNBC tonight .
As Obama indicated at the end , and has said before , both are far , far better than what the Republicans are offering with John McCain .
What seemed to most distinguish Clinton from Obama tonight was also , once again , Clinton 's occasional aggressiveness and one round of outright whining , in contrast to Obama 's calm grace .
This is something he first showed last week , and I thought then and now that it feels Presidential .
He seems to be wearing the potential coat of the highest office very well .
Hillary Clinton 's carping came early in the debate , when she complained to moderators Brian Williams and Tim Russert that she 's always asked questions first in the debates !
This is supposed to be Presidential ?
What a petty point .
I have to admit that I always like speaking first in public events , but , even if I did not , I would hardly complain about it in a national debate .
And she topped it off with an awkward reference to Saturday Night Live 's skit this past Saturday about the Clinton - Obama debate in Texas , in which the moderators were satirized as obsessively worrying about Obama 's every need .
Clinton 's " joke " about this tonight , if that what it was , might have worked at a campaign rally .
But , again , it fell flat in this debate .
Clinton also confronted Obama on several issues - most interestingly , I thought , on his response to the Rev. Louis Farrakhan support of Obama , given that Farrakhan is a raving anti-Semite .
Obama said he " denounces " Farrakhan .
Clinton pressed him on why does n't outrightly " reject " Farrakhan 's support .
Obama 's response was very telling : he said he did n't see any real difference between denunciation and rejection , but just so there would be no lack of clarity , he rejected Farrakhan 's support .
Everyman , along with other types of polyphasic sleep , has accumulated quite a body of information since this article was written .
I myself have been on the Everyman 3 schedule for over four years now .
Updated details , instructions , and even a book discussing polyphasic sleep adaptation can all be found at http://www.puredoxyk.com.
Everyman is another type of polyphasic sleep schedule that grew out of the experiments I first wrote about in 2000 under Uberman 's Sleep Schedule .
As of this writing -- January 2007 -- I have been living on the Everyman Sleep Schedule for approximately six months .
How the Everyman Schedule was born
The " Uberman " schedule , which was the first polyphasic schedule I experimented with , is very cool , but also really hard to adjust to .
A very small percentage of the people who try it make it through the first week , and not even half of those go on to succeed for a month , which is the time required by the mind and body to really adjust .
Not that you can blame them :
Not only is the sleep deprivation utterly crushing for the first couple days of Uberman - adjustment , but maintaining the schedule requires the kind of anal - retentivity that you usually only see in damaged people ( like Lex Luthor or Dr. Doom ) .
Naps must be taken every four hours on the dot ; small deviations become possible only after at least a solid month of perfect or darn - near - perfect adherence to the schedule .
So even assuming the subject is crazy enough to adjust to the schedule and iron - willed enough to stay on it , for many people it simply is n't possible .
Lifestyle can really throw a monkey - wrench in the process , no matter how dedicated the sleeper wants to be :
No amount of iron will can compensate for a hectic work - schedule , or kids , etc .
Right about the time I was experimenting to determine the validity of the above sentence , people began howling at me about how unfair it was that only hermits and supervillians could ever have both the character and the kind of life - schedule that accomodated the Uberman schedule .
After finding out myself , the really hard way , that no amount of sheer guts could maintain the Uberman schedule in the face of work / kids / etc. , I realized that I shared their pain : I deeply missed my polyphasic schedule , but it seemed that now that I was a " grown - up " , I could n't have it back !
Crushing .
Then someone -- I do n't remember who was first -- suggested that maybe another type of schedule would work .
Perhaps Uberman could be modified to make it more flexible .
The " Core Nap "
The modification that makes Everyman what it is is the addition of a " core nap " -- a longer nap that occurs regularly somewhere in the 24 - hour cycle .
The core nap is much less sleep than a monophasic person gets at night -- usually no more than 3 hours , though I 've heard of 4 and 5 being used for short periods -- and is supplemented by a corresponding number of 20 - minute naps throughout the day .
Please note that not every combination of naps and core - nap seems viable .
Of the ones that have been tested , the most successful combinations seem to be 3 hours core + 3 naps ( the one I 'm using ) , and 1.5 hour core + 4 - 5 naps .
While this seems to suggest a pattern , anything shorter than a 1.5 - hour core might as well be just another 20 - minute nap ( and you 'd be doing Uberman ) ; and more than 3 hours ' core might as well be siesta - sleep , which involves a short night 's sleep and a single afternoon nap .
So for now and until somebody proves otherwise , those two schedules above are what we generally mean by Everyman .
My experiments with the Everyman schedule , which have now been going on for nearly six months ( as of Jan. 2007 ) , showed an interesting effect :
The longer the core nap , the more flexibility one gains in the nap - times .
Obviously individual results vary a bit , but in my case , a 3 - hour core nap ( 1 - 4 a.m. ) means I can take three 20 - minute naps throughout the day and feel great , plus my naptimes can be shifted by as much as an hour in either direction .
So I can nap at 9 , 2 , and 9 ( which is what I aim for ) , or 8 , 1 , and 9 ; or 9:30 , 3 , and 8:30 ...etc .
This provides that crucial ability to work around meetings , sick kids , traffic jams , and all the " etcetera " that made sticking to Uberman so impossible .
Other differences from Uberman
The addition of the core naps causes some other differences from the Uberman schedule as well .
Really , Everyman and Uberman are more than just two schedules ; they 're two different classes of polyphasic schedule , technically referred to as " equiphasic " ( all naps equal ) and " nonequiphasic " ( duh ) .
Whether you 're using Uberman ( or Dymaxion , another equiphasic , naps - only schedule named by Buckminster Fuller ) or either / any variety of Everyman , the following differences remain fairly solid .
One major difference is the adjustment process .
As you might expect , the sleep - deprivation involved in adjusting to an Everyman schedule is not as bad as it is for Uberman , though it can still be tricky for a day or two .
Significantly , though , to fully adjust to Everyman takes quite a bit longer than it does to adjust to Uberman , so one can expect to be using alarms and carefully monitoring one 's sleep for several months rather than a couple weeks .
Uberman , being more severe and more extreme , becomes habit a lot quicker once you get the hang of it ; and you get the hang of it faster , because it 's more " do or die " for your body .
Everyman does n't cause the kind of sleep dep that forces a full adjustment in a matter of days , so it 's something you have to get more gradually used to .
Having done both , I can honestly say that it's a pretty even toss - up , being horrifically sleep - deprived for a week and vigilant for another week or two , versus being quite sleep - deprived for a few days and vigilant for at least a month .
They 're both pretty annoying ... but I would also say they 're both completely worth it .
( Of course I would ! )
Another big difference is the psychological impact .
Uberman 's is very profound .
You 've eradicated " sleeping at night " completely .
After a while you 'll lose track of the days completely if you do n't take additional measures .
Days will stretch reeeeealllly long , which can be very cool or quite intolerable , depending on your lifestyle .
With Everyman , however , you 're still getting a chunk of sleep with which to divide the days in your mind , so you probably wo n't lose track ( or not very often , anyway ) .
The days seem long on Everyman ( long enough to get dangerously bored if you do n't really need / use the extra time ) , but not endless ( like they can / do on Uberman ) .
In both cases , you 'll get used to living outside the normal schedule after a couple months , but even once you 're used to it , it can feel a little eerie -- like being a vampire .
There can be social effects accompanying both schedules , that range from a mild reputation for weirdness to full - on rewrite of your social life , depending on what it was like before .
As with the psychological effects , the social changes are usually more profound with Uberman than Everyman .
( For my part , being both a late - nighter and an early - riser has made me a bit of a conversation piece at work and on a few social occasions , but it 's not much of a big deal , since it's not unheard of for some people to only need three hours ' sleep , period .
Now , when I " never slept " , I often felt like a circus freak and sometimes went to great lengths to hide it . )
Also , myself and every other successful adopter of Uberman I 've read or spoken to has reported impressive effects on consciousness -- increased awareness / energy , sharpened senses , a feeling that the whole world is moving in slow motion and you 're not , so you have all the time in the world for everything , even small things like catching a ball .
My friend and I , when we first did the experiment , could n't get over how awesome this was , and while the effect was less noticeable after 3 or 4 months , it was there right up until I quit .
On Everyman , you get something of the same effect , but much less so .
The feeling of being superhuman that caused us to name the Uberman schedule what we did is more muted and practical on Everyman -- you 're gaining about four hours onto your day , but you do n't feel as though you 've " beaten sleep " or transcended it .
The altered - consciousness part is pretty much invisible ; I 've felt a flicker of it here and there , but nothing like before .
They 're the same in a few ways , too -- the ways that characterize polyphasic sleep , as I know it .
Both require strict dedication in the beginning to adjust to .
Both require that you do n't mind people thinking you 're a weirdo !
Both will cause a shift in your psyhological perception of time , which is probably more inherent to your mental state than you 'll realize before you go messing with it . ;)
Both are also apparently safe , physically speaking --
Other people have seen doctors while doing Uberman / Dymaxion schedules , and I 've had regular checkups while doing Everyman , and we 're all fine .
Both types of schedule will NOT result in being " tired all the time " once you 're fully adjusted , though as I mentioned , full adjustment takes longer with Everyman -- for a while you 'll still get yawny at night , but it 's only aggravating for the first 2 - 3 weeks in my experience .
Oh , and both schedules can be lifesavers for people who just do n't have enough hours in the day !
The Normative Analysis
Having done each schedule for about six months now , I would have to call them a tie .
They both have benefits , and both have detriments against each other ( the purpose of this writeup is n't really to judge polyphasic vs. monophasic schedules , so I 'll comment on that later ) .
Probably the biggest benefit of Everyman is its accessibility .
Out of the people who want to sleep polyphasically , only about 2 % of them seem to be suited for the Uberman schedule , in lifestyle and disposition .
Probably about another 25 - 30 % seem to be compatible with the Everyman schedule , and I 've seen quite a few people besides myself benefit from it .
( For my part , I do n't know how I 'd live without it .
My hectic schedule would leave me no room to relax or pursue my hobbies without the extra time Everyman gives me , and I 'd probably go insane . )
I 'll end this writeup on polyphasic sleep the same way I always end things I write about this topic :
With the plea that polyphasic sleeping desperately needs more attention from scientists , who can conduct long - term and controlled research studies .
I and others have provided enough testimonial evidence , I think , to show that the projects would be worthwhile .
( I also have issued an open invitation for people who'd like to use me or my data in experimental research , and I 'm not alone in that either . )
I hope to have my book on the subject done by the end of this summer , with all the details I can muster about the hows , whys , and wherefores of polyphasic sleeping , all wrapped up in an enticing package of pay - attention - to - me that hopefully will drive scientific interest by better informing the public .
So you think Dilbert is everywhere already ?
Think again , my pointy - headed friends , for Dilbert is about to become as common online as the winter cold is in a kindergarten class , thanks to a free widget from comic creator Scott Adams that 's certain to prove irresistible to legions of bloggers and site operators .
( 2012 ’s 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
From The Dilbert Blog yesterday : " To underscore your special status as readers of The Dilbert Blog , here 's a sneak peak at the totally free and ridiculously awesome Dilbert Widget .
You can't see this anywhere else until the end of the month . "
Actually , you can see the widget on plenty of other blogs already - and presumably countless more by day 's end - which is the whole idea .
More from Adams : " The Dilbert Widget allows you to see the daily Dilbert comic , for free , and in color for the first time , on your own page .
You can also see the Dilbert archive all the way back to January 2005 , with the entire archive coming online in batches .
All free , which is your favorite price . "
Free is n't a business model in and of itself , of course , a reality with which Adams and other content creators are fully and painfully aware .
I sent Adams a couple of questions regarding the business strategy behind his widget giveaway ( and Adams is much better at answering his e-mail than , than say , Google , so we may actually get answers . ) ... ( Update : Here 's his reply . )
Adams writes that he is hoping to gather feedback from early adopters regarding the widget 's design , as well as the ease with which it can be integrated and shared .
The early returns are wildly positive , although not universally so regarding the current panel - by - panel format .
" I 'm not sure if this is just something that applies to me , but I find reading the strips like this very awkward and weird , " writes one reader of The Dilbert blog .
" Having to wait or click to see the next panel seems to ' hammer home ' the lines of dialogue , like having someone read a comic to you .
...
When I read it this way I feel like there should be a canned laugh track over the top . "
Adams says a version of the widget with a full - strip view is in the works .
Among those who 've already incorporated the widget into their blogs , the glowing reviews offer a glimpse of the interest that is likely to follow .
" Being a huge Dilbert fan ... I did n't hesitate a second when he offered the possibility to install a Dilbert widget , " writes one blogger .
Another has been converted into a widget guy .
" I 've been reluctant to add widgets , because I think they slow down the loading of the site and I have n't seen the value in most of them , " he writes .
" I 'm experimenting with the Dilbert Widget , though , because it resonates with me . "
There were bound to be hiccups .
This blogger reported that the widget was providing a glimpse into Dilbertian future , as upcoming comics were visible along with those already published .
" I imagine they 'll solve this problem pretty quickly when they find out , " he writes .
They did .
There 's buzz .
" This dude is smart , " offers one early adopter .
" There are varying sizes for the widget depending on where you want to embed it .
So pop over to the site , find a size that suits you , as we know one size does not fit all and bigger is not always better , and spread the Dilbert word now . "
And , appropriately enough , humor .
" Adding this widget to the blog is the second best thing I 've done today , " says this guy .
" The first one , obviously , is taking a bath . "
So go ahead and check out the Dilbert widget ... provided you 've already bathed .
( Update : Mississippi Mountain Man reports having widget trouble . )
The former CEO of the leading supplier of body armor to U.S. soldiers in Iraq was charged yesterday with looting the company to bankroll a lavish lifestyle that included a $ 10 million bat mitzvah for his daughter .
In addition to the bat mitzvah – which included performances by Aerosmith , 50 Cent , Tom Petty , Kenny G and the Eagles – prosecutors said David Brooks got the firm , DHB Industries , to pay for other goodies .
Among them were a face lift for his ex-wife ; vitamins for his stable of 100 horses ; pricey vacations ; fancy jewels ; an armored car ; a $ 194,000 Bentley ; and a $ 100,000 diamond - studded belt buckle .
The elaborate scheme exploded yesterday when federal prosecutors unsealed a 21 - count indictment accusing Brooks , 53 , of securities fraud , insider trading , tax evasion and obstruction of justice .
If convicted , he could spend the rest of his life behind bars .
Sandra Hatfield , 54 , the company ’s former chief operating officer , was hit with similar charges .
Brooks founded DHB , which moved from Westbury , L.I. , to Pompano Beach , Fla. , last year , and served as its chairman and chief executive officer .
He resigned last year as the scandal erupted .
According to the indictment , Brooks lined his pockets by having DHB underwrite his lifestyle and by artificially inflating the value of company stock .
He allegedly reaped $ 185 million by selling DHB stock when he learned that 6,000 bullet - proof vests the company made were about to be recalled for being faulty and not able to block bullets .
Hatfield , who left the firm in 2005 , allegedly made $ 5 million in the scheme .
Brooks also was accused of evading taxes by giving money to charities he ran .
Brooks made headlines in November 2005 , when he rented two floors of the Rainbow Room for the bat mitzvah of his daughter , Elizabeth .
He reportedly sent the company jet to fly Aerosmith in from Pittsburgh , paying them a cool $ 1 million .
In return , they let his nephew play drums .
In honor of the band ’s appearance , Brooks changed from a black leather suit into a magenta suede biker outfit covered with chains .
The indictment said the body - armor tycoon spent $ 122,000 of company cash on iPods and digital cameras for his guests .
It also revealed he shelled out $ 20,000 for leather - bound invitations to his son ’s bar mitzvah in 2000 .
Brooks pleaded not guilty at his arraignment in federal court in Central Islip , L.I. , and was held without bail pending a hearing Monday .
His lawyer , Paul Shechtman , said Brooks “ grew up in Brooklyn and that means he does n’t run away from a fight . ”
Shechtman asked for bail of a mere $ 50 million .
Prosecutor John Martin asked that no bail be granted , calling Brooks a serious flight risk .
“ In my opinion , he will spend the rest of his life in jail , ” the prosecutor said .
“ Every couple of months , we uncover new crimes and new frauds he has committed . ”
Hatfield is expected to be arraigned next week .
The indictment accuses Brooks and Hatfield of falsely inflating the value of the inventory of DHB ’s top product , the Interceptor vest , to help meet earnings projections .

So , Google does n't like other people hijacking their web pages , but it 's more than happy to hijack someone else's .
On December 8 , the ever sneaky Canadian cable and telcom giant Rogers Communications was caught inserting Rogers - centric messages onto third party web sites .
Since Rogers 's high - speed internet service is co-branded with Yahoo ! , this included bastardizing Google 's home page with the logo of its biggest rival .
Google soon told the world it was really peeved .
" We are concerned about these reports .
As a general principle , we believe that maintaining the Internet as a neutral platform means that carriers should n't be able to interfere with web content without users ' permission , " the world 's largest search engine said .
Then , just days later , Google released a new version of its browser toolbar designed to hijack 404 error pages .
No one noticed at the time , but word quickly spread yesterday after a shout - out from a blog known as Seoker.com .
As Google put it , when you use its new toolbar , " You ’ll get suggestions instead of error pages :
If you mistype a URL or a page is down , now the Toolbar will give you that familiar ' Did you mean ' with alternatives , like when you do a Google search . "
In other words , if you key in a web address and the server you 're visiting can't find that address , the toolbar will , in many cases , ignore the 404 error page returned by the server , displaying one supplied by Google instead .
This Googlicious error page will give you alternative urls , but it also includes a Googlicious logo and a Googlicious search box .
Plus , as Seoker.com points out , the search box is pre-packed with words from the url you keyed in .
So Google has yet another means of tracking your behavior .
Of course , Google does n't see the irony here .
With his own blog post , Google search guru Matt Cutts said that if toolbar users and webmasters do n't like this , they can do something about it .
Cutts argues that toolbar users can easily turn off this " feature " - or remove the toolbar .
And he points out that even when the " feature " is turned on , the toolbar only displays Google 's 404 error page if the server 's page is less than 512 bytes .
If it 's less than 512 bytes , Google says , the server must be using the default error message .
" So if you ’re a webmaster and want users to see your custom 404 page , just make your page be more than 512 bytes long , " Cutts says .
He also goes to great lengths trying to show that this " feature " is darn useful .
But he fails to point out that most users and webmasters are completely unaware all this is going on - and will remain completely unaware .
To us , this sounds an awful lot like Verizon and VeriSign nabbing mistyped urls and other DNS wildcards .
Only it 's worse .
In this case , Google is hijacking your web browser even though you 're trying to visit a valid domain .
It 's grabbing land that belongs to someone else .
Just like Rogers . ®
To the average Heathrow traveller , it must have looked like just one of those inexplicable minor commotions that occur sometimes in the world 's busiest airports .
An El Al flight was standing on the runway , with some passengers still inside .
Telephone calls were being made .
Messages were passed to and fro .
After two hours , the plane took off .
No visible drama .
We now know that the story could have turned out very differently .
Inside the plane was a senior Israeli army officer , Doron Almog , veteran of some of the most celebrated military operations in the troubled history of the Middle East .
There were also armed Israeli sharpshooters .
Outside were officers of the Metropolitan Police , acting reluctantly on an arrest warrant served by a judge at the request of lawyers who wanted to launch a private prosecution against the general .

The question that can never be answered is what would have happened if the police had marched on to the plane to seize the general and haul him before the courts .
Possibly , he would have come quietly , and a lot of lawyers would have been kept very busy as the courts weighed what to do next .
A much more sinister possibility is that the Israeli agents on board would have refused to let the general be arrested without putting up resistance .
At best , that would have meant an ugly stand off followed by a major diplomatic row .
At worst , it could have led to dead bodies aboard the plane .
But now , the police and the Government face some awkward questions , of which the most interesting is who warned the Israelis that there was trouble brewing at Heathrow ?
Maj - Gen Almog had planned to visit the UK in September 2005 to pay various social and charitable calls on Jewish communities in Solihull , the West Midlands , and Manchester .
As his plane touched down at Heathrow , a call from the Israeli embassy in London warned him that police were waiting to arrest him .
The general and his wife refused to leave the plane .
Two tense hours elapsed , while Det - Supt John MacBrayne , a senior counter - terrorism officer in charge of the operation , agonised over what to do .
One of his problems , according to documents that have come to light , which were passed to the Independent Police Complaints Commission , was that he was unsure of the legal position .
He contacted Scotland Yard for advice on whether he had the authority to order his men aboard the El Al aircraft , when it was clear the airline was not going to give consent .
According to the official log : " He was informed that police did indeed board aircraft routinely but it was not clear if this could be done without the consent of the carrier .
It was confirmed that El Al were refusing voluntary access to the plane and Det - Supt MacBrayne could not get confirmation that he had a legal right to do so . "
But the log also shows that Supt MacBrayne had a problem .
As an experienced anti-terrorist officer he knew that El Al aircraft are the most heavily guarded vehicles in the world .
The seats on its aircraft are never filled only by ordinary fare - paying passengers .
There are always at least a couple of men who are highly trained , heavily armed " air marshals " .
With a famous major - general on board , there might have been four or five air marshals .
These are not people that any police officer would want to mess with .
" DSU MacBrayne took the considered opinion that , as access to the plane would not be consensual , there existed a real threat of an armed confrontation , " the log recorded .

Having consulted Commander John McDowall , deputy national co-ordinator of terrorist investigations , the Superintendent decided to allow the plane to go on its way with his quarry still aboard .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission has vindicated the police who conducted the operation .
But that leaves two big questions unanswered – who tipped off the Israelis , and why did the Met seem to think they did not have the power to board an aircraft on British soil ?
The legal position , which seemed to have the Met stumped , was actually straightforward , according to several legal experts who were asked their opinion yesterday .
A foreign aircraft is not sovereign territory , and while it is on British soil it is subject to British laws .
Even the threat of a shoot - out should not have prevented the police from enforcing the law , Kate Maynard , of the solicitors ' firm , Hickman Rose insisted .
" Who knows what might have happened ? " she said .
" It need not have been an armed stand off .
They could have stopped the plane from taking off , and brought in negotiators from the Foreign Office .
Can you allow people from other countries to put the police in a situation where they can't enforce British law ? "
The Anti-Terrorist Branch had been reluctant all along to take any action against the general .
They acted only under pressure from Hickman Rose , who represents Palestinian clients , including the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights .
The lawyers themselves are not Palestinian .
Several are Jews , and of those , Daniel Machover is an Israeli citizen – facts that have played big in the Israeli media .
Mr Machover has been accused by Israel 's most popular newspaper , Yedioth Ahronoth , of committing " a travesty masquerading as righteousness , exonerating terror - masters from blame but painting those who fight mass murderers as villains " .
One of the firm 's clients is Abdul Matar , the former inhabitant of one of 59 homes in a Palestinian camp that were bulldozed by the Israelis in 2002 in retaliation for attacks on Israeli soldiers .
Another is Ra-ed Mattar , whose wife and daughter were killed when the Israelis dropped a powerful bomb in a crowded part of Gaza in July 2002 , killing Sheikh Saleh Shehadeh , a leading Palestinian militant .
The bomb killed 14 others including nine children .
Under pressure from the lawyers , the Anti-Terrorist Squad agreed that they would detain the general if he set foot on British soil , and would consider serving him with a warrant , but it would be up to the solicitors to bring a private prosecution .
They intended to rely on a 50 - year - old act of Parliament , the Geneva Conventions Act , which enshrined the Geneva Convention in British law .
No one has ever been prosecuted under that Act .
The Anti-Terrorist Squad was also feeling discreet pressure from the Government to leave the general alone .
Supt MacBrayne had had a note from a minister at the Foreign Office – whose name is not revealed in the log – who claimed that there was " little or no evidence " on which to launch a prosecution .
Mr MacBrayne felt obliged to contact the Foreign Office and point out this was not true .
Hickman Rose had in fact produced evidence that satisfied a magistrate that there was a case for the general to answer at least in relation to the bulldozing of those 59 homes .
It also believed it could substantiate three other criminal charges against him .
He is not the only senior Israeli in its sights .
Just over a year ago , the Israeli army 's former chief of staff , Moshe Ya'alon , was arrested in New Zealand , after Hickman Rose took out a private case against him over the assassination of Sheikh Shehadeh .
The case was ruled out by New Zealand 's attorney general .
When Tony Blair met Israel 's Internal Security Minister , Avi Dichter , last August , in his new role as Middle East peace envoy , he was dumbfounded to learn that Mr Dichter dare not visit the UK , where he too would risk being arrested over the Shehadeh killing .
Two others , the Chief of Staff Dan Halutz and a former commander of the Gaza division , Aviv Kochavi , are also keeping away from the UK , for the same reason .
Doron Almog has been a well - known public figure in Israel since 1993 , when he was appointed commander of the occupation forces in the Gaza Strip .
By then , he had already had a colourful military career .
When he was 22 , he led a paratrooper unit into action in the Yom Kippur War .
Three years later , in July 1976 , he was one of the Israeli commandos who descended suddenly on Entebbe airport , in Uganda , where over 100 crew and passengers of an airbus were being held hostage by Palestinian hijackers .
When the shooting stopped , all six hijackers , one commando , three hostages and 45 Ugandan soldiers were dead .
In December 1993 , Mr Almog stunned Israel by sensationally announcing that he had met members of Hamas , the militant organisation that is now the elected government of Gaza .
Even now , most governments in the world , including the UK , refuse to recognise the Hamas administration , because Hamas will not recognise the state of Israel .
Mr Almog made two seemingly contradictory claims : first that he knew Hamas was preparing to send suicide bombers against Israel , secondly that there was a moderate faction within Hamas with whom Israel could do business .
He claimed its hostility to the PLO exceeded its hostility to Israel .
Hamas claimed the meeting had never taken place .
Mr Almog has attracted international attention for his role as head of Israel 's Southern Command from 2000 to mid 2003 , when he was in charge of operations in Gaza , and presided over the demolition of an estimated 1,100 Palestinian homes .
Before his planned UK visit , in September 2005 , the police had also been warned that arresting a prominent Israeli might trigger a reaction among British Jews .
Their original plan had been to detain General Almog in Solihull , where he was scheduled to speak in the synagogue , but they were warned that that would be inflammatory .
To lessen the tension , they decided a uniformed officer would be the one to make the arrest at Heathrow .
Even so , the advice from the Met 's National Community Tensions Team was that " this matter was of national significance to the Jewish community ... any police action could significantly impact on community confidence in the police . "
After the botched arrest , Mr MacBrayne checked with the West Midlands police and the Jewish community and reported that " there had been no local Jewish community issues . "
But the Israeli government was enraged that one of its military heroes should be made so unwelcome in the UK , though it was mollified by an apology from the Foreign Secretary , Jack Straw .
That apology has attracted derision from lawyers .
" He apologised for a judicial process , " Mr Maynard said .
" This case was not a stunt ; it was an effort to bring Almog to justice in a place where he would have a fair trial , because he has complete immunity in Israel .
To have it thwarted , and then to have an apology , is incredible . "
That being the British Government 's attitude , perhaps it is not surprising that somebody , somewhere , took it upon themselves to warn the Israelis that it would save both countries a serious embarrassment if Maj - Gen Almog did not alight from that plane .
People make bad decisions , but they make them in systematic ways .
SEYMOUR CHWAST
A couple of months ago , I went on - line to order a book .
The book had a list price of twenty - four dollars ; Amazon was offering it for eighteen .
I clicked to add it to my “ shopping cart ” and a message popped up on the screen .
“ Wait ! ” it admonished me .
“ Add $ 7.00 to your order to qualify for FREE Super Saver Shipping ! ” I was ordering the book for work ; still , I hesitated .
I thought about whether there were other books that I might need , or want .
I could n’t think of any , so I got up from my desk , went into the living room , and asked my nine - year - old twins .
They wanted a Tintin book .
Since they already own a large stack of Tintins , it was hard to find one that they did n’t have .
They scrolled through the possibilities .
After much discussion , they picked a three - in - one volume containing two adventures they had previously read .
I clicked it into the shopping cart and checked out .
By the time I was done , I had saved The New Yorker $ 3.99 in shipping charges .
Meanwhile , I had cost myself $ 12.91 .
Why do people do things like this ?
From the perspective of neoclassical economics , self - punishing decisions are difficult to explain .
Rational calculators are supposed to consider their options , then pick the one that maximizes the benefit to them .
Yet actual economic life , as opposed to the theoretical version , is full of miscalculations , from the gallon jar of mayonnaise purchased at spectacular savings to the billions of dollars Americans will spend this year to service their credit - card debt .
The real mystery , it could be argued , is n’t why we make so many poor economic choices but why we persist in accepting economic theory .
In “ Predictably Irrational : The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions ” ( Harper ; $ 25.95 ) , Dan Ariely , a professor at M.I.T. , offers a taxonomy of financial folly .
His approach is empirical rather than historical or theoretical .
In pursuit of his research , Ariely has served beer laced with vinegar , left plates full of dollar bills in dorm refrigerators , and asked undergraduates to fill out surveys while masturbating .
He claims that his experiments , and others like them , reveal the underlying logic to our illogic .
“ Our irrational behaviors are neither random nor senseless — they are systematic , ” he writes .
“ We all make the same types of mistakes over and over . ”
So attached are we to certain kinds of errors , he contends , that we are incapable even of recognizing them as errors .
Offered FREE shipping , we take it , even when it costs us .
As an academic discipline , Ariely ’s field — behavioral economics — is roughly twenty - five years old .
It emerged largely in response to work done in the nineteen - seventies by the Israeli - American psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman .
( Ariely , too , grew up in Israel . )
When they examined how people deal with uncertainty , Tversky and Kahneman found that there were consistent biases to the responses , and that these biases could be traced to mental shortcuts , or what they called “ heuristics . ”
Some of these heuristics were pretty obvious — people tend to make inferences from their own experiences , so if they ’ve recently seen a traffic accident they will overestimate the danger of dying in a car crash — but others were more surprising , even downright wacky .
For instance , Tversky and Kahneman asked subjects to estimate what proportion of African nations were members of the United Nations .
They discovered that they could influence the subjects ’ responses by spinning a wheel of fortune in front of them to generate a random number : when a big number turned up , the estimates suddenly swelled .
Though Tversky and Kahneman ’s research had no direct bearing on economics , its implications for the field were disruptive .
Can you really regard people as rational calculators if their decisions are influenced by random numbers ?
( In 2002 , Kahneman was awarded a Nobel Prize — Tversky had died in 1996 — for having “ integrated insights from psychology into economics , thereby laying the foundation for a new field of research . ” )
Over the years , Tversky and Kahneman ’s initial discoveries have been confirmed and extended in dozens of experiments .
In one example , Ariely and a colleague asked students at M.I.T. ’s Sloan School of Management to write the last two digits of their Social Security number at the top of a piece of paper .
They then told the students to record , on the same paper , whether they would be willing to pay that many dollars for a fancy bottle of wine , a not - so - fancy bottle of wine , a book , or a box of chocolates .
Finally , the students were told to write down the maximum figure they would be willing to spend for each item .
Once they had finished , Ariely asked them whether they thought that their Social Security numbers had had any influence on their bids .
The students dismissed this idea , but when Ariely tabulated the results he found that they were kidding themselves .
The students whose Social Security number ended with the lowest figures — 00 to 19 — were the lowest bidders .
For all the items combined , they were willing to offer , on average , sixty - seven dollars .
The students in the second - lowest group — 20 to 39 — were somewhat more free - spending , offering , on average , a hundred and two dollars .
The pattern continued up to the highest group — 80 to 99 — whose members were willing to spend an average of a hundred and ninety - eight dollars , or three times as much as those in the lowest group , for the same items .
This effect is called “ anchoring , ” and , as Ariely points out , it punches a pretty big hole in microeconomics .
When you walk into Starbucks , the prices on the board are supposed to have been determined by the supply of , say , Double Chocolaty Frappuccinos , on the one hand , and the demand for them , on the other .
But what if the numbers on the board are influencing your sense of what a Double Chocolaty Frappuccino is worth ?
In that case , price is not being determined by the interplay of supply and demand ; price is , in a sense , determining itself .
Another challenge to standard economic thinking arises from what has become known as the “ endowment effect . ”
To probe this effect , Ariely , who earned one of his two Ph.D.s at Duke , exploited the school ’s passion for basketball .
Blue Devils fans who had just won tickets to a big game through a lottery were asked the minimum amount that they would accept in exchange for them .
Fans who had failed to win tickets through the same lottery were asked the maximum amount that they would be willing to offer for them .
“ From a rational perspective , both the ticket holders and the non-ticket holders should have thought of the game in exactly the same way , ” Ariely observes .
Thus , one might have expected that there would be opportunities for some of the lucky and some of the unlucky to strike deals .
But whether or not a lottery entrant had been “ endowed ” with a ticket turned out to powerfully affect his or her sense of its value .
One of the winners Ariely contacted , identified only as Joseph , said that he would n’t sell his ticket for any price .
“ Everyone has a price , ” Ariely claims to have told him .
O.K. , Joseph responded , how about three grand ?
On average , the amount that winners were willing to accept for their tickets was twenty - four hundred dollars .
On average , the amount that losers were willing to offer was only a hundred and seventy - five dollars .
Out of a hundred fans , Ariely reports , not a single ticket holder would sell for a price that a non -ticket holder would pay .
The essential technology America ’s space - shuttle astronauts depend on , which almost no one outside NASA knows about , is paper .
Not just a file folder of vital checklists but actual piles of paper–stacks and stacks of it .
Every minute of flight , every experiment , every space walk , is scripted .
The routines are rehearsed in advance , manuals in laps , over and over .
The loose - leaf sheets –called FDFs , or flight data files–are organized into functional sets , held together with three metal rings .

When the day comes to pull on the orange go - to - space suits , the paper goes too– 250 pounds of it .
Astronauts , strapped in for launch , have critical FDFs Velcroed to their legs for easy access .
When you ’re hurling a 30 - year - old spaceship into orbit , some things are not going to feel particularly space - age ; hauling along your stacks of paper is definitely one of them .
The United States is long overdue for a new spaceship .
The last time NASA ’s engineers sat down to design one –the space shuttle–it was 1974 , and George W. Bush had n’t yet received his MBA from Harvard , or met Laura ; the IBM Selectric was the dream office machine ; a microwave oven was found in just 4 % of U.S. kitchens .
Almost everything that matters in the world of technology and flight has changed since then : computing power , materials science , electronics , communications .
Imagine if you had n’t designed something as prosaic as a car since 1974 – before common use of fuel injectors , air bags , cup holders , not to mention engine - control computers and onboard navigation .
A new model would likely be loaded with techno - wizardry .
Yet for NASA and Lockheed Martin , the principal contractor for designing America ’s next spacecraft , the goal is simplicity , not razzle - dazzle .
The nation ’s new spaceship is called Orion .
In shape , it looks like a big version of a 1960s - era Apollo craft–a cone - shaped crew capsule atop a cylindrical service module .
“ This is not a Ferrari , like the space shuttle , ” says Skip Hatfield , NASA ’s project manager for the capsule .
“ It ’s more like a minivan .
It ’s more of a vehicle to go to the grocery store in . ”
That is , if the grocery store is on the moon .
Orion is part of a larger program called Constellation , which is backed by a Jimmy Neutron–esque slogan :
“ To the moon , Mars , and beyond . ” NASA envisions Orion launching a new era of American space exploration , with people living on the moon as soon as the early 2020s .
The Honda Odyssey minivan is not a bad metaphor for NASA ’s hopes for Orion : reliable , functional , thoughtfully designed , with more utility than glamour .
That ’s what the shuttle has never been , despite its ambitions .
The shuttle was sold as a space truck that would handle large cargo loads and launch twice a month .
Yet in the past decade , the shuttle has averaged just four flights a year .
Its systems are so temperamental that taking it to orbit has turned out to be like driving to the Grand Canyon , spending a week examining the safety of your tires and engine , then turning back and driving home with just a glance over the canyon ’s edge .
Although the shuttle ’s key elements have been flying for 25 years , its technology has never moved from cutting - edge to manageable .
NASA has spent a generation worrying not about where we ’re going in space , but about handling the capricious vehicle we ’re flying .

Designing any new spacecraft requires relentless innovation .
But sometimes the better part of innovation is not invention , but effectiveness .
And therein lies the challenge for Orion , and for the engineers designing it .
NASA and Lockheed Martin must find the discipline to produce a straightforward spaceship , with a clear mission and mature technology .
And they must do it by 2015 , with a total budget of only $ 8 billion – the equivalent of six weeks ’ expenses in Iraq .
But Orion will hardly be primitive .
Those stacks of paper the astronauts depend on , for example :
They ’re being banished .
The beloved FDFs and all the procedures they outline are being built into Orion ‘s onboard computers .
But the really remarkable things are the computers themselves .
The shuttle ’s computers had to be custom - designed .
Orion ‘s computers use existing Honeywell technology .
They are fifth - generation aerospace avionics boxes , with millions of hours of real - world experience , the same computers pilots use to fly Boeing 777s , hardened against vibration and radiation for the rigors of space flight .
Says Larry Price , a Lockheed engineer who is second - in - command of creating Orion : “ We spent nothing to develop them . ”
He ’s smiling .
How sweet it is in the year 2007 to be designing a new rocket ship , look around , and buy the computers to fly to the moon off - the - shelf .
Building 9 of Houston ’s Johnson Space Center is a vast training facility with a ceiling three stories up and a floor crowded with full - size spacecraft mock - ups – the shuttle , the International Space Station .
Everywhere people are using the mock - ups to train for future missions .
In one corner , an astronaut in a prototype moon / Mars space suit is doing an endurance test , carting wheelbarrows of rocks up an incline , monitored by a half - dozen attendants .
Tucked between space - station modules sits a squat white cone not much larger than a medium - size family camping tent and made mostly of plywood and plastic :
This is the full - size Orion crew - capsule mock - up .
Duck through the hatch and have a seat in the capsule , and the functional austerity of Orion becomes vivid .
It is designed to carry six people to the space station , or four to the moon .
With six metal seat frames bolted in place , there is no open floor space .
The capsule feels snug with four people inside ; none of us are wearing space suits .
A spot has been carved out for the toilet , tucked to one side , just below floor level .
For privacy , it will have a wraparound curtain .
It ’s definitely a step up from Apollo–which relied on adhesive plastic bags–but , really , no more private than the third row of a minivan .

During the 1960s , NASA commanded an army of 400,000 people who were furiously designing and building Apollo — three times the number of Americans deployed in Iraq .
Today , at Lockheed Martin , there are 1,600 people working on Orion , supported by another 600 at NASA .
Overall , Constellation uses fewer than 5 % of the number of people Apollo did .
During the ’60s , NASA commanded an army of 400,000 people who were building Apollo .
Today , Constellation uses fewer than 5 % of that number .
Bill Johns is a senior manager for Lockheed , which won the $ 8 billion contract to build Orion in August 2006 , over a joint team from Northrup Grumman and Boeing .
Johns is chief engineer for the crew capsule .
On the whiteboard in his office , there is only one thing boxed off with a note that says DO NOT ERASE .
In the box , in green marker , is a question : WHAT DID APOLLO DO ?
The question is central to Orion ‘s unusual design philosophy .
For every challenge facing Orion ‘s engineers , there is a simple mantra : Borrow or buy before you invent .
That is , borrow technology NASA has already used , if it works .
Buy technology from the commercial world that has been introduced in the past three decades , technology NASA did n’t have to pay to develop or debug .
And if you ca n’t find a solution in stock or off the shelf , only then do you go into the NASA workshop and mix up something new .
Everything is ultimately adapted for Orion , but the resourcefulness provides two things the manned space program needs : efficiency and confidence .
“ Does paying attention to Apollo limit our thinking ? ” Johns asks .
“ Yes , it does .
But I do n’t have any lack of young engineers coming up with great new solutions to problems –I get eight or nine of those for every problem .
Engineers love to reinvent things .
I use that question to make sure the engineers have actually checked to see what [ their predecessors ’] solution was . ”
Examples of NASA borrowing from its own heritage are everywhere .
Orion will use a hatch design nearly identical to Apollo‘s .
It will be launched on a solid rocket adapted from the shuttle .
advertisement
Orion ‘s parachute system , too , will be almost identical to Apollo‘s .
“ I ’ve read all the reports I can find from that time , ” says Koki Machin , who leads the Orion parachute group at NASA .
“ They wrote reports out the wazoo .
They did a really good job with parachutes . ”
Machin ’s changes are small :
The heavier Orion will use newer material and a larger diameter , and the chutes will be tethered to Orion with something light , strong , and pliable like Kevlar , instead of recalcitrant braided steel cable .
Orion is even buying the parachutes from the descendant company that made Apollo‘s .
They were a cutting - edge technology for Apollo , developed by a “ parachute branch ” that employed dozens of people .
Machin ’s team consists of five , including him .
When Orion ‘s engineers tackle a particular design problem , they typically do something called a “ trade study , ” in which they look beyond NASA ’s workshops , scanning the horizon for new solutions .
So , for instance , there are two competing materials for Orion ‘s heat shield , which must protect the capsule and the astronauts upon reentry .
The first is the original heat - shield material from Apollo , which is heavy and tedious to apply but can be used in a relatively thin layer .
The second , developed in the past decade , is lighter and easier to handle but requires a thicker layer .
In a NASA lab in Houston , engineers have spent the past two years evaluating the materials by blasting them in giant furnaces that can create temperatures of up to 5,000 degrees .
They expect to make a choice this spring .
In space , Orion will get its power not from heavy fuel cells but from two circular solar panels that will unfurl on either side of the ship in space .
The panels are round versions of commercial solar panels used routinely in communication and military satellites .
As the performance of solar panels improves , new versions can be swapped onto Orion .
Seats for the astronauts are a surprisingly complicated problem .
The seats need to be light and easily stowed once in space .
They will be mounted on shock absorbers that allow them to cushion the impact when Orion bumps back to earth .
Unlike Apollo , Orion will return to land , not water .
Its final touchdown will be absorbed by huge air bags .
But in the event that , say , one of the parachutes fails , the seats must help protect the crew .
For advice on designing impact - absorbing seats , NASA has turned to NASCAR , of all outfits , which in the last few years has developed technology that restrains race car drivers and helps prevent serious injuries when their cars slam into track walls at high speed .
Every design project–a new Motorola cell phone , a new BMW dashboard , a new Manhattan skyscraper –is a series of trade - offs : between technology and functionality , between ambition and affordability , between the desires of the people creating the object and the needs of the people using it .
Spacecraft design is a particularly stark version of those trade - offs because of two unusual challenges –the stakes and the laws of physics .
People ’s lives hang on getting Orion ‘s design right .
And the laws of physics impose limits terrestrial designers rarely face .
Take the issue of weight .
The absolute weight of a spacecraft is set early , by the size of the rocket launching it .
Orion–service module , capsule , escape tower–must weigh no more than 50,250 pounds .
The resulting cascade of trade - offs touches almost everything .
There is an ongoing wrangle , for example , about whether Orion will have a water heater so astronauts can make coffee each morning –a slim connection to normalcy .
Apollo had one , the shuttle has one .
Is there room in Orion ‘s “ weight envelope ” for a water heater ?
What are you willing to give up to have hot coffee during a 7 - to 21 - day mission ?

Even something as fundamental as windows depends on your perspective .
Spacecraft windows have been an issue at NASA since the days of Mercury in the early ’60s .
Engineers would just as soon create Orion ‘s capsule without windows .
That ’s the strongest , most efficient way to design a spacecraft ’s structure and skin .
The astronauts would prefer a pair of bay windows .
That ’s the way to ensure vital visibility during launch , landing , and orbital maneuvering .
Although Orion ‘s flight will typically be automated , astronauts crave a sense of “ situational awareness , ” the ability to orient themselves spatially , physically .
That is critical when things start to go wrong .
As astronaut Edward Lu told Orion ‘s designers , “ I ’ll trade food for larger windows . ”
Yet one square foot of spacecraft window–three panes of quartz glass–weighs more than a square foot of metal hull .
Every inch of window is weight that has to be shaved somewhere else .
Blaine Brown is the Lockheed engineer in charge of designing the crew capsule .
He is so passionate about aeronautical design that he went out and earned a pilot ’s license–so he ’d have a taste of what it ’s like to fly–and applied to be an astronaut in the class of 2000 .
Brown ’s designers delivered an initial Orion capsule with four main windows , two over the control panel , two on either side of it .
Astronauts assigned to consult on Orion ‘s design did n’t like the windows .
They were , astronaut Lee Morin says , “ like looking through a mail slot ” –with no view of the horizon and unsatisfactory views for docking .
The astronauts originally suggested larger windows that added 80 pounds –to a spacecraft already 5,000 pounds over its limit .
Fortunately , there was a perfect arena to play out the window debate in Houston , and it illuminates the pragmatic culture that has sprung up around the Orion project .
Squirreled away in a corner of Building 16 at Johnson sits the ROC ( reconfigurable operational cockpit ) , a bare - bones Orion - capsule simulator .
It is the creation of Michael Red and Alberto Sena , two NASA engineers who have worked on shuttle simulators for years and pulled together the ROC without anyone asking for it .
“ We just did it , ” Sena says .
“ We ’re trying to provide an immersion environment to aid the design . ”
The ROC includes just a small slice of Orion interior , made of white Masonite and simple aluminum framing .
An ordinary bar stool with a blue - cloth seat pulls up to the control panel .
Dangling overhead is a ping - pong ball on a thread .
Adjust the height of the barstool so the ball rests on the bridge of your nose , pull your barstool up to the command console , and you get an astronaut ’s - eye view through the windows , behind which a computer plays a launch simulation on a big screen .
Astronauts and designers were able to see what each of the 20 different versions of window configurations would show at critical stages of a mission .

This simple skunkworks took the guesswork out of designing the windows .
“ We were able to tweak them a little bit and get a lot more performance , ” Brown says .
Because Orion is double - hulled ( with an inner pressure shell and an outer thermal shell ) , the deep frames were blocking the view to each side .
The astronauts were so determined to evaluate the views , Red says , that during simulations they ’d end up sticking their heads right through the window holes to look around .
Eventually , the windows were repositioned , and the frames were flared along the ship ’s hull to open up the field of view .
Total weight increase : 27 pounds .
Total cost : little more than a few trips to Home Depot .
Space is a hard , unforgiving place .
It will find the flaws–in thinking , in design , in human nature .
Spacecraft design is unforgiving in another important way –politically .
There are plenty of critics of the course chosen by NASA administrator Mike Griffin , who since taking over in 2005 appears to be trying to get NASA to face reality : a dangerous , unreliable shuttle that is costing billions a year to keep flying ; no replacement ready to take humans into space ; insufficient money for robotic space science ; surging space competition from other nations ( notably China and India ) and the private sector .
For decades , NASA ’s bosses and engineers have been scorched for shuttle flaws , most the result of design choices that pushed the technological envelope .
Now criticism is already mounting for Constellation ’s perceived lack of ambition .
To Griffin , Orion and Constellation are the way to get back to the business of space exploration in a rational way .
“ We do n’t have an infinite amount of money , ” Griffin said in a 2005 interview , as he was tightening the program ’s focus and timelines .
“ What we have is a specific task we ’re trying to perform , and I ’m trying to do that in the simplest , cheapest , easiest , most prudent way possible . ”
“ Space will be explored and exploited by humans , ” Griffin told Congress that year .
“ The question is , which humans , from where , and what language will they speak ?
It is my goal that Americans will be always among them . ”

Griffin is betting that Orion can become the symbol of a mature space program–one in which it ’s the destination that matters , not the transportation .
The country hardly seems aware of this critical juncture , not just in 50 years of spaceflight but in 200 years of American exploration .
If Orion does not succeed , Americans will be left grounded , for the first time in history simply shrugging at the frontier .
If Orion does not succeed , Americans will be left grounded , for the first time in history simply shrugging at the frontier .
Orion and Constellation ca n’t come soon enough .
NASA has said that the three space shuttles will be retired at the end of 2010 ; Orion is scheduled for its first manned flight in early 2015 .
So if everything goes perfectly , there will be a nearly five - year gap during which the U.S. will not be able to launch its own astronauts without outside help .
Launch Pad 39 - B , at Kennedy Space Center , is one of only two equipped to launch manned rockets .
Up close , Pad 39 - B is testament to how brutal , even primitive , our approach to space remains .
The grounds of the pad encompass 40 acres of scrub brush along the Atlantic Ocean , and much of the 40 acres is blackened by each shuttle launch .
Most of the smoke you see in a shuttle launch is actually steam .
Starting 17 seconds before launch , a water tower cuts loose 300,000 gallons of water onto the launch pad .
The water has nothing to do with heat ; it acts as a sound damper .
The noise from the shuttle ’s engines is so powerful that without the protective deluge , the shock waves would bounce off the launch pad , ricochet up , and tear the spaceship apart as it ascends .
Astronauts ride a controlled explosion to orbit .
Pad 39 - B has launched its share of historic missions , including the space shuttle Challenger , which killed seven astronauts .
The first launch from 39 - B was Apollo 10 – the formal dress rehearsal for Apollo 11 ‘s landing on the moon–and it sent Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan to within 50,000 feet of the moon ’s surface .
Coming home , the crew set what remains the record for the fastest manned vehicle : 24,791 miles per hour .
Pad 39 - B could eventually inaugurate an era of less momentous but equally pioneering launches .
It has been pulled from shuttle service and is already being rebuilt to launch Orion .

Dealing with a banking crisis used to be such a simple affair for the Bank of England not least when the crisis rolled up at its own front door !
Back in Sept. 1720 , just as the South Sea Company was hurtling from bubble to bust and hurtling into the history books as a result the Bank of England faced a ' run ' from anxious depositors .
Still a private enterprise , it managed to stem that drain on its assets , calm the panic , and survive to become the monopoly issuer of Pounds Sterling some 120 years later .
Now the Bank 's charged with ensuring the stability of both consumer prices and the financial system six decades after it was nationalized could the same trick used in 1720 prevent a run on its currency today ?
Nine years before the South Sea Bubble burst , in 1711 , the government in London had hit upon a fantastic wheeze for reducing its huge debt burden , built up during the decade - long War of the Spanish Succession .
This series of pan-Atlantic battles , including Queen Anne's War on the French in Quebec , proved so expensive that by the time the conflict ended with the Treaty of Utrecht , more than one - third of British tax receipts was going to service the debt - interest alone .
How to reduce the national debt and fend off disaster ?
Step forward the South Sea Company , backed by the infamous Sword Blade Bank and run by that company 's secretary , John Blunt .
An historic chancer almost matching the chutzpah of John Law the brains behind the Mississippi Bubble in Paris Blunt offered to convert British government bonds into South Sea stock , promising the investors he thus acquired a huge rate of return from the Company 's trading monopoly in Spanish South America .
Blunt never actually got round to doing much trade , however not beyond selling 34,000 West Africans into slavery and nor did the Sword Blade Company have much to do with making sword - blades after it got into financial engineering , too .
Instead , Blunt and his associates became among the wealthiest men in England by giving a profit to existing investors straight out of the funds received from new stock buyers .
This classic ' Ponzi Scheme ' a pyramid rip - off requiring ever more new investment to cover the last set of promises also earned a guaranteed chunk of the nation 's tax revenues on top , paid in return for converting the government 's debt into South Sea Company stock .
The scheme worked beautifully at first , with some £ 10 million of government debt redeemed for South Sea paper that paid 6 % per year in interest and rose nearly 40 % in price by the end of 1713 alone .
Come 1719 , however , the Company over - reached itself , offering to swap half of the government 's outstanding debts for a new issue of stock worth £ 31.5 million .
' Tiz amazing , ' said an anonymous broadside hawked around the coffee - houses of Exchange Alley , ' that a company at first erected upon pretence of trade should take so little care to begin , fix or improve any Trade , and that when at last they had got into their possession a great deal of ready money , they should employ their genius in stock - jobbing , or so to speak plain , in gaming away their own Treasure , and encouraging others to do the same . '
In the summer of 1720 , Blunt 's pyramid scheme bubbled and burst .
The price of South Sea Company shares plunged by 25 % during July and August .
Panic ripped through London and the rural gentry ; some 30,000 creditors had been sucked into the conversion ( around 0.5 % of the entire population ) and there were thousands of stockholders and traders ' on risk ' as well .
The plunge threatened ' Publick Credit ' so severely , in fact , that today it ' would be called a systemic threat to financial stability ' as Richard Dale explains in his history , The First Crash .
' Five well - established banks failed around this time , ' Professor Dale goes on , ' and on 24 September [ 1720 ] the South Sea Company 's own bank , the Sword Blade Company , stopped payments , leading over the next fortnight to a run on the Bank of England itself . '
How come the Bank of England got involved ?
Still a private company , the Bank of England had also offered to fix up the government 's balance sheet in late 1719 and after losing out to the South Sea Company ( its directors had more powerful friends in parliament ) , the Bank was left holding around 8 % of all government debt still outstanding .
So when its arch - rival 's stock price began to collapse and a ' systemic threat ' challenged London 's financial stability the Bank felt it necessary to help underwrite the South Sea scam .
In mid-Sept. 1720 , the Bank of England announced it would exchange South Sea bonds for silver at a price of £ 400 .
Anyone wanting to quit their position in the ' tricking and shuffling ' of that historic scandal could redeem their paper for hard cash , in other words .
That would at least put a floor beneath the South Sea Company 's stock down by one - third to £ 520 in the first two weeks of Sept. alone .
The scheme worked only too well , however , as the market value of South Sea stock traded in Exchange Alley continued to plunge .
Once the Sword Blade Company stopped redeeming South Sea stock on Sept. 24th , it seemed that all of London with his broker in tow ! was queuing up outside its offices in the Grocer 's Hall , Princes Street to claim £ 400 in silver for every bond they held , and the Bank was forced to withdraw its offer .
But alas !
The Bank 's own customers took this turnaround to mean it did n't hold enough silver to cover its obligations .
So a frantic queue of depositors formed outside the Grocer 's Hall instead , replacing the South Sea speculators and demanding the return of their savings .
What to do ?
The method must surely raise a wry smile at the Bank of England today as it finds itself on the hook for underwriting Northern Rock the over - geared mortgage lender that suffered the first British banking run in more than 130 years this September .
To avert failure in 1720 , ' the Bank organized its friends in the front of the line and paid them slowly in [ silver ] sixpences , ' writes Charles Kindleberger in his Manias , Panics & Crashes , quoting a Victorian history .
' These friends then brought the cash back through another door ; it was deposited , again slowly counted , and then made available for paying out once more . '
Round and round the silver sixpences went ... out over the counter ... and in through the back door !
Slowly counting out the deposits , only to get them back and then count them out once again , the Bank 's diligent tellers helped it survive until the Feast of Michealmas on Sept. 29th .
Once the holiday was ended , the panic had passed .
South Sea stock , on the other hand , only continued to plunge , dropping to £ 290 on Oct. 1st and then sinking to £ 170 over the following fortnight .
The Bank of England , in short , had done well to withdraw its support for the Bubble .
Honoring the South Sea Company 's false promises had nearly destroyed it .
And today ...?
' Taxpayers may be forced to pay for the Northern Rock crisis , the Government has admitted for the first time , ' reports The Telegraph .
' Alistair Darling , the Chancellor , refused to guarantee in Parliament that the £ 24 billion of public money [ $ 49.4bn ] propping up the bank the equivalent of £ 1,000 for every taxpayer [ $ 2,060 ] would ever be repaid in full . '
What 's more , that historic loan to Northern Rock made by the Bank of England acting in its capacity as ' lender of the last resort ' is in fact an adjustable - rate loan , starting with a teaser rate and ' adjusting ' higher in five years ' time .
Hell , that 's an even sweeter and riskier deal than the two - year ARMs sold by Northern Rock as it grew its mortgage book by 43 % in the first half of 2007 .
' The Bank of England has repeatedly warned against the ' moral hazard ' of public money being made available to a commercial lender , ' the newspaper goes on , ' prompting observers to think a stiff rate was being imposed on Northern Rock of between 6.75 % to 7.25 % .
' But in fact , it has only been paying the [ BoE target ] base rate of 5.75 % .
A further charge of 1.25 % is being rolled up to be repaid in five years ' time . '
Meantime , all that money pouring into Northern Rock through the back - door of unannounced loans from the Bank of England is heading straight out again ... out over the counter ... as depositors continue to flee the mortgage lender , withdrawing their savings and emptying what little is left in its coffers .
Between the start of the panic in Sept. and the end of the first week in Nov. , Northern Rock savers had withdrawn at least £ 10.5 billion ( $ 21.6 bn ) of their money .
Last month alone , according to the Building Societies Association of which Northern Rock was a member until it ' demutualized ' in Oct.
1997 , floating on the stock market and embarking on its growth - hungry quest to boost returns to shareholders private savers moved anything up to £ 3 billion out of the bank , more than $ 6bn .
Here at BullionVault , we can only guess what has happened to the other £ 13.5 billion borrowed on that special teaser - deal from the Bank of England so far .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) -
As expected , Yahoo Inc began carrying out lay - offs up to 1,000 employees on Tuesday , as part of job cutbacks announced last month , several employees at the company ’s headquarters said on Tuesday .
A spokeswoman for Yahoo , which is seeking to fend off an unsolicited takeover bid by Microsoft Corp , declined to comment on the cutbacks beyond the general outlines Yahoo executives provided in an investor conference call last month .
One Yahoo engineering manager who was having to fire staff himself said the cuts were spread across a variety of divisions .
They are performance - based rather than part of a plan to shut - down whole operations , said the source , who declined to be named .
He gave no further details .
Chief Executive Jerry Yang last month forecast a tough 2008 year for the Sunnyvale , California - based company as he pledged to reduce Yahoo ’s work force by around 7 percent .
The company had 14,300 employees at the end of 2007 .
Subsequently , Microsoft unveiled a plan to acquire Yahoo .
Yahoo’s board of directors rebuffed Microsoft ’s offer on Monday of $ 31 a share , saying it “ substantially undervalues Yahoo . ”
Many Wall Street analysts believe the two sides will eventually agree to merge if Microsoft comes back with a higher offer .

Veterans Disarmament Act To Bar Vets From Owning Guns
GOA ^ | Sept , 2007 | Larry Pratt
Posted on by AuntB
Hundreds of thousands of veterans -- from Vietnam through Operation Iraqi Freedom -- are at risk of being banned from buying firearms if legislation that is pending in Congress gets enacted .
How ?
The Veterans Disarmament Act -- which has already passed the House -- would place any veteran who has ever been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) on the federal gun ban list .
This is exactly what President Bill Clinton did over seven years ago when his administration illegitimately added some 83,000 veterans into the National Criminal Information System ( NICS system ) -- prohibiting them from purchasing firearms , simply because of afflictions like PTSD .
The proposed ban is actually broader .
Anyone who is diagnosed as being a tiny danger to himself or others would have his gun rights taken away ... forever .
It is section 102 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( C ) ( iv ) in HR 2640 that provides for dumping raw medical records into the system .
Those names -- like the 83,000 records mentioned above -- will then , by law , serve as the basis for gun banning .
No wonder the Military Order of the Purple Heart is opposed to this legislation .
The House bill , HR 2640 , is being sponsored by one of the most flaming anti-Second Amendment Representatives in Congress : Carolyn McCarthy ( D - NY ) .
Another liberal anti-gunner , Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , is sponsoring the bill in the Senate .
Proponents of the bill say that helpful amendments have been made so that any veteran who gets his name on the NICS list can seek an expungement .
But whenever you talk about expunging names from the Brady NICS system , you 're talking about a procedure that has always been a long shot .
Right now , there are NO EXPUNGEMENTS of law - abiding Americans ' names that are taking place under federal level .
Why ?
Because the expungement process which already exists has been blocked for over a decade by a " funds cut - off " engineered by another anti-gunner , Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - NY ) .
So how will this bill make things even worse ?
Well , two legal terms are radically redefined in the Veterans Disarmament Act to carry out this vicious attack on veterans ' gun rights .
One term relates to who is classified a " mental defective . "
Forty years ago that term meant one was adjudicated " not guilty " in a court of law by reason of insanity .
But under the Veterans Disarmament Act , " mental defective " has been stretched to include anyone whom a psychiatrist determines might be a tiny danger to self or others .
The second term is " adjudicate . "
In the past , one could only lose one 's gun rights through an adjudication by a judge , magistrate or court -- meaning conviction after a trial .
Adjudication could only occur in a court with all the protections of due process , including the right to face one 's accuser .
Now , adjudication in HR 2640 would include a finding by " a court , commission , committee or other authorized person " ( namely , a psychiatrist ) .
Forget the fact that people with PTSD have the same violent crime rate as the rest of us .
Vietnam vets with PTSD have had careers and obtained permits to carry firearms concealed .
It will now be enough for a psychiatric diagnosis ( a " determination " in the language of the bill ) to get a veteran barred -- for life -- from owning guns .
Think of what this bill would do to veterans .
If a robber grabs your wallet and takes everything in it , but gives you back $ 5 to take the bus home , would you call that a financial enhancement ?
If not , then we should not let HR 2640 supporters call the permission to seek an expungement an enhancement , when prior to this bill , veterans could not legitimately be denied their gun rights after being diagnosed with PTSD .
Veterans with PTSD should not be put in a position to seek an expungement .
They have not been convicted ( after a trial with due process ) of doing anything wrong .
If a veteran is thought to be a threat to self or others , there should be a real trial , not an opinion ( called a diagnosis ) by a psychiatrist .
If members of Congress do not hear from soldiers ( active duty and retired ) in large numbers , along with the rest of the public , the Veterans Disarmament Act -- misleadingly titled by Rep. McCarthy as the NICS Improvement Amendments
Act -- will send this message to veterans : " No good deed goes unpunished . "

OMG ... can we please get past this ?
The GOA says that the NRA are a bunch of gun grabbing socialists , and the NRA says different .
My opinion is that the bill does n't even begin to do what the GOA says and that this is just more of the same old GOA tactic of attacking their friends in order to drum up some cash .
It really does get old fast .

Stanford legal theorist Lawrence Lessig is n't throwing his hat into the ring quite yet , but the renowned cyberlawyer has announced that he is seriously considering a run for Congress in response to a fast - growing netroots campaign pushing him to seek the House seat left vacant by the death of Rep. Tom Lantos ( D - CA ) .
Earlier today , Lessig spoke with Ars Technica about why he might run , what the Lessig platform would look like , and why voters in the Golden State 's 12th district should choose him over longtime state senator Jackie Speier .
A two - pronged campaign
A Lessig campaign would have two dimensions : process and policy .
The " process " dimension , which Lessig elaborates in a video ( in Lessig 's signature pithy , PowerPoint style ) posted at his newly - launched proto - campaign site , is an outgrowth of his latest academic project : the study of money 's corrupting influence on politics .
His goal here is to " fundamentally alter the incentives legislators face as they 're trying to do their jobs . "
Pondering a run
One simple means of reducing the political power of campaign cash , Lessig says , " could be done tomorrow . "
He wants to ban legislative earmarks , those juicy morsels of targeted federal funding legislators direct toward pet projects and political supporters .
Lessig also hopes to encourage more robust public financing of campaigns , noting the salutary effect such policies appear to be having in states like Maine and Arizona .
Most immediately — and perhaps most radically — Lessig says he will swear off contributions from lobbyists or political action committees , and he hopes to bring grassroots pressure to bear on other candidates to follow suit .
( Prospective opponent Jackie Speier , he notes in passing in his online video , does accept such contributions . )
" This is about building a parallel to Creative Commons in Congress , " Lessig explains , referencing the popular legal license he created to help authors and artists make their work available for free distribution and modification .
Just as creators under a Creative Commons license cede some control over their works in order to promote a robust open - source culture , Lessig 's political vision entails " people in power , legislators , voluntarily waiving that power in order to build a better system . "
If politicians begin foreswearing PAC money , the theory runs , voters may come to see the failure to refuse lobbyist dollars as a badge of shame rather than simply the way things are done .
Policy prescriptions
On the policy front , Lessig happily allows that there is n't a whole lot of daylight between himself and Speier on issues like healthcare or the war in Iraq .
" I'm a liberal Democrat , " he says , though he adds that he is " a free - trade , pro-market liberal . "
( Since California 's 12th runs deep , deep blue , the winner of the Democratic primary is all but guaranteed victory in the general election . )
Instead , Lessig would set himself apart by making technology the centerpiece of his campaign .
" Silicon Valley needs a representative who can speak for the interests of the Internet , of making it flourish , " he says .
" As we 're leading into this moment when the owners of telecommunications platforms are trying to leverage their ownership into control of the Internet , yammering about the need to turn it into the old Bell System , we need someone in Washington who 's going to be able to stare them down . "
But while Lessig wryly notes that the RIAA and MPAA " wo n't be excited to have an opponent of extremist copyright legislation in Congress , " he also stresses that a congressional run would not be some kind of crusading extension of his work on " free culture . "
For Lessig , the central policy question will be , " Who ultimately controls innovation on the Internet ?
That 's the net neutrality fight ; that 's the open spectrum fight . "
One obstacle to such innovation is the Federal Communications Commission , which " was established in order to protect the incumbents , " and may now need to be " restructured to facilitate competition . "
As an example , Lessig points to recent spectrum policy , which he describes as " extremely disappointing . "
According to Lessig , " circa 2001 , the basic lesson we had learned is that we had undervalued unlicensed spectrum , that we did n't understand its innovation potential .
Everyone was adopting the view that we needed more unlicensed areas alongside more spectrum auctions . "
But in the intervening years , he says that " lobbyists have been very effective at changing the conversation , at making the property model seem like the only model " — a trend Lessig believes has enriched a few spectrum owners at the expense of overall economic growth .
Stepping out of the ivory tower
But why should an already - influential academic celebrity hailed as the father of his field trade his department chair for a seat in Congress , where he would be just one of 435 votes ?
Lessig says he began considering the prospect after a member of the audience at one of his recent lectures asked him why he was n't doing something about the problem of political corruption — a challenge that struck home .
But he admits there 's also a practical angle .
" When I was doing free culture stuff , there were hundreds of fora every year where people wanted to talk about these issues .
There are no industry conferences on political corruption , and I quickly realized this was going to be harder to talk about than I had expected . "
Finally , there 's what sounds like a bit of a perfectionist streak in the equation .
" It would be painful to watch other people try to solve the problems I 'm talking about and do it wrong , " Lessig says .
Of course , all this will be — pardon the phrase — academic unless Lessig can stage an upset against Jackie Speier , a seasoned politician who has already lined up the support of some of California 's most prominent Democrats .
Speier has the support of both the state 's representatives in the US Senate : San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom and the late Rep. Lantos himself .
Lessig points out , however , that those endorsements were " given when nobody thought anyone else was running , " and suggests that the " rush to consolidate " before a field of contenders has emerged is creating frustration among voters who would prefer a few more options .
With only weeks remaining before the special election , Lessig says he 'll make a definite decision about whether to run by the beginning of March .
If he does , he 'll have to push his distributed network of supporters to the limit in order to get his campaign out of beta on time .
Diego thought this was better than school
" The holidays were such fun , " Diego Palacios , 10 , who lives outside Monterrey , told Reforma newspaper .
His mother Sandra found him watching television with his hand stuck to the bedstead .
" I do n't know why he did it , " she said .
" He is a good boy . "
Police and paramedics eventually managed to free him unharmed , and he was only a few hours late for school .
Diego had got up early to fetch some industrial - strength glue from the kitchen .
His mother spent two hours trying to free him with nail - polish remover before calling for expert help .
Diego watched cartoons while paramedics dissolved the glue with a spray .
CBS reporter : Giuliani values ' loyalty over everything ' David Edwards and Adam Doster

This week , a federal grand jury voted to indict Former New York City police Commissioner Bernard Kerik , the corrupt protege of Presidential Candidate Rudy Giuliani , on charges stemming from tax evasion and corruption allegations .
While it was believed that Giuliani did not know of Kerik 's legal woes before they grew close , Andrew Kirtzman , a journalist for CBS 2 in NYC and a long - time Giuliani reporter , tells a different story .
" It turns out that Giuliani was briefed about Kerik 's relationship with this allegedly mobbed - up company even before Giuliani named him police commissioner , long before Giuliani recommended Kerik to be Homeland Security Chief , " he told John Roberts on CNN 's American Morning .
" So , it raises a lot of questions .
Giuliani has a lot of questions to answer on the campaign trail about his judgment . "
The journalist made clear the value Giuliani ascribes to allegiance , perhaps at the expense of pragmatism or honesty .
" I 've been covering Giuliani as long as anyone and I can't guarantee to you , sitting here this morning , that he would n't make the same mistake again if he became president because Giuliani values loyalty over everything . "
Kirtzman also sees a commonality between Giuliani and President Bush , who stood by embattled confidants Donald Rumsfeld and Alberto Gonzalez long after others defected .
" Giuliani and Bush have that trait in common .
I think it 's something to look for , " he said .
The following video is from CNN's American Morning , broadcast on November 9 , 2007 .
I was in no way expecting spoken dialogue in this .
It was a very pleasant surprise !
What I love is how the voices are quite distinct .
You did n't credit voices on the side of this page .
I guess it 's a bit cliché to talk about a character 's dark side .
This was still tons of fun .
The fight with X and Zero was probably the best part .
It 's weird to see a whole episode being split into so many parts .
Knuckles is probably my favorite character .
I just appreciate the fancy sprite work .
I at least recognize the Mega Man enemies .
From a wooden jetty , Cédric Giroud gazed out over the wide bend of the river Rhône , a picturesque , dark blue expanse dotted with swans .
" At midnight on summer nights , when I 'd finished fishing and boxed up my catch , I 'd slip into the water and swim in the moonlight , " he said .
The swell in the Rhône at the Grand Large just outside Lyon draws tens of thousands of French tourists on holiday weekends .
It is a haven for rowers , sailors , fishermen and children feeding ducks .
But under the crystal clear water lurks an environmental disaster the conservation group WWF is calling " a French Chernobyl " .
The French government has banned the consumption of fish from the length of the Rhône - where it enters France from the Swiss Alps all the way down to the Mediterranean - after local specialities such as bream , pikeperch , carp and catfish were found to contain high levels of the toxic chemicals PCBs .
France 's second longest river has contaminated sediment in its bed and feeding fish have sent the toxins through the food chain .
Environmentalists say the poison Rhône , which flows through tourist spots such as the papal city of Avignon down to the Camargue delta , is the tip of the iceberg of French industrial pollution , which the government has recklessly ignored for 20 years .
Freshwater fishermen talk of being suicidal .
Local mayors and authorities have filed dozens of court cases after decades of campaigning by environmental groups .
Research outside France has shown that PCBs - polychlorinated biphenyls once used in electrical generators , transformers and insulating fluid - cause infertility and birth defects in mammals .
But the French government has not tested the toxic compounds ' impact or carcinogenic effect on humans .
The WWF , backed by 300 doctors , is now lobbying the government to urgently fund its own tests on health implications .
The ban on consuming fish from the Rhône has been extended to other French rivers poisoned by PCBs : in Normandy the popular delicacy of eels from the Seine has been outlawed as well as fish from the Somme .
Scientists predict more bans will follow .
The Chernobyl comparison by the WWF comes not from the potential number of deaths of humans , but from successive French governments ' attitude of ignoring what campaigners call " a ticking timebomb " .
The poisoning was not uncovered by the state but by Giroud , who sells his catch to African , Asian and eastern European immigrants in the local markets of Lyon 's grey suburbs and old industrial heartlands .
Giroud , 35 , is the only commercial fisherman on the Grand Large in Décines , bringing in 10 tonnes a year and selling it himself .
His freshwater fish - cheaper than sea fish and often sold for € 2 ( £ 1.50 ) a kilo - is a staple for poor people in the suburbs .
Chinese and Vietnamese customers would use it for traditional dishes .
One Turkish father used to buy 10kg to 20kg a week .
Then in 2004 birds started dying around the Grand Large .
Tests showed it was avian botulism .
" Although there was no effect on my fish , customers who had seen dead birds were wary , " said Giroud .
" Off my own back , just to reassure them , I sent my perfect - looking fish to the lab .
I expected excellent results . "
But the tests found a different , murkier poison - the fish contained PCBs between 10 and 12 times the legal safety limit .
Fish from the Grand Large was banned at the end of 2005 and similar bans have progressively spread to other areas .
" This is the tip of the iceberg , the more research is done the more toxic contamination will be uncovered , " said Alain Chabrolle of Frapna , a local environmental group which has campaigned on the effect of pollution in the river for decades .
" There must be precise research on all possible PCBs sources , accurate maps and measures taken .
The state polluted and allowed others to pollute .
For decades they have put their head in the sand . "
PCBs , one of the most poisonous groups of industrial compounds , were produced globally in large amounts before their danger was understood .
They are still present in some industrial and electrical equipment and are difficult to dispose of safely .
Trédi , an industrial waste processing plant formerly owned by the French state , sits on the Rhône 15.5 miles upstream from the Grand Large .
It was supposed to limit pollution but instead emitted PCBs into the water .
The plant 's new owners insist they have cleaned up .
But environmentalists say other sources of PCBs , such as disused factories , must be assessed .
The Rhône cuts through France 's biggest concentration of chemical industries .
Although Nicolas Sarkozy 's new environmental super - ministry has now taken up the matter of PCB river poisoning , Chabrolle said the ministries of agriculture and health were slow to get on board , despite the implications for food and health .
The freshwater fishermen banned from selling fish have received no compensation .
French professional river fishermen are few in number and not a vocal lobby .
In comparison , their seafaring counterparts have huge political clout , and if marine fishing becomes affected there could be a major political row .
" If they do n't like something , marine fishermen will instantly block a major port with 100 vessels , " said Chabrolle .
" What can Cédric Giroud do , block the Rhône with one boat ? "
In a nearby Asian supermarket a Vietnamese mother said : " I 've always been suspicious of the river fish here . "
But other elderly French locals said they would be prepared to keep eating Rhône fish .
Giroud said potentially amateurs could still sell the odd catch on the black market .
Some of his customers still call him asking for it .
At a fishing supplies shop Didier Lardon has had to expand his stock to knives and toy guns to stay in business .
" My takings are down 20 % to 30 % and the older amateur fishermen have not even renewed their licences , " he said .
Three fishing shops near the Grand Large have already closed .
If tests on the effect on human health begin Giroud and his four children aged six to 14 would be prime samples .
But having lost his business and livelihood , he does not want to know .
" Every day I think I 'm just happy not to have committed suicide , that I still have my kids and my wife has n't left me .
It 's not myself I feel bad about , it 's having fed the fish to my children all these years . "
So much for the Rezko angle :
The couple who sold Barack Obama his Chicago home said the Illinois senator ’s $ 1.65 million bid “ was the best offer ” and they did n’t cut their asking price because a campaign donor bought their adjacent land , according to e- mails between Obama ’s presidential campaign and the seller .
The Illinois senator has said he made a “ boneheaded ” move in involving contributor Antoin “ Tony ” Rezko , a Chicago businessman , in the purchase of the property on June 15 , 2005 .
Rezko ’s wife , Rita , also an Obama donor , bought the adjoining plot in Hyde Park from the couple , Fredric Wondisford and Sally Radovick , for the $ 625,000 asking price , the same day that Obama bought the house for $ 300,000 less than the asking price .
Antoin Rezko was under federal investigation at the time .
Rezko was indicted on unrelated fraud charges 16 months later , in October 2006 .
Obama has since returned about $ 85,000 in campaign contributions made or raised by Rezko .
The sellers had n’t previously made their side of the story public out of concern for their privacy , according to Bill Burton , a spokesman for Obama ’s campaign .
They approached Obama ’s Senate office 15 months ago and agreed to break their silence now through the campaign out of concern that the story was being distorted in the media , Burton said .
As I was writing this post , I took a break and checked the comments to a previous post , and found this :
John Cole , the troll .
Is there any other way to explain the hate you bring to the discussion ?
I have a question that is only being touched on .
Serious questions are being raised about Obama ’s relations with Rezbo ( sp ? ) , and implications of criminality .
Deny these as you will , but they exist .
What happens , assuming Obama ’s winning the Democratic nomination for president , when bush ’s department of justice indicts him two weeks before the presidential election ?
And there you have it , in all the glory it deserves - the Clinton way .
Throw shit out there , and even if it does n’t stick and you ca n’t even SPELL the name , you have weakened your opponent .
Glorious , no ?
I fully expect the next few weeks will be full of this sort of crap , including more false charges of sexism and whatever other garbage they can drag up ( the first time I heard of the similarities between Obama ’s speeched and those of Patrick ’s was in the comments here from a… Clinton supporter– would it surprise anyone if team Hillary is behind the latest attack on Obama in the press ? ) .
This election can not end soon enough .
*** Update ***
That did n’t take long - they are n’t even hiding behind anonymous sources for the plagiarism BS :
Howard Wolfson , the Clinton campaign ’s communications director , today accused Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) of committing “ plagiarism ” in a speech in Milwaukee on Saturday night .
Wolfson made the explosive charge in an interview with Politico after suggesting as much in a conference call with reporters .
On the call , Wolfson said : “ Sen . Obama is running on the strength of his rhetoric and the strength of his promises and , as we have seen in the last couple of days , he ’s breaking his promises and his rhetoric is n’t his own . ”
If you are wondering how desparate this seems coming from the Clinton camp , and how lame the plagiarism charges are , let me point you to this - Captain Ed is not falling for them .
Some of the commenters are donating 5 bucks every time the Clinton camp does something sleazy .
Here is where to donate .
Relationship Bombs .
We hit them all of the time – or rather they hit us .
They are tensions ready to snap , anger ready to boil over or cold , calculated vengeance waiting for opportunity .
A relationship bomb is on the brink of exploding in most confrontations because people simply do n’t understand each other .
This is our first mistake .
We look at a conflict and all we can see is an incident or a situation that can be solved .
We are in an angry altercation with someone and we try to fix it straight away by doing something .
Practical measures might have stopped the problem before it happened , but now it is too late .
Really , the only way to make peace is to defuse the bomb first , and here is how it is done .
Try this example .
You sit down at your colleague ’s work station to quickly check something while the service guy works on your computer .
You close a window and temporarily lose a file for your colleague and she is furious .
Of course you can offer to search around and retrieve it but she wo n’t listen .
Her blood is boiling , her pulse is rising and it looks like any minute you might see Mt. Vesuvius erupting through her eyes .
Practical solutions are not going to help because you simply do n’t understand how she feels .
It is not about the lost file anymore .
There is something going on in her personal world that is making the bomb tick .
The only solution is to deal with the understanding issue before it gets out of hand .
The best way to do this , and walk away with a productive relationship , takes time .
If you do n’t have the time , then try some other way to make peace but you are going to lose in the long run .
Until we try to understand the other person , an issue will never be fully solved , and may well come back to bite us later .
Here is one way to make sure you understand the other person .
I call it Tedious Reflection , simply because it is tedious and it involves reflecting what you hear from the other person .
This is not the same as the manipulative reflection that is supposed to build rapport with others .
All we are doing here is asking if we understand the other person .
If we do n’t then we ask again and again and again slowly getting closer and closer to full understanding .
Advertising
So you lose your colleague ’s file and you carefully ask her :
You : “ Can I solve this by finding your file for you ?
Will that make everything OK ? ”
Sue : “ Of course it wo n’t , you lazy …… … ”
You : “ So is the problem that I am a lazy … . ”
Advertising
Sue : “ No , that just makes you lose files .
The problem is that this is the fourth time that … ”
You : “ So is the problem that people keep abusing your generosity ? ”
Sue : “ No I have n’t been generous , it is just that they assume that I will be . ”
You : “ So people have just been walking in here and using your desktop like I did . ”
Advertising
Sue : “ Yes , and they would n’t have done that if I was a jerk like Steven ”
and so it goes on , and after a tedious process of dragging the understanding out of your colleague , her tempo gradually reduces , her colour changes back to normal and she visibly relaxes a little .
At the end , you understand that the actual incident was just the flash - point .
Really she cared very little about the file and so finding it again was not a big issue .
It all came down to a bunch of other things happening in her world that now you have a better understanding of .
This sort of confrontation is not for the weak - hearted because you may cop a lot of anger along the way .
In effect , what you are asking is “ What is making you angry ? ” .
The problem with this is that only part of any situation is actually directly related to you .
Usually there will be contributing factors from all over the place that you will be hit with , in the flurry of communication .
You will never reach 100 % understanding with another human unless you are physically joined by the brain .
The best that you can hope for is maybe 90 % .
But this is a lot better than most people ever experience in their haste .
You will know you are there , when you carefully ask your colleague .
“ Have I got this right ?
Do I understand correctly ?
You feel ….. ” and then they agree .
That is close enough for what we want .
If the other person is ready to agree that you have heard and understood them , then solving the practical things will be easy .
Advertising
The whole process may have been tedious and time consuming .
You may have felt awkward and embarrassed .
No matter what , you will walk away with a defused Relationship Bomb , a way towards a workable solution to the underlying problem , and probably a strengthened and trusting relationship .
If nothing else , this exercise will show that you have integrity in your relationships and that you are trying to set up a way that you can both walk away with dignity .
Try it today .

The spice of life : Scientists believe turmeric may help prevent heart failure and repair damaged hearts
The secret to a healthy heart could lie in your spice rack .
Research shows that the curry spice turmeric can help prevent heart failure and repair damaged hearts .
Although the tests were carried out in mice , scientists are hopeful the findings could apply to humans .
Heart failure , in which the heart , damaged by heart attack or disease , gradually loses the ability to pump blood round the body , typically kills 40 per cent of victims within a year of onset .
Symptoms include tiredness , swollen ankles and breathlessness .
Although there are drugs that can control the condition , there is no way of repairing the scarring and damage suffered by heart muscles .
The study , reported in the Journal of Clinical Investigation , suggests turmeric could help .
It contains a compound called curcumin , which has been used in Asian medicine for centuries to treat inflammatory disorders and is linked with a wide range of health benefits .
When experts at Toronto General Hospital in Canada tested the spice on mice , they found the creatures ' damaged hearts became more efficient at pumping blood and scars healed up after just a few doses .
Exactly how the orange - coloured spice heals is not clear , although scientists think it may be switching off the genes that cause the heart to become enlarged and scarred .
However , they warned eating more curry may not be the answer , as many dishes are high in fat .
Researcher Dr Peter Liu said : " The benefits of curcumin are not strengthened by eating more of it . "

" Um , I really like music .
It is very good .
I want to make music my living . "
This was Hung 's statement before he started singing Ricky Martin 's " She Bangs ! " .
As judges Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul tried to hold back their laughter , judge Simon Cowell dismissed Hung 's performance outright : " You ca n't sing , you can't dance , so what do you want me to say ? "
Hung defended himself , stating , " Um , I already gave my best , and I have no regrets at all . "
Jackson and Abdul applauded his positive response , and Abdul said , " That 's the best attitude yet . "
Hung 's response to Cowell 's criticism was in stark contrast to earlier contestants ' often angry , confrontational rejoinders .
Hung also remarked , " And you know , I have no professional training of singing and dancing , " eliciting a response of mock surprise from Simon Cowell , saying , " No , well this is the surprise of the century . "
Hung was not admitted to the next round .
Hung rapidly gained a cult following around the world .
A William Hung fan site set up by Realtor Don Chin and his wife Laura , recorded over four million hits within its first week .
Hung subsequently appeared as a guest on a number of television programs including On Air with Ryan Seacrest , Entertainment Tonight , The Late Show With David Letterman , Countdown with Keith Olbermann , The Howard Stern Radio Show , The Ellen DeGeneres Show , Dateline NBC , and CBS's The Early Show .
He was also featured in numerous magazines and newspapers nationwide and parodied on Saturday Night Live and Celebrity Deathmatch .
On March 8 , Koch Entertainment announced that Hung had decided to sign a record deal .
The album has sold 195,000 copies , and reached # 3 on Amazon. com 's sales rankings .
Hung released a Christmas album , Hung for the Holidays , on October 19 , 2004 .
Hung 's third album , Miracle : Happy Summer from William Hung , was released July 12 , 2005 and became an instant failure .
Its poor reception perhaps indicates that Hung 's fifteen minutes of fame had finally run out .
A
Flash - based video of now twenty - year - old American Gary Brolsma lip- synching the song energetically on his webcam brought the Numa Numa phenomenon to the US video .
Brolsma has stated that he first discovered the song in the Japanese flash animation .
Brolsma first published his " Numa Numa Dance " on the Newgrounds site on December 6 , 2004 .
Since then it has popped up on hundreds of other websites and blogs , and he has made appearances on ABC's Good Morning America , NBC's The Tonight Show and VH1's Best Week Ever .
Brolsma is a resident of the state of New Jersey and is reportedly not happy with his fame , although he has created tweaked versions of the video since it became popular .
According to The New York Times , Brolsma has become an " unwilling and embarrassed Web celebrity . "
Brolsma has stopped taking phone calls from the media ; he canceled an appearance on NBC's Today Show on February 17 , 2005 , and he did not cooperate with The New York Times for their February 26 , 2005 article about him .
Ghyslain Raza ( born 1988 ) , from Canada , became known throughout the Internet in May 2003 as the " Star Wars Kid " when a video clip he recorded of himself was leaked online .
On November 4 , 2002 Raza made a video of himself swinging a golf ball retriever around as if it were a weapon .
Most believe he was imitating the Star Wars character Darth Maul with a lightsaber .
The video was filmed at the studio of Séminaire St - Joseph high school .
The tape was left forgotten in a basement for a few months .
On or around April 19 , 2003 , the original owner of the videotape discovered Raza 's recorded acts and immediately shared it with some friends .
Thinking that it would be a funny prank , they encoded it to a WMV file and shared it using the Kazaa peer - to - peer file sharing network , calling the videofile Jackass_starwars_funny.wmv .
Within two weeks , the file was downloaded several times .
An adapted version of the video was created , adding Star Wars music , texts , and lightsaber lights and sounds to Raza 's golf ball retriever .
According to Waxy.org , this was done by Bryan Dube , an employee from Raven Software .
Several gaming , technology and Star Wars - related sites began to host the video , which caused the video to be downloaded more and more .
Soon , people all over the world picked up the original and began making conversions of it , adding music , visual effects , and sounds , combining it with other well - known videos or scenes from films , for comic effect .
Raza reportedly suffered considerable embarrassment , in part because the video showed him to be overweight , and not particularly graceful .
The case raised privacy issues and was extensively reported in mainstream news media worldwide , including the New York Times , CBS News and BBC News .
The boy had to undergo therapy and counseling that began on October 12 and is currently still suffering chronic depression .
Mahir Cagri : " I KISS YOU !!!!!!" Mahir Cagri , a resident of Turkey , became an Internet celebrity in 1999 .
His picture - laden personal homepage , which exclaimed in broken English his love of the accordion and travel , was visited by millions and spawned numerous fansites and parodies .
Mahir claimed in various interviews that his personal webpage was hacked , with additions such as " I like sex " embedded into his webpage .
His website was quickly spread through word of mouth on the internet .
The website came at a time when " Internet phenomenon " was a new concept for Internet users , media , and the curious public .
Some quotes from his site : " I KISS YOU !!!!!!
" " Who is want to come TURKEY I can invitate .....
She can stay my home ........ " " I like sex " " I like music , I have many many music enstrumans my home I can play "
The tourist guy , is an Internet phenomenon consisting of a photograph of a tourist ( Péter Guzli ) that has appeared in many Photoshopped pictures after the September 11 , 2001 attacks .
The first one who claimed to be the tourist was the Brazilian businessman José Roberto Penteado .
When Penteado started to get media attention , including an offer to be in a Volkswagen commercial , a 25 year old Hungarian man named Péter Guzli came forward as the real tourist .
Guzli says , however , that he does not want publicity and did not originally release his last name .
Guzli took the photo on November 28 , 1997 , and was also responsible for the initial edit .
He edited the image for a few friends , not realizing it would spread so quickly across the Internet .
He first provided the original undoctored photo and several other photos from the same series as proof to a Hungarian newspaper .
Later on , Wired News examined the evidence and confirmed that Guzli was the real tourist guy .
Florence Foster Jenkins ( 1868 ) was an American soprano who became famous for her complete lack of singing ability .
she became tremendously popular in her unconventional way : her audiences apparently loved her for the amusement she provided rather than her musical ability .
Jenkins was firmly convinced of her greatness , comparing herself favourably to the renowned sopranos Frieda Hempel and Luisa Tetrazzini , and dismissed the laughter which often came from the audience during her performances as coming from her rivals consumed by " professional jealousy " .
Jenkins restricted her rare performances to a few favorite venues , and her annual recital at the Ritz - Carlton ballroom in New York City .
Attendance of her recitals was always limited to her loyal clubwomen and a select few others - she handled distribution of the coveted tickets herself .
At the age of 76 , Jenkins finally yielded to public demand and performed at Carnegie Hall on October 25 , 1944 .
So anticipated was the performance that tickets for the event sold out weeks in advance .
Jenkins died a month later .
Dick Assman is a Saskatchewan gas station owner whose name propelled him to international celebrity status in 1995 .
Assman , who worked at Petro - Canada 's Victoria Square Mall station in Regina , was discovered by David Letterman , who was amused by his name .
Assman was lavishly introduced on July 24 , 1995 , on The Late Show with David Letterman , where he was a nightly feature for about a month .
Live field units in Canada interviewed him for the show .
Over the weeks , Assman received a musical tribute from Tony Orlando , while Joe Namath declared himself an " Ass- maniac " .
Vancouver polling company Angus Reid reported that 49 percent of surveyed Canadians in September 1995 had heard of his name .
Assman received a number of contracts for commercial appearances , was asked to run for public office , and received many marriage proposals .
Assmania came to a close in August when Assman visited the Ed Sullivan Theater and was presented with a bouquet of roses by Letterman .
Noel Godin ( 1945 ) is a Belgian writer , critic , actor and notorious cream pie flinger or ‘ entarteur ’ .
Godin gained global attention in 1998 when his group ambushed Microsoft CEO Bill Gates in Brussels , pelting the software magnate with pies .
Godin claims his goal has long been to ‘ entarte ’ as many people like Gates as possible - people he feels are particularly self - important and lacking a sense of humor .
Godin , who uses the pseudonym ‘ Georges Le Gloupier ’ has also inspired an unknown number of followers around the world , who now regularly provide him with details about the whereabouts of various important potential targets .
It took 32 people to conduct the Bill Gates operation .
His followers take care to look as ridiculous as possible as they throw their tarts , smiling broadly , spouting anti-pretentious poetry and repeating " gloup , gloup , gloup . "
David Allen Bawden ( born 1959 ) , is an American citizen who was elected " Pope Michael I " by a group of six Conclavist or post - Sedevacantist Catholics , arguing that the elections of the last 6 popes were invalid because they are all modernists .
Sedevacantists argue that if the College of Cardinals will not or cannot elect a valid pope , ordinary Catholics can do so , under the principle of " Epikeia " ( Equity ) .
Acting on the basis of this , DavidBawden was elected Pope by six people on 1990 ( including himself and his parents ) .
He is still on the job to this day .
Henry Earl ( born 1949 ) is a homeless African - American man from Kentucky who is famous primarily because of his extensive police record , mostly for non-violent alcohol - related offenses .
Henry 's rise to fame was in large part due to the fact that the Fayette County Jail had a public web site which listed a person 's arrest record and mug shots .
Henry Earl had an extensive record , and a wide range of emotions expressed in the mug shots , from despondent to happy .
This page was linked to regularly by Internet news blogs - in particular , Fark.com and www.messedup.net.
The web site eventually had to be shut down due to the strain that was placed upon it .
Later , a Henry Earl website was made in tribute to him , by the admin of www.messedup.net, Heywood Jablomey .
Henry has made numerous talk show appearances and has been featured in national and international media venues , including MSNBC , the UK Sunday Mail , and Jimmy Kimmel Live .
In the shorthand of news coverage , law - enforcement officials said , the subtleties of who had really put the cases together and where important evidence originated often be lost .
Law - enforcement experts agreed that the enormous insider - trading investigation began with a tip to the Securities and Exchange Commission , not the United States Attorney 's office .
The S.E.C. developed much of the evidence and worked , as it usually does , with the prosecutor 's office to exert the force of criminal sanctions .
The enforcement director of the commission , Gary G. Lynch , said of Mr. Giuliani : '' He certainly was involved in the decision - making process .
But certainly there were other important players , as well . ''
Mr. Giuliani receives high marks for personally winning the conviction of Mr. Friedman in the Parking Violations Bureau scandal .
Often not noted , however , is that his office first received the case because a Federal informer in Chicago told investigators there that New York officials were taking payoffs .
Work of Others
The foundation of Mr. Giuliani 's reputation may have been the major cases against organized crime and a precedent - setting victory over the ruling '' commission ' ' of five Cosa Nostra families .
But several of the major Mafia cases were already well along when Mr. Giuliani took over the prosecutor 's office in 1983 , said his predecessor , John S. Martin Jr. Many leads that became the well - known Pizza Connection case were being pursued by officials in Brooklyn when Mr. Giuliani took control of the investigation .
'' I think it 's fair to say that Rudy took what was there and developed it further , '' Mr. Martin said .
Even Mr. Giuliani's harshest critics said he often acknowledged the roles of others in important cases .
But as his term went along and the press grew increasingly attracted to the ' ' superprosecutor ' ' image , Mr. Giuliani seemed to enjoy the limelight .
With Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato , Republican of New York , he went with drug agents to Washington Heights to demonstrate a drug purchase .
Later , a widely distributed photograph showed the Senator and the prosecutor posing in disguises and dark glasses .
Some said the escapade worked as an imaginative warning to the public about the increasing prevalence of drugs .
Others dismissed it as a publicity stunt .

Some 48 percent of US diplomats who would refuse to volunteer to work in Iraq cited disagreement with President George W. Bush ’s policy as a factor , according to a survey released Tuesday .
That reason ranked behind separation from family and security concerns , according to a survey by their union , the American Foreign Service Association .
In the survey in which 4,300 of the 11,500 US Foreign Service members responded , some 68 percent opposed forced assignments as unnecessary and undesirable .
… The survey also found that almost half of the US Foreign Service thinks Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is doing a “ poor job ” looking after their material and professional needs .
The survey revealed serious staff complaints about salaries and other personnel issues , as well as about staffing at the US embassy in Iraq .
( Original Article )
" The Stepford Wives " tells the chilling story of once smart , independent women who get abducted and turned into tamed , mindless robots .
I have a theory about a similarly subversive process that turns grown men once capable of independent and reasoned thought into robotic extremists .
Call them Stepford Republicans .
The nefarious transformation always occurs before the individual gets close to becoming a Republican president or vice president .
Stepford Wives become robotically subservient only to their husbands ; they pose no threat to the rest of us .
But Stepford Republicans become subservient to right - wing forces of corporatism , war and prejudice .
Once converted into mindless ideologues , Stepford Republicans are a threat to us all .
The prototype of a Stepford Republican is PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN .
After his apparent abduction and alteration , he became an instrument of corporate power in the White House : union - busting , downsizing , cutting school lunch funding .
This is the Reagan many remember : champion of the overdog .
But when Reagan was still a sentient being , he was actually a bleeding - heart advocate for working people .
He denounced budget cuts ( " millions of children have been deprived of milk once provided through the federal school lunch program " ) and tax cuts that " benefit the higher income brackets alone . "
He assailed corporate profiteering , and labeled a top Republican " the banner carrier for Wall Street . "
He hailed unions and complained that " labor has been handcuffed by the vicious Taft - Hartley law . "
In other words , before he was robotized , Ronald Reagan could be a warm , compassionate human being - and I offer a remarkable tape to prove my theory .
Many Americans have long suspected that VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY is an android .
What they may not know is that - before being Stepfordized into a neoconservative drone - he was capable of non-ideological thought that would allow him to choose a peace option over war , able to use human reason to figure out why invading Iraq would inevitably lead to " quagmire . "
This short video clip offers compelling evidence .
Today , MITT ROMNEY is such a robotically rabid spouter of social - conservative dogma that he's won the praise of radio rightists like Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham .
Offered as evidence of his Stepfordization is this video revealing a once human and tolerant Romney who seemed to care deeply about women 's rights and abortion rights , and resisted any connection to the policies of Reagan - Bush .
It was this pre-abduction Romney who boasted that he would do more for gay equality than Ted Kennedy .
JOHN MCCAIN was also horrifically rewired toward servile courtship of the Religious Right .
Dramatic evidence of McCain 's Stepfordization is caught on video : " Before " footage shows you a strong human speaking bravely against right - wing " agents of intolerance " like Jerry Falwell ; " after " footage reveals a lifeless , docile tool of those same forces .
Perhaps you can't accept my theory - despite the powerful taped evidence I offer - that these Republican icons are victims of Stepford - like abduction and transplant .
If so , I 'd like to hear an alternative theory as to why these individuals betray their own principles or intellect - why they turn themselves into fawning servants of economic forces or ideologies or social movements they once abhorred .
The blind pursuit of power , you say ?
I 'm simply unwilling to believe that human beings - even top Republicans - are so inherently opportunistic and corrupt .
I 'll stick with my abduction theory .

Bootstrap Percolation
What is this ?
Mathematics
&lambda = &pi2 / 18 = 0.548311 ...
Theory versus Experiment
&lambda = 0.245 ± 0.015 ,
different from the rigorous value above by more than a factor of two !
The reason for the discrepancy seems to be that the convergence to the limiting constant 0.548311 ... is extremely slow , so even very large simulations do not come very close .
In fact , combining the simulation results of [ 2 ] with the rigorous results of [ 6 ] , one may ( tentatively ) estimate that in order to get close to the limiting value , one would need to simulate a square of about
100,000,000,000,000,000,000 by 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 ( 1020 by 1020 ) sites ,
certainly well beyond the range of any computer !

Sibel Edmonds , meet Valerie Plame Wilson
Times Online ( UK ) :
The FBI has been accused of covering up a key case file detailing evidence against corrupt government officials and their dealings with a network stealing nuclear secrets .
The assertion follows allegations made in The Sunday Times two weeks ago by Sibel Edmonds , an FBI whistleblower , who worked on the agency 's investigation of the network .[.. ]
One of the documents relating to the case was marked 203A - WF - 210023 .
Last week , however , the FBI responded to a freedom of information request for a file of exactly the same number by claiming that it did not exist .
But The Sunday Times has obtained a document signed by an FBI official showing the existence of the file .
Edmonds believes the crucial file is being deliberately covered up by the FBI because its contents are explosive .
She accuses the agency of an " outright lie " . [.. ]
The anonymous letter names a high - level government official who was allegedly secretly recorded speaking to an official at the Turkish embassy between August and December 2001 .
It claims the government official warned a Turkish member of the network that they should not deal with a company called Brewster Jennings because it was a CIA front company investigating the nuclear black market .
The official 's warning came two years before Brewster Jennings was publicly outed when one of its staff , Valerie Plame , was revealed to be a CIA agent in a case that became a cause célèbre in the US .
This more than succesfull idea from New York agency JWT was made to promote their search for coats for the homeless during the freezing winter in New York .
The idea was to paint a giant homeless person on a wall and place coat hooks on the upper half of his body .
As people hang their donated coats on the hooks .
“ Donating your coat wo n’t stop people from sleeping on the streets , but it may stop them from dying on them . ”
The building managers were not happy .
Memos were sent .
Phone calls made .
But the wall got fixed and the installation got finished .

PLoS Biol 1 ( 1 ) : e27 doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0000027 .

Reproduced from http://anthro.palomar.edu/vary/ with permission from Dennis O'Neil .
A favorite book of mine is Evolution : A Scientific American Reader , a collection of articles on astronomy , cell biology , paleontology and anthropology from the print magazine .
One of my favorite chapters , " Skin Deep " by Nina Jablonski and George Chaplin , covers the evolution of human skin color .
Skin color results from the presence of the pigment melanin , an organic molecule that absorbs UV radiation and neutralizes free - radicals produced by UV radiation .
Why do we need worry about UV radiation ?
UV radiation causes mutations in skin cells leading to skin cancer , and also destroys the essential B vitamin , folate , which is involved in DNA synthesis .
The more melanin , the more protection against UV radiation and the darker the skin .
Hmm , if that is the case , why do not all humans have dark skin ?
Better to protect against cancer then , is n't it ?
The answer is that UV light also has another effect : it activates 7 - dehydrocholesterol into vitamin D3 .
Too much melanin will therefore lead to vitamin D3 deficiency .
This is n't much of a problem in the tropics where there is plenty of sunlight , but can be a issue at the margins of the world where sunlight is reduced .
There are two competing forces , then , affecting human skin tone : the need to protect against cancer and the need for vitamin D3 .
The interesting thing is that humans have evolved to carefully regulate the amount of UV light penetrating the skin , and hence carefully balancing the trade - off between vitamin D3 and cancer .
A recent review reports that skin reflectance is lowest ( i.e. melanin is highest ) at the equator , then gradually increases , about 8 % per 10° of latitude in the Northern Hemisphere and about 4 % per 10° of latitude in the Southern Hemisphere .
This pattern is inversely correlated with levels of UV irradiation , which are greater in the Southern than in the Northern Hemisphere .
There are , of course , exceptions to the rule , but these are informative in their own right .
For example , the Inuit natives of the arctic are dark - skinned .
This can be explained by the fact that their traditional animal - based diet provides plenty of vitamin D3 .
Another example is the difference in skin color between the dark skinned Bantu and light skinned Khoisan inhabiting Southern Africa .
It poses a puzzle unless one considers that the Khoisan are derived from one of the earliest migrations into Southern Africa , whereas the Bantu migrated from West Africa more recently , perhaps within the past 1000 years .
Jablonski and Chaplin end their essay by writing , " Our current knowledge of the evolution of human skin indicates that variations in skin color , like most of our physical attributes , can be explained by adaptation to the environment through natural selection .
We look ahead to the day when the vestiges of old scientific mistakes will be erased and replaced by a better understanding of human origins and diversity .
Our variation in skin color should be celebrated as one of the most visible manifestations of our evolution as a species . "

If you ’ve never seen any of the anti-Scientology videos of “ Anonymous , ” this clip might seem a bit strange .
While we would never compare Ralph Nader to the Church of Scientology , this spot - on parody is probably worth your 2 minutes and 21 seconds .
Unless you ’re one of those titans of industry who makes a million dollars a minute .
Then it probably is n’t .
A warning to steadfast Nader supporters :
The arguments presented in this clip are the same ones you ’ve heard and rejected before .
There ’s no new ground broken here , except for the Anonymous angle .
For those not in the know , Anonymous is a decentralized group of people determined to make life miserable for the Church of Scientology .
The video that inspired this Nader clip can be found below .
Message to Ralph Nader :
( via PoliticsTV )
Message to Scientology :
IN TODAY'S green world , hydroelectric dams are often unwelcome .
Though their power is renewable and , on the face of it , carbon - free , there are lots of bad things about them , too .
Blocking a river with a dam also blocks the movement of fish upstream to spawn and the movement of silt downstream to fertilise fields .
The vegetation overwhelmed by the rising waters decays to form methane — a far worse greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide .
The capital cost is huge .
And , not least , people are often displaced to make way for the new lake .
The question , therefore , is whether there is a way to get the advantages without suffering the disadvantages .
And the answer is that there may be .
The purpose of a dam is twofold .
To house the turbines that create the electricity and to provide a sufficient head of water pressure to drive them efficiently .
If it were possible to develop a turbine that did not need such a water - head to operate , and that could sit in the riverbed , then a dam would be unnecessary .
Such turbines could also be put in places that could not be dammed — the bottom of the sea , for example .
And that is just what is starting to happen , with the deployment of free - standing underwater turbines .
The big disadvantage of free - standing turbines is that they are less efficient in transforming the mechanical energy of water into electrical energy than turbines in dams are .
They are also subject to more wear and tear than turbines protected by huge amounts of concrete .
They can be hard to get at to repair and maintain .
And the generators they run , being electrical machines , need to be protected from the water that surrounds the rest of the turbine .
A discouraging list .
But in the past three decades computing power has become cheaper , helping developers to simulate the behaviour of water and turbine blades — something that is hard to do with paper , pen and formulas .
Moreover , prototypes can be built directly from the computer model .
All this has helped scientists and industry to solve the weaknesses inherent in free - standing turbines .
The first new design was by Alexander Gorlov , a Russian civil engineer who worked on the Aswan High Dam in Egypt .
He later moved to America where , with the financial assistance of the Department of Energy , he produced the first prototype of a turbine that could extract power from free - flowing currents “ without building any dam ” .
The Gorlov Helical Turbine as it is known , allows you to use any stream , whatever the direction of its flow .
The vertical helical structure , which gives the device its name , provides a stability that previous designs lacked .
It increases the amount of energy extracted from a stream from 20 % to 35 % .
In addition , as the shaft is vertical the electric generator can be installed on one end above the water — without any need of waterproof boxes .
In 2001 Mr Gorlov won the Edison patent award for his invention , and the turbines have now been commercialised by Lucid Energy Technologies , an American company , and are being tested in pilot projects in South Korea and North America .
A second design is by Philippe Vauthier , another immigrant to America ( he was originally a Swiss jeweller ) .
The turbines made by his company , UEK , are anchored to a submerged platform .
They are able to align themselves in the current like windsocks at an aerodrome so that they find the best position for power generation .
As they are easy to install and maintain , they are being used in remote areas of developing countries , as well .
Finally , a design by OpenHydro , an Irish company , is not just a new kind of turbine but also a new design of underwater electric generator .
Generators ( roughly speaking ) consist of magnets moving relative to coils .
Why not have the magnets encapsulated in the external , fast moving part of a turbine ?
The turbine is then installed in an external housing , containing the coils .
The result looks like an open - centre turbine contained within a tube .
OpenHydro's generators do not need lubricant , which considerably reduces the need for maintenance , and are said to be safer for marine life .
These new designs , combined with the fashion for extracting energy from the environment by windmills and solar cells , means money that previously shied away from the field is now becoming available .
According to New Energy Finance , a specialist consultancy , investments in companies proposing to make or deploy free - standing turbines have risen from $ 13 m in 2004 to $ 156 m in 2007 .
Projects already underway include the installation by American Verdant Power of a tidal - turbine in New York 's East River and pilot projects in Nova Scotia with UEK , OpenHydro and Canadian Clean Current .
And that , optimists hope , is just the beginning .
Soon , many more investors will be searching for treasures buried in the ocean sea beds — or , rather , flowing above them .

Text version below transcribed directly from audio ]
Thank you very much , Gertrude Mongella , for your dedicated work that has brought us to this point , distinguished delegates , and guests : I would like to thank the Secretary General for inviting me to be part of this important United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women .
This is truly a celebration , a celebration of the contributions women make in every aspect of life : in the home , on the job , in the community , as mothers , wives , sisters , daughters , learners , workers , citizens , and leaders .
It is also a coming together , much the way women come together every day in every country .
We come together in fields and factories , in village markets and supermarkets , in living rooms and board rooms .
Whether it is while playing with our children in the park , or washing clothes in a river , or taking a break at the office water cooler , we come together and talk about our aspirations and concern .
And time and again , our talk turns to our children and our families .
However different we may appear , there is far more that unites us than divides us .
We share a common future , and we are here to find common ground so that we may help bring new dignity and respect to women and girls all over the world , and in so doing bring new strength and stability to families as well .
By gathering in Beijing , we are focusing world attention on issues that matter most in our lives -- the lives of women and their families : access to education , health care , jobs and credit , the chance to enjoy basic legal and human rights and to participate fully in the political life of our countries .
There are some who question the reason for this conference .
Let them listen to the voices of women in their homes , neighborhoods , and workplaces .
There are some who wonder whether the lives of women and girls matter to economic and political progress around the globe .
Let them look at the women gathered here and at Huairou -- the homemakers and nurses , the teachers and lawyers , the policymakers and women who run their own businesses .
It is conferences like this that compel governments and peoples everywhere to listen , look , and face the world ’s most pressing problems .
Was n’t it after all -- after the women ’s conference in Nairobi ten years ago that the world focused for the first time on the crisis of domestic violence ?
Earlier today , I participated in a World Health Organization forum .
In that forum , we talked about ways that government officials , NGOs , and individual citizens are working to address the health problems of women and girls .
Tomorrow , I will attend a gathering of the United Nations Development Fund for Women .
There , the discussion will focus on local -- and highly successful -- programs that give hard - working women access to credit so they can improve their own lives and the lives of their families .
What we are learning around the world is that if women are healthy and educated , their families will flourish .
If women are free from violence , their families will flourish .
If women have a chance to work and earn as full and equal partners in society , their families will flourish .
And when families flourish , communities and nations do as well .
That is why every woman , every man , every child , every family , and every nation on this planet does have a stake in the discussion that takes place here .
Over the past 25 years , I have worked persistently on issues relating to women , children , and families .
Over the past two and a half years , I 've had the opportunity to learn more about the challenges facing women in my own country and around the world .
I have met new mothers in Indonesia , who come together regularly in their village to discuss nutrition , family planning , and baby care .
I have met working parents in Denmark who talk about the comfort they feel in knowing that their children can be cared for in safe , and nurturing after - school centers .
I have met women in South Africa who helped lead the struggle to end apartheid and are now helping to build a new democracy .
I have met with the leading women of my own hemisphere who are working every day to promote literacy and better health care for children in their countries .
I have met women in India and Bangladesh who are taking out small loans to buy milk cows , or rickshaws , or thread in order to create a livelihood for themselves and their families .
I have met the doctors and nurses in Belarus and Ukraine who are trying to keep children alive in the aftermath of Chernobyl .
The great challenge of this conference is to give voice to women everywhere whose experiences go unnoticed , whose words go unheard .
Women comprise more than half the world ’s population , 70 % of the world ’s poor , and two - thirds of those who are not taught to read and write .
We are the primary caretakers for most of the world ’s children and elderly .
Yet much of the work we do is not valued -- not by economists , not by historians , not by popular culture , not by government leaders .
At this very moment , as we sit here , women around the world are giving birth , raising children , cooking meals , washing clothes , cleaning houses , planting crops , working on assembly lines , running companies , and running countries .
Women also are dying from diseases that should have been prevented or treated .
They are watching their children succumb to malnutrition caused by poverty and economic deprivation .
They are being denied the right to go to school by their own fathers and brothers .
They are being forced into prostitution , and they are being barred from the bank lending offices and banned from the ballot box .
Those of us who have the opportunity to be here have the responsibility to speak for those who could not .
As an American , I want to speak for those women in my own country , women who are raising children on the minimum wage , women who ca n’t afford health care or child care , women whose lives are threatened by violence , including violence in their own homes .
I want to speak up for mothers who are fighting for good schools , safe neighborhoods , clean air , and clean airwaves ; for older women , some of them widows , who find that , after raising their families , their skills and life experiences are not valued in the marketplace ; for women who are working all night as nurses , hotel clerks , or fast food chefs so that they can be at home during the day with their children ; and for women everywhere who simply do n’t have time to do everything they are called upon to do each and every day .
Speaking to you today , I speak for them , just as each of us speaks for women around the world who are denied the chance to go to school , or see a doctor , or own property , or have a say about the direction of their lives , simply because they are women .
The truth is that most women around the world work both inside and outside the home , usually by necessity .
We need to understand there is no one formula for how women should lead our lives .
That is why we must respect the choices that each woman makes for herself and her family .
Every woman deserves the chance to realize her own God - given potential .
But we must recognize that women will never gain full dignity until their human rights are respected and protected .
Our goals for this conference , to strengthen families and societies by empowering women to take greater control over their own destinies , cannot be fully achieved unless all governments -- here and around the world -- accept their responsibility to protect and promote internationally recognized human rights .
The --
The international community has long acknowledged and recently reaffirmed at Vienna that both women and men are entitled to a range of protections and personal freedoms , from the right of personal security to the right to determine freely the number and spacing of the children they bear .
No one --
No one should be forced to remain silent for fear of religious or political persecution , arrest , abuse , or torture .
Tragically , women are most often the ones whose human rights are violated .
Even now , in the late 20th century , the rape of women continues to be used as an instrument of armed conflict .
Women and children make up a large majority of the world ’s refugees .
And when women are excluded from the political process , they become even more vulnerable to abuse .
I believe that now , on the eve of a new millennium , it is time to break the silence .
It is time for us to say here in Beijing , and for the world to hear , that it is no longer acceptable to discuss women ’s rights as separate from human rights .
These abuses have continued because , for too long , the history of women has been a history of silence .
Even today , there are those who are trying to silence our words .
But the voices of this conference and of the women at Huairou must be heard loudly and clearly :
It is a violation of human rights when babies are denied food , or drowned , or suffocated , or their spines broken , simply because they are born girls .
It is a violation of human rights when women and girls are sold into the slavery of prostitution for human greed -- and the kinds of reasons that are used to justify this practice should no longer be tolerated .
It is a violation of human rights when women are doused with gasoline , set on fire , and burned to death because their marriage dowries are deemed too small .
It is a violation of human rights when individual women are raped in their own communities and when thousands of women are subjected to rape as a tactic or prize of war .
It is a violation of human rights when a leading cause of death worldwide among women ages 14 to 44 is the violence they are subjected to in their own homes by their own relatives .
It is a violation of human rights when young girls are brutalized by the painful and degrading practice of genital mutilation .
It is a violation of human rights when women are denied the right to plan their own families , and that includes being forced to have abortions or being sterilized against their will .
If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference , let it be that human rights are women ’s rights and women ’s rights are human rights once and for all .
1
Let us not forget that among those rights are the right to speak freely -- and the right to be heard .
Women must enjoy the rights to participate fully in the social and political lives of their countries , if we want freedom and democracy to thrive and endure .
It is indefensible that many women in nongovernmental organizations who wished to participate in this conference have not been able to attend -- or have been prohibited from fully taking part .
Let me be clear .
Freedom means the right of people to assemble , organize , and debate openly .
It means respecting the views of those who may disagree with the views of their governments .
It means not taking citizens away from their loved ones and jailing them , mistreating them , or denying them their freedom or dignity because of the peaceful expression of their ideas and opinions .
In my country , we recently celebrated the 75th anniversary of Women ’s Suffrage .
It took 150 years after the signing of our Declaration of Independence for women to win the right to vote .
It took 72 years of organized struggle , before that happened , on the part of many courageous women and men .
It was one of America ’s most divisive philosophical wars .
But it was a bloodless war .
Suffrage was achieved without a shot being fired .
But we have also been reminded , in V - J Day observances last weekend , of the good that comes when men and women join together to combat the forces of tyranny and to build a better world .
We have seen peace prevail in most places for a half century .
We have avoided another world war .
But we have not solved older , deeply - rooted problems that continue to diminish the potential of half the world ’s population .
Now it is the time to act on behalf of women everywhere .
If we take bold steps to better the lives of women , we will be taking bold steps to better the lives of children and families too .
Families rely on mothers and wives for emotional support and care .
Families rely on women for labor in the home .
And increasingly , everywhere , families rely on women for income needed to raise healthy children and care for other relatives .
As long as discrimination and inequities remain so commonplace everywhere in the world , as long as girls and women are valued less , fed less , fed last , overworked , underpaid , not schooled , subjected to violence in and outside their homes -- the potential of the human family to create a peaceful , prosperous world will not be realized .
Let --
Let this conference be our -- and the world ’s -- call to action .
Let us heed that call so we can create a world in which every woman is treated with respect and dignity , every boy and girl is loved and cared for equally , and every family has the hope of a strong and stable future .
That is the work before you .
That is the work before all of us who have a vision of the world we want to see -- for our children and our grandchildren .
The time is now .
We must move beyond rhetoric .
We must move beyond recognition of problems to working together , to have the comment efforts to build that common ground we hope to see .
God 's blessing on you , your work , and all who will benefit from it .
Godspeed and thank you very much .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - A computer program that learns to decode sounds from different languages in the same way that a baby does helps to shed new light on how people learn to talk , researchers said on Tuesday .

They said the finding casts doubt on theories that babies are born knowing all the possible sounds in all of the world ’s languages .
“ The debate in language acquisition is around the question of how much specific information about language is hard - wired into the brain of the infant and how much of the knowledge that infants acquire about language is something that can be explained by relatively general purpose learning systems , ” said James McClelland , a psychology professor at Stanford University in Palo Alto , California .
McClelland says his computer program supports the theory that babies systematically sort through sounds until they understand the structure of a language .
“ The problem the child confronts is how many categories are there and how should I think about it .
We ’re trying to propose a method that solves that problem , ” said McClelland , whose work appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Expanding on some existing ideas , he and a team of international researchers developed a computer model that resembles the brain processes a baby uses when learning about speech .
He and colleagues tested their model by exposing it to “ training sessions ” that consisted of analyzing recorded speech in both English and Japanese between mothers and babies in a lab .
What they found is the computer was able to learn basic vowel sounds right along with baby .
“ It learns how many sounds there are .
It figures that out , ” he said in a telephone interview .
And if the computer can do it , he said , a baby can , too .
“ In the past , people have tried to argue it was n’t possible for any machine to learn these things , and so it had to be hard - wired ( in humans ) , ” he said .
“ Those arguments , in my view , were not particularly well grounded . ”

The Council of Mortgage Lenders said 27,100 homes , the highest figure since 1999 , were taken over by lenders after people fell behind with repayments .
The figure for the UK is more than the 22,400 in 2006 , but not as extreme as the CML had forecast .
It is still a sharp rise on the 8,500 of 2003 .
And the CML warned that the number of repossessions was likely to rise again in 2008 as the credit crunch tightened .
Meanwhile , the numbers of mortgages behind on payments rose by 8.6 % compared to 2006 , the organisation , which represents mortgage lenders , said .
' Wider issues '
Another bill would come up which you would be paying on a credit card and you would have to pay the interest on the cards ... all that adds up
Kevin Allen , who faced repossession
Homeowners ' on the rack '
Added cost pressures on homeowners are expected this year , owing to higher energy and food bills , while more than a million people are coming off fixed - rate mortgages .
Michael Coogan , CML director general , said : " The number of repossessions is likely to be higher in 2008 as a result of wider issues in the economy and the mortgage funding markets . "
He said that " no one is necessarily to blame for this " but called for " a fair and reasonable balance of responsibility " .
Mr Coogan said consumers , their advisers and lenders , and the system of state support , all had a role to play to ensure " repossessions are minimised " .
Tighter credit market
The rise in repossessions was likely to be down primarily to the credit crunch , with lenders taking fewer risks with borrowers who were already over - extended .
Charities have previously warned about some homeowners using credit cards to pay their mortgages , but with credit increasingly difficult to come by , many have been struggling to meet repayments .
Most mortgage possession claims do not end with the owner losing their home , because the lender often comes to an arrangement with the borrower to pay off the arrears .
Repossession figures are still far below levels in the early 1990s
But Sue Edwards , head of consumer policy at Citizens Advice , said :
" Our evidence shows that lenders are not always doing everything they can to help borrowers in trouble , all too often piling on extra charges and being too quick to take court action rather than being prepared to negotiate affordable repayment arrangements .
" We want to see all lenders being reasonable when dealing with customers who do get into trouble , and taking court action for possession only as a last resort . "
And Shadow Housing Minister Grant Shapps said : " These figures sadly make a mockery of Labour 's hollow claims to have helped more people onto the property ladder . "
Interest rates
Despite the latest rise in repossessions , figures are still much lower than the numbers in the early 1990s .
when they reached 75,500 repossessions a year .
The CML figures have been released the day after many of the largest - but not all - mortgage lenders announced they would pass on the 0.25 % cut in interest rates in full to customers .
These lenders said the cut on the standard variable rate would come in early March .
Simon Rubinsohn , chief economist of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors , predicted further interest rates in the coming months , offering more relief to homeowners .
Godfrey Blight , chairman of the Intermediary Mortgages Lenders Association , said arrears and repossessions would rise in 2008 , but not " catastrophically so " .
Political row
The figures have prompted political debate .
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said : " We must take steps to ensure that repossession is only ever a last resort - by making financial advice compulsory at the point repossession claims are issued . "
For the Conservatives , shadow housing minister Grant Shapps said : " These figures sadly make a mockery of Labour 's hollow claims to have helped more people on to the property ladder .
" The Government needs to urgently address the issue of affordable housing . "
A Treasury spokesman said : " The Government 's Housing Finance Review , to be published in the Budget , will explore options to increase the uptake of affordable long - term fixed - rate mortgages . "
On Monday , the Insolvency Service said the number of people declared insolvent in 2007 was 106,645 , just slightly below the record high in 2006 , while bankruptcies were up 2.4 % .
Experts said it would be increasingly difficult for people to borrow their way out of trouble .
Those who fear getting into trouble with mortgage repayments have been urged to speak to their lender .
In a victory for gun-rights advocates , the federal government is preparing to relax a decades - old ban on bringing loaded firearms into national parks .
Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said Friday that his department would suggest new regulations by the end of April that could bring federal rules into line with state laws concerning guns in parks and public lands .
His announcement came in a letter to Sen. Michael D. Crapo ( R - Idaho ) , one of 50 senators who have written to him about the issue .
Senators from both parties have backed a drive to repeal the ban , which has been in place in some parks for at least 100 years .
The proposed rule change would let visitors carry loaded weapons into national parks in states with few gun restrictions , such as Montana .
California is not one of those states .
Its law prohibits loaded guns in state parks unless they are locked inside a car trunk or are similarly inaccessible .
“ It ’s a place of refuge , not a place for hunting , and it ’s patrolled by state park rangers who are there to protect visitors , ” California State Parks spokesman Roy Stearns said .
Gun rights advocates , notably the National Rifle Assn. , have said the ban infringes on their 2nd Amendment rights to bear arms and their ability to defend themselves from predators , both human and animal .
“ If you ’re hiking in the backcountry and there is a problem with a criminal or an aggressive animal , there ’s no 911 box where you can call police and have a 60 - second response time , ” said Gary S. Marbut , president of the Montana Shooting Sports Assn .
Kempthorne ’s decision to review the ban was hailed by the NRA .
“ This is an important step in the right direction , ” said the organization ’s chief lobbyist , Chris W. Cox .
On the other hand , the National Parks Conservation Assn. called Kempthorne ’s action “ alarming . ”
Thomas C. Kiernan , the group ’s president , said loosening the ban would be “ a blow to the national parks and the 300 million visitors who enjoy them every year . ”
His view is echoed by gun-control advocates and some rangers who say that permitting firearms would be dangerous for visitors and wildlife and would alter the national park experience .
“ Parks have long been sanctuaries for both animals and people , ” said Charles R. “ Butch ” Farabee , a former acting superintendent at Montana ’s Glacier National Park who is retired .
“ There need to be places in this country where people can feel secure without guns and know that the guy in the campground across the way does not have one . ”
Although a federal rule change would not directly affect California , George Durkee , a board member of the U.S. Park Rangers Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police who works at Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks east of Fresno , worries about gun owners from other states : “ Somebody who says , ‘ Oh , well , I can now carry a gun in national parks , ’ and does n’t read the fine print will just figure he can carry one in Yosemite . ”
The federal government would not cede authority over firearms in national parks to the states , said Interior Department spokesman Chris Paolino , but would like to reflect the policies of host states .
Paolino said the department would also take into consideration the ban on firearms in federal buildings .
Weapons originally were prohibited in national parks to prevent “ opportunistic poaching ” of wildlife , said Frank Buono , a former assistant superintendent of Joshua Tree National Park , east of Palm Springs .
A 1908 Yellowstone National Park regulation , for example , required that visitors “ having firearms , traps , nets , seines or explosives ” surrender the weapons at the entrance unless they received written permission from the park superintendent .
A similar policy was in effect at most parks for decades .
Then the Reagan administration in 1983 required that visitors unload and store their firearms before entering most parks .
Supporters of the repeal effort note that state gun laws apply to federal land managed by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management , and they think that should be the case in national parks and wildlife refuges as well .
Half of the Senate seems to agree .
Nine Democrats and 41 Republicans have signed letters to Kempthorne calling on him to lift the gun ban .
“ We do not believe that allowing law - abiding citizens to transport and carry firearms -- rather than forcing them to disassemble or store them in their trunks -- will increase the chances that they will be tempted to violate prohibitions on discharge , ” one group wrote .
In campaigning to repeal the ban , the NRA hoped to add to a string of recent victories that included blocking an effort in Congress to give local law enforcement officials access to federal gun purchase data and a move in Virginia to require background checks for buyers at gun shows .
In a measure of the bipartisan support for relaxing gun laws , a majority of Congress -- 55 senators and 250 House members -- recently urged the Supreme Court to strike down the District of Columbia ’s handgun ban , one of the nation ’s strictest .
Advocates of allowing loaded guns in national parks believe it is foremost an issue of ending what they see as an unconstitutional infringement on their right to bear arms .
But they also contend that park visitors are “ increasingly vulnerable ” to violent crime .
“ While park rangers now use bulletproof vests and automatic weapons to enforce the law , regular Americans in states where conceal - and - carry law exists are denied the opportunity for self - defense , ” Sen .
Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) said in “ talking points ” distributed by his office .
The National Park Service says there were 116,588 reported offenses in national parks in 2006 , the most recent year for which data are available , including 11 killings , 35 rapes or attempted rapes , 61 robberies , 16 kidnappings and 261 aggravated assaults .
Supporters also think gun owners should be able to protect themselves against dangerous animals , dismissing arguments that firearms would ruin the park experience .
“ An attack , whether by an animal or a criminal , would degrade the experience of park visitors more , ” NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said .
The park service said there were four bear attacks last year : two in Yellowstone , one in Sequoia and one in Grand Teton .
There were none in 2006 .
Officials at Glacier -- which recorded 10 deaths from grizzly bear attacks between 1967 and 1998 -- said the last attack was in 2005 , when two hikers were mauled .
One of the victims , Johan Otter , an Escondido man who , with his daughter , was seriously injured , said the idea that a gun could have stopped the 400 - pound bear that charged him is naive .
“ We only had , like , half a second between seeing the bear and the impact , ” Otter said .
“ Most likely , if you shoot , you ’re going to hurt the animal .
It ’s just going to get even more mad at you .
The minute they ’re on top of you , there ’s no way you can pull a trigger . ”
Organizations that represent current and retired park workers oppose a repeal , saying it would endanger visitors , rangers and wildlife , and change the parks ’ character .
Bill Wade , executive council chairman of the Coalition of National Park Service Retirees , said people could be discouraged from visiting certain parks , such as Shenandoah National Park in Virginia , where he served as superintendent .
“ How many of you would want to go out there if you knew that people were running up and down the Appalachian Trail with guns ? ”

Network security firm Sophos recently published a study on what it terms WiFi " piggybacking , " or logging on to someone 's open 802.11b/g/n network without their knowledge or permission .
According to the company 's study , which was carried out on behalf of The Times , 54 percent of the respondents have gone WiFi freeloading , or as Sophos put it , " admitted breaking the law [ in the UK ] . "
Amazingly , accessing an unsecured , wide - open WiFi network without permission is illegal in some places , and not just in the UK .
An Illinois man was arrested and fined $ 250 in 2006 for using an open network without permission , while a Michigan man who parked his car in front of a café and snarfed its free WiFi was charged this past May with " Fraudulent access to computers , computer systems , and computer networks . "
On top of that , it 's common to read stories about WiFi " stealing " in the mainstream media .
It 's time to put an end to this silliness .
Using an open WiFi network is no more " stealing " than is listening to the radio or watching TV using the old rabbit ears .
If the WiFi waves come to you and can be accessed without hacking , there should be no question that such access is legal and morally OK .
If your neighbor runs his sprinkler and accidentally waters your yard , do you owe him money ?
Have you done something wrong ?
Have you ripped off the water company ?
Of course not .
So why is it that when it comes to WiFi , people start talking about theft ?
The issue is going to come to a head soon because more and more consumer electronics devices are WiFi-enabled , and many of them , including Apple 's iPhone and most Skype phones we 've used , come ready out of the box to auto - connect to open WiFi networks .
Furthermore , as laptop sales continue to grow even beyond desktops , the use of open WiFi is only going to grow along with it .
Steal this WiFi connection !
When you steal something , there 's typically a victim .
With WiFi , Sophos thinks the ISPs are the victims .
" Stealing WiFi Internet access may feel like a victimless crime , but it deprives ISPs of revenue , " according to Sophos ' senior technology consultant Graham Cluley .
Furthermore , " if you 've hopped onto your next door neighbors ' wireless broadband connection to illegally download movies and music from the ' Net , chances are that you are also slowing down their Internet access and impacting on their download limit . "
In Sophos ' view , then , both ISPs and everyday subscribers can be victims .
In one fell swoop , " stealing WiFi " gets mentioned in the same breath as " illegally " downloading movies and music .
The fact is , people join open WiFis for all manner of reasons : to check e-mail , surf the web , look up directions to some place , etc .
Those do n't sound like nefarious activities , however , and certainly not activities which are likely to get someone in trouble .
Of course if you run an open WAP ( wireless access point ) and it is heavily used for just e-mail , you could still hit your bandwidth cap ( if you even have one ) , but that has to happen only once for that user to figure out what 's up , and fix the problem .
And let 's be honest : it is their problem .
No one forced that user to install a WAP or to leave it wide open .
We 'll get back to this in a minute .
The argument that using open WiFi networks deprives ISPs of significant revenue is also a red herring .
Take the case of public WiFi hotspots : official hotspots are n't that difficult to find in major cities — every public library in Chicago has open WiFi , for instance .
Are the public libraries and the countless other free hotspot providers helping defraud ISPs ?
No , they 're not .
There 's no law that using the Internet requires payment of a fee to an ISP , and the myriad public hotspots prove this .
Really , there 's only one time when you could argue that an ISP is being gypped , and that 's when someone is repeatedly using his neighbor 's open WiFi in lieu of paying for his own service .
Is this really wrong ?
Let 's consider some parallel examples .
If the man in question were given a key and told that he could enter his neighbor 's house whenever he wanted to use a PC to access the Internet , would this be wrong ?
Of course not .
They key here ( pun intended ) is the " permission " given by the owner of the home .
Our leeching friend would clearly be in the wrong if he were breaking into the house , of course , because he would be sidestepping something clearly set up to keep him out .
If he has permission , I suppose one could argue that it 's still not right , but you wo n't find a court that will punish such a person , nor will you find too many people thrilled at the idea that someone else can tell them who they can and can't allow into their homes for what purposes .
Some people leave their wireless access points wide open deliberately .
A friend of mine and recent seminary graduate lived in a campus - owned apartment building .
In addition to being a man of the cloth , Peter is a longtime Linux user and open - source advocate .
While living here in Chicago , he got his DSL from Speakeasy and shared the connection with others in his building ... and anyone else who needed a quick Internet fix ( Speakeasy even encouraged this ) .
He even positioned his router so that anyone in the church across the street could pick up a signal .
Obviously , not everyone is like Peter .
But despite easy - to - read instructions and a plethora of warnings about the need to secure your WAP , some people just can't be bothered to enable the most basic security settings .
To the person with a laptop and a sudden need to check e-mail or surf the web , it 's not possible to tell who is leaving their access points open deliberately and who just plain does n't care .
The access point is there and the virtual doors are unlocked , so why not take advantage of it if you 're in need ?
A couple of caveats : be familiar with the law of the land .
As the examples at the beginning of this story show , it 's illegal to access a WAP without permission — even if it 's wide open — in some places .
Also , you should never use an open point for anything illegal or even unneighborly .
Do n't log onto the first " linksys " WAP you see and fire up a torrent for your favorite , just - released Linux distro .
And as always , do n't leave your own 802.11b/ g/n router wide open unless you 're comfortable with random surfers using your ' Net access for their own purposes .
Open WiFi is clearly here to stay .
Dr. Stan's Plan to Save Earth From Asteroid " Let 's blow it up ! " not the answer , says astronaut on spacewalk .
Feb . 11 , 2008  -- Astronaut Stanley
Love will be walking in space today to help attach yet another new section of the International Space Station , but he has even bigger plans in mind .
He 'd like to save the world .
Love , who is aboard the space shuttle Atlantis , has hatched a a plan with his colleague Ed Lu to prevent Earth from getting hit by an asteroid .
" Many methods that people have talked about involve things like nuclear weapons — let 's blow it up !
Or smash something into [ an asteroid ] at eight kilometers per second and blow it apart , " Love said .
" Those methods are a great way of getting kinetic energy into the target , but you are not quite sure what you are going to get after that .
Instead of one big rock , you might have a swarm of smaller rocks . "
Love 's and Lu's plan would send a spacecraft into orbit around any asteroid with Earth in its sights .
" You sidle up next to it , and you just hover there for like a year .
Now you need a good long warning time on the asteroid because during your year of hovering , because of the very tiny gravitational pull between the spacecraft and the asteroid , that amount of pull is about the same amount of thrust as gluing a housefly beating its wings , to an asteroid , " Love said .
" A tiny amount of thrust , but build up over a year , then given 20 years to drift , in that direction , you can turn an asteroid strike into a miss . "
Before he saves Earth from an asteroid strike , Love has to help out with a spacewalk .
The astronomer - turned - astronaut was scheduled for one spacewalk during STS 122 , the current shuttle mission , but because of the unexpected and unexplained illness of his colleague , Hans Schlegel , he will go out into space twice .
Love and astronaut Rex Walheim will prepare the $ 2 billion European Columbus module for installation on the International Space Station .
It 's no big deal , he told ABC News , in an interview before his launch .
" Mainly it is an attitude of mental flexibility .
Do n't be married to the plan , " he said .
" You know that at any moment the plan may change and the finely crafted choreography you worked out may not work out that day and you may have to do something else . "
Love is enthusiastic about his mission .
" I am very psyched in a wow gee whiz way .
It is hard to explain .
I think enthusiasm and professionalism go hand - in - hand , " he said .
" You are not going to be a very good professional if you do n't enjoy what you doing .
But pure enthusiasm without professionalism is dangerous . "
He certainly plans to stop once in awhile when he is on the spacewalk and look around .
" There will be times when I need to hang tight , when I do n't have something specific that I have to do and those are the moments that everyone has advised me , take those moments and look around , savor the moment — be where you are and appreciate it , " he said .
What makes this space shuttle mission to the International Space Station important ?
Love says it means the space station will truly be international now .
" This European community has invested their resources , their people , and their enthusiasm in building this Columbus module that we are adding to the space station , " Love said .
" Right now we have physical parts of the space station from the United States , from Canada and from Russia and now we are adding in another partner and that partner itself is composed of the many member nations of ESA . "
The newest partner is the 11 - nation consortium of the European Space Agency .
What would he like to do next ?
Love would n't mind going to the moon .
While it may be a forbidding place , so is , he says , Antarctica .
" I imagine the first people to go to Antarctica found nothing there but ice and wind and cold , now of course Antarctica is like the premier science lab for the Earth and glaciology and geology and atmosphere sciences .
All this great stuff [ is ] going on there in this place where it was worth your life just to look at 100 years ago , " he said .
" So I think maybe the moon will be like that in 100 years — an amazing science lab where people go to find out stuff about our world and our universe " .
As an astronomer he is really hoping for a chance to see the stars from a different angle .
" I expect the light pollution on the space station is as bad as it is in Houston .
I am not sure how good a view I am going to get , " he said .
" I have had people come back and say if you get a chance , in the shuttle cockpit , turn off all the lights during a night pass when nobody is working and look out the window .
It is really cool . "
Maverick economist Jeff Rubin , who is at the top of his game these days , says Canadians should n't be surprised to see gasoline at $ 1.50 a litre and oil at $ 150 ( U.S. ) a barrel within the next four years – possibly much sooner .
Oil depletion from existing fields is outpacing new supply , argues the chief economist of CIBC World Markets , and what supply the International Energy Agency and other tracking bodies are optimistically counting on involves complex and costly " mega - projects " that are likely to see major delays .
And this , according to a CIBC report released yesterday , does n't even account for the unpredictable : escalating geopolitical tensions and extreme weather events .
" What we do n't appreciate is that the oil - sands delays ( we 've seen ) are not a unique story .
It 's happening in the very fields where the world is expecting to get its future supply , " Rubin told the Toronto Star .
" Do n't think of today 's prices as a spike .
Do n't think of them as a temporary aberration .
Think of them as the beginning of a new era . "
The impact on the Canadian dollar will also be felt , he said .
" Notwithstanding what 's happening to the dollar now , if oil goes to $ 150 and the Canadian oil sands become the marginal barrel of oil ( the dollar ) is going up . "
It would n't be Rubin 's first break - from - the - pack forecast .
For more than a decade the 53 - year - old economist has sparked controversy by calling economic outcomes that most of his peers have dismissed as long shots .
He supports the peak oil theory and believes we 've already passed the peak in conventional production .
He sees carbon priced at $ 30 a tonne and a continental cap on emissions within three years .
And he says if we 're serious about fighting climate change , consumers should face higher energy prices to spark meaningful conservation .
Sometimes he nails it .
He correctly predicted in 2000 that oil would average $ 50 by mid-decade and , two years ago , was right when he said oil would hit $ 100 by the end of 2007 ( though Goldman Sachs made the prediction a year earlier ) .
Rubin also suggested back in 2005 the Canadian dollar was on its way to parity with the greenback , and last June predicted it would happen before year 's end .
It did .
" I think my calls have been pretty good , " said Rubin , who first grabbed the spotlight in 1989 when he went against the grain and correctly predicted a collapse in the Toronto real estate market .
But sometimes his calls have fallen flat .
In 1992 , Rubin forecast an economic recovery from the 1990 - '91 recession and for several years nothing much happened .
And in 1995 he called for more aggressive cuts to the federal deficit , only to backtrack a year later and blame the deficit payoff for sluggish economic growth .
More recently , he predicted the S&P / TSX composite index would hit 15,000 by the end of 2007 , but reality came nowhere close .
And now he is locked into a prediction it will reach 16,200 by the end of this year at a time when the economy is slowing .
He stands by it .
" The TSX call is n't looking good right now , but we 'll see if that 's a one - quarter head fake , " he said , adding that merger and acquisition activity in the energy sector will carry his prediction .
David Detomasi , a professor of international business at Queen 's School of Business , called Rubin 's track record " pretty good " but calls his oil analysis a " bit of an exaggeration . "

" We should get a moderation in the price , because we 're getting a bit more of a build - up in the system , " said Detomasi , pointing out that $ 60 a barrel is a more realistic long - term projection .
Many economists , expecting oil demand to drop alongside a U.S. economic slowdown , also see the price falling .
" I 'm not saying prices will drop significantly , but they ought to drop , " he said .
Though he admitted a lot could happen by 2012 .
" There are quite a few ifs , ands and buts between now and $ 150 . "
An Algerian living in Britain who was wrongly accused of being involved in the 9/11 terror attacks tells for the first time today of how his life has been ' ruined ' by the police and the Crown Prosecution Service .
Lotfi Raissi , 33 , a pilot who had trained in the United States before moving to England , was the first person in the world to be arrested in connection with the atrocities .
He was suspected of teaching several of the 9/11 terrorists to fly planes .
Raissi was arrested by British police at his home in west London 10 days after the attacks on the World Trade Centre , following intelligence passed on by the US authorities .
He was held for almost five months in Belmarsh high - security prison before being released without charge and subsequently exonerated .
Last week the Court of Appeal ruled that the High Court had been wrong to block him from suing the government for compensation , paving the way for a ground - breaking claim for damages .
' I feared for my life in court and inside prison , ' Raissi said .
' They moved me from the high - security unit after three or four days and sent me to the normal wing , where I was n't safe .
I suffered racism and discrimination .
I got stabbed twice by other prisoners and no one investigated .'
Raissi says he has had two nervous breakdowns as a result of his incarceration and still suffers from high blood pressure and post - traumatic stress disorder .
Despite having been completely exonerated , he is still banned from flying anywhere but Algeria because his US extradition warrant is still outstanding .
' I 'm not working , I 'm blacklisted from all airline jobs , ' he said .
' I 'm framed as a terrorist . '
His wife and his brother 's sister - who both worked in the airline industry - also lost their jobs , he says , as a result of his arrest .
His arrest and subsequent attempts to clear his name have also damaged his relationship with his wife , Raissi said .
' Even with my marriage I struggle very much , ' Raissi said .
' Every part of my life I struggled with .
It is an agony . '
Raissi was forced to drop a $ 10 m claim against the FBI and the US Department of Justice , but he has pledged to continue with his legal action against the British government .
' It 's a matter of principle , ' Raissi said .
' I want my life back ; I want to clear my name and that of my family and to have a normal life . '
The Home Secretary , Jacqui Smith , has 14 days to decide whether she will fight Raissi 's compensation case .
While Raissi said he ' cherished ' living in Britain , the strain of the last six years to clear his name have left their mark .
' I learned to forgive , I learned patience , ' he said .
' But it has been damaging to my life and my dignity - that is something I will never forgive . '
Neoconservative hawks lamented the latest casualty in the war on terror last Friday , as the ax fell on Stephen Coughlin ’s job .
The Pentagon decided not to renew the contract of its " foremost " specialist on Islamic law and Islamic extremism when it ends in March , citing budget cuts .
But Coughlin ’s supporters say the jihad maven was unjustly fired because his message was too politically hot and far too inconvenient for government bureaucrats eager to make nice with Muslim groups that  so decry right - wing hawks  merely serve as front organizations for more nefarious " Islamo - fascists . "
And it appears they are waging a campaign in the conservative press to combat what they believe amounts to the double standards within the warm and fuzzy " politically correct " Washington bureaucracy .
While most policymakers and experts acknowledge that Washington has a serious public diplomacy problem on its hands  especially with regard to Arabs and Muslims  Coughlin ’s dismissal and its aftermath reflect the latest salvo by neocons to retain the dubious language of the war on terror .
" If allowed to stand , the effect of Maj .
Coughlin ’s dismissal would be a surgical strike on a man who is arguably one of the most knowledgeable opponents of Sharia  not only in the Defense Department , but inside the entire US government , " wrote right - wing polemicist Frank Gaffney , who also heads the Center for Security Policy , in the Washington Times .
As a casualty in the war of ideas , he sarcastically wrote , Coughlin may perhaps " receive its first Purple Heart . "
Gaffney and others continue their efforts to wrest the " battle of ideas " from the jaws of what they presume to be " political correctness " , instead arguing for an aggressive and unapologetic doctrine that dares to confront " radical Islam "  to clarify a choice between two fundamentally inconsistent and inconsistent strategies .
Either we protect the nation or we choose to be politically correct .
Either we confront the threat of " radical Islam " head on , or we perform ill - advised outreach to Muslim groups .
Coughlin was presumably the model soldier in the battle of ideas , delivering tough and blunt analysis ; and he did n’t mince words .
From the laudatory statements of his supporters , it appears he was a powerful bulwark against the Islamo - fascist threat currently facing the US mainland .
And for his service to the cause of battling Islamic extremism , he became a victim of the type of misguided sensitivity that fears to lift the veil from radical Islamist front groups .
Wrote Washington Times editorial columnist Diana West : " ’ Islamist ’ and ‘ extremism ’  like ‘ Islam fascism ’ and other euphemisms  are words that draw a PC curtain over mainstream Islam .
They effectively shield the religion and its tenets from the scrutiny necessary to assess the ideology driving our jihadist enemies .
Of course , lifting that PC curtain on Islam and its jihadist tenets is precisely the effect of Stephen Coughlin ’s Pentagon brief .
It goes against what political correctness tells us ; it also goes against what Islamic advocacy groups tell us . "
But for all his motivation and zeal , Maj .
Coughlin is not the Islam " expert " he and his supporters claim he is .
In fact , he has no academic background in Islamic law or extremism .
A reservist in the US army , Coughlin holds a masters degree in Strategic Intelligence from the National Defense Intelligence College , with a focus on global terrorism and Jihadist movements , as well as a law degree from the William Mitchell School of Law .
Said former CIA agent Larry Johnson , who has helped script exercises for the US military forces that conduct counterterrorism missions : " Does [ Coughlin ] speak Arabic ?
No. How about Urdu ? Nope .
He studied Islam where ?
No clue .
But he graduated from an ABA - sanctioned second - tier law school .
A good school , but it is not known as a center of Islamic study .
Unfortunately , Coughlin ’s broad brush approach to Islam is more polemics that scholarship . "
As reported by Bill Gertz of the Washington Times , Coughlin ’s recent misfortunes transpired after a confrontation with Hasham Islam , a high - level aide to Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England , who reportedly asked Coughlin to " soften his views on Islam " after the " specialist " emphasized the relationship between Islamic law and Islamist jihad doctrine , a belief which runs contrary to the White House view of Islam as a religion of peace hijacked by extremists .
Over the weekend , the Fox News Channel spun the centrifuges of Islamo - hysteria faster , featuring an interview with self - declared " terrorism expert " Steve Emerson , who alleged that radical Islamists had infiltrated the US government and had gained enough clout to manipulate who gets hired and fired .
Emerson called Islam  Gordon ’s aide  " an Islamist with a pro-Muslim Brotherhood bent who has brought in groups to the Pentagon who have been indicated as coconspirators . "
Emerson said that Coughlin had analyzed " hundreds of thousands of documents " released during the trial of the Muslim charity Holy Land Foundation in Dallas , Texas .
He said that the documents showed that there was a secret Muslim Brotherhood plan to acquire influence in the US in order to undermine democracy and establish a Caliphate .
" Mr. Coughlin wrote a memo spelling out the implications of these documents and the profound nature of what would happen if the US government decided to start doing dialogue and embracing the very organizations that were intent on undermining US national security , " said Emerson .
The Holy Land case , which ended with no convictions in late October 2007 , was widely viewed as the Bush administration ’s flagship terror - financing case .
President Bush announced he was freezing the charity ’s assets in 2001 because he said the radical Islamist group Hamas had " obtained much of the money it pays for murder abroad right here in the US "
Prosecutors tried unsuccessfully to convince jurors that the foundation and five of its backers had supported terrorism by sending more that 12 million dollars to charitable zakat committees , social services organizations that build hospitals and feed the poor .
Prosecutors claimed that the committees were controlled by Hamas and contributed to terrorism by helping the group spread ideology and recruit supporters .
The most pointed criticism of Coughlin ’s approach of analyzing extremist doctrine has come from terrorism experts who believe that by directly linking the Koran to Islamic extremism , Coughlin unwittingly bolsters the message of terrorist groups such as al - Qaeda .
After being falsely accused by Coughlin of somehow being sympathetic to the presumably nefarious aspirations of the Muslim Brotherhood , Jim Guirard  a longtime chief of staff to US Senators Allen Ellender and Russell Long and current anti-terrorism strategist  wrote in the small wars journal blog , " The truth of the matter is that while I am trying to undermine bin Ladenism ’s self - canonizing language of ‘ jihad by mujahedeen and martyrs destined for Paradise as a glorious reward for killing all of us infidels and for destroying the Great Satan , ’ it is Mr. Coughlin and others of his persuasion in the Government , the media , the universities and elsewhere who are busy parroting and promoting this perverse AQ and Muslim Brotherhood narrative as the true face of Islam  rather than as a satanic deviancy and an apostasy toward that religion . "
A New York congresswoman is seeking to allay concerns that Democratic superdelegates would switch crucial votes to Senator Obama from Senator Clinton now that momentum in the presidential campaign appears to have shifted in Mr. Obama 's direction .
Rep. Nydia Velazquez , who is among the 796 Democratic superdelegates who could be in a position to award the nomination at the party 's national convention , said her endorsement of Mrs. Clinton is final .
" I 'll be with Hillary until the end , " she told reporters yesterday at City Hall .
Ms. Velazquez , who represents parts of Brooklyn , Queens , and Manhattan , said concerns that party leaders may end up deciding the contest between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton are being raised too late to consider a suggestion forwarded by some Democrats  that all delegates vote according to the popular vote .
" Well , we do n't want to change the rules now , " Ms. Velazquez said .
" I think that if people want to change the rules of the game , you have to do it immediately , right when we start a campaign like this one . "
The role of superdelegates has drawn scrutiny as Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton compete for the support of pledged delegates .
Some are concerned that superdelegates , comprising about 20 % of the delegate total , could override a clear victory by one of the candidates in the primaries and draw the party into a bitter squabble over the winner 's legitimacy .
According to CNN , Mrs. Clinton currently holds the support of at least 224 superdelegates versus 135 backing Mr. Obama .
Turkey and Thailand have in the past also banned access to the site
Its telecommunications authority ordered internet service providers to block the site until further notice .
Reports said the content included Danish cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad that have outraged many .
But one report said a trailer for a forthcoming film by Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders , which portrays Islam in a negative light , was behind the ban .
" They asked us to ban it immediately ... and the order says the ban will continue until further notice , " said Wahaj - us - Siraj , convener of the Association of Pakistan Internet Service Providers .
" Users are quite upset .
They 're screaming at ISPs which can't do anything .
" The government has valid reason for that , but they have to find a better way of doing it .
If we continue blocking popular websites , people will stop using the internet . "
Other countries that have temporarily blocked access to YouTube include Turkey and Thailand .
Last summer , George W. Bush told The Washington Examiner ’s Bill Sammon that Hillary Clinton would probably be the 2008 Democratic nominee .
“ She ’s got a national presence and this is becoming a national primary , ” he said .
“ And therefore the person with the national presence who has got the ability to raise enough money to sustain an effort in a multiplicity of sites has got a good chance to be nominated . ”
This seemed a reasonable judgment at the time .
It may still turn out to be right .
But today Barack Obama is neck - and - neck with Clinton in the national polls  and he ’s shown a greater ability to raise money .
After his strong showing over the weekend , it is Obama who now has the clearer path to his party ’s nomination .
I ’ll avoid a false precision in the numbers that follow .
There are minor differences among news organizations in projecting delegate allocations in states that have already voted , and in counting preferences among the 796 elected officials and party leaders  the “ superdelegates ”  who vote according to their choice , not voters ’ instruction .
Obama leads Clinton by roughly 70 delegates among about 2,000 chosen so far in primaries and caucuses .
( There are still about 1,200 delegates outstanding . )
Among the superdelegates , Clinton is ahead by about 100 superdelegates among the 300 who have declared a preference ( though any of them can change their mind , so a count of them now is in large measure premature ) .
All in all , Clinton seems to be slightly ahead .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- American fighter jets intercepted two Russian bombers , one of which buzzed a U.S. aircraft carrier in the western Pacific on Saturday , U.S. military officials told CNN Monday .
Russia 's Defense Ministry said Tuesday that there was no violation of flight regulations during the incident .
A ministry official said the flights are standard operating procedure for air force training .
One of them twice flew about 2,000 feet over the deck of the USS Nimitz Saturday while another flew about 50 miles away , officials said .
Two others were at least 100 miles away , the military reported .
U.S. defense officials said four F / A - 18A fighter jets from the Nimitz were in the air .
The Russians and the U.S. carrier did not exchange verbal communications .

An Efficient Data Structure For A Hex Editor
by Simon Tatham
1. Introduction
Hex editors have been around for a long time , and at the very basic level they are very simple to write .
Since they are mostly used for editing files such as executables , which contain a lot of cross-references to particular byte positions in the file , a hex editor need not have an insert mode in order to be useful .
And a hex editor without an insert mode is very easy to implement : you simply allocate a large enough array for the input file , and use that as your data structure .
The only operation you really need to be able to do efficiently is to jump to a particular byte position , and that 's precisely what an array makes easy .
On the other hand , an insert mode can be useful in other circumstances .
Not all types of file you might want to edit have the same restrictions as an executable .
And as soon as you want your hex editor to have an insert mode , the data structure question becomes much more interesting .
In this article I present an efficient and scalable data structure which supports all the operations needed by a hex editor .
2. Simple options
One technique used to support insert mode in editors is to use an array larger than the file size , with a gap in it .
The file contents up to the current cursor position are stored at the start of the array ; the file contents from the current cursor position to the end are stored at the end of the array ; and the gap in the middle moves about as the cursor does .
This makes insertion easy .
When the user inserts an extra character , you just add it to one end or other of the gap .
On the other hand , moving through the file now becomes a slow operation ; it 's not noticeable when you 're moving by a byte , by a line , or even by a screenful at a time , but as soon as you try to jump to the start or end of the file , or jump to a particular specified file offset , suddenly the editor has to bodily shift enormous amounts of file data from one end of the gap to the other .
Another slightly better option is to use a linked list of small arrays , and to let the arrays vary in size between K and 2 K bytes , for some fixed minimum block size K . Inserting a single byte in the middle of a block does n't cost too much ; occasionally the block will grow beyond size 2 K and have to be split into two smaller ones , but even that is n't too slow .
Jumping to a particular position , however , is still an O ( N ) operation using this structure .
In practice it is n't too bad , since the length of the linked list is at worst 1 / K times the size of the file ; but once the file size becomes seriously big , this approach does not scale well .
The common problem in both these methods is that as soon as you make insertion a constant - time operation , seeking to a given byte position becomes linear - time .
Whereas in the original array format , of course , seeking was constant - time but insertion became linear - time .
3 . Using balanced trees
This is where trees come in .
Balanced tree structures ( any of AVL trees , red - black trees and B - trees ) all solve this sort of problem for sorted lists .
You can insert an element into a balanced tree in log time , and you can search for a particular element in log time as well .
This sounds like the kind of compromise we want : if making insertion constant - time forces seeking to be linear and vice versa , we would prefer to arrange for both to be log - time .
The conventional use of a balanced tree to store a sorted list , however , is not immediately helpful to us .
The only criterion we could reasonably sort on would be byte position in the file ; and as soon as we store our data as a set of ( position , data ) pairs , we 're back to insertion being linear again , because we would have to alter the position field of every tree element after the insertion point .
Is there anything we can do to our balanced trees to make this work better ?
4. Counted trees
Yes , there is .
Suppose you add an additional field to every node of a balanced tree .
In that field , you store a count of the number of elements in or below that node .
Operations which alter the tree ( insertion and deletion ) now have to make sure these counts remain accurate .
This can be done without sacrificing the log - time characteristics of the operations .
For example , when you add an element , you increment the count of the node containing it , and then work back up the tree to the root incrementing the counts in all the nodes you go past .
Since the height of the tree is O ( log N ) , this only takes you O ( log N ) time .
So we can add counts to a tree and still maintain it efficiently .
What have the counts bought us ?
Once we have counts in a tree , they introduce an entirely new way to search the tree .
Starting at the root , we can search down the tree by examining the count fields rather than comparing elements as usual ; and this allows us to find the Nth item in the tree , for any N , in a single log - time search .
For example , suppose the root tree node contains a child with count 54 , then an actual element , then a child with count 73 .
Then :
If you are trying to get to a position less than 54 , then you descend straight to the leftmost child .
If you are trying to get to exactly position 54 , you return the element out of the root node .
If you are trying to get to position 55 or greater , you descend to the rightmost child , and subtract 55 from your desired position .
( If you want element 57 of the tree , then you know there are 55 elements in the tree before the right - hand subtree , so you know you want element 2 of the right - hand subtree . )
So now we have a means of finding the Nth item in a tree in a log - time search .
This is starting to look promising .
The trouble is , we 're still stuck with having some sort of sorting order on the tree .
Now we need to deal with that .
5. Unsorted trees
The simple answer to the sorting problem is to do away with sorting the tree at all !
Conventional balanced trees have a sorting order because it's used to find elements in the tree , and to know where to add an element .
But we do n't need a sorting order to find things any more , because we can use a count - based search to jump to the Nth position .
Can we also use counts during the tree add operation , to allow us to specify where we want to add our new element ?
We can .
Tree add algorithms start by searching down the tree to find the position where the new element will be inserted .
If we do this search using counts , in exactly the same way described in section 4 , then we can add any element we like at any position in the tree .
Once we do this , of course , we have to throw out the sorting order completely , and never do another order - based search or insertion again , because they wo n't work .
But that 's OK , because we did n't need them anyway .
Now we have exactly what we were after in the first place .
We have a data structure which stores an unordered list of items , in such a way that we can insert or delete an item in log time and find the Nth element in log time .
6. Splitting and joining trees
Now we can begin to get more ambitious .
One issue we have not addressed yet is cut and paste .
So far I have discussed tree insertion in the assumption that you only ever insert one character at a time into your tree .
In fact hex editors need cut and paste just as much as normal text editors do ; so we must think about how to insert or remove a larger block of data at a time .
One obvious way is to process each byte individually .
A ten - byte cut operation is ten individual deletions , and a ten - byte paste is ten individual insertions .
This is fine if you only ever use cut and paste to move tiny chunks of data around a large file , but if you need to move half the file from one place to another , things get more interesting .
The linked - list structure discussed in section 2 would have helped a lot with this problem .
Linked lists do n't just make it easy to insert or delete one item : they make it just as easy to unlink an enormous chunk of a list once you 've found both ends of the chunk , and you can link that chunk in somewhere else easily as well .
It turns out that you can do the same thing with balanced trees .
At this point it starts to make a difference what kind of balanced tree you use : all three of AVL , red - black and B - trees support these operations , but the precise methods vary between them .
I 'm going to use B - trees from here on , because the algorithms are slightly simpler .
What we need are two basic operations .
Given a counted , unsorted B - tree containing an unordered list of items , we need to be able to :
Split the tree down the middle , giving two valid B - trees as output .
Take two valid B - trees and join them together end - to - end , giving one B - tree containing all the data from tree A followed by the data from tree B .
This will provide all the operations we need .
To unlink a large section from the middle of a tree , we split it in two places and then join the outer two parts back together ; to link a large section into the middle of a tree , we split it at the insertion point , join the left half on to the left side of the inserted section , and join the right half on to the right side of the inserted section .
6.1 . Joining two B - trees together
When you add an element to a B - tree , sometimes it ends up increasing the size of a leaf node beyond the size limit .
When that happens , you deal with it by splitting the node in two , and transforming the parent node so that where it previously had a single child pointer , it now has two child pointers with an element between them .
If that makes the parent node too big as well , you do the same thing again , and so on until you reach the tree root .
Joining two B - trees is therefore reasonably simple , if you have an additional separating element to place in between them .
Position the two trees so that their leaf nodes are at the same level ; now ( usually ) one tree will be shorter than the other .
So you can add the root of the shorter tree as a sibling of the node next to it in the taller tree ; their common parent gains one extra child pointer ( pointing at the root of the shorter tree ) , separated from its neighbour by the additional separating element .
If this causes the node to increase beyond the maximum size , just split it in two and propagate up to its parent , just as in the ordinary insertion process .
If the trees were originally the same height , just combine their root nodes into a single larger root node .
You need an extra element to go in between the rightmost child pointer of the left - hand root node , and the leftmost child pointer of the right - hand root node ; and again , this is where your separating element comes in .
Again , if the new root is too big to be a single node , split it in two and create a new root above it .
So it turns out that it 's very easy to join two trees together , but the algorithm requires a spare element to go in the middle .
However , we normally do n't have such a spare element : we just have two trees .
This is easily solved , though : we simply start by removing the leftmost element of the right - hand tree using the ordinary tree deletion algorithm .
Then we just do the join algorithm , as described above , using the element we just removed as our separator .
6.2 . Splitting a B - tree in two
To split a B - tree in two : we are given a tree , and a means of searching down the tree to find the split point .
( In this application , that will be a numeric position , which we check against the node counts on the way down ; in other situations , we might perfectly well want to split an ordinary sorted B - tree in half , so we might have an ordering - based search criterion .
It makes no difference . )
We start in the simplest possible way .
Start at the root node ; decide which of its subtree pointers you are going to descend down ; and saw the node in half at that subtree pointer .
The two half - nodes thus created will each need a subtree pointer to go on the cut end , but that 's OK because we 're about to saw the next node down in half as well and they can have half each .
So descend to the next node , decide on a split point again , saw that node in half , and put a pointer to each half in the two halves of the parent node .
Once we finish this searching - and - cutting pass , we will have successfully separated our tree into two parts at the required point .
However , the result will almost certainly not be a pair of valid B - trees ; the chances are that many of the nodes on the cut edges will be below the minimum allowed node size .
In fact , if at any point our search criterion made us descend through the endmost subtree pointer in any node , some of those nodes will have no elements in them whatsoever , just a single subtree pointer !
So now we must make a healing pass down the cut edge of each tree , to turn it back into a valid B - tree .
We can start by throwing away the root node if it has nothing but a single subtree pointer ( which will happen quite often if we split near one end of the original tree , since in that case the output trees will almost certainly need to be of different heights ) .
Keep doing that until we find a real root node .
One child of that node is on the cut edge , so it may be below the minimum size .
If it is , we solve this using its ( valid ) neighbour node .
If the neighbour is large , we can move some subtrees over into the undersized node to make two correctly sized nodes ; if the neighbour is too small and does not have that many subtrees to spare , we can instead combine the undersized node with its neighbour .
( And it turns out you can always do at least one of these : if the neighbour is too large to combine with the undersized node , then it must have enough subtrees for redistribution to give two viable nodes . )
The only interesting case is that combining an undersized node with its neighbour reduces the number of subtrees of their common parent by one .
Therefore :
As we go down , we arrange for each node on the cut edge to be at least one more than minimum size , in case its size must drop by one when we process its child .
( This still just about works in all cases . )
If the first non-trivial root node had only two children ( recall that the root node in a B - tree is the only node exempt from the minimum size limit ) , and those two children end up having to be combined , then the root node must be thrown away again and the combined node is the new root .
Once we have sorted out each node , we descend to its child on the cut edge , and do the same thing again .
Eventually we reach the bottom of the tree and every node is of valid size .
Then we do the same thing to the cut edge of the other tree , and we 're done .
7. Cloning trees
The splitting and joining algorithms look as if they make cut and paste pretty much trivial .
You can split a big chunk out of your editing buffer into a separate cut buffer easily enough ; and then you can ‘ paste ’ it somewhere else by joining it back into the middle of the editing buffer at a different position .
However , in real life , cut and paste is n't that simple .
People often want to paste the same data more than once ; so you can't just link the cut buffer straight into the editing buffer , because then you do n't still have it to link in again next time .
You need to copy the cut buffer and link in the copy .
Equally , users often want to press
Copy rather than Cut , in which case you have to split the buffer tree in two places , copy the middle section , and join all three back together .
Copying a tree , it would seem , is inherently an O ( N ) operation ; there 's no way you can copy a tree containing megabytes of data without actually copying all that data .
Or is there ?
It turns out that we can do better than this , by adding another annotation field to each tree node .
This time , the annotation is a reference count : it counts the number of pointers to the node , either from other tree nodes or from the ‘ root ’ field in a tree header structure .
To begin with , of course , all reference counts are 1 .
Reference counts are normally used for garbage collection .
In this case , though , I 'm going to use them to implement copy - on - write .
All of the tree - altering algorithms ( insertion and deletion , plus the split and join algorithms described above ) will now check the reference count of a node before attempting to modify it .
If they find that they need to modify a node with a reference count greater than one , they will not modify it .
Instead , they will make a copy of that node , and use the copy in place of the original .
The copy links to all the same child nodes as the original , so the reference count in each child must be incremented ; and the copied node 's parent ( or tree header structure ) now links to the copy rather than to the original , so the reference count in the original must be decremented .
Now we are looking at a node with a reference count of 1 , which means nobody else is using it so we can modify it safely .
The effect of this is that it is now a trivial - not merely log - time but constant - time - operation to clone an entire B - tree , no matter how large .
We simply create a new tree header structure ; we point its root field at the root node of the input tree ; and we increment the reference count on that root node .
Once we have cloned a tree like this , we can treat the original and the clone as if they were entirely independent .
If you add an element to one of them , for example , then a single string of nodes from the root down to one leaf will be duplicated and modified , but the rest of the trees will still be held in common .
You can split either tree into lots of little pieces , or join it into the middle of a larger one , and never affect the data stored in what was once its clone , because every time you touch a node that the other tree is depending on , you make your own copy rather than disturbing it .
This allows us to support really efficient cut and paste in our hex editor .
You select a 200 Mb chunk and press Copy ; the buffer tree is split in two places ( in log time ) , the middle section is cloned ( instantly ) , and the tree is joined back together .
You 'd hardly know anything was different - but the cut buffer now contains a clone of part of the original buffer , most of which consists of nodes that are still shared with it .
And you can paste in as many copies as you like of that chunk , still in no worse than O ( log N ) time .
The best bit is that by the time you 've done this a few times and have a file that 's 1600 Mb longer than it started out , the hex editor is n't actually using up 1600 Mb more memory , because most of it is in shared nodes !
This technique naturally provides a form of compression as well as being fast .
8 . Lazy file loading
In all of the above I have been tacitly assuming that the data elements stored in my tree are individual bytes .
This would be hideously inefficient if I were using AVL or red - black trees , in which each node contains precisely one element : for every byte of the file being edited , there would be an overhead of two child pointers , a byte count and a reference count .
On a normal 32 - bit machine , that 's 20 bytes per node , not counting overhead from the memory allocator .
A factor of twenty is just ridiculous .
B - trees are a bit more flexible , since they can be made to have a large minimum degree .
A B - tree with a minimum node size of ( say ) 512 can contain up to 1023 bytes of data plus 1024 subtree pointers , and those 1023 bytes can be packed together in memory so the overhead is now more like a factor of five .
Also , since no node in a B - tree ever changes its height above ground level , you can just not bother to allocate space for the 512 NULL child pointers in your leaf nodes , and since the vast majority of your nodes will be leaf nodes , the structure is now closer to being space - efficient .
There are other improvements one could make .
For example , there 's no reason why a B - tree really needs to have the same minimum node degree at every level ; so you could have low - degree nodes everywhere above the leaf level , and enormous leaf nodes containing 4 - 8 Kb of file data .
You could move to B + trees in which no actual data elements were stored anywhere except in the leaf nodes , thus saving the tiny alignment overheads in the other nodes .
However , there 's a better direction to head in .
In section 2 I mentioned the idea of using a linked list as the main data structure , and I said that each element of the linked list would be a smallish array of file bytes ( between size K and 2K ) .
There 's no reason we could n't do that in our B - tree - based approach : each element stored in the B - tree is no longer a single byte but a small block of bytes .
It would mean that our element counts no longer allowed us to jump to the Nth byte , only to the Nth block ; but we can fix that by replacing the element count with a byte count , summing the total size of all the blocks in or below a particular tree node .
Now , given any byte position , we can do a single log - time search and return a data block plus an offset within that block .
This technique adds work to all operations .
Inserting a byte , for example , is now done by finding the block it needs to go into , inserting it in that block , and potentially splitting the block into two and doing an extra tree operation .
Splitting and joining buffers involves splitting and joining blocks at each end , and checking to make sure undersized blocks are not created .
So what does this technique buy us , that makes it worthwhile over just storing single bytes in the B - tree ?
The answer is : once we have a block data structure as our tree element , we can start having different types of block .
In particular , we can have a type of block which is a placeholder , containing nothing but a file offset and length .
A block of this type indicates ‘ at this point in the tree we have N bytes from position P in the original file ’ .
Blocks of this type are exempt from the normal maximum size for normal literal - data blocks .
The effect of this is that we no longer need to read the entire file into memory when we start up .
Instead , we just initialise our tree trivially , so that it contains nothing but a single placeholder block , with offset zero and size equal to the initial file size .
Now whenever we need to read data from the tree , and it turns out the data in question is somewhere in a placeholder block , we must refer back to the original input file in order to find the data ( and the placeholder block will tell us where in the file to read it from ) .
So before we do any editing , our hex editor is suddenly a low - cost hex file viewer , which just pages back and forth and refers to the disk all the time .
But as soon as we start altering parts of the file , the placeholder block gets broken up into smaller blocks , and literal - data blocks begin to be created in between them .
If we cut and paste a section including a placeholder block , then the tree can end up containing placeholder blocks in a strange order ; it might ( for example ) indicate something like ‘ the first 192K of the input file ; then the literal bytes 5B 49 A7 ; then 25 K of the input file starting from position 12345 ; then 512 K of the input file starting from position 204325 ’.
Now the hex editor looks as if it 's doing exactly the same thing as it did to begin with .
I can page around the original file ; I can insert , delete , overwrite , cut , copy and paste to my heart 's content , and ( provided no other process modifies the original file under our feet ) the data I am manipulating will remain consistent at all times with the editing operations I have performed .
But there was n't a big delay at startup when the file was loaded in , because most of it was n't loaded in ; and if I list the running processes on my system , the hex editor will not be using memory proportional to the size of the file .
It will only be using memory proportional to the changes I 've made to the file .
When I save the file , if there are any placeholder blocks remaining in the buffer tree , the hex editor must write out the new version by referring to the original .
This is the only remaining operation , apart from searching , that takes time proportional to the size of the file .
And there are no remaining operations which take memory proportional to the size of the file .
( There is one thing you need to be careful of .
Literal data blocks must be permitted to fall below the minimum size K if there is no literal block next to them to merge with ; in particular , this is vital if you are writing a binary file from scratch or you would never be able to give it a size between zero and K .
But this raises the possibility that given a pathological sequence of editing operations , your data structure might end up being an interleaving of one - byte literal blocks and one - byte placeholder blocks , giving a huge space overhead .
The simplest solution to this is to impose a minimum size of 2 K on placeholder blocks , below which you read the relevant piece of file data and convert them into literal blocks ; then they can be merged with adjacent blocks and the worst case is no longer terrible . )
We now have a data structure which does pretty much everything you could reasonably ask a hex editor to be able to do , and does it all at a reasonable memory cost and ( apart from the two genuinely necessary operations of searching and saving ) all in O ( log N ) time .
9 . Further directions
The data structure as I have presented it is suitable for use in a high - performance hex editor with an insert mode .
There are a couple more points worth noting .
9.1 . Conventional text editing
This structure would need only minor modifications to be an efficient basis for a conventional text editor .
In order to do this , you would need to be able to jump quickly to a particular line of the file , which means you 'd need a node annotation counting newlines .
In fact , it 's possible to do slightly better than that : we can devise a more complex node annotation which tracks the effect of an arbitrary byte sequence on the ( line , column ) position .
Assuming that a physical tab character always advances the cursor to the next multiple of 8 spaces , there are three possibilities :
A sequence of bytes containing no newlines or tabs simply adds some number A to the column number , and does not affect the line number .
A sequence of bytes containing no newlines but at least one tab has the overall effect of adding some number A to the column , and rounding it up to the next number that is congruent to B mod 8 .
A sequence of bytes containing at least one newline has the effect of adding some number A to the line number , and setting the column number to a fixed value B .
These three function schemas are closed under composition ( i.e. combining any two of them gives another one ) .
Storing one in each node of a buffer tree would provide the ability to search directly to a particular ( line , column ) position in a single log - time search .
So the text editor could treat its buffer as a simple sequence of bytes ( or possibly of Unicode characters ) .
This is superior to treating the buffer as a sequence of lines , because it removes the distinction between inserting within a line and inserting data between lines .
In particular , cut and paste in a line - based model is fiddly because lines must be spliced together at each end of the pasted region ; but cut and paste in this model is as trivial as it was in the hex editor - you just cut a sequence of bytes , paste it somewhere else , and the line / column indexing automatically keeps up no matter what you do .
The only snag is that if you did this , you would probably no longer be able to do the trick with placeholder blocks and lazy file loading ; a text editor tends to need to know in advance where all the newlines are in its buffer , so there would probably be no alternative to physically loading the file .
But in that , at least , this data structure is no worse than any other .
9.2 . Supporting undo
An undo function in an editor conceptually stores a sequence of previous buffer states , and allows you to return to one of them when you need to .
Usually , this is not actually implemented by storing copies of the entire buffer , since that would be ludicrously wasteful of space !
Instead , a journal of changes is kept which allows previous buffer states to be reconstructed by reversing the precise changes made .
One could do that using this data structure , if one wanted to .
However , there 's another intriguing option .
Since cloning an arbitrarily large tree is a cheap operation , you could implement undo by actually storing a sequence of clones of previous buffer states !
The cost of this would be nothing like as bad as it would naïvely appear .
It might still not be ideal , though .
Every time you clone a tree and the two clones diverge , several nodes must be copied , and if each node contains several blocks of literal data then the cost of maintaining too many buffer clones might still become prohibitive .
But it 's an interesting possibility regardless .
10 . Summary
I 've presented a design for a data structure which implements practically every operation required for a hex editor in O ( log N ) time , apart from one or two which genuinely need to be O ( N ) .
The structure is :
A B - tree , each of whose elements is either a small array of literal data bytes , or a placeholder block denoting a section of the unmodified input file .
Each B - tree node is annotated with the total byte count of all the elements in or below that node , allowing a log - time search to pinpoint any numeric byte position .
Those counts provide the only necessary means of navigating the tree , so there is no need for a sorting criterion .
Split and join algorithms make it possible to link and unlink large chunks from the middle of a buffer at a time .
Reference counts implementing copy - on - write allow cloning of chunks in constant time .
As a result :
Inserting or deleting bytes in the file is a log - time operation .
Finding a particular byte position is a log - time operation .
Cut and paste is always log - time , no matter how large or complex the chunk of data being moved around .
Memory usage grows proportionally to the changes made to the file , not the overall file size .
( However , memory usage is also bounded by a value proportional to the file size , even if you keep editing and re-editing for ever . )
Searching must still be linear ( there 's no alternative to actually reading the data if you need to know anything about its contents ) , and saving the modified output file is linear ( because you actually must physically write out that much data ) , but everything else can be done in log time .
I 've also sketched a means of converting this into a data structure for an ordinary text editor , and suggested interesting implications in the area of undo operations .
