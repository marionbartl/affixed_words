A new fossil survey has revealed cephalopods like this early squid were ruling the seas over 500 million years ago .
This is far earlier than previously believed .
Meet Nectocaris pteryx , the ancient predator with two tentacles .

Though researchers had seen fossils of the Nectocaris pteryx before , a recent survey of new fossils found in British Columbia , Canada , made it clear that these two - tentacled creatures are in fact the precursors of the ten - tentacled squid of today .
Evolutionary biologist Martin Smith describes the find in an article published this afternoon in Nature .

From a release about the article :
The new specimens , between two and five centimetres long , show that Nectocaris was kite - shaped and flattened from top to bottom , with large , stalked eyes and a long pair of grasping tentacles , which the researchers believe helped it to hunt for and consume prey .
Smith and [ Jean - Bernard ]
Caron further suggest that the creature swum using its large lateral fins , and , like modern cephalopods , probably used its nozzle - like funnel to accelerate by jet propulsion .
" Some of the specimens ' large gills were choked with mud , suggesting that the animals were fossilized after being caught in an underwater mud-flow , " says Smith .
" Our findings mean that cephalopods originated 30 million years earlier than we thought , and much closer to the first appearance of complex animals in the ' Cambrian explosion ' " says Smith .
Nectocaris does not have a mineralized shell , a fact that surprised the scientists .
" It 's long been thought that cephalopods evolved in the Late Cambrian period , when gradual modifications to the shells of creeping , snail - like animals made them able to float .
Nectocaris shows us that the first cephalopods actually started swimming without the aid of gas - filled shells .
Shells evolved much later , probably in response to increased levels of competition and predation in the Late Cambrian . "

And here ’s more from the Electronic Intifada article " Jewish challenges to Zionism on the rise in the US " :
Accountability of Israeli , US government and international Zionist support for Israel will not come from a shift in US policy but through shifting American public opinion and debate , fomenting popular movement , using international and US legal sanctions and supporting the Palestinian call for BDS .
The 2010 US Assembly of Jews seeks to contribute to these efforts and reflects a significant departure from Zionism that has been building since the second Palestinian intifada broke the stranglehold of the Oslo accords .
It has continuity with a long history of Jewish participation in struggles for human emancipation .
Ours are among the growing voices of Jews who seek a departure from the course that Zionism has been and continues down — a course that is a betrayal of our humanity as it simultaneously denies that of Palestinians .
A good Washington DC contact told me that a public relations / media push to demonize those who decide to walk away from mortgages they can still afford to pay ( aka “ strategic defaulters ” ) is underway .
Expect to see a good bit of moral fervor as those who choose to cut their losses are attacked as immoral , irresponsible , and abusive .
There is a wee problem with the “ blame the ruthless borrower ” narrative .
Banks who acted in a ruthless manner have trained their customers to behave the same way .
This shift in prevailing attitudes is the logical and inevitable result of financial firms taking an increasingly predatory posture toward their customers .
Borrowers are responding in kind , by taking a cold - blooded and legalistic look at their agreements with lenders .
So now they are going to try to stuff the genie back in the bottle by castigating borrowers who treat their obligations as “ just business ” , the way banks do .
But the problem with this little narrative is that the bank have n’t simply been pig- headed about adherence to their often pig- headed contracts ( and before you argue otherwise , go read your full credit card agreement , which at Bank of America runs to 30 pages , or a home equity line of credit agreement , and then we can talk ) .
It ’s that even with doing everything possible to skew the playing field in their favor , they still had to be rescue en masse .
Having been deadbeats and strategic defaulters of the first order , they continue to manifest their characteristic unmitigated gall via ( through proxies and ads ) hectoring the public about honorable behavior .
Now it is true that this is in fact a very destructive trend .
A calculating , contract - driven mindset eats away at the foundations of commerce .
When I was young , it was possible to deal with most clients on a handshake ( I ’d still write the arrangements up , but it was mainly a device for confirming that we had heard each other correctly ) .
Now pretty much every one I know has very carefully crafted agreements precisely because if things stray outside the bounds initially contemplated , it is much less likely that the party on the other side of the table will try to reach a middle of the ground resolution .
It is now the norm that parties to a contract will try to exploit ambiguous or unforeseen situations to their advantage .
Now this is a destructive trend .
An erosion of trust leads to much greater contracting and dispute - resolution costs , a de facto tax on all commerce .
As I discuss in ECONNED at greater length , it ’s prohibitively costly and time consuming to negotiate agreements that contemplate every scenario .
It would be far better if the banksters were to lead by example ; most consumers would be delighted to deal with an institution that had n’t forgotten the notion of reciprocity ( which is why many consumers are switching to community banks and credit unions ) .
But they no doubt want the average Joe to toe the line while they carry on with their use of complexity and opacity to shift hidden risks and fees on to overmatched customers .
One example comes , in of all places , a Republican motion to recommit ( an amendment to a bill when it is on the floor made by the minority party ) .
Now narrowly , one might well agree with the idea behind this amendment ( to prevent people who strategically default , which will be difficult to define in any tidy way , from using FHA programs ) .
But look at this section , which is roughly 2/3 of the entire amendment :
Strategic Defaults
A strategic default occurs when a borrower decides to stop paying their mortgage even though they can still afford their payments .
It is usually undertaken by those who owe more on their mortgage than their home is currently worth .
The Wall Street Journal has reported on families that have chosen to stop paying their mortgage and instead use the extra money they are saving each month to “ buy season tickets to Disneyland … take a Carnival cruise to Mexico … ” and go out to dinner more often .
Companies have even sprung up to capitalize on the new trend with websites advising people ( for a fee ) on how to go about a strategic default .
These companies actually advertise that after a few years an individual who chooses to default on their mortgage should be able to buy a home again , including through government loan agencies .
60 Minutes reported on individuals who defend their decision to strategically default saying , “ … with the money savings that I will have in four to six years , I ’m confident I ’ll have money to buy my way into a house if I want to . ”
Strategic defaults raise costs for responsible borrowers , many of whom may currently be struggling to make their mortgage payment themselves , but who take their obligations to pay their debts seriously .
The MTR would ensure that no one who chooses to simply stop paying their mortgage , even though they can afford to do so , is able to benefit in the future from the government ’s FHA program .
But it might be more straightforward to restore debtors ’ prison .
David Walker of the Peterson Institute seems fond of them :
At various points in my shadowy , reclusive existence , I have studied economics , worked at the International Monetary Fund , and done mysterious things in the financial industry .
I mention all this not to lay claim to being an economist , which I certainly am not , but merely to note that I have spent a fair amount of time in my life thinking and talking about economic theory .
And one thing I have learned is that most people simply do not understand fiat currency .
They really , really do n’t understand how our monetary system works , how our economy works , or how it all hangs together .
To be fair , many economists do n’t seem to really understand it either .
Or rather , they act like they do n’t understand it .
There is n’t an economist alive today who does n’t know that we ’re on a fiat currency , that we do n’t need to dig metal out of a hole in the ground or mine it out of a mountain , that modern money is an imaginary unit of value , and that the U.S. government is sovereign in its own currency .
They know all this .
Yet they act as if we ’re still on the frigging gold standard .
The economy is heading into a depression ?
Tax revenues are down ?
Oh noes !
We must cut Social Security !
We must cut spending !
We must tighten our belts !
Oh , horseshit .
It does n’t work like that .
Consider taxation , for example .
People talk about what their taxes are “ paying ” for , and whether or not the government has enough tax revenue to “ pay ” for various and sundry things .
We all talk that way , just like we talk about the sun coming up tomorrow .
But it ’s not true .
The sun does n’t “ come up , ” and taxes do n’t pay for anything .
Money is a creation of the government .
It ’s an agreed - upon fictional unit of value .
In a nation with sovereign currency , like the United States , the government can create as much of the stuff as it wants .
We ’re not dealing with finite gold reserves ; the government does n’t need to collect gold from the citizens in order to send the gold somewhere else .
There is no gold .
( Also , there is no spoon . )
If that ’s the case , you might ask , then why do we have to pay taxes at all ?
And in fact economists were asking that question in the first half of the 20th century , as the world started sliding away from the gold standard and towards the realm of pure fiat currency .
What is the role of taxation in a fiat currency ?
they wondered .
What does it do ?
In a world where there is no spoon gold , what ’s the point ?
There are a few answers to that , and a few theories .
The chartalist view is that in a sovereign currency , taxation is what gives value to money .
The government prints dollars , but why should we use them ?
Because the government makes us use them , to pay taxes .
Dollars are the only thing the government will accept .
And the government ’s ability to compel tax payments in its own currency is , at bottom , what gives that currency value .
Another purpose of taxation is to peg the rate of government spending to some real thing in the world : namely , the productive capacity of the economy .
Back in the days of gold bullion , there was a clear physical connection between government spending , on the one hand , and a real pile of shiny metal on the other .
Now that money is entirely a fictitious construct created by the government , what is it based on ?
What should it be based on ?
How much of the stuff should the government issue ?
What is the appropriate amount of money to have floating around to keep this imaginary exchange system going ?
Everybody understands that the government must n’t just print money at will : that would lead to massive devaluation of the currency , the imaginary system would collapse , and Keanu Reeves and Carrie - Anne Moss would fall to the bottom of the elevator shaft .
So it needs to be tied to something .
But what ?
Milton Friedman had that whole automatic k - percent thing , but he was obsessed with keeping the government as powerless as possible , so his options were kind of limited .
Also , his theoretical treatment of inflation basically amounted to the argument that modern fiat currency would , strangely enough , behave exactly like 18th - century Spanish doubloons .
So , no help from Uncle Miltie .
Many theorists ( post - Keynesians , chartalists / Modern Monetary Theorists ) would say that the index for money creation / government spending needs to be something like the employment level .
Unemployment indicates unused capacity in the economy , which means that the government can and should be spending to create wealth and inject stimulus .
That makes sense to me , though the details are arguable .
The budgetary role of taxation in this scheme is to provide an index of the economy ’s productive capacity , a guideline for how much money the government should be creating / spending .
But notice : it ’s a guideline .
It ’s just a proxy for the real thing — economic capacity — and there ’s no reason to treat it like a real physical constraint .
It should certainly never be treated as a real constraint when doing so means impoverishing the citizenry — which is what the deficit hawks want to do when they propose cutting Social Security in order to balance the imaginary budget that the government created to spend imaginary money created by the government and provided by imaginary taxes paid in imaginary money that the government created , ahem — and thus contracting the economy even further and diminishing wealth and , hello , future tax revenues .
Why is this so hard to understand ?
Maybe because it ’s so new .
The U.S. went off the gold standard less than 40 years ago .
The generation of economists that should have been exploring the theoretical ramifications of modern fiat currency were instead in thrall to Ayn Rand novels and antiquated visions of private capital and money supply .
It ’s as if Darwin ( read : Keynes ) was followed by a bizarre interregnum when the creationists resumed control of everything and rewrote all the textbooks to say that evolution was wrong !
wrong !
wrong !
and God really did create the world and us and all the animals , just like we used to think , and the sun really does come up and the earth is the center of the universe and fiat currency behaves exactly like currency based on a big pile of gold we dug out of the ground , because to imagine otherwise is too goddamn scary .
Okay , I ’m ranting now .

This is one way to approach this :
c = -> x do $ *. clear if x [ ' if ' ] && x [ 0 ] != ' f ' . y = x [ 0 ...x.index ( ' for ' ) ] x = x[ x.index ( ' for ' ) ..- 1 ] ( x.insert(x.index(x.split [ 3 ] ) + x.split [ 3]. length , " do $* << # {y} " ) x.insert ( x.length , " end ; $ * " ) eval ( x ) $ *) elsif x [ ' if ' ] && x [ 0 ] == ' f ' ( x.insert(x.index(x.split [ 3 ] ) + x.split [ 3]. length , " do $* << x " ) x.insert ( x.length , " end ; $ * " ) eval ( x ) $ *) elsif !x [ ' if ' ] && x [ 0 ] != ' f ' y = x [ 0 ...x. index ( ' for ' ) ] x = x[ x.index ( ' for ' ) ..- 1 ] ( x.insert(x.index(x.split [ 3 ] ) + x.split [ 3]. length , " do $* << # {y} " ) x.insert ( x.length , " end ; $ * " ) eval ( x ) $ *) else eval ( x.split [ 3 ] ) .
to_a end end
so basically we are converting a string to proper ruby syntax for loop then we can use python syntax in a string to do :
c [ ' for x in 1..10 ' ] c[ ' for x in 1..10 if x.even ? ']
c [ 'x ** 2 for x in 1..10 if x.even ? '] c [ 'x ** 2 for x in 1..10 ' ] # [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] # [ 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 ] # [ 4 , 16 , 36 , 64 , 100 ] # [ 1 , 4 , 9 , 16 , 25 , 36 , 49 , 64 , 81 , 100 ]
or if you do n't like the way the string looks or having to use a lambda we could forego the attempt to mirror python syntax and do something like this :
WASHINGTON  President Obama will face significant challenges at a summit meeting in Toronto next week , where he will be trying to secure cooperation from European and Chinese leaders in nurturing the still - fragile recovery of the global economy .
European countries are pulling back on spending with a speed that the Obama administration believes could derail the global recovery .
China signaled this week that it would not let its currency rise in value anytime soon , raising the prospect of a showdown with Congress .
Germany and France have turned skittish about an American - led push to raise capital and liquidity requirements for large banks .
Meanwhile , the United States and Britain favor a tax on the giant banks , but do not support a further - reaching proposal by the European Union to tax financial transactions .
Canada , Japan and Australia oppose any form of bank tax .
The disagreements threaten to hurt the effectiveness of the Group of 20 , the expanded club of nations that Mr. Obama and his predecessor , George W. Bush , have used to coordinate the response to the financial crisis .
Two postings this time , on the theme of elections .
As is well known , Proudhon both argued against standing candidates and for abstaining in elections ( during the Second Empire ) and , in 1848 , he stood for Parliament twice , with success in a by - election .
The postings cover both these periods with this blog also discussing Proudhon , Marx and the Paris Commune ( again ! ) .
First off , is Proudhon ’s second election manifesto of 1848 , the one associated with Presidential election campaign .
Initially , Proudhon argued for a boycott of the election ( being opposed to having a President because it smacked of monarchy ) but turned to supporting Raspail ’s candidacy instead ( and according to Marx , as noted previously , this was authentic proletarian position to take ! ) .
This manifesto was included in Guerin ’s essential “ No Gods , No Masters ” anthology and it is easy to see why .
It is a succinct summary of Proudhon ’s ideas .
It covers most of his themes , such as free credit , workers ’ self - management , socio- economic federalism and others .
It is a much better work than his first manifesto ( Revolutionary Program : To The Voters Of The Seine Region ) , which has been translated at the “ Collective Reason ” project ( this is an important project which should be supported and they are also working on Bakunin , if Proudhon is not to your tastes ) .
The manifesto itself covers certain ideas which have become mainstays of revolutionary politics , both libertarian and Marxist ( well , for the latter , once the Mutualists in the Paris Commune raise it and Marx praised it in 1871 , as discussed in a previous posting ) .
Thus we see Proudhon proclaiming the need for both workers ’ self - management , economic federalism but also the merging of executive and legislative functions in the hands of mandated and recallable delegates .
While the Proudhonian influences in the Paris Commune are discussed in the introduction , it is useful to compare Proudhon ’s manifesto from 1848 with Marx ’s reporting from 1871 .
Proudhon , 1848 :
“ We want the mines , canals , railways handed over to democratically organised workers ’ associations . . .
We want these associations to be models for agriculture , industry and trade , the pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies woven into the common cloth of the democratic and social Republic . . .
We want property , but property restored to its proper limits , that is to say , free disposition of the fruits of labour , property MINUS USURY ! ”
Marx , 1871 :
“ the Commune intended to abolish that class property which makes the labour of the many the wealth of the few . . .
It wanted to make individual property a truth by transforming the means of production , land , and capital , now chiefly the means of enslaving and exploiting labour , into mere instruments of free and associated labour . ”
Proudhon , 1848 :
“ because of the formation of a class of capitalists or proprietors , another class of workers , and a third of talents . . . the worker has wound up enslaved . . . socialism thus consists of reducing the aristocratic formula of capital - labour - talent into the simpler formula of LABOUR ! . . . to make every citizen simultaneously , equally and to the same extent capitalist , worker and expert or artist . . . the organic origin of the proletariat . . . is located in the division of society into two classes : one that works and does not own ; the other that owns but does not work . ”
Marx , 1871 :
“ With labour emancipated , every man becomes a working man , and productive labour ceases to be a class attribute . . . present society with its two poles of capital and wages - slavery . ”
Proudhon , 1848 :
“ It is up to the National Assembly , through organisation of its committees , to exercise executive power , just the way it exercises legislative power through its joint deliberations and votes . ”
Marx , 1871 :
“ The Commune was to be a working , not a parliamentary body , executive and legislative at the same time . ”
Proudhon , 1848 :
“ Besides universal suffrage and as a consequence of universal suffrage , we want implementation of the binding mandate [ mandat impératif ] .
Politicians balk at it !
Which means that in their eyes , the people , in electing representatives , do not appoint mandatories but rather abjure their sovereignty !...
That is assuredly not socialism : it is not even democracy . ”
Marx , 1871 :
“ The Commune was formed of the municipal councillors , chosen by universal suffrage in the various wards of the town , responsible and revocable at short terms . . .
In a rough sketch of national organization . . . it states clearly that the Commune was to be the political form of even the smallest country hamlet . . . . and . . . each delegate to be at any time revocable and bound by the mandat imperatif ( formal instructions ) of his constituents . ”
The one missing item between the 1848 manifesto and the Commune was , of course , the vision of a federative political structure but this aided by Proudhon in the years subsequent to the Second Republic .
It is also worthwhile noting that , with regards to the binding mandate , Proudhon thought that this involved recall .
In his March 1848 pamphlet “ Democracy ” ( the second he wrote in response to the February revolution and most of which will be in “ Property is Theft ! ” ) , Proudhon went into this in more detail ( a previous translation can be found here ) :
“ In the end , we are all electors ; we can choose the most worthy .
“ We can do more ; we can follow them step - by - step in their legislative acts and their votes ; we will make them transmit our arguments and our documents ; we will suggest our will to them , and when we are discontented , we will recall and dismiss them .
“ The choice of abilities , imperative mandate and permanent revocability are the most immediate and incontestable consequences of the electoral principle .
It is the inevitable program of all democracy . ”
All of which suggests that Marx ’s comment that “ But this is communism , ‘ impossible ’ communism ! ” in relation to the Paris Commune was , well , spin .
It was , fundamentally , mutualism , libertarian socialism .
As such , it is somewhat amusing to see Marxists praise the Paris Commune to the hilt while , at the same time , denouncing Proudhon .
To be fair , this is often a product of ignorance as few Marxists bother to read anarchist writers and so fail to realise when they praise the Commune they are praising ideas popularised long before it by Proudhon .
Sadly , though , many anarchists fail to realise this too as Proudhon is not that well known in the English - speaking world .
Partly , this is because of a lack of translated material ( which should be changing now with this anthology and the work of people like Shawn Wilbur translating material ) .
Partly , though , it is because of the various distortions inflicted upon Proudhon by Marx and Marxists and which many anarchists are aware of more than Proudhon ’s own ideas .
Hopefully the anthology ’s discussion of Marx and Proudhon , plus our footnoting of “ System of Economic Contradictions ” comparing what Proudhon said and what Marx said he said , will show that much of the “ conventional wisdom ” on Proudhon is simply wrong .
And , finally , part of the problem is that Proudhon was wrong a few key issues ( sexism and racism , most obviously ) and his reformism does not appeal to revolutionary anarchism .
And in response to that , yes , we should criticise Proudhon for where he got it wrong but we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater !
I should note that the version in “ Property is Theft ! ” is not the same as in “ No Gods , No Masters . ”
This is the full translation , with the missing bits freshly translated .
Most of it is the same , but a few bits have been changed to bring in more in line with the original French version .
This meant fixing a few bits and pieces , for example “ le salariat ” is now rendered as “ wage - labour ” rather than “ wage - slavery ” to make it consistent with the other translations in the book .
One economic term had to be changed , as the reference to fiat money was missed in “ No Gods , No Masters . ”
Finally , one paragraph was translated as follows :
“ Nor do we want government of man by his fellow - man any more : have those who are so quick to seize upon the socialist formula given it any thought ? ”
It should have been :
“ We do not want the government of man by man any more than the exploitation of man by man : have those who are so quick to seize upon the socialist formula given it any thought ? ”
This reflects a common theme of Proudhon ’s , first raised in “ What is Property ? ” , namely opposition to both state and capitalism , both government and exploitation .
He did not think libertarian principles stopped at the doors of the workplace , nor did subsequent anarchists like Bakunin or Kropotkin .
As such , attempts by the authoritarian right and left to suggest anarchism is limited to critiquing and opposing the state are misguided , misleading , of dubious logic and historically ignorant .
However , as there is undoubtedly a political agenda in such attempts to limit anarchism and deny its legacy such attempts are unsurprising .
There are other obvious links to Proudhon ’s seminal 1840 book .
In the manifesto he argues that “ under universal association , ownership of the land and of the instruments of labour is social ownership ” and that “ [ u ] nder the law of association , transmission of wealth does not apply to the instruments of labour , so cannot become a cause of inequality . ”
However , there would be “ free disposition of the fruits of labour . ”
This obviously repeats the conclusions of 1840 that “ all production being necessarily collective , the labourer is entitled to a share of the products and profits commensurate with his labour , ” that “ all accumulated capital being social property , no one can be its exclusive proprietor ” and that as the land is “ a common thing . ”
His 1848 call for “ democratically organised workers ’ associations ” reflects his 1840 comment that workplace leaders “ must be chosen from the labourers by the labourers themselves , and must fulfil the conditions of eligibility . ”
So what we have , in essence , is a market socialist vision of independent workers and co-operatives using socialised land and means of production but distributing the means of producing by means of the market .
It is interesting that he denounces nationalisation as “ still wage - labour ” so showing the basic anarchist position that replacing the boss with the state is not socialism but state - capitalism .
Proudhon also links his ideas of the organisation of credit with those on the organisation of labour , showing ( certain commentators on his ideas not withstanding ) that he supported both and that each were interwoven .
It should also be stressed that Proudhon ’s roots his ideas in working - class self - activity .
He rejects the idea that a few leaders or politicians ( “ whose only wish is to command the people ” ) could create socialism , arguing repeatedly that socialism would be the product of working people freeing themselves by their own efforts and creating their own organisations .
He raised this opposition to socialism from above two years previously in “ System of Economic Contradictions ” ( chapter VII : “ your favourite maxim is that the welfare of the people must be achieved in spite of the people ” ) .
Or as he put it in 1849 ’s “ Confessions of a Revolutionary ” :
“ In this distinction of from above and from below , there is a great deal of bluster but little truth .
M. de Girardin , explaining his thoughts in this way , believes himself to have expressed an idea which is as new as it is profound ; but he has simply reproduced the eternal illusion of the Demagogues who , believing , with the help of power , that they are advancing their revolutions , are in fact merely serving to undermine them . . .
From above . . . evidently signifies power ; from below signifies the people .
On the one hand we have the actions of government ; on the other , the initiative of the masses . . . revolution from above is . . . inevitably revolution according to the whims of the Prince , the arbitrary judgement of a minister , the fumblings of an Assembly or the violence of a club : it is a revolution of dictatorship and despotism . . .
Revolution on the initiative of the masses is a revolution by the concerted action of the citizens , by the experience of the workers , by the progress and diffusion of enlightenment , revolution by the means of liberty . . . a revolution from below , from true democracy . . .
“ [ State ]
Socialism gave in fully to the illusion of radicalism . . .
Saint - Simon , Fourier , Owen , Cabet , Louis Blanc , all believers in the organisation of labour by the State , by Capital , by whatever authority , appealed . . . to revolution from above .
Instead of teaching the people how to organise themselves , by calling on their experience and their reasoning , they demanded Power .
So in what way do they differentiate themselves from despots ?
They are also utopians , like all despots : as one despot steps down , another fills his shoes !
“ The conclusion is that government can never be revolutionary quite simply because it is government .
Society alone , the masses armed with their intelligence , can create revolution ; society alone is able to deploy all its spontaneity , to analyse and explain the mystery of its destiny and its origin , to change its faith and its philosophy , because it alone is capable of fighting against its originator and to bear its fruit .
Governments are God ’s scourge , established to discipline the world : do you really expect them to destroy themselves , to create freedom , to make revolution ? ”
Such comments , of course , show how baseless attempts by Leninists ( Hal Draper , notably ) to rebrand Marxism as “ socialism from below ” are .
In terms of “ from below ” and its libertarian imagery , anarchists like Proudhon and Bakunin had been utilising it for over a century before Draper ( and , via him , the likes of the SWP and ISO ) started to .
At times it seems that we anarchists are fated to see our best words and expressions appropriated by ideologues at odds with our ideals ( most obviously libertarian being appropriated by propertarians ) .
Still , we can and must protest at such attempts …
Of course , from a revolutionary anarchist position there is much to object to in the manifesto but we must remember that this is an election manifesto and reformist in nature .
Hence the role of the state supervising the workers associations must be viewed as a transitional position .
While recognising the exploitative nature of capitalism , the manifesto also stresses the peacefulness of his means and the need for everyone to work for social transformation .
This dualism , the recognition that classes exist and the desire to end them plus seeking to reform capitalism away and not alienating the very class he seeks to abolish , occurs throughout his writings .
Needless to say , the Proudhon defends the patriarchal family although he is also at pains to stress that hierarchy was to limited to the family and was not for society ( “ the model of civil society is the fraternal association ” ) .
As other anarchists noted , this is somewhat in contradiction to his core libertarian principles and so argued that the family should be a “ fraternal association ” as well .
Still , there in spite of its limitations there is much of interest in the manifesto ( as can be said of Proudhon ’s work as a whole ! ) .
I was originally just going to have an edited version of the “ No Gods , No Masters ” version but I think that is a very good summary of Proudhon ’s ideas that it should be available in full – it would make a good little pamphlet , in my opinion .
Much of what is discussed finds parallels with subsequent revolutionary anarchist theory and , of course , Proudhon ’s ideas of the “ agro- industrial federation ” named as such in 1863 ’s “ The Federative Principle . ”
These links with subsequent revolutionary forms of anarchism are clear enough and worth stressing , particularly as they give an insight into the evolution of anarchism in the 19th century .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , then , Daniel Guerin quotes from this in his classic introductory book Anarchism :
“ We , the workers , associated or about to be associated , ” wrote Proudhon in the style of a manifesto , “ do not need the State ....
Exploitation by the State always means rulers and wage slaves .
We want the government of man by man no more than the exploitation of man by man .
Socialism is the opposite of governmentalism ....
We want these associations to be . . . the first components of a vast federation of associations and groups united in the common bond of the democratic and social republic . ”
It should be mentioned that when Proudhon wrote this manifesto , he was an elected representative of the people .
The second posting is Proudhon ’s famous ( and lengthy ) letter discussing absentionism when asked by workers his opinions on the Manifesto of the Sixty which called for workers to stand as candidates in elections under the Second Empire .
This letter position is the typical anarchist position on elections , namely abstentionism and outside pressure ( Proudhon ’s 1849 comments on “ legal resistance ” are pertinent here – and the full chapter will be posted here , eventially ) .
Which raises the questions of why , in 1848 , did Proudhon stand for election and why he later stressed abstentionism .
The first question was addressed by Proudhon at the end of the biographical Chapter XI ( “ Who am I ? ” ) of Confessions of a Revolutionary :
“ When I think of everything that I have said , written and published over these past ten years regarding the State ’s role in society , bringing the authorities to heel and government ’s disqualification from revolution , I am tempted to believe that my election in June 1848 was the result of some incomprehension on the part of the people .
Those ideas have been in my head ever since my earliest deliberations : they are coeval with my conversion to socialism .
Study and experience have expanded upon them : they have guided me constantly in my writings and actions : they have inspired all of the actions for which I shall answer : curious that after the reassurance they offer and which is the best that an innovator has to offer , I may have appeared momentarily to the society which I take for my judge and the authorities with whom I want no truck , as a formidable agitator . ”
Suffice to say , the revolution of 1848 infused him with hope for peaceful change and he sought to take advantage of it .
He did consider himself as a republican , a person seeking to make the promise of 1789 a reality by social reforms to match ( and extend ) political reforms .
Indeed , the failure of the republican experiment and the unwillingness of the people to defend it ( and the popular support Napoleon ’s coup of 1851 ) made him extremely bitter ( a bitterness which provoked a stream of abuse against “ the people ” which his enemies happily quote out of context ) .
This hope made him temporary forget his comments from 1846 :
“ Thus power , the instrument of collective might , created in society to serve as a mediator between labour and privilege , finds itself inevitably enchained to capital and directed against the proletariat .
No political reform can solve this contradiction , since , by the confession of the politicians themselves , such a reform would end only in increasing the energy and extending the sphere of power , and since power would know no way of touching the prerogatives of monopoly without overturning the hierarchy and dissolving society .
The problem before the labouring classes , then , consists , not in capturing , but in subduing both power and monopoly , – that is , in generating from the bowels of the people , from the depths of labour , a greater authority , a more potent fact , which shall envelop capital and the State and subjugate them .
Every proposition of reform which does not satisfy this condition is simply one scourge more , a rod doing sentry duty , virgem vigilantem , as a prophet said , which threatens the proletariat . ”
Proudhon also quotes those lines from “ System of Economic Contradictions ” after chronicling the reaction against social reform by the bourgeois politicians , adding these words “ are the prophecy of the events that we have seen take place in 1848 and 1849 . ”
So his experience as a politician confirmed the wisdom of those words – and the experience of Marxist social democracy , the German Greens and a host of other radicals utilising elections have borne them out ( as they have Bakunin ’s predictions on this issue ) .
As he put in “ Confessions of a Revolutionary ” :
“ Elected . . . as a representative of the people , I entered the national assembly with the shyness of the child and the ardour of a neophyte .
Always in attendance from nine o’clock in the morning at the office and committee meetings , I only left the assembly at night , exhausted with fatigue and disgust .
Since I first set foot on this parliamentary Sinai , I ceased to be in contact with the masses : by absorbing myself in my legislative work , I had completely lost view of current affairs .
I knew nothing about the national workshop situation , government policy or the intrigues going on within the assembly .
One has to experience this isolation called a national assembly to understand how the men who are the most completely ignorant of the state of a country are nearly always those who represent it . . .
Most of my colleagues on the left and the extreme left were in the same state of mental perplexity and ignorance of daily reality .
We only talked about the national workshops with a kind of dread : because the fear of the people is the evil of all those who belong to authority : for power , the people are the enemy . ”
In Confessions he spends some time explaining how the state is simply unsuitable as a means of social transformation , a position subsequent anarchists have expanded upon ( and the experience of the Russian Revolution confirmed ) .
Socialism , as anarchists have long re-iterated , can only be created from below , by the actions of the masses themselves and attempts to avoid this conclusion have always ended in failure .
I should also note that the 1846 analysis of the state was reiterated by Proudhon in the 1850s :
“ In a society based on the principle of inequality of conditions , government , whatever it is , feudal , theocratic , bourgeois , imperial , is reduced , in last analysis , to a system of insurance for the class which exploits and owns against that which is exploited and owns nothing . ”
( Manuel Du Spéculateur à la Bourse ( 4th edition , 1857 ) , p. 138 )
( As an aside , I should note that this quote is not , unfortunately , in the extracts from that strange work in “ Property is Theft ! ” although it is in the introduction , via Woodcock ’s excellent biography of Proudhon . )
All of which places Marxist claims that anarchists lack “ class analysis ” or fail to understand that the state is an instrument of class rule in stark context .
It also iterates that Marx ’s claim ( as repeated by Marxists ever since ) that Proudhon ’s opposition to electioneering was driven by idealism and a horror of violating ideals is simply wrong .
The 1864 letter is also notable for his denouncing of the opposition ’s proclaiming themselves not to be socialists and that universal suffrage under the Empire simply was not democratic enough .
These positions may come as a surprise to those who consider Proudhon as being against socialism or somehow anti-democratic .
In reality , as discussed in the introduction , Proudhon repeatedly called himself a socialist and stressed how monarchical ( anti- democratic ) a centralised republic was ( “ nothing resembles a monarchy more than a république unitaire ” ) .
This letter is also the first supplemental material , i.e. , translations which are not in “ Property is Theft ! ”
This was one of the things planned to go into the anthology , mostly because it had already been translated and I had no idea at the start how much of the wish - list would be done by the dead - line .
I also organised all the bits and pieces from “ No Gods , No Masters ” into their appropriate chapters .
As it turned out , thanks to the hard work of numerous volunteers the anthology got an abundance of new material and so both the letter and extracts were dropped .
After all , it is in “ No Gods , No Masters ” and so readily available ( and , to be honest , if you are interested in anarchism or Proudhon you would either have this classic anthology or quickly buy it once you knew about it ! ) .
Over the coming months I will be adding to this supplemental material , including whatever new Proudhon translations I become aware of as well as sections dropped from the final introduction due to space considerations ( so expect sections on numpties like Hal Draper and J. Salwyn Schapiro whose bizarre and downright false interpretations of Proudhon ’s ideas have done so much harm in certain circles ) .
This will also include , when I get round to posting the appropriate works , any extracts from “ No Gods , No Masters ” which I organised but , in the end , did not include in the anthology .
Suffice to say , I hope that the 1848 election manifesto shows why Proudhon is important and why anarchists today can benefit from a greater awareness of his ideas .
After all , he was the first to champion a lot of what we take for granted in revolutionary circles and it helps us gain a better insight into modern ideas , I would argue , if we have a better notion of where they came from and how they have evolved over the years .
This is not to suggest that we “ return to Proudhon ” as so many Marxists over the years have proclaimed with Marx ( usually after the predictable , and predicted , consequences of certain tactics and ideas panned out ) but , rather , to see how Proudhon contributed to the commonwealth of ideas which is anarchism , what is still of value in his legacy and , hopefully , use it to enrich and develop our activity and ideas in the here and now .
We gain little by smugly ignoring the past for , after all , those who do so tend to repeat it …
We are going to have a special Memorial Day post on Monday , so for today ’s Photo Hunt , my human wanted me to tell you a little bit about her cat before me — a memorial of sorts .
I ’ve mentioned her a few times , but I never met her .
She died about eight months before I came to live with my human .
This cat ’s name was Harlot and she was a longhaired calico .
Do not let her innocent eyes and sweet face fool you .
She was tough , she was mean , and she was a mass murderess .
No bird , squirrel , rat or mouse was safe when she was around .
Sometimes people were n’t either .
Once a neighbor lady tried to pet her and Harlot scratched her so badly that she had to go to the doctor and my human had to pay the lady ’s bill .
It was easier to get away with such bad behavior in the 1980s .
Why she was named Harlot : that was the one thing she answered to when my human was trying to name her .
She came from the streets of San Pedro , CA .
It was August of 1986 and my human had been down there for a music festival .
When she and her friend were walking back to the car , they saw a bunch of kids playing with a kitten .
The kitten ’s forehead had been shaved into some sort of punk rock ‘ do , although she seemed oblivious to this ( most street kittens are n’t fashionistas ) .
Of course my human wound up taking the kitten home , and the kitten was perfectly happy with this arrangement — until she found out that my human already had another cat !
She was mad about that , and she and the other cat never did make friends .
When he died , in fact , Harlot was perfectly fine about it .
It meant that she had my human all to herself .
It is no wonder that this kitty answered to the name Harlot — she was a groupie !
My human interviewed lots of rock bands , and Harlot tried to kiss up to every one of them .
For a few weeks , the living room was rented out to a singer who was homeless after a European tour , and he was friends with Ian Astbury of the Cult .
One day Ian came over and within two seconds , Harlot was giving him a lap dance .
She was a hussy .
She also decided that the trashcans out in back of the apartment belonged to her and her alone .
Any other cat who tried to dig through her trash got a beating .
Then the horrible day came : my human moved to a house on a big , overgrown hill that had only one trashcan … with a lid .
Harlot was inconsolable — until she realized she now had a new hobby : killing every living thing smaller than her that lived on this big hill .
She would catch squirrels that were almost as big as she was ( she was little like me , only a bit over seven pounds ) .
One time she came home with a special treat , which she offered to share with my human on the backyard pavement : a neatly severed squirrel head .
The thing could have been mounted , it was so perfect .
But after giving her a proper thank you , my human declined the gift , and Harlot picked up the head and took it away to enjoy by herself .
See , Harlot loved my human in a way that was fierce and feral .
They were more than pals , they were partners in a hostile , kill or be killed world .
More than once , Harlot avoided certain death .
She escaped coyotes and cars with barely a scrape and refused to let my human make her an indoor cat .
Harlot could no more have stayed indoors than my human could have ever held a 9 to 5 job .
She was bad tempered and utterly devoted and had the loudest purr of any cat my human ever lived with .
Eventually my human bought a house of her own and when Harlot wanted attention , she climbed the tree outside her home office window and yelled at her .
The windows in the living room were almost always left open so Harlot could come and go as she pleased .
Never mind the fact that they were almost two stories up — that was her preferred entrance and exit .
That house was also where Harlot was diagnosed with the bone cancer that would eventually kill her at the age of 15 - 1 / 2 .
The vet gave her a few months to live .
She lasted a year and a half .
And until my human sold that house , six months before Harlot died , she was still climbing the tree , jumping through the living room windows and killing small , unsuspecting creatures .
Even with a tumor on her shoulder .
Years ago , my human ’s boyfriend drew her a Valentine ’s Day card .
It showed Harlot devouring a bloody heart .
Some cats leave paw prints on your soul .
Harlot left raw , bleeding claw marks .

Addressed Issues :
Sure , we may have missed out on a great show in Pinellas County when a potential candidate who had serious problems with basic science understanding did n’t qualify in time to officially run .
But another opportunity has presented itself in Hillsborough County .
Terry Kemple is running for a seat on the school board there .
Do n’t remember Kemple ?
Let me jog your memory .
Baptist Press story : Proposed science standards debated in Fla .
Terry Kemple , president of the Tampa Bay Christian public policy group Community Issues Council , said leaving the standards unchanged regarding the origin of species would be better for teaching children how to think .
“ The issue really goes to the basic question of whether our schools are places of learning or indoctrination … , ” Kemple said .
The proposed standards , she [ sic ] noted , come from people who have a set of beliefs and want children ’s education to be based on those beliefs , he said .
“ My objection to their proposal is that , at its core , the suggested science standard relative to evolution is a set of beliefs unproven .
They believe that millions of years ago there was nothing and then suddenly there was something .
They have no proof .
It ’s not replicable .
It ’s clearly a belief , ” Kemple said .
“ You can give it a name and call it evolution , but it is nonetheless a set of beliefs . ”
Kemple noted that a set of beliefs is typically considered a religion or non-religion .
A large number of educated people believe evolution is not correct , he noted , and thus , as a set of beliefs , it should not be taught without stating its shortcomings .
Opinion article written by Kemple : What ’s The Fuss About Evolution ?
Macroevolution is entirely unproven .
It hypothesizes that our original “ ancestor ” went through a series of gradual changes that led to it becoming a new type of organism .
It further hypothesizes that through thousands of iterations of this process , you and I are here today .
There is no fossil evidence of this happening nor has it ever been replicated in the laboratory .
The sole purpose of the Academic Freedom Act that Storms introduced is to protect teachers and students from persecution if their investigation of evolution leads them to conclusions that differ with the “ party line ” as it ’s stated in the standards .
Yet , those who are using the authority of the Florida Department of Education to impose the religion of evolution are railing against Storms and claiming she is using her position to introduce religious teaching into the classroom when that ’s exactly what they are doing !
Press release issued by Kemple : State Legislature to take up “ Academic Freedom Act ”
“ The evolution ‘ sacred cow ’ must be submitted to scrutiny in American education , ” said Terry Kemple .
“ Anyone in academia who strays from the ‘ doctrine ’ of marching lock step in support of the theory of evolution risks persecution and blackballing in their career . ”
Members of both chambers of the Florida Legislature have filed a bill that will allow teachers “ to present scientific information relevant to the full range of views on biological and chemical origins ” without fear of persecution .
The bill will also protect “ students from being penalized for subscribing to a particular position on evolution . ”
“ Finally teachers and students will have the opportunity to cover all the information regarding the theory of evolution , ” Kemple continued .
“ Until now a teacher who differentiated between micro evolution ( observed changes over time within a species like a bacterium becoming resistant to antibiotics ) and macro evolution ( Darwin ’s unproven theory that all varieties of animal life came from a one celled common ancestor ) did so at the risk of his or her employment . ”
Kemple , President of Community Issues Council , worked closely with the Senate sponsor to get the bill filed in the Florida Senate .
The Senate language is being picked up by the House sponsor .
Other pro-family groups around the state have joined in and there are already co-sponsors in both the House and the Senate and the bill enjoys the favor of legislative leadership .
So , do you remember him now ?
I thought you would .
His campaign website is pretty tame right now , avoiding all mention of any divisive issues from his past .
His record is readily available , though , with a quick search of the Internet .
It looks like someone has already taken the initiative to create a parody campaign website for Kemple .
Despite having views completely at odds with reality , do n’t be fooled .
Some folks in Hillsborough County have told me he has quite a bit of support , and can raise tons of money in no time .
This is definitely a race worth watching .
Nowhere is the gap between sinister stereotype and ridiculous reality more apparent than in Afghanistan , where it ’s fair to say that the Taliban employ the world ’s worst suicide bombers : one in two manages to kill only himself .
And this success rate has n’t improved at all in the five years they ’ve been using suicide bombers , despite the experience of hundreds of attacks — or attempted attacks .
In Afghanistan , as in many cultures , a manly embrace is a time - honored tradition for warriors before they go off to face death .
Thus , many suicide bombers never even make it out of their training camp or safe house , as the pressure from these group hugs triggers the explosives in suicide vests .
According to several sources at the United Nations , as many as six would - be suicide bombers died last July after one such embrace in Paktika .
Many Taliban operatives are just as clumsy when suicide is not part of the plan .
In November 2009 , several Talibs transporting an improvised explosive device were killed when it went off unexpectedly .
The blast also took out the insurgents ’ shadow governor in the province of Balkh .
When terrorists do execute an attack , or come close , they often have security failures to thank , rather than their own expertise .
Consider Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab — the Nigerian “ Jockstrap Jihadist ” who boarded a Detroit - bound jet in Amsterdam with a suicidal plan in his head and some explosives in his underwear .
Although the media colored the incident as a sophisticated al - Qaeda plot , Abdulmutallab showed no great skill or cunning , and simple safeguards should have kept him off the plane in the first place .
He was , after all , traveling without luggage , on a one - way ticket that he purchased with cash .
All of this while being on a U.S. government watch list .
Fortunately , Abdulmutallab , a college - educated engineer , failed to detonate his underpants .
A few months later another college grad , Faisal Shahzad , is alleged to have crudely rigged an SUV to blow up in Times Square .
That plan fizzled and he was quickly captured , despite the fact that he was reportedly trained in a terrorist boot camp in Pakistan .
Indeed , though many of the terrorists who strike in the West are well educated , their plots fail because they lack operational know - how .
On June 30 , 2007 , two men — one a medical doctor , the other studying for his Ph.D. — attempted a brazen attack on Glasgow Airport .
Their education did them little good .
Planning to crash their propane - and - petrol - laden Jeep Cherokee into an airport terminal , the men instead steered the SUV , with flames spurting out its windows , into a security barrier .
The fiery crash destroyed only the Jeep , and both men were easily apprehended ; the driver later died from his injuries .
( The day before , the same men had rigged two cars to blow up near a London nightclub .
That plan was thwarted when one car was spotted by paramedics and the other , parked illegally , was removed by a tow truck .
As a bonus for investigators , the would - be bombers ’ cell phones , loaded with the phone numbers of possible accomplices , were salvaged from the cars . )

Please review our list of best credit cards , or use our CardMatch ™ tool to find cards matched to your needs .
Americans accustomed to plunking down a credit card to pay for everything from their morning cup of joe to their after - hours aperitif might be in for quite a surprise when traveling to many parts of the world where cash is still king .
Credit cards may only be accepted in the best of hotels and fanciest of restaurants ;
ATMs may be few and far between ; and carrying a wad of cash in your wallet may make you a magnet for pickpockets .
“ If it ’s a cash - based economy , chances are you ’re going to have to be very vigilant .
Everybody knows you ’re going to be carrying cash , ” says Peggy Goldman , owner of Friendly Planet Travel , based in Jenkintown , Pa .
But there are still plenty of ways to stay safe when traveling in a cash - based economy .
Start online
The best place to begin your journey is online .
Almost 39 million Americans flew to international destinations in 2009 , according to the U.S. Department of Commerce .
While Europe remains the perennial favorite , Asia , the Caribbean and Mexico have become hot spots , with more than 5 million visitors each .
And the popularity of the Mideast and Africa are booming .
But unlike Western Europe , where credit cards and ATMs are ubiquitous , other regions can present interesting challenges .
The best place to learn about the country you plan to visit is at the travel website run by the U.S. State Department , which has detailed information about each foreign country , often highlighting financial matters .
There you ’ll learn that in places such as Peru and China , counterfeit currency is a growing problem , and that the ruble is the only legal currency in Russia , except at certain authorized retailers .
Scout your ATMs in advance
You can also check out Wells Fargo ’s website , which offers information on credit cards , cash and ATMs for several dozen nations .
There you ’ll learn U.S. dollars in small denominations are accepted in Vietnamese cities , and that for safety ’s sake , ATMs should be used inside banks or other commercial establishments in countries including Mexico and South Africa , so you wo n’t be so visible to criminals .
Safety issues are n’t the only concern with ATMs .
They may be a challenge to find outside bigger cities and towns ; transaction fees may be costly ; or they may only dispense small sums of cash or run out entirely .
“ If the infrastructure of a country is dodgy , chances are so are the ATMs , ” says Jan Goodwin , a New York - based journalist who has covered wars and unrest in many of the world ’s hot spots .
“ It ’s very important to find out ahead of time what ’s available at your destination , ” in terms of ATMs , says Ed Perkins , a contributing editor at SmarterTraveler.com .
He suggests searching the VisaATM locator and MasterCardATM locator ahead of your travels to find out where ATMs are located in the countries you ’ll be visiting .
That will tell you if the country has two ATMs or 2,000 .
While travelers checks were once the mainstay of people traveling abroad , they ’re gradually falling out of favor .
“ Travelers checks are a pain in the neck , ” Goldman says .
“ Nobody likes them anymore . ”
In some places only banks and major hotels will accept them , and they may charge travelers a premium to cash them , says Bob Drumm , president of General Tours World Traveler , based in Keene , N.H .
If the infrastructure of a country is dodgy , chances are so are the ATMs .
Jan Goodwin , journalist and traveler
‘ Control the visibility of cash ’
So for many travelers , the best bet is bringing along cash .
But that means travelers need to “ control the visibility of cash , ” Drumm says .
Goodwin , whose recent vacations involved kayaking in Mongolia and Vietnam , travels to off - the - beaten - path destinations with several hundred dollars in cash , which she puts in a plain white envelope with a rubber band around it , and stores in a locked compartment of her backpack .
“ Authorities have never questioned it . ”
Other options for carrying cash include :
Money belts and pouches .
Socks .
Zippered inner compartments of travel jackets or vests .
It can help to divide it up among various storage spots , and keep only a small amount at hand .
Goldman recommends storing the bulk of your cash in the in - room safe or the hotel ’s safety deposit box , and only carrying around a limited amount of money .
Then if you ’re out shopping and find something you ’re dying to buy , go back and get the extra cash from your hotel .
Another way to limit your need for cash is to prepay for as much of the trip as possible before you leave home , Goldman says .
Currency issues
Goodwin recommends making sure the dollars you ’re carrying are relatively new .
“ Many Third World countries wo n’t take notes older than 7 years old . ”
On the flip side , be familiar with the currency at your destination .
“ There ’s an awful lot of fake money on the market , ” she says .
The State Department website warns of Americans in Mexico being arrested for passing on counterfeit currency that they received as change , and in Colombia , “ police officers ” may approach travelers in the street and ask to examine their money to make sure it ’s not counterfeit .
Then they flee with the cash .
Converting dollars into the local currency should be done at a reputable location , such as a bank , hotel or exchange office , Goldman says .
Ann Lombardi , a travel consultant with The Trip Chicks in Atlanta , says travelers need to be vigilant so they do n’t receive outdated bills rather than proper currency when exchanging money or making a purchase .
They also need to make sure no one tries to slip them a different country ’s bills or coins .
That currency may look similar to that of the country they ’re in , but it will be worth less — if it ’s usable at all in their current location .
Along with knowing what the currency looks like , it ’s imperative to know the proper exchange rate to avoid getting ripped off .
“ It always amazes me how many American travelers still seem to stick their hands out and invite street vendors or store sales personnel to ‘ help themselves ’ to the correct payment amount , ” Lombardi says .

So , just a few moments ago , Apple introduced Safari 5 , the next major version of our favorite web browser .
And with Safari 5 ? Safari Extensions , a new way for developers to add new functionality to Safari .
And , also a few moments ago , we have our very first crack at a Safari extension !
What is it ?
Well , the pitch goes something like this : we do a pretty good job making life easier for people who hand - code websites using Coda , our all - in - one web development environment .
But is there anything we can do to make life better for the client ?
The person who ’s paying the bills , or the marketing person , or the guy or girl who ’s likely to call you and say , “ Hey , can you make that one thing bigger , move that one thing and do that thing ?
By tomorrow ? ” Nobody knows what that means .
And that ’s something we thought we could improve .
Introducing Coda Notes , our Safari Extension for website annotation , and a fun little project .
When you install Coda Notes , you ’ll get a new button in your toolbar .
Click it to see all our annotation tools , built right into Safari .
Draw some notes on your favorite website .
Communicate changes , ideas , concepts , or problems .
Then , when you ’re done , hit the Send Notes button and the whole page flips over as a postcard .
Enter your comments , e-mail addresses , hit the nice looking “ Send Notes ” button , and that ’s it !
The developer gets an e-mail with your screenshot and notes , instantly .
In short , with Coda Notes , you can communicate in seconds what would have been much harder to communicate before , all without ever leaving Safari .
And let ’s not forget cool thing # 2 : we literally added a new feature to Safari .
In a standards - based , clean way .
This , my friends , is awesome .
( Tech Note : The Coda Notes extension is built entirely in JavaScript , HTML , and CSS ; the extension bar is basically an HTML file , and the page - flip effect is accomplished using a CSS transform .
We draw on a transparent canvas element injected over the target page .
Live text editing is done by setting the contentEditable attribute on the body of the page , thus turning Safari into an editor , similar to how Apple Mail works ! )
When will this be available ?
Update : Coda Notes is now available for download !
We ’re feeling it out .
It ’s certainly “ quick and dirty ” in its current form , and Coda Notes was a bit of an experiment for us — made in only 4 days !
But when Safari Extensions are more available to the public , it ’s likely you ’ll see Coda Notes too .
Keep an eye on this blog and / or follow us on Twitter !
Thanks to Apple for letting us play with Safari Extensions , and thanks to Neven and Garrett for such great quick work on this project .
If you have ideas for Coda Notes , let us know !
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - Investigators probing the deadly sinking of a South Korean navy ship in March near the North have concluded that a torpedo was the source of an explosion that destroyed the vessel , a news report said on Friday .
The team of South Korean and foreign investigators found traces of explosives used in torpedoes on several parts of the sunken ship as well as pieces of composite metal used in such weapons , South Korea ’s Yonhap news agency said quoting a senior government official .
South Korean officials have not officially accused the North but made little secret of their belief Pyongyang deliberately torpedoed the 1,200 - tonne corvette Cheonan in March near their disputed border in retaliation of a naval firefight last year .
The metallic debris and chemical residue appear to be consistent with a type of torpedo made in Germany , indicating the North may have been trying to disguise its involvement by avoiding arms made by allies China and Russia , Yonhap quoted the official as saying .
North Korea has denied involvement and accused South Korean President Lee Myung - bak ’s government of trying to use the incident for political gains ahead of local elections in June .
The federal Conservatives continue to garner more support than the Liberals , but their lead is narrowing , a new EKOS opinion poll suggests .
The poll , released exclusively to CBC , suggests that 31.4 per cent of respondents would vote for the Tories if an election were held today , compared with 26.8 per cent who would back the Liberals .
The Tories ' lead of 4.6 percentage points over the Liberals is down from the 5.5 - percentage - point spread of last week and a lead of up to 10 percentage points last month .
Support for the other parties was stable , according to this week 's telephone poll .
The NDP had 16.6 per cent support of respondents , while 12.6 per cent backed the Green Party and 8.9 per cent preferred the Bloc Québécois .
The poll also suggests that close to half of Canadians ( 48.1 per cent ) felt that the country is moving in the right direction while 39.4 per cent felt it is moving in the wrong direction .
Similar to previous weeks , close to half of Canadians ( 48.6 per cent ) felt the government is moving in the wrong direction , suggesting that Canadians are not associating the direction of the country with the direction of the government .
The random survey of 1,789 Canadians aged 18 and over was conducted June 2 - 8 and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 2.3 percentage points , 19 times out of 20 .
It was his first reference to the possibility of a criminal probe into the accident in the Gulf of Mexico , although he did not say such an investigation was under way .
Attorney General Eric Holder said on May 3 that the Justice Department was part of the probe into the spill , though a US official said then it was not a criminal inquiry .

CLEVELAND , Ohio --
He 's more than a sports superstar .
He 's a one - man economic engine that drives the lane , fills the bars and puts Cleveland on national TV .
Exactly how much LeBron James means to the local economy is difficult to calculate .
Millions ?
Of course .
Billions ?
Maybe , maybe not .
Either way , the economy will feel the sting if James decides to take his basketball and play elsewhere .
The league 's two - time Most Valuable Player can become a free agent Thursday and sign with another team .
Got your calculator ?
Let 's see how much money we might lose .
Start with downtown businesses
If the Chosen One chooses someone else , downtown businesses figure to lose $ 48 million over the course of a season .
Here 's how :
For three years , Quicken Loans Arena has seen sellout crowds of more than 20,500 .
Virtually every one of those people came to watch Northeast Ohio 's biggest sports star .
" They fill up the restaurants .
They go to the bars after the games .
They spend a lot of money , " said Jerry Hausman , an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studied Michael Jordan 's effect on the National Basketball Association .
Jordan led the Chicago Bulls to their sixth NBA title in eight years in the 1997 - 98 season .
Then he called it quits .
The next year , the Bulls missed the playoffs , and attendance fell by 1,500 per game in a season shortened by a labor dispute .
More losing seasons followed , and by 2001 - 2002 , attendance was down by more than 5,000 a game .
In Houston , Hakeem Olajuwon led the Rockets to back - to - back NBA championships in the 1993 - 94 and 1994 - 95 seasons .
Every home game for four seasons afterward was a sellout .
But with Olajuwon gone in 2000 - 01 , attendance was off about 3,600 per game from the sellout years -- despite the team 's winning record .
And a year after that , per -game attendance was down about 4,500 from the peak .
Say LeBron leaves and the crowds shrink to the size they were before he arrived : a little under 14,000 fans a game .
That 's 6,500 fewer people buying tickets , paying for parking , visiting restaurants , celebrating in bars and renting the occasional hotel room for the night .
Positively Cleveland , the city 's convention and visitors bureau , estimates that the average fan spends $ 180 per game to see the Cavs at The Q , meaning the smaller crowd would cost businesses $ 1.2 million per game .
Multiply that by 41 home games , and you have $ 48 million .
Or , more precisely , you do n't have it .
Now , the playoffs
Imagine LeBron leads the Cavs deep into the playoffs .
Yes , forget this year for a moment .
John Skorburg , an economist at the University of Illinois at Chicago , esimates the James - led Cavs could generate $ 15 million for Greater Cleveland for each home playoff game .
That 's based on a sellout crowd at the Q and 5 percent of the population watching the playoffs -- eating , drinking , bar - hopping , renting cars , buying jerseys and so forth .
He figures an average of $ 100 per person .
So on top of $ 48 million , add 10 home playoff games -- a total of $ 150 million , according to Skorburg .
Other cities would benefit even more .
Skorburg estimates that Chicago would gain $ 500 million and New York $ 1 billion , because more people live in those places .
The team itself loses value , too
The franchise is worth $ 476 million now , but if James left , it could revert to close to what it was before he signed with the Cavs in 2003 , said Bruce S. Schaeffer , president of Franchise Valuations Ltd. , in New York .
The Cavs were valued at $ 258 million before James .
The value jumped to $ 298 million in 2004 .
In early 2005 , Gilbert bought the team for $ 375 million .
Don Erickson , co-founder of Erickson Partners in Dallas , who specializes in sports team contracts and values , said the value of the franchise depends on how much money the team is making .
It 's possible a team could become more profitable if it's not paying a superstar 's salary .
" The fact is that the Cavaliers may or may not be getting a rate of return for their investment in him , " Erickson said .
" You can overpay players .
Teams have done that .
The same thing could be true with LeBron James . "
Still , Forbes magazine puts James ' value to the franchise at somewhere around $ 100 million .
Aggregate revenue over James ' seven years has averaged $ 19.4 million more than the seven pre-James years , Forbes says .
The magazine used those figures to determine that James has added at least $ 56 million in inflation - adjusted value .
That does n't include media , sponsorship and branding revenues -- things like local advertising rates and licensing fees that add 50 percent to 66 percent more value .
" If Mr. Gilbert wants to maximize his long - term wealth position , " Forbes said , " the numbers suggest that he better retain his King .
Otherwise , Gilbert becomes a court jester in his own kingdom . "
What 's LeBron worth ?
$ 48 million
The amount downtown businesses could lose if LeBron left the Cavs
$ 150 million
The amount the region would lose if it missed out on 10 home playoff games
$ 100 million
The amount LeBron contributes to the Cavs ' total value
Priceless
The happiness we feel having LeBron playing here
*
Even the government gets hit
If James worked only in Ohio , as most of us do , he would pay about $ 976,773 in state income taxes on his Cavs ' salary .
He does n't .
Like all professional athletes and entertainers , he pays income taxes to other states based on the number of days he plays or practices there .
You might say conservatively that he spends more than half of his working time in Ohio .
James also pays local income taxes , about $ 353,250 to Cleveland , Independence and Akron combined .
Of course , none of this includes taxes on his $ 28 million in income from endorsements .
Nor does it include the $ 186,942.98 in annual property taxes he pays on his 30,000 - square - foot home in Bath Township , valued at $ 9.8 million .
Between all of the taxes , James pays more than $ 1 million to local governments .
Some of that money might continue to flow if James left town .
Would he sell his palace in Bath ?
How many games would he still play here ?
No one has those answers .
But no one knows if he 's leaving either , so why stop there ?
Finally , the squishy stuff
The monetary side is only one part of James ' value , said economist LeRoy Brooks of John Carroll University in University Heights .
The other part , in economist 's terms , is utility .
That 's a bureaucratic way of saying this :
" He makes people happier , " Brooks said .
" It 's not just the money .
He makes people feel better , more enthused .
" Why do you think sports is so big ?
There 's a sense of community that comes from sports .
It helps bring a community together . "
Downtown development , to some extent , also might rest on James ' shoulders .
If the Cavs are good , downtown buzzes , and it becomes a more appealing place to live .
If no one comes downtown for games , the electricity ebbs .
And the city 's image shines when the Cavs play on national TV , a more common occurrence in the LeBron years .
" You ca n't underestimate LeBron 's impact on our community and our region , " said Cavaliers President Len Komoroski .
Komoroski is quick to note that fans are renewing season tickets and luxury boxes at record levels .
He declines to say whether he thinks James will stay in Cleveland .
But even if he leaves , Komoroski says he 's certain the team wo n't fall apart as the Bulls did when they lost Jordan .
" Our fans in Northeast Ohio believe in Dan Gilbert and our team and that Dan will take the necessary steps " to keep the Cavs competitive , Komoroski said .
" Fans understand that the right kind of decisions are being made . "
That might be , but the biggest decision -- the one James soon will make -- is yet to come .
When the government launched a nationwide campaign to register cellphones , millions of Mexicans refused .
And thousands of others registered with a familiar name : Felipe Calderon , the country ’s president .
The idea was that the registry would combat rampant telephone extortion rackets and kidnapping attempts .
But even with the threat of having their lines disconnected , an estimated 26 million users ( about 30 % of all holders of cellphones in Mexico ) had n’t submitted their names on the eve of the government - set deadline .
Some said they were convinced that the government would use the information to spy on dissidents or anyone else out of favor .
Others said they feared the information would end up in the wrong hands .
They were proved right last month when the confidential data of millions of Mexicans from official state registries suddenly became available for a few thousand dollars at Mexico City ’s wild Tepito flea market .
“ Mexicans left naked ! ” complained one columnist .
Threat to national security !
opined experts .
In Mexico , unlike the United States , voter sign - up rolls and motor vehicle registrations are not a matter of public record .
Mexicans , in theory at least , expect privacy .
So when these databases began turning up in the chaotic Tepito market , Mexicans were not pleased .
In a country seized by the fear of kidnapping and held hostage by violent crime bosses , having this quantity of personal information on open display seemed tantamount to a death sentence , or , at the minimum , a magnet for trouble .
It confirmed the worst suspicions of many Mexicans : that any attempt to do their civic duty by registering property or signing up to vote would end up being used against them .
“ This was a devastating blow to any effort to create a relationship of trust between citizens and the authorities , ” said Gustavo Fondevila , a researcher at the Center for Investigation and Economic Studies , a Mexico City think tank .
“ There is complete mistrust toward everything the government decides , promises and especially when it asks for personal information .
And it is completely justified . ”
It is that suspicion that fuels Mexico ’s notorious scofflaw culture .
The personal data discovered at the Tepito market , part of an investigation by El Universal newspaper , also included lists of police officers with their photographs , which could easily be cross - referenced with other databases to find out where they live .
The paper said a complete package of data could be had for about $ 12,000 .
The revelations lighted a fire under the Mexican Senate , where a privacy law had been languishing .
Senators quickly passed the law unanimously late last month and congratulated themselves for being able to give reassurances to the public that their private data would not be misused .
But , as they say in Mexico :
They were covering the well after the child had drowned .

A pot smoking den inside an NYU dorm named ' Narnia ' has gone up in smoke after drawing a little too much attention to itself .
The alcove inside a Hayden Hall suite that saw up to 50 people in a given day enter it to get high was moved elsewhere when university officials read about in last week 's Washington Square News , where students bragged about a spot that provided a sense of community the school did n't ( not to mention a safe haven for oral sex ) .
The paper talked to one freshman who smoked pot for the first time inside the room adorned with Christmas lights , a set of bongos , a stuffed raven and a poster of Prince Caspian .
He told them , “ I ’ve learned a lot about life through marijuana and Narnia has facilitated my marijuana usage . "
That freshman ended up donating a 32 - inch plasma television , an Xbox 360 , and more than a dozen games to the space .
In its wake , one junior told the Post , " Places like Narnia became social centers for students looking for a thrill .
I bet student morale will plummet now that it 's gone . "

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Researchers in Grenoble , France have for the first time successfully implanted glucose biofuel cells in living rats .
The results suggest such cells may one day use the body ’s own glucose and oxygen supplies to power human implants and avoid the necessity for surgical replacement when the batteries are nearing the end of their lives .
The device consists of electrodes of compressed graphite containing enzyme catalysts for the oxidation of glucose and chemicals called redox mediators .
Redox mediators transport the electric charge from the enzymes to the electrodes leading from the fuel cell to the device it is powering .
Glucose oxidase and ubiquinone were at the anode , while polyphenol oxidase and quinine were at the cathode .
The enzymes and redox mediators are contained within a dialysis bag that keeps them inside but allows glucose and oxygen obtained from the bodily fluids to pass through .
The devices were implanted into the rats ’ abdominal cavities and in one case monitored for three months .
Once in place the enzymes triggered the oxidation of glucose , which generated electrical energy .
The research team , from the Joseph Fourier University , found that confining the enzymes to discs of graphite placed inside dialysis bags overcame the problems found in previous attempts at developing glucose biofuel cells ( GBFCs ) , such as inhibition of the reaction by charged particles in the surrounding body fluids , or the need for low pH conditions .
Summary of the principle , preparation , implantation and operation of an implantable “ Quinone - Ubiquinone Glucose BioFuel Cell ” .
See the original paper for more details .
Image : doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0010476
The team , led by biomedical engineer Philippe Cinquin , found in one rat the device could produce up 6.5 microwatts , and electrical output remained stable at two microwatts for 11 days , after which the rat was sacrificed .
They calculated they obtained a maximum specific power of 24.4 microwatts per milliliter , which exceeds a pacemaker ’s requirement of 10 microwatts .
The second rat was monitored for three months , and throughout the period its urine contained gluconate , a byproduct of glucose oxidation , indicating the device was still working .
When this rat was sacrificed and dissected the scientists found a new vascular network had developed around the implant , and there was no sign of inflammation .
Cinquin said he was optimistic the efficiency could be improved , and achieving electrical outputs in the tens of milliwatts is not unrealistic in larger animals .
He said he could see no reason why the devices could not work in people , and hoped to see them developed for use in humans within five to 10 years .
The biofuel cell could find application in devices such as insulin pumps , artificial urinary sphincters , biosensors , bone growth simulators and drug delivery devices as well as pacemakers .
The research team want to continue their research by testing glucose biofuel cells in larger animals and for longer periods .

£ 100 m building project halted after GOOSE lays eggs on site ... so builders give nest its own security guard
Work on a £ 100 million building development ground to a halt yesterday - because of a goose .
The bird has laid three eggs right in the middle of the building site and has been given her own bodyguard to protect her and her brood .
Security guard Jake Fielding has been assigned to give the Canada Goose 24 - hour protection and takes his duties extremely seriously .
The development that is being delayed because of the goose is known as the Cube - which was meant to be the finishing touch to an exclusive area of Birmingham .
A goose has laid three eggs right in the middle of a building site , bringing work to a halt .
The bird has been given her own bodyguard to protect her and her brood
It will contain a boutique hotel and residential apartments and is the final phase of luxury development The Mailbox , in an affluent area of the city .
Work on the Cube , which will be overlooking a canal , was expected to finish soon - but the arrival of the goose has delayed the whole operation .
Contractors Fitzgerald have been forced to hold off on any work on the pavements , where the goose has got settled .
A spokesman from Fitzgerald admitted that the goose was a source of both amusement and annoyance .
He said : ' The goose has been her for about three weeks now , and she 's settling in quite nicely , which is unfortunate for us .
' But Jake Fielding , who is guarding the bird is doing a great job of keeping her safe and hopefully we wo n't be waiting too long for the eggs to hatch .
The development that is being delayed is known as the Cube - which was meant to be the finishing touch to an exclusive area of Birmingham
' We try to be very environmentally friendly , and do n't want to do anything to disturb the bird .
' The goose has meant we have had to put off finishing the pavements around the bird and its eggs for three weeks .
' We have been able to work on other parts of the site in the meantime so we are not losing money but it is a pain that it has delayed the project .
' It is frustrating that we 're being held up but I 'm sure work will be able to continue as usual once the eggs have hatched .
' It would n't be a good idea to move her before her goslings have hatched . '
Cllr Mike
Whitby said of the Cube back in 2006 before the goose incident that it would break all the boundaries of what has been achieved in Birmingham so far .
He said : ' Our city is a city of the future and as a futuristic building with phenomenal foresight in style and design , it is indicative of our plans in how we see Birmingham developing .
' The Mailbox has already raised the bar in the quality and calibre of our architecture and the retail offerings , worldwide brand names and stylish restaurants have given Birmingham a contemporary profile rivalling the capitals of Europe .
The folks over at VideoLAN are in the process of releasing version 1.1.0 of VLC , and one of the major changes is the removal of SHOUTcast , a media - streaming module from AOL - owned Nullsoft .
" During the last year , the VLC developers have received several injunctions by e-mail from employees at AOL , asking us to either comply to a license not compatible with free software or remove the SHOUTcast capability in VLC . "
Within the license is a clause prohibiting the distribution of SHOUTcast with any product whose own license requires that it be " disclosed or distributed in source code form , " " licensed for the purpose of making derivative works , " or " redistributable at no charge . "
The license would also force VideoLAN to bundle Nullsoft adware with VLC .

Image caption Binyam Mohamed :
An MI5 officer faces investigation over his case
The terms of an inquiry into claims British agents were complicit in the torture of terror suspects are still being debated , the BBC understands .
Whitehall had been prepared for an announcement on Wednesday but the BBC's Nick Robinson said there were still arguments about its scope .
The PM is understood to have agreed to compensation if it was found suspects were tortured and UK agents knew .
British security services say they do not collude in torture .
Former Labour ministers have insisted the UK did not use or condone torture .
Judge - led inquiry
But the Conservatives and Lib Dems have long urged an inquiry into the claims of UK resident Binyam Mohamed who said British security services were aware of his torture .
Foreign Secretary William Hague confirmed in May there would be a " judge - led " inquiry to the allegations .
It is understood more details had been expected to be announced on Wednesday .
However our correspondent said he had been told there were still arguments about the inquiry 's scope , its membership and whether it should be headed by a judge .
Our officers are as committed to the values and the human rights values of liberal democracy as anybody else Sir John Scarlett , Former MI6 chief ' Publish terror guidelines ' call
But he said he understood British security services had advised ministers they would prefer an inquiry - rather than a long , drawn out process through the courts .
It is also understood that the inquiry will offer compensation to people found to have been victims of torture carried out by foreign security services , but with the knowledge of British intelligence officials .
The prime minister 's spokesman would only say an announcement would be made " in due course " .
Ethiopian - born Mr Mohamed says he was tortured after being held in Pakistan in 2002 , and subsequently moved to Morocco and Afghanistan .
He says agents from the UK's MI5 knew about this and fed questions to his interrogators through the CIA .
' Rigorous investigation '
Mr Mohamed was transferred to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba in 2004 and was freed last year , after charges of involvement in terrorist plots were dropped .
He says the only evidence against him was obtained through torture .
The government 's reviewer of terrorism legislation , Lord Carlile , told the BBC : " I think a judge - led inquiry will have the advantage of a rigorous investigation of allegations that are made , the protection of national security and the award of compensation to anyone who 's able to prove on the balance of probability that they have been tortured or otherwise subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment . "
But he said an inquiry could not take place until criminal investigations already under way had been completed .
Its reach must also be broader than just the security services and must include other government officials Andrew Tyrie , Parliamentary group on extraordinary rendition
The Metropolitan Police are investigating the role played by a number of British security agents in Mr Mohamed 's interrogation , after a request by former Attorney General Lady Scotland .
Lord Carlile also said he hoped the judge would be assisted by people with experience of the security services world and would not expect the entire inquiry to be held in public , for national security reasons .
On Tuesday the Human Rights Watch group demanded that guidance given to UK intelligence officers interrogating suspects overseas be published " without delay " .
But , speaking to the BBC last year , the then head of MI6 Sir John Scarlett said there was no torture and " no complicity in torture " by the British secret service .
" Our officers are as committed to the values and the human rights values of liberal democracy as anybody else , " he said .
" They also have the responsibility of protecting the country against terrorism and these issues need to be debated and understood in that context . "
The chairman of the all - party parliamentary group on extraordinary rendition , Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie , said : " This inquiry can only be of lasting benefit if its remit is wide enough to include not only complicity in the torture of terrorist suspects , but also allegations of complicity in extraordinary rendition .
" Its reach must also be broader than just the security services and must include other government officials . "
Shami Chakrabarti , director of human rights group Liberty , said : " This investigation must be independent , judge - led and have broad powers to call evidence and make as much as possible publicly available .
" Only this kind of inquiry can end the slow bleed of embarrassing revelation and expensive litigation and draw a line under this shameful business once and for all . "
What ’s the best private tracker to download BRRips ?
This is a question we see all too often in our E - mail inbox .
BRRip and BDRip are two relatively new video release types that saw the light after the launch of Blu Ray disk format .
These are usually XViD or x264 encoded rips made using a Blu Ray video source .
Although not considered as true HD encodes , BRRips usually have a higher video resolution and image quality compared to regular DVDRip releases .
In fact , a good BRRip usually has better image quality than even a DVD5 / DVD9 DVDR release .
Additionally , these often have lesser file size than regular 720 p and 1080 p Blu Ray encodes ( usually 2 - 3GB as opposed to 4 - 13GB ) and are becoming increasingly popular amongst BitTorrent users with relatively low bandwidth internet connections .
While almost every tracker on the planet tracks XViD encoded DVDRip releases , only a select few index Blu Ray Rips .
Coming back to the original question , which private tracker has the largest collection of BRRip / BDRip torrents ?
If you are looking to download BRRips / BDRips , first tip would be to stop looking in scene only trackers .
These are not popular release formats amongst scene release groups and even the best scene trackers such as SCC have only a handful of such releases ( SCC only has around 90 torrents ) .
P2P oriented groups on the other hand have had much more success with these formats .
Tracker No. Of Blu Ray Rips Notes IPTorrents ~4000
The actual number of movies may even be higher as the torrent count includes ~ 100 movie packs .
Demonoid 2240 + Yeah , Demonoid .
Never ceases to amaze :p RevolutionTT 1700
This includes XvidHD releases by NPW .
TorrentLeech 1550 Finding BRRips on TL is easy .
Just browse the NonScene / BRRip -x264 and NonScene / BRRip - XviD categories .

PTN 360 Again , the actual number of BRRip movies tracked is a lot higher than 360 as some of these are movie packs .
As you can see from the table above , IPTorrents leads the pack with nearly 4000 BRRip / BDRip torrents .
IPT indexes a huge number of releases from SANTi , D - ZON3 , JEZZA , Rx , FLAWL3SS ( who release non HD rips internally on IPT ) and a number of other P2P groups who frequently release Blu Ray rips .
Some of you might be surprised not to see specialized movie trackers up in the list – well this is once instance where having access to a huge general tracker pays off ( and remember , we ’re talking about 2 - 3GB Blu Ray rips here – thousands of full HD 720p / 1080 p releases indexed on HDBits , etc were not counted ) .
Speaking of movie trackers , a good niche site to download x264 BRRip releases from is x264.me .
This tracker has it ’s own internal encoders and has releases not found anywhere else .
If you are looking to download BRRips you now know where to go .
Those who still have n’t given this format a try , do n’t forget to check it out .
While not true HD releases , BRRips have greater video quality and lesser file size .
These should be ideal for folks on systems with SD video and / or if you are worried about internet bandwidth .
If you know any other torrent sites that track a lot of BRRip releases , feel free to share them here – surely we must have missed some of them :)

A City Worker Pleas with Spider - Man to Clean up After Himself
Hey Spider - Man ,
Enough with the freakin’ webs already !
I get that you ’re some hotshot superhero , savin ’ New York , but c’mon man , pick up after yourself .
You ’re the pride of Queens , how ’s about helping us out by takin ’ ‘em with you when you ’re done with ‘em ?
What do you think happens to them webs you leave stuck on buildings ?
That ’s freakin’ right , you “ do n’t know ! ”
Well , I ’ll tell you , me and my crew gotta get up there and swat at ‘em with brooms , and sticks , and crap .
One time , I swear on my mother , they sent me up to the top of the Chrysler Building with a fishin ’ pole to clean up your mess .
How much crime happens up there , web - head ?
Now , I do n’t know what part of you makes that crap , and I do n’t wanna know , but it ’s sticky , man .
I go home , I gotta wash up for like an hour with turpentine .
No joke , one time my hand got stuck to a cereal box while I ’m pourin ’ breakfast for my kid .
I had to get on the A Train lookin’ like some kinda whack - a- do with a cardboard freakin ’
Coco bird stuck to my hand .
Seriously , you ’re like a spider , ca n’t you jump around the city from buildin ’ to buildin ’ without them webs ?
I get that you gotta tie up bad guys .
I got no beef with that , but all the time with the swinging ?
It seems pretty unnecessary .
You know , the kids ’d love to see you on the subway once in a while .
Anyway , next time you see that Sandman , punch that jerk right in the ribs for me .
His mess is worse than yours .
I do n’t know how that guy ’s still walking around , I got like a hundred pounds of him in a box back at the shop .
The new kid at work threw a sandwich in there the other day , to see if he was hidin’ .
So I said , “ Did you just chuck a good sandwich in the Sandman box ?
Now you got no sandwich , dope ! ”
Go Mets !

Mexico City , Mexico ( CNN ) --
A strong earthquake hit southern Mexico's Oaxaca state early Wednesday , the U.S. Geological Survey reported .
The magnitude 6.2 quake rattled the region at 2:22 a.m. local time and was centered about 220 miles south - southeast of Mexico City .
The Oaxaca state Civil Protection Agency reported no damage or loss of life .
The earthquake was also felt in Mexico City and Acapulco , about 150 miles from the epicenter .
" It was long ... slow waves ... the kind we sometimes feel here , " according to a receptionist at the Crowne Plaza Acapulco Hotel .
There was no damage at the hotel , she said , adding some people were woken up by the quake and called the front desk to find out what was happening .
It ’s also in keeping with this ideology that Paul wants the federal government to stop shoveling taxpayers ’ money into wars .
He was against the war in Iraq and finds the justification for our commitment in Afghanistan “ murky . ”
He believes that America ’s national security is “ not threatened by Iran having one nuclear weapon . ”
No wonder he did n’t get Cheney ’s endorsement ;
Paul also opposes the enhanced government surveillance mandated by the Patriot Act .
The Tea Party is a rolling rebuke to the neocons ’ quarter - century dominance of the G.O.P .
Only three months ago , Ron Paul , who shares his son ’s un-Cheney national security views , won the straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington , ending Mitt Romney ’s three - year winning streak .
With Rand Paul , we also get further evidence of race ’s role in a movement whose growth precisely parallels the ascent of America ’s first African - American president .
The usual Tea Party apologists are saying that it was merely a gaffe — and a liberal media trap — when Paul on Wednesday refused to tell Rachel Maddow of MSNBC that he could fully support the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .
But Paul has expressed similar sentiments repeatedly , at least as far back as 2002 .

His legal argument that the federal government cannot force private businesses to desegregate is the same used by Barry Goldwater , a frequently cited hero of Paul ’s , when the conservative standard - bearer voted against the Civil Rights
Act at its inception .
It ’s all about the Constitution , not race , you see .
Under fire , Paul ultimately retreated from this stand — much as the new Republican governor of Virginia , Bob McDonnell , finally withdrew his April proclamation saluting Confederate History Month .
But not before both men ’s messages reached their intended demographic .
Still , it ’s Paul ’s brand of populism , not his views on Jim Crow or Iran , that are most germane to the Tea Party ’s birth and its future — both within the G.O.P. and as a force that will buffet Obama and the Democrats .
Paul most abundantly embodies the movement ’s animus when he plays on classic American - style class resentment .
His campaign loved to deploy the full name of his opponent , Charles Merwin Grayson III , a Harvard - educated banker ’s son .
In his victory speech Tuesday night , Paul said the voters ’ message was to “ get rid of the power people , the people who run the show , the people who think they ’re above everybody else ” — or , as he put it on an earlier occasion , the establishment who “ from their high - rise penthouse ” look down on and laugh at the “ American rabble . ”
That Paul gave his victory speech in a “ members only ” country club is no contradiction to white Tea Partiers .
Their anger is directed at a loftier club that excludes them as well : the big - government and big - money elites partying together in that high - rise penthouse .
At the Utah state G.O.P. convention this month , the mob shouted “ TARP ! TARP ! TARP ! ” as it terminated the re-election bid of the conservative Senator Robert Bennett .
It was Bennett ’s capital crime to vote for a bailout of Wall Street ’s high - flying bankers .

I believe in this great and beautiful country .
I have studied its roots .
I have gloried in the wisdom of its magnificent Constitution , and its inimitable history .
I have marveled at the wisdom of its founders and its framers .
Generation after generation of Americans has understood the lofty ideals that underlie our great Republic .
I have been inspired by the story of their sacrifice and their strength .
But today , I weep for my country .
I have watched the events of recent months with a heavy , heavy heart .
No more is the image of America one of strong , yet benevolent peacekeeper .
The image of America , Madam President , has changed .
Around the globe , our friends mistrust us ; our word is disputed ; our intentions are questioned .
Instead of reasoning with those with whom we disagree , we demand obedience , or threaten recrimination .
Instead of isolating Saddam Hussein , we seem to have succeeded in isolating ourselves .
We proclaim a new doctrine of preemption which is understood by few and feared by many .
We say that the United States has the right to turn its firepower on any corner of the globe which might be suspect in the war on terrorism .
We assert that right without the sanction of any international body .
As a result , the world has become a much more dangerous place .
We flaunt our superpower status with arrogance .
We treat UN Security Council members like ingrates who offend our princely dignity by lifting their heads from the carpet .
Valuable alliances are split .
After the war has ended , the United States will have to rebuild much more than the country of Iraq .
We will have to rebuild America 's image around the globe .
The case that this Administration tries to make to justify its fixation with war is tainted by charges of falsified documents and circumstantial evidence .
We cannot convince the world of the necessity of this war for one simple reason :
This is not a war of necessity , but a war of choice .
There is no credible information to connect Saddam Hussein to 9/11 , at least up to this point .
The twin towers fell because a world - wide terrorist group , Al Qaeda , with cells in more than 60 nations , struck at our wealth and our influence by turning our own planes into missiles , one of which would likely have slammed into the dome of this beautiful Capitol except for the brave sacrifice of some of the passengers who were on board that plane .
The brutality seen on September 11 , and in other terrorist attacks we have witnessed around the globe , are the violent and desperate efforts by extremists to stop the daily encroachment of western values upon their cultures .
That is what we fight .
It is a force not confined to territorial borders .
It is a shadowy entity with many faces , many names , and many addresses .
But this Administration has directed all of the anger , fear , and grief which emerged from the ashes of the twin towers and the twisted metal of the Pentagon towards a tangible villain , one we can see and hate and attack .
And villain he is .
But he is the wrong villain .
And this is the wrong war .
If we attack Saddam Hussein , we will probably drive him from power .
But the zeal of our friends to assist our global war on terrorism may have already taken flight .
The general unease surrounding this war is not just [ due ] to " orange alert . "
There is a pervasive sense of rush and risk and too many questions unanswered .
How long will we be in Iraq ?
What will be the cost ?
What is the ultimate mission ?
How great is the danger here at home ?
A pall has fallen over the Senate Chamber .
We avoid our solemn duty to debate the one topic on the minds of all Americans , even while scores of thousands of our sons and daughters faithfully do their duty in Iraq .
What is happening to this country ?! -- my country , your country , our country ?
When did we become a nation that ignores and berates our friends , and calls them irrelevant ?
When did we decide to risk undermining international order by adopting a radical and doctrinary 1 approach to using our awesome military might ?
How can we abandon diplomatic efforts when the turmoil in the world cries out for diplomacy ?
Why can this President not seem to see that America 's true power lies not in its will to intimidate , but in its ability to inspire ?
War appears inevitable .
But I continue to hope that the cloud will lift .
Perhaps Saddam will yet turn tail and run .
Perhaps reason will somehow still prevail .
I , along with millions -- scores of millions -- of Americans , will pray , pray , pray for the safety of our troops , for the innocent civilians -- women , children , babies , old and young , crippled , deformed , sick -- in Iraq , and for the security of our homeland .
May God continue to bless the United States of America in the troubled days ahead , and may we somehow recapture the vision which for the present eludes us .

The Turkish military today said that they had killed over 100 Kurdish rebels in the past month of attacks on northern Iraq ’s Kurdistan region , including 20 in the past week .
Most of the deaths came in air strikes against the region , but earlier this week hundreds of Turkish soldiers also briefly marched into Iraqi Kurdistan in “ hot pursuit ” of rebels , sparking a multi - hour gunbattle .
Turkey ’s military has been launching attacks off and on against northern Iraq for years , as has Iran .
Both have cited the mountainous border region as a popular hiding place for Kurdish rebels from their own nations , and Turkey says that the US has been providing “ intelligence ” for the attacks .
Turkey ’s clashes are with a group called the PKK , the “ Kurdistan Workers ’ Party , ” which has regularly been launching attacks inside Turkey for years , but is also seen as expanding attacks in recent months .
The group is officially listed as a terrorist organization by the US .
A teenage Jehovah 's Witness crushed by a car as it crashed into a West Midlands shop is thought to have died after refusing a blood transfusion .
Joshua McAuley , 15 , was airlifted to hospital from the incident in Smethwick on Saturday but died later that day .
Elder at Smethwick 's Kingdom Hall of Jehovah 's Witnesses Clive Parker said Joshua , who worshipped there , had " made a stand on the blood issue " .
A post -mortem examination is due to be carried out on Thursday .
Joshua is believed to have told doctors at Selly Oak Hospital not to give him a blood transfusion on religious grounds .
Jehovah 's Witnesses refuse transfusions because they believe the use of products derived from blood is forbidden by God .
It is a very complex area that has to be approached on a case - by - case basis
Selly Oak Hospital spokesman A spokesman for West Midlands Police said Joshua 's family , who live in Smethwick , did not wish to comment .
Mr Parker said Joshua was conscious after the accident in Cape Hill .
He added the family worshipped at Smethwick 's Kingdom Hall .
He said : " A mother has lost her son , and Joshua had a brother .
He has lost his brother , he was there in the morning and then gone by the afternoon .
They are terribly distressed . "
A spokesman for Selly Oak Hospital would not comment on the individual case but described the issue as an " extraordinarily complex area " with no set rules .
" There is no automatic right to override parental wishes or that of a minor .
It is a very complex area that has to be approached on a case - by - case basis , " he said .
Two other adults were injured in the crash , which happened in the Cape Hill area at 1114 BST .
Police said a 24 - year - old woman was in a serious but stable condition in hospital and a 32 - year - old man sustained a suspected broken arm and leg .
A 28 - year - old man from the Winson Green area of Birmingham was arrested after the crash and bailed pending further inquiries .

Is Wikileaks Secure ?
And beyond the law ?
BY Gabriel Schoenfeld
Is there nothing we can do about Wikileaks ?
Is it really a website where anyone can post any U.S. government secret no matter how injurious it is to American security ?
Wikileaks is much in the news because of the young Army intelligence officer accused of providing it with a massive trove of diplomatic cables and sensitive military videos .
The websites organizers boast that it combines the protection and anonymity of cutting - edge cryptographic technologies with the comfortable presentation style of Wikipedia . 
They convey an assumption that its servers are beyond the reach of law enforcement , and that those who post to it can not be tracked down .
But the history of warfare including information warfare teaches that every measure elicits a countermeasure .
An interesting and highly relevant detail emerges from the indictment of Thomas Drake , the senior National Security Agency employee recently charged under the Espionage Act for passing classified information to the Baltimore Sun .
To communicate covertly with the Sun reporter , Drake opened up a Hushmail account and she apparently did the same .
Hushmail is a web service that , as it advertises itself , looks and feels just like any other web - mail site , but adds strong encryption to your emails to protect your secrets from prying eyes . 
Yet when the prying eyes are federal investigators , it turns out that Hushmail is not quite so secure .
The indictment of Drake makes plain that the feds pierced Hushmails encryption either via technological or legal means , noting , among other things , that defendant DRAKE scanned and emailed Reporter A electronic copies of certain classified and unclassified documents .
Wikileaks makes claims about its inviolability that are strikingly like those made by Hushmail .
Whether it can be pierced by technological means is unknown .
But warfare is not a static thing .
Even cutting - edge cryptographic technologies  may not cut it when facing the huge decryption resources of powerful states .

Your Comment : Wikileaks communications security is well beyond that of Hushmail which is known to be weak by comsec followers .
This is not to suggest that national - grade countermeasures could not break Wikileaks protection .
More likely is that national - grade surveillance of Wikileaks and similar providers of hard to get governmental and banned information is a continuing covert operation .
Online surveillance by authorities is common , either by direct access to worldwide Internet infrastructure or by cooperation of Internet Service Providers and commercial firms which provide hardware and software for digital communications and are obliged by law to provide lawful access to user data .
There are a number of lawful spying guides available on the Internet , many hosted on Cryptome.org and elsewhere .
Wikileaks is assuredly aware of these invasive practices and its protection for communications is far superior to commercially - provided protection which is so weak that it verges on being criminally deceptive .
National authorities unfortunately are not accountable to the public for its surveillance of lawful activities , and Wikileaks is justified in helping increase accountability , including that related to national security which is excessively hidden from the public by secrecy amok .

The couple were married in 1996 and have a six - year - old daughter Actor Dennis Hopper is terminally ill and is unable to undergo chemotherapy to treat prostate cancer , his lawyer has said in court papers .
Joseph Mannis said his client was therefore unable to be questioned by lawyers of his wife of 14 years as part of divorce proceedings .
In previous court documents , Hopper had said he hoped chemotherapy would be successful and that he could recover .
The film star , 73 , filed for divorce from Victoria Hopper in January .
' Outrageous conduct '
In the papers , which state that Hopper weighs about 7st 2lb ( 45kg ) , he is described by his doctor , David Agus , as extremely weak and unable to have long conversations .
Being questioned by his wife 's lawyers " could actually threaten his ability to survive the current health crisis " , Dr Agus adds .
But he has approved an appearance by Hopper to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Friday because it would be good for his state of mind .
Last month , a judge ruled that Mrs Hopper must stay at least 10 ft ( 3 m ) away from her husband after the actor said he wanted to eliminate unnecessary stress .
In previous papers filed in Los Angeles Superior Court , Hopper - who has been married five times - claimed his wife had engaged in " outrageous conduct " over the past year .
He alleges she has been difficult over visitation rights for their six - year - old daughter Galen .
Mrs Hopper , 42 , meanwhile , said the actor threatened her , smoked marijuana around their daughter and that his illness had left him unable to make sound decisions .
She has also claimed that he filed for divorce so that he could cut her out of her inheritance .
The actor , best known for films including Easy Rider , Apocalypse Now and Blue Velvet , has denied all the claims .

On Wednesday , LOFT — a brand owned by Ann Taylor Inc. — posted pictures of a tall , blonde catalog model in the brand 's new silk cargo pants on its Facebook Page with a click - to - buy link in the captions .
Nothing about the post was uncommon — except , perhaps , Fans ' responses .
While many Fans acknowledged that the pants looked good on the model , they complained that the pants were " not universally flattering " and would " look great [ only ] if you 're 5 ' 10 " and a stick like the model in the photo . "
The post led several women to request — politely , of course — that LOFT show the pants on " real women . "
The next day , the fashion retailer posted pictures of its own staff posing in the cargo pants .
The women — drawn from different departments of LOFT 's design , styling and marketing staff — ranged from size 2 to 12 , and from 5 ' 3 " to 5 ' 10 " .
Each styled the pants for a specific occasion , and explained why they liked the pants or why the pants worked well on their individual bodies .
As you can imagine , Fans were very pleased .
" I sooooo appreciate you taking the time to ' listen ' to our comments and show these pants on ' real ' women , " one Fan wrote , while still acknowledging that the pants were ugly .
This is , in our opinion , a great example of a big company using social media to drive customer loyalty and satisfaction .
And while many other large companies — like Comcast , Ford , Virgin Airlines , Starbucks and Best Buy — have also used social media to connect with their fans in smart , personable ways , we 've rarely seen this level of engagement from a fashion company .
It 's certainly a step in the right direction after the brand 's run-in with the FTC , social media - wise .
What do you think of LOFT 's response ?
Have you ever had a positive interaction with a big brand using social media ?

A Pinal County Sheriff 's deputy was shot in the stomach Friday by an undocumented immigrant off Interstate 8 , according sheriff 's officials .
Lt. Tami Villar told 12
News that the search and rescue deputy was investigating a load of marijuana in the desert and was confronted by five suspects .
She also said the wounded deputy is expected to survive .
Deputies believe at least two people were armed with long guns and at least one handgun .
The deputy , whose name was not released , was patrolling alone in what is considered a high - traffic drug and human - smuggling corridor .
Villar said the deputy radioed dispatch about 4:30 p.m. to say he had been shot off Interstate 8 and Arizona 84 , but he could not be found when authorities arrived at the scene .
The deputy was located more than an hour later and taken to the Casa Grande Medical Center for treatment .
His condition was not available .
The Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office dispatched a helicopter and members of its SWAT team to Pinal County to assist in the case , said department spokesman Lt. Brian Lee .
Lee said at 5:45 p.m. there were reports over the police scanner that suspects were shooting at a police helicopter .
Lee did not know which agency was operating the helicopter .
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio was headed to Pinal County to assist in the investigation , Lee said .
The Border Patrol has sent agents to assist the Pinal County Sheriff 's Office with the investigation , said Mario Escalante , a Border Patrol spokesman assigned to the Tucson sector .
" We are headed out to assist , " he said .
Escalante said he had no further details about the shooting .
The nearest Border Patrol station in the area is located in Casa Grande .
Staff writers Craig Harris , Allison Hurtado and Daniel Gonzalez contributed to this report .
One year ago this Friday , United States chief information officer Vivek Kundra launched an ambitious website called Data.gov to make the government ’s vast stores of data available to the public .
The thinking behind the site then , as now , was to give app developers access to these rich , comprehensive datasets on all sorts of topics — health care , education , energy , the environment and so on — in the hope that they would create useful tools for analyzing a range of information , from air quality by county to crime statistics by neighborhood and foreign aid by nation .
“ Part of what we ’re trying to do [ with Data.gov ] is realize the president ’s vision when he set out , ” Kundra told Wired.com by phone .
“ He issued , on his first full day , a memorandum on transparency and open government . ”
To make good on that promise , Data.gov launched with 47 datasets on May 21 , 2009 .
On its first anniversary , Data.gov will have ballooned to more than 250,000 datasets and racked up 97.6 million hits — not bad for a website whose main attractions are massive databases and wonky graphs .
However , the sailing has not been entirely smooth for Kundra and company — mirroring , in a way , Obama ’s presidency .
Federal Computer
Week complained that Data.gov was a demonstration of “ how not to do open government ” because it did n’t pass “ the ‘ mom test . ' ”
By that , FCW meant it was too hard for the average person to figure out what to do on the site and where everything was .
Kundra ’s team redesigned the entire Data.gov with that sort of feedback in mind , and we ’re inclined to agree that the new homepage , currently password - protected but set to launch Friday , is markedly more intuitive and user - friendly , as you can see for yourself on the following pages .
Still , he concedes that plenty of work remains , particularly in the mobile app department , which Kundra described as “ the next frontier ” along with the semantic web ( more on that below ) .
On a deeper level , one big problem with wrangling government data is that some of its myriad systems run software that is decades past its expiration date .
“ Some of the challenges that remain are challenges around , frankly , systems — outdated technology within the federal government , ” said Kundra .
“ We ’ve noticed this huge gap in tech investment between the private sector and the public sector .
The Patent and Trademark office , for example , is using 30 - year - old systems built on Cobol .
Therefore , releasing a lot of the data that we want to , very fast , is difficult . ”
He added that the Veterans Administration is another department mired in ancient technology .
But perhaps the most damning criticism one could make about Data.gov is that people have n’t been using it enough .
In a country of 300 million or so people , many of the datasets have only been voted on a handful of times , and only 250 or so apps are listed on the site ( granted , Kundra said “ countless ” others may have been developed without being listed on the site ) .
To encourage more widespread use of the government ’s data , the Obama administration recently brought on an evangelist for the program : Jeanne Holm , formerly chief knowledge architect for NASA ’s jet - propulsion laboratory , whose new title is communications and collaborations lead for Data.gov .
In her new role , modeled somewhat on Kundra ’s own outreach to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ( which resulted in some of the most powerful uses of the government ’s data to date , as you ’ll see below ) , Holm will travel to grade schools , high schools and universities over the coming year to explain to students and teachers how they can make use of these datasets through basic science projects , in the case of younger students , and more advanced data analysis at higher educational levels .
Hopefully , this will increase the nation ’s awareness of these now - public resources , and by doing so , the number of web and mobile apps they build on them over the coming years .
“ [ Holm ] is going to help us evangelize , and create an army of developers who are going to create applications that we can’t even imagine , as we think through innovation in the coming century , ” said Kundra .
In addition , the government plans to make tools available that enable non-programmers to mash its data into public - facing apps , “ making it as easy as writing an article on Wikipedia is today — that ’s the vision , that ’s what we ’re focused on in the coming year . ”
Kundra walked us through the redesigned Data.gov , set to launch Friday .
Come along on a little tour through the site , which you wo n’t find anywhere else , because Wired.com is the only publication with the password .
Note :
The design of the following webpages is subject to change before the site goes live on Friday , and some of these examples are visible on the current , pre-redesign version of Data.gov .
Let ’s take a look :
Slicker , simpler , more intuitive
Kundra and his team redesigned Data.gov from the ground up , altering everything from fonts and page layout to the site ’s organizational and search features , in an effort to make it simpler and more powerful .
The homepage is less crowded and surfaces the most popular data sets , while a prominent search function now appears at the top of every page on the site .
Basically , the site looks more professionally done , approaching a commercial level of slickness , whereas the old design looked more like , well , the work of a government agency .
“ We ’ve designed it to make it as simple as possible , if you compare this [ redesigned version ] to the current website , ” said Kundra .
“ We ’ve used consumer search tools to make it really easy for people who are just looking for a dataset or if they ’re interested in a policy area to quickly search , and people who are interested in apps can quickly find them , rather than organizing it by catalogs and so forth at the top level . ”
Other countries adopting the Data.gov model
The next stop on our tour : A graph showing how the Data.gov idea itself has started to spread around the world over the past year .
“ Other countries are following the lead of the Obama administration . ” said Kundra .
So far , Australia , Canada , Estonia , New Zealand , Norway and the United Kingdom have set up similar sites and released datasets to the public , as the graph shows .
It ’s unlikely that countries such as North Korea would post such information , but as more countries come on board with the concept , programmers will be able to mash data not only in those countries but across their borders — an especially powerful tool for tracking worldwide phenomena such as global warming and air or water pollution .
Tracking obesity and health trends geographically
One of the most effective uses of the government ’s health data developed as part of the Data.gov initiative is the National Obesity Comparison Tool , powered by Tableau Software ’s visualization software .
Tableau ’s charts represent about as much fun as you can have analyzing obesity data by state and county .
Mouse over any of the counties to see detailed information , or click one to see where it stands relative to the rest of the state , as well as the national average on the graphs below , which track low consumption of fruits and vegetables , lack of exercise and tobacco smoking in addition to obesity .
It ’s a quick and fascinating way to browse the health habits of your fellow citizens .
“ The vision that I want to realize is a YouTube for data , ” said Kundra .
“ You can embed your analysis on a website , and the content and presentation layer will stay alive as the data gets updated over time .
Imagine a world where people can literally share data and analysis in the same way today we share YouTube videos across the world . ”
On - time flights
The FlyOnTime.us web app “ allows the American people to make intelligent decisions around which flight to pick .
The only reason this app can exist is that we release data from the FAA . ”
As part of the app , citizens report how long it takes to get through the security line at various airports via Twitter , so you can schedule your trip accordingly ( another tip : we hear you can get an iPad through security without taking it out of your bag , when laptops must be removed and scanned individually ) .
To report security wait times using your cellphone , bookmark flyontime .us / m/ lines /security or tweet “ # airportsecurity [ three - letter airport code ] in ” when you enter the security line , and “ # airportsecurity [ airport code ] out ” once you ’ve gotten through .
So far , however , Data.gov has n’t received many of these submissions .
Come on , America ; Uncle Sam wants you to tweet these times .
Web 3.0 : Making Data Talk to Data
Kundra visited Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ( RPI ) to encourage students there to apply “ new international standards for persistent government data ( and metadata ) , ” otherwise known as the semantic web or Web 3.0 , to Data. gov ’s datasets .
These standards will make it easier for governmental data to power deep - linked data mash - ups combining various data sources in a consistent way .
“ In the same way that the ability to link documents across the world essentially gave birth to the world wide web , where you could literally create HTML pages on the fly , our vision is to create an open data - linked web , ” explained Kundra .
“ There are hundreds of applications that RPI has created that have brought in datasets from all over the world that [ for instance ] compare crime in the U.K. versus crime in the United States .
“ Imagine these living , breathing sites that are constantly updating data from databases and linking them in an open format .
That ’s one of the big shifts that we have moving forward as we create this community of developers . ”
To demonstrate how this works , he showed a map of U.S. foreign aid that quickly surfaces how much aid , and what kind of aid — be it security , development , child survival , agriculture , narcotics control and so on — our country sent to others around the world in 2008 ( subsequent years to come ) , mashed together with news from The New York Times and facts from the CIA World Fact Handbook .
Extensive graphs can be generated to reflect historical trends in a number of aid categories .
Other successful semantic web - style mash - ups created by RPI and served via W3C - approved RDF SPARQL queries include a graphical representation of the top 100 visitors to the White House and who they met with , nationwide maps depicting the presence of pollution , the bankruptcies of public companies and the ratio of library books to population .
In addition to RPI ’s participation , Kundra said he has been particularly impressed by the Sunlight Foundation ’s $ 25,000 contest to make the best use of Data.gov datasets and by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs creating profitable businesses on the back of this data .
Worldwide earthquake tracking
Anyone can request that the government make a dataset available in the Dialogue section of the site , and users can also vote on which of those suggestions they would most like to see .
So long as the release of the data does n’t compromise citizens ’ privacy or national security , the Data.gov team honors those requests in the order of popularity .
“ Right after [ the ] Haiti [ earthquake ] , we got feedback from the public that they wanted to see datasets around earthquakes all over the world , ” said Kundra .
“ Part of what we ’ve incorporated over the past one year is the ability to get public feedback and act on it .
You can also see ratings of these datasets — overall , utility , ease of access — we ’re crowdsourcing which datasets we want to democratize and the order of operation . ”
We told Kundra one dataset we would like to see would expose the environmental impact of the ongoing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , which some experts expect to spread to east cost beaches over the summer .
“ We ’ve got a lot of datasets from NORAD and the EPA that speak to that issue , and as more is generated , we will make that available on Data.gov . ”
Making Data.gov itself more transparent
If Data.gov is about making the government ’s data more transparent , and the site itself can be considered a form of data , then why not surface data about how people are using the site ?
Over the past year , Kundra and his team have added all sorts of data to that effect , all of which can be downloaded and sliced in various ways .
“ We ’ve driven transparency at the data element level , ” said Kundra .
“ You can see the number of downloads per dataset … the Top 10 [ non - U.S. ] countries that are visiting Data.gov [ Canada , the U.K. and Germany are the top three ] , the states that are visiting datasets [ California , Georgia , the District of Columbia ] , ” how the traffic to the site dips on the weekends , the number of datasets published by each governmental department each month , and more .

SAN ANTONIO – Texas is only one of 11 states that has an elected state board of education .
The 15 members are 10 Republicans , all white , and five Democrats .
It meets every two years .
In its meetings in January and May this year , it has shredded a year of work by teachers and scholars to write a social studies curriculum upon which 4 million textbooks will be produced for Texas schools .
In January , after refusing the suggestion that scholars or teachers be present at the board meetings , the board ’s Republican majority , largely social conservatives , began to make drastic changes to the curriculum .
A huge battle ensued , led by the Texas Freedom Network ( TFN ) , against the literal takeover of the curriculum by political ideas of the right wing and religious conservatives , often showing lack of knowledge and creating an embarrassment to the state .
Some 40,000 letters and phone calls came into the board from the public and from scholars within and outside Texas .
Some of the worst examples of the changes became known as the “ list of shame ” :
* Rejecting the word “ capitalism ” and substituting “ free enterprise , ” since “ capitalism ” is only used by “ liberal ” professors in academia .
* Rejecting teaching students about constitutional protection of religious beliefs and the separation of church and state .
* Downplaying President Thomas Jefferson , author of the Declaration of Independence , and references to enlightenment ideas .
* Removing concepts of “ justice and responsibility for the common good ” from the list of characteristics of good citizenship .
* Stripping out Delores Huerta , cofounder of the United Farm Workers of America , as not a model of good citizenship because she is a “ socialist . ”
* Rehabilitating the smarmy image of the infamous Sen. Joe McCarthy and teaching students about “ communist infiltration ” in the Cold War .
* Removing the book “ Brown Bear , Brown Bear , What Do You See ? ” from grade 3 because the board confused its writer Bill Martin with another author Bill Martin who wrote a book on Marxism !
* Adding in right - wingers such as Phyliss Schlafly of the Heritage Foundation with no similar standard for liberal individuals or organizations .
* Minimizing the history of the Civil War and adding a comparison of Jefferson Davis ’ inaugural address as president of the Confederacy , which says nothing of slavery , to President Abraham Lincoln’s .
* Watering down the history of the civil rights movement and decades of struggle of minorities and women , claiming that they owed thanks to men and the majority for their rights !
* Downgrading the words “ democracy ” and “ democratic government ” to “ constitutional republic . ”
* Removing a high school standard on sex and gender as social constructs and how they interact , for fear students would learn about homosexuals , transvestites , etc .
* Requiring students to learn the “ unintended bad consequences ” of President Lyndon Johnson ’s “ Great Society ” social programs , affirmative action , and Title lX .
* Downgrading “ imperialism ” to the word “ expansionism . ”
The San Antonio Express News has criticized this effort to politicize the curriculum and make changes that are simply ignorant .
These changes were made as some of the board members sat with their laptops and with little knowledge played with the education our children will receive over the next 10 years ( standards are changed every 10 years ) .
An Express News editorial called the new standards “ terribly flawed and politically inspired . ”
Columnist Cary Clack said the board “ would rather deny history than learn from it , forgetting that we are made better each time we correct a wrong or give attention to people and problems we have neglected . ”
Other critics say that minorities have been neglected and “ whited ” out of the textbooks !
Since Texas is the largest purchaser of textbooks in the country , it is probable that not only Texas but also other states will be purchasing books written with these new guidelines .
Although not all the Republican members of the board vote as a block with the most conservative , the final vote on May 21 was split 9 - 5 ( one not present ) in favor of the new guidelines that include the changes mentioned above .
On May 19 , hundreds of teachers , scholars and interfaith clergy as well as members of the NAACP , lawmakers including state Rep. Sylvester Turner of Houston from the Texas Legislative Black Caucus , and former U.S. Education Secretary Rod Paige had 2 minutes each to speak .
They were the last opposition available to the public before the final vote was taken .
Mary Berlanga , a Democratic school board member from Corpus Christi , speaking against the new guidelines , said they will mean that “ Hispanics will have to wait until they reach college before learning the real truth . ”
TFN Communications Director Dan Quinn made it clear that the fight is not over .
Efforts in the Legislature to rein in the power of the Texas State School Board of Education have been tried and failed in the past .
But after this internationally publicized fight and some new electees waiting to take seats on the board , many Texans hope to get a much - needed change .
Another solution proposed , abolishing the State Board of Education , would mean a very difficult change in the Texas Constitution .

Information about a keyboard being included in the Rock Band 3 package was teased in the Green Day : Rock Band demo , and we have now been given some exclusive information by our now - famous Mole about what we can expect from Rock Band 3 .
Read on to find out what to expect from the instruments in the latest version of the game .
It 's the ' 80s !
There wo n't actually be a keyboard peripheral sold with the game ; instead there will be a keytar - like instrument supported .
For those who did n't listen to much ' 80s music , a keytar is a sort of keyboard with a strap , held like a guitar .
The keytar will be the only new instrument for the game .
We were surprised that new instruments were being released at all , since Activision had noted that they were focusing on software and not hardware in order to cut costs .
We figured Harmonix would follow what seemed to be a savvy strategy in a world already choked with peripherals .
Harmonix will actually be doing something similar , and the peripherals will be created by an outside company .
Mad Catz is bringing the instruments
Mad Catz will be creating all the Rock Band 3 instruments and bundles ; EA will only be distributing the software .
Mad Catz will be offering many different bundles with different combinations of instruments available , and there will be bundles that are exclusive to certain retailers .
If you have guitars , you 'll be able to find a bundle for drums .
If you need everything , that will be available as well .
If a store does n't want to be saddled with huge boxes , they can simply stock the game .
This will allow the focus of the launch to be kept on the software , and we 're told that there will be a " pro " mode included in the game that will require proper technique , and may lead to actual skills on guitars and bass .
How this will work is n't known , but it 's possible Mad Catz may create a product that more closely mimics an actual guitar .
All this information is firmly in the rumor pile , excluding the Mad Catz connection , but our Mole has successfully broken more stories in gaming news and peripherals than anyone else in this business , so we 're confident in this data .
It also makes sense : Mad Catz has long had the license to release Rock Band peripherals , and large bundles suffer from thin margins and can be expensive to stock .
Giving control of the hardware to a company who knows how to release and ship peripherals makes sense for everyone , and more bundles give retailers a new layer of granularity to stock items based on their needs .
As for the keytar ?
We have no clue .
Expect this information to be confirmed at E3 .

Permanent Impermanence
I was standing on the helipad of a new , swanky highrise apartment building in the Dubai Marina with my friend Vishul in the summer of 2006 .
We took in the panoramic , nighttime view of skyscrapers in the making , each capped with cranes lit red and white like so many giant Transformer action figures .
Vishul , who ’d grown up in Dubai , turned three hundred and sixty degrees and jokingly exclaimed , “ This is the future ! ”
And , until the global economic meltdown hit in late 2008 , it probably was .
Listen to Syed Ali on the Contexts Podcast
Dubai has been lauded by Western statesmen and the media as a model for the rest of the Muslim world to follow — a capitalist , consumerist paradise tolerant of alternative ( read : Western ) lifestyles and undisturbed by terrorism .
This city of the future is ruled over by a benign autocrat , Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum , and is populated mainly by foreigners .
In fact , even before the United Arab Emirates ( of which Dubai is a semi-autonomous member ) received independence in 1971 , Dubai ’s migrant population exceeded its native citizen population .
These expatriates , who comprise over ninety percent of the population , account for ninety - nine percent of the private sector workforce and ninety percent of the public sector workforce in jobs ranging from construction workers and maids to engineers , architects , and bankers .
Because Dubai has been a migrant - receiving city since the early 1900s , its massive foreign population is nothing new .
What ’s astounding , though , is that all expatriates are in Dubai on short - term visas .
Unlike immigrant - receiving countries such as the U.S. , U.K. , France , and Germany , Dubai has no form of permanent immigrant incorporation .
Even in countries as strict as Switzerland , migrants , including lower - skilled “ guest workers , ” can find roads to permanent settlement and family reunification .
So while guest workers and their children throughout Europe may find it varyingly difficult to acquire citizenship , they often have the legal right to stay permanently .
In Dubai , expatriates willingly give up political rights such as free speech and due process , and they live precariously on short - term visas that can be revoked at any time for any reason .
In exchange , they earn tax - free wages as “ economic mercenaries , ” fully aware that they are there solely to work .
For lower - level workers from developing countries , the trade - off includes the unstated promise that they will live and toil in harsh conditions in Dubai so they can send remittances and make a better life for themselves back home .
The middle class , mainly South Asians and Arabs from outside the Arabian Gulf who fill the bulk of lower and middle white - collar positions , find better occupational possibilities , better schools , more comfortable family living , and a largely crime - free environment enticing .
And for upper - class professionals ( Westerners , but also South Asians , Arabs , and others ) there is the lure of the “ good life ” — comprised of cheap household help ( maids alone form ten percent of the population ) , luxury accommodations , spas , clubs , bars , restaurants , outdoor sports , and prostitution — that has made Dubai so famous in the West .
On its surface , the case of Dubai and its permanently impermanent workforce seems singular .
But , as many Western countries implement restrictive guest worker programs that limit immigrants ’ ability to stay and circumscribe many of their rights , the case of Dubai ’s expatriates may actually be a harbinger of the future of global migration .
A Mercenary Life
All expatriates in Dubai , even those born in Dubai , are on short - term , renewable visas , regulated through the kafala , or sponsorship , system .
Expatriates ’ residence visas are , as in the rest of the Arabian Gulf countries , tied to their sponsors , usually their employers .
Changing jobs is virtually out of the question , and any expatriates who quit or are fired , with some exceptions for professionals , have to leave the country for a six - month period before they can return to take another job .
So long as expatriates in Dubai hold on to their jobs and do n’t bring negative attention to themselves , though , they can stay until the retirement age of 60 , at which point , unless they own a business or receive permission on a case - by - case basis , they must leave .
Not unexpectedly , laborers , the middle class , and professionals experience their temporariness differently .
Laborers including construction workers , maids , cab drivers , and lower - level service workers ( who generally earn slightly better than third - world level wages ) constitute the vast majority of Dubai ’s population and are highly regulated in their working and social lives .
Their passports are confiscated upon arrival ( an illegal practice that even government ministries engage in ) , their wages are often withheld for months at a time to prevent them from quitting ( a practice the government tolerates ) , and unions and strikes are illegal .
Workers who have participated in strikes or protests have been immediately deported without a trial or due process of any kind .
Many men ( especially construction workers ) are housed in remote , overcrowded , filthy labor camps , and most of the rest of the working class shares rooms in overcrowded , filthy , and dilapidated villas or apartment buildings .
Socially , they fare no better : construction workers , for example , are often denied entry to the shopping malls they build .
Where laborers ’ lives are largely regulated by this series of “ sticks , ” the middle class and professionals ’ lives are regulated mostly with “ carrots ” like high salaries , fast professional advancement , and luxury living .
The government does n’t need to enforce discipline , as these expatriates essentially live in a “ gilded cage , ” willingly trading political rights for economic possibilities .
And the government is more than happy to allow these expatriates wide latitude in their social behaviors ( they ’re free to worship as they like , drink , and openly visit prostitutes , for instance ) so long as none of those behaviors looks remotely political .
While professionals , and to a lesser extent the middle class , find a great degree of social freedom , in the end they too , like laborers , are simply factors of production , there to create wealth for the ruler , the government , and the national citizen population .
The kafala system essentially defines the bulk of the population as disposable and temporary .
It is not incidental that the government insists expatriates are “ guest workers . ”
The transience of expatriates is underscored by the fact that citizenship is basically unattainable and there is no such category as permanent residence .
The most commonly stated reasons given by government officials for denying citizenship or permanent residence are the threats of cultural extinction and demographic imbalance posed by the possibility of absorbing so many expatriates into the pool of citizens .
These twin arguments are repeated time and time again .
However , there are two critical but unstated factors that are central to the management of expatriates in Dubai and the government ’s stance on naturalization .
First , the government ’s legitimacy depends to a great degree on its ability to guarantee a high standard of living to national citizens .
Allowing expatriates to naturalize might lead to the state having to spread its welfare largesse among a much larger pool of recipients .
Second , the kafala system provides a simple and effective mechanism of social control .
As expatriates are in Dubai primarily to work , the mere possibility of deportation is enough to stifle any kind of threat they may pose to the political - economic order .
Many scholars argue that formal , legal citizenship is becoming less important in an increasingly globalized world .
As money , goods , ideas , and people move further and faster than ever before , legal and social barriers to movement have weakened .
The idea of dual citizenship is more widely accepted than it ever has been , further eroding the historical notion that citizens should have loyalty to only one place .
Even illegal migrants can often become legal by proving that they have conducted themselves like “ good citizens ” in their new land .
The literature on citizenship has expanded the concept to take into consideration how the boundaries of the nation - state have become , literally and figuratively , more permeable and , in some ways , less relevant over time .
International treaties and institutions ( especially those making human rights universal ) and the free movement of people and capital greatly affect the sovereignty of states and how they relate to both citizens and noncitizens living within their borders .
In the past 20 years , terms such as “ flexible citizenship , ” “ post- national citizenship ” and “ denationalized citizenship ” have gained currency .
And while there are major differences between these influential concepts and other ideas that expand upon the notion of what is and who is a citizen , taken together they announce that “ citizen ” is more than simply a legal category and that people can claim to “ belong ” to a place without legally belonging to that place .
But legal citizenship and the realistic possibility of obtaining it remains important — you simply cannot legally and securely live somewhere without a proper visa or citizenship .
The non-legal dimensions of citizenship , including the cultural , economic , consumer , and psychological angles , are largely meaningless without formal legal standing .
Consider one of the most basic factors of citizenship : generally , you can not be deported — and if you are deported , the other forms of citizenship become moot .
For noncitizens , these other forms of citizenship can only be meaningful if the threat of deportation is minimal .
These are things that expatriates in Dubai , most of whom are from the developing world , understand all too well .
While there are no publicly available data on the numbers of deportations , they occur frequently enough that stories of deportees serve as widely - known cautionary tales that help keep laborers , the middle class , and professional expatriates in line .
These nonnatives are careful to stay out of trouble with the police , they make certain not to engage in behavior that might look political , and they avoid criticizing the ruling family or national citizens in general .
At any point and for practically any reason , the government or an employer may arbitrarily cancel a worker ’s visa and trigger immediate deportation .
The threat of deportation and the lack of any legal recourse is one reason why so many expatriates would welcome the possibility of naturalization or , at least , permanent residence .
Without these possibilities , expatriates understand that their stay in Dubai , no matter how long - term , is by definition temporary .
They plan accordingly : Westerners know they will return to the West .
Laborers know they will also go back home .
South Asian and Arab middle class and professional expatriates must either go home ( an undesirable outcome for many ) or attempt to go to the West seeking new professional opportunities for themselves or education for their children .
Expatriates born in Dubai also understand that they are temporary residents .
Of the forty - five South Asian and Arab second - generation expatriates I interviewed , more than half had acquired permanent residence or citizenship in Western countries , and most of the rest were trying to do the same .
Hardly anyone I interviewed intended to return to their legal home in their parents ’ third - world country of origin , but few had any illusions of calling Dubai home .
I was stunned to hear one young , Indian corporate headhunter say bluntly , “ Dubai is a pitstop , a place where you come , make a good amount of money and you get out . ”
Why was this so shocking ?
The young man in question had been born and raised in this “ pitstop . ”
Until just before we met , he ’d never even been outside the U.A.E .
In response to recent international pressure and spiraling unemployment among national citizens , some Arabian Gulf states have begun to rethink the kafala system .
Bahrain was the first to initiate radical change , discarding the sponsorship system altogether in August 2009 .
Its expatriates will now be “ sponsored ” directly by the government , and their visas will no longer be tied to a particular job .
Following Bahrain , Kuwait took a first step toward abolishing the kafala system when it announced that its expatriates would be able to change jobs after three years without sponsor approval or after one year if the sponsor does n’t object .
Using language that Human Rights Watch would approve of , a Kuwaiti minister lauded the change and called the kafala system “ modern - day slavery . ”
The abolition of the kafala system could lead to higher wages , especially at the middle and lower ends of the job market , where most workers are from the developing world and paid accordingly .
Bahrain and Kuwait also hope that the current high unemployment rates among national citizens will be reduced , as the financial costs of hiring and training nationals become more attractive to private - sector firms .
Conspicuously though , officials in Dubai have remained mum on any similar changes .
Their silence is deafening — and unsurprising , given that Dubai ’s government - owned companies in construction , hospitality , and other sectors employ tens of thousands of workers at all levels , and government coffers are enriched through those depressed wages .
These policy changes represent a monumental shift for the region .
The basic premise of my research has been that the kafala system colors every aspect of life in Dubai .
If similar , radical changes were undertaken in Dubai , the way of life for expatriates and national citizens alike would be drastically altered .
Expatriates would have freedom of mobility in the labor market and would no longer have to fear deportation should they lose or quit their jobs .
This is a particularly important issue today , as Dubai is in the middle of a recession , with megaprojects at a standstill and many completed highrises standing empty .
Workers are being laid off in such large numbers that some estimate Dubai ’s population may have shrunk by an incredible seventeen percent in 2009 .
The “ Dubai Effect ”
The story of Dubai ’s expatriate population feels , at first , like an outlier .
But it may end up being replicated beyond Dubai and the Arabian Gulf countries .
While Bahrain and Kuwait are in the process of abandoning the kafala system , Western countries are increasingly adopting labor policies similar to those of Dubai and the other Gulf countries .
These policies mainly concern working - class laborers , but as in the Gulf , professionals may find themselves living under similar visa regimes .
For example , more than half of skilled workers from non-European Union countries arrive in the U.K. on “ intra - company ” transfers .
As of a 2008 overhaul , the U.K. ’s visa system is largely grounded through employers .
While Tier 1 visas , issued for highly skilled professional migrants , do not require a sponsor , Tier 2 employees applying for permanent status must be sponsored or they ’ll be forced to leave .
Further , in 2009 , the government was considering banning transferred , “ intra - company ” workers from citizenship altogether , a move that could conceivably turn them into Dubai - like expatriates : legal , but impermanent .
Similarly , the U.S. has programs limiting the ability of professionals from overseas to stay , most notably the H1B visa ­program .
The H - 1B program is mostly for IT professionals , whose visas are tied to their employers .
They can stay up to six years , so long as they are employed , and they are allowed to apply for permanent residency .
There is , however , no guarantee that it will be granted ; my friend Vishul tried , but failed , to adjust his own H - 1B status and had to leave the country .
At its peak , the H - 1B program covered roughly 200,000 people a year , but the number of these visas being issued yearly has since dropped to its original 1999 level of 65,000 .
The U.S. has also toyed with the idea of a wide - ranging guest worker program for lower - skilled workers .
This would echo the Bracero Program , which brought temporary Mexican agricultural laborers to the U.S. from 1942 - 1964 , but ended in part because of widespread abuse of workers .
In 2006 , Congress proposed a plan to create a permanent guest worker program that would admit 400,000 more workers a year .
While it was not enacted , many in Congress made it clear that when immigration reform is eventually addressed it must include some kind of temporary guest worker program .
Recognizing aspects of the kafala system creeping into national policy debates , the Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman mused on what he called “ the Dubai Effect ” in The New York Times .
Writing in 2006 , Krugman said that a guest worker program could amount to a dangerous betrayal of the United States ’ democratic ideals .
It would , he wrote , basically form an entrenched caste system of temporary workers whose interests would largely be ignored and whose rights would be circumscribed .
Further , their wages would undoubtedly be less than those of people with greater labor market mobility , though the ripple effects of a glut of guest workers would be expected to lower wages for all workers in sectors where guest workers are “ bonded ” to their employers , Dubai - style .
Following Krugman , I wonder if Western states increasingly adopt policies like those in the Arabian Gulf countries , they will see situations of non-assimilation similar to those played out among expatriates in Dubai .
Of course , unlike in Dubai , any children born in the U.S. acquire citizenship by birth , but there would still be a sizeable community of adults who were essentially in the country , but not of it .
If that ’s the case , Dubai and its permanently impermanent population would look less like a unique example and more like a prescient harbinger of the future experience of incorporation — or lack thereof .

Honeybee remains found in a 3,000 - year - old apiary have given archaeologists a one - of - a- kind window into the beekeeping practices of the ancient world .
" Beekeeping is known only from a few Egyptian sources , from a few tombs and paintings .
No actual hives have been found , " said Hebrew University of Jerusalem archaeologist Amihai Mazar .
The hives were uncovered in 2007 at an excavation in Tel Rehov , Israel , home to the flourishing Bronze and Iron Age city of Rehov .
Mazar and his team found more than 100 hives , capable of housing an 1.5 million bees and producing half a ton of honey .
In a paper published June 8 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the researchers analyzed bees preserved in honeycomb that was charred , but not completely burnt by fire that likely destroyed the rest of the apiary .
Unfortunately for would - be makers of ancient honey , heat damaged the bees ' DNA , making it impossible to revive their genes in modern bees .
But the researchers were at least able to identify them as Apis mellifera anatoliaca , a subspecies found only in what is now Turkey .
It 's possible that A. m. anatoliaca 's range has changed , but more likely that Rehov 's beekeepers traded for them .
Local bees are notoriously difficult to handle .
During the 20th century , when beekeepers tried to establish a modern industry in Tel Rehov , they ended up importing A. m. anatoliaca — a literally sweet example of history repeating itself .

Commuters travel to work on the Tube NAKED to help boost company 's bottom line
It was a cheeky and unexpected sight that greeted commuters as they boarded a Tube into work .
But the four naked men and women certainly livened up the usually dull journey for many people – attracting gasps from stunned workers .
Carrying handbags or briefcases to cover their modesty – and wearing shoes – the nudes travelled on escalators and rode in the carriages as though their lack of suitable attire was completely normal .
Baring all : Naked workers attract stares from other commuters as they travel on the London Underground
But , rather than trying to start a new trend on the London Underground , the group were promoting a TV series which sees staff at struggling businesses helping to turn their company around .
Steven Suphi , behaviour change specialist and leadership guru , believes stripping off in the office will help boost employees ' confidence and develop trust .
She said : ‘ For most people in the UK going to work in the nude is a very daunting prospect .
High heels , handbags .. and very little else confront some stunned fellow commuters on the Tube
With just bags protecting their modesty the two naked commuters cause a stir on the platform
Cheeky :
Two workers stroll hand - in - hand as a fully - clothed couple look on in amusement
‘ I believe this extreme process will help them push their boundaries and become a close team that trust each other enough to get naked together . ’
The nudes were publicising tomorrow ’s episode of the new six - part series The Naked Office being screened on Virgin 1 at 9 pm .

Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers Easter Egg - The Two Towers " Wilhelm "
In the movie go to the Helm 's Deep section .
I do not know the specific time or chapter for VHS or DVD but it occurs right around the part where the Orcs begin to scale the walls of the fortress .
When the Orcs get to the top watch for the first person to be flung over the wall ( I believe it is one of the Elf archers ) .
An Orc picks him , and throws him over the front wall .
There is a clear shot of this happening , and as he is thrown , you should hear a sort - of high - pitched scream coming from him .
The sound that you hear is referred to by sound editors as the " Wilhelm " .
I listened to a radio show that talked about this sound file .
The origin of the sound itself is somewhat unknown , though it is done by a male ( the person 's name is unknown ) and may have been recorded in a movie all the way back in the 30's or 40's .
The amazing part about this sound file is that it seems many sound editors for movies try to sneak this sound into films .
The Two Towers is not the only film has that has used this sound .
It is also used in Star Wars : Episode IV ( there is already an egg listed for that ) .
The radio show also said it was in Raiders of the Lost Ark but I can't remember where they said it was ( you 're welcome to find that one on your own ) .
The fun part about this is that there are many films out there that probably have this sound file hidden in there somewhere .
And if it was used in The Two Towers , then it was also probably used in The Fellowship of the Ring .
Happy hunting on that .

Game Spotlight : killer7
E3 2010 is on the way and we ’ll be seeing lots of media regarding many new games on the way … which means it ’s a good time to take a little look into the past at a game that very few people played but is very much appreciated by most of those who did .
“ Look .
I ’m a cleaner .
I can feel no remorse from seeing a dead body .
To me , it ’s merely cold , rotting flesh . ”
— Garcian Smith
I have previously mentioned killer7 in my entry for No More Heroes so it seemed only natural to talk more about the game since NMH has gained Suda51 a lot more fans than he used to have .
Of course , as I said in that previous entry , killer7 is a different kind of game than killer7 and although it contains Suda51 ’s unique styles , it is in many ways alien to No More Heroes …
“ Shit !
There ’s more than 14 .
Those bastards are breeding … ”
— Dan Smith
killer7 was developed by Grasshopper Manufacture and is one of Suda51 ’s most complex works , however to ensure that this game was even made required the backing of Shinji Mikami and Capcom .
The game itself takes some getting used to as you enter it not knowing exactly what to expect … at least that ’s the way I felt when I first played the game .
I did n’t know who Suda51 was at the time and I can’t remember exactly what persuaded me to buy the game , but whatever it was , I ’m glad I did .
“ I ’m not a monster , it ’s only a mask . ”

Cel - shading seems to have been all the rage with the sixth - generation of home consoles .
Jet Set Radio , The Legend of Zelda : The Wind Waker , Viewtiful Joe , XIII and killer7 are only a handful of games that bear their own forms of cel - shaded visuals from that generation .
Developers quickly realised the potential for the style and we ’ve enjoyed the benefits of it over the years .
Of course , the cel - shading is only one of the elements that make up what is a very strange game .
Let me explain just how strange it is …
The controls of killer7 will seem strange to most , going by the GameCube version , you press A to go forward , B to turn around and R to go into first person view so you can shoot .
The whole game is set on rails , however you have the ability of reaching junctions where you use the control stick to determine which path you want to follow .
However , despite the inclusion of these intersections , the game is strictly linear with the only true decision left up to the player at the end of the game .
“ I ’ve changed my makeup , did you notice ?
Ah , men .
They never notice , these kinda things . ”
— Kaede Smith
While there is a PlayStation 2 version of the game , it had many limitations compared to its GameCube counterpart including slower load times , lower frame - rates and the lack of a big A button …
I know , it seems like a trivial thing to not have a big A button , but if and when you play killer7 , you ’ll understand exactly why it ’s so important .
The game was made specifically with the GameCube controller in mind with the PlayStation 2 version being a port .
“ Wow , it ’s the handsome men ! Awesome ! ”
— Con Smith
Without going into spoilers , the group known as “ killer7 ” is made up of seven of the worlds most powerful professional assassin ’s under the command of a mysterious man named Harman Smith .
Garcian Smith leads the group in the field and has the ability to revive his fallen comrades ; Dan Smith is the resident badass of the group and an instant favourite of many ; Mask de Smith is a former wrestler of the Lucha libre who still uses his powerful wrestling moves to great effect ; Kaede Smith is the only female of the group and has the ability to defeat barriers by slitting her wrist and spraying her blood everywhere ; Coyote Smith is the South American thief that can get his way past any padlock ; Con Smith is the youngest of the group and also happens to be blind ; finally , Kevin Smith is an albino who does n’t speak , uses throwing knives and is able to turn invisible …
All of what I have told you so far is only what the game wants you to know at the beginning .
Just as every other game created by Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture , there ’s a lot more to it … and most of it will just weird you out in different ways .
“ Pfff … You ’re fucked . ”

The story takes place in “ the future ” in an era where world peace has been declared and there are no nuclear weapons .
Despite this era of supposed peace , a terrorist organisation known as the Heaven Smiles wreaks havoc on the world and threatens to destroy this peace .
The group known as killer7 are the only ones who have the ability to oppose the Heaven Smiles and their leader Kun Lan .
As you discover early on in the game , there is a mysterious connection between Harman Smith and Kun Lan that spans beyond any human concepts … trying to explain any more than that will be pointless since most of it will just fuck your mind up anyway .
“ … ”
— Kevin Smith
There are a lot of people who passed up the chance to play killer7 , but I feel that if it were n’t for the small measure of success that this game had achieved then I do n’t think that No More Heroes would have been made such as it is .
Also , Suda51 has expressed some interest in returning in some way to killer7 … whether it will be a port of the game for Wii or a kind of sequel , who knows … the possibility is unfortunately very slim , but I ’d like to see it happen so that more people can experience just what a fuck up game this really is … ( laughs )
Sarah Palin lines up UK trip – and a visit to Lady Thatcher
Controversial US politician Sarah Palin could soon be on her way to Britain to boost her hopes of challenging Barack Obama in the 2012 US presidential election .
Her representatives approached Margaret Thatcher to ask for a meeting as part of a bid to enhance her claim to be the ‘ heir to Ronald Reagan ’ and prepare to challenge Mr Obama .
And Lady Thatcher has agreed to see Mrs Palin , who stood as the Republican vice - presidential candidate in 2008 .
A spokesman said : ‘ We had an informal approach asking if Lady Thatcher would meet Mrs Palin if she comes to Britain and we said yes . ’
Planning a comeback : Sarah Palin in New York earlier this month .
Lady
Thatcher has agreed to meet her in the UK as part of a bid to enhance the US politician 's claim to be the ' heir to Ronald Reagan '
Mrs Palin seems to have ditched the staid and formal ‘ hockey mom ’ image she appeared to favour during her campaign with Republican hopeful John McCain .
Earlier this month she was spotted looking relaxed and in high spirits at the races in New York , with her hair down and wearing a baseball cap , trendy sunglasses , a flimsy T - shirt and jeans .
And there was speculation last week she may have had breast enlargement surgery after she appeared in public wearing a tight - fitting white blouse which showed off her figure .
But the former Alaska Governor issued a strong denial during a TV interview .
‘ No , I have not had implants .
I ca n’t believe we are even talking about this , ’ she said .
Any trip by Mrs Palin to Britain could cause potential problems for David Cameron .
Embarrassingly , Mrs Palin ’s team have not contacted No 10 so far .
Image change : Palin during her 2008 campaign
One individual involved in the talks about the visit said : ‘ Palin ’s people have n’t said anything about meeting Cameron .
Their main interest is getting a picture of her with Lady Thatcher .
I ’m not sure they know who David Cameron is . ’
It would also pose a delicate diplomatic protocol dilemma for the Prime Minister , who is trying to defuse an acrimonious confrontation with Mr Obama over the oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico .
Outspoken Mrs Palin has launched a series of savage personal attacks on the US President .
Mr Cameron would have to decide whether to pose for photographs with her on the steps of No 10 , invite her in through the back door – or meet her elsewhere more discreetly .
It could also cause difficulties within the coalition Government .
While many Right - wing Tory MPs admire Mrs Palin , many Liberal Democrat MPs regard her as dangerous and irresponsible .
She is opposed to gay marriages , abortion and gun control , supports capital punishment and is a global warming sceptic .
One source said : ‘ A meeting with Margaret Thatcher would be an enormous publicity coup for Sarah Palin .
Thatcher is by far the biggest political name in US politics , much bigger than Blair .
' Palin ’s big hero is Ronald Reagan .
In US Republican folklore Thatcher and Reagan brought down the Soviet Union between them .
That ’s why Maggie is so important . ’
Mrs Palin has a Down ’s Syndrome son , Trig , and is a grandmother .
Speculation that she is preparing to run in the 2012 election has grown since she resigned as Governor of Alaska .
Asked directly if she would stand against Mr Obama , she said : ‘ I would be willing to if I believe that it ’s right for the country .
I wo n’t close the door that perhaps could be open for me in the future . ’
She is seen as the unofficial leader of America ’s so - called Tea Party , a Right - wing tax - cutting movement .
At a rally earlier this year , she ridiculed Mr Obama ’s pledge to change America , saying : ‘ How ’s that hopey - changey stuff workin ’ out for ya ? ’
She criticised America ’s increasing deficit since he won power and claimed he was weak on the war on terrorism .
The Israeli government is pressuring Poland to not extradite alleged Mossad spy Uri Brodsky to Germany .
If he is sent to Germany , Brodsky could be tried in court or even extradited to Dubai for his suspected role in the assassination of Hamas agent Mahmoud al - Mabhouh in January .
A Polish source told Haaretz that no decision had been made on an extradition .
The source also declined to say where Brodsky was being held .
Brodsky , who says he is a businessman and has no connection to the events , was arrested based on information provided by the Dubai and United Arab Emirates police and on an international arrest warrant issued in Germany via Interpol .

A German spokesman said the final decision was solely up to the Polish government .
Germany and Poland have an extradition agreement , both bilateral and through European treaties .
The extradition matter , however , is complex and could prove long and drawn out .
The Polish source added that Poland feels embarrassed and trapped between two countries it views as friends .
Poland is considered one of Israel 's greatest friends anywhere in the world , let alone the European Union .
They have close ties including economic agreements , arms deals , cultural relations and support by Poland for Israel in international forums , especially the United Nations .
According to foreign reports , Israel and Poland also also have covert ties through their intelligence communities .
Evidence of those ties can be seen in the fact that the arrest was kept under wraps in Poland ; the news was broken by a German media outlet .
Even after the story broke , the Polish media played it down on Saturday , basing their reporting on the Der Spiegel report .
Germany is also considered one of Israel 's best friends , including decades - long ties between the Mossad and the German foreign intelligence service .
It may be assumed that if Brodsky is extradited to Germany it will be on suspicion of belonging to a foreign organization and not on the suspicions of which Dubai is accusing him .
One can also assume that Germany would decline to extradite Brodsky to Dubai .
The fact that this is the first arrest of an Israeli suspected of being a Mossad agent involved in the Dubai assassination indicates that the matter refuses to fade away .
The Dubai hit may have been a success operationally , but it has severely damaged Israel diplomatically .
Britain has expelled the Mossad representative in the Israeli embassy in London , followed by Australia 's expulsion of the Mossad representative in Canberra .
Ireland is also considering various actions , including expelling the IDF military attache .
The political damage to Israel comes as a series of actions – or lack of actions – indicate that the world is sick of Israel 's deeds and sees Israel as a neighborhood bully that disregards and violates international norms .
Israel 's good friends , like Australia , Germany and France are finding it difficult to defend Israel and to justify their support of Israel to their publics .
You might recall the scoffing of right - wingers , and a fair number of " impartial " members of the pundit class , when Democrats complained in past news cycles about the incessant political bias employed by the Fox News Network .
Does the charge have any more credibility now that a Republican is the one making it ?
( Trey ) Grayson says he's not just facing the Paul family in his race to replace retiring Sen.
Jim Bunning ( R - Ky. ) , but an even more powerful force in conservative politics : Fox News .
By frequently putting Rand Paul , the son of Ron Paul and Grayson 's opponent , on its air , Grayson says the network has all but endorsed Paul and given him an easy way to tout his candidacy without actually meeting Kentucky voters in person .
" I 've been on Fox News once , on a live feed on one of the shows , and I was told I was to expect a certain line of questioning , and I was given a different line of questioning , " Grayson said .
Referring to Rand Paul , Grayson said , " He 's on all of the time . "
Grayson takes the Fox News bias charge and actually expands on it .
In the past , most of the allegations have been about things like topic choices , balance in terms of guests , and even the stray " mistake " by their chyron operator .
Grayson goes even deeper here .
He comes perilously close to alleging sabotage by saying that they prepared him for one line of questioning , and then ambushing him with another line of questioning .
He also makes it very clear that he thinks Paul 's appearances on the network are tantamount to campaign appearances :
" His dad had these phenomenal contacts , so ... he's on Fox News every couple of weeks with softballs , " said Grayson .
Imitating an anchor 's voice , Grayson said the questions are softballs such as , " Rand , tell us about health care , you 're a doctor .
Rand , tell us about the tea party . "
Grayson 's protest , like those in the past , will probably be largely dismissed .
After all , he is on his way to what will surely be a substantial defeat tomorrow in the Republican primary in Kentucky .
It wo n't be hard to discount Grayson 's allegations of favoritism as a mere case of " sour grapes " ( and , indeed , those exact two words appear in the WaPo article about Grayson 's complaint ) .
That said , it does raise an interesting question .
Is Fox News now going from merely being a mouthpiece for GOP talking points to being a player in what is clearly a developing civil war to determine the future ideological course of the party ?
Trey Grayson , quite clearly , seems to think so .

When the zombie apocalypse strikes , will you be ready ?
How can you prepare now to survive the undead onslaught ?
We got the inside scoop from the Green Light Anti-Zombie Squad , a group that 's dedicated to protecting you from zombie attacks .
Here are 10 practical tips on how to survive an encounter with the walking dead .
Advertisement
The Green Light Anti-Zombie Squad offers lectures and demonstrations to help you and your loved ones survive an army of the undead with your brains ( and sanity intact ) .
To ensure you 'll make it through the zombie apocalypse , heed their simple tips .
1. Clear the Room .
There 's nothing worse than stepping into a room only to be set upon by a horde of brain - hungry zombies .
A team of four armed shooters can easily clear a room if they all stand against the nearest wall : one body in each corner and two in the middle .
This position proves optimal for quickly dispatching of a room full of the reanimated .

2. Never Turn Your Back on the Enemy

Shambling is n't just for zombies .
Three live humans can stand with their backs together and carefully rotate through the room , ensuring that all eyes are facing outward and no one falls victim to a surprise attack .
3. The Fine Line
Advertisement
For those lucky enough to amass a relatively large army of live humans , the Fine Line is the best way to fend off roving zombie hordes .
Simply form two lines of armed persons , one line in front of the other .
Have the front line shoot while the back line holds .
When the front line runs out of ammo , the back line steps in while the front line reloads .
Tragically , the Squad 's training zombie , Billy the Hunter , died while the Squad demonstrated this technique .
4. Zombies Are the Least of Your Worries
Advertisement
It 's bad enough that you have to deal with the zombified masses , who are tireless , feel no pain , and greatly outnumber healthy human beings .
But perhaps even more deadly are the humans who simply can't cope with the new world order .
It 's best if you keep a psychologist on hand who can identify and subdue such persons before they embark on a murderous rampage that makes the zombies look as ferocious as fluffy kittens .
5. Choose Your Weapons Wisely
Advertisement
Not all weapons work for all people , and the trendiest zombie - fighting armaments are n't always the best .
When in doubt , melee weapons are a fine tool against the undead , but think twice before picking up that giant hammer .
As satisfying as squishing zombie skull may be , swinging the hammer creates a sizable arc that gives zombies plenty of time to nibble at your armpits .
GLAZS advises that you invest in a machete , which is cheap , lightweight , and neatly separates a zombie 's head from its bodies .
As for ranged weapons , you may want to reconsider that sawed - off shotgun you 're so fond of .
Bolt action rifles are both powerful and accurate , without the ammunition restrictions of the close - range shotgun .
6. Windows Are Not Your Friend
Advertisement
Zombies have a nasty habit of crashing through glass windows , so it 's best to choose a hideout with as few ground level windows as possible .
Steer clear of malls , coffee shops , and boutique outlets in favor of Costco , BJs , Sam's Club , or any other large warehouse .
If you find yourself trapped in your house , it 's best to hightail it up to the attic , which the uncoordinated zombies will have trouble reaching .
Basements , even windowless ones , spell trouble .
7. Do n't Get Stuck With A Gas - Guzzler
Advertisement
If you 're traveling with a group , you may consider fleeing by minivan or SUV , but be warned that the gas mileage and rollover rates might be a literal killer .
If you 're traveling alone , it 's best to take a high miles per gallon vehicle , like a dirt bike , or , better yet , grab a bicycle and escape the zombies under your own replenishable power .
8. Fight World War Z with TNT
Advertisement
Using dynamite around the undead is a tricky proposition ; the right amount of explosives can blow them to bits , but you might get cremated yourself .
It 's better to stave off those desiccated corpse with a controlled burn .
But , GLASZ 's demolitions expert warns , make sure it 's a fire you can contain .
A raging wildfire could prove far more deadly than the zombies themselves .
9. Animals : Friend or Foe ?

Animals can be invaluable allies at the end of the world , but the zombie infection could render them more hazard than help .
If the zombie plague is viral , it can infect any living cells , causing even the most inhuman animals to exhibit flesh - craving symptoms .
GLASZ members ask : Would you rather fight off a zombie human — or a zombie lion ?

10 . Suit Up
Advertisement
Perhaps the best way to prepare for the day the dead rise from their graves is to assemble the perfect zombie - fighting attire .
Avoid brain spray - back by wearing goggles and covering your face with a non-porous material .
Use plate mail or leather to create a bite - proof body suit .
Kevlar gloves ( provided to some food industry workers ) can be worn as is or refashioned into impenetrable sleeves , allowing you to fend off zombie bites by holding up your forearms .
Riot shields also add an extra layer of protection and make the zombie head squishing that much easier .

A version of this article first appeared back in 2009 .
The Supreme Court ruled today that Congress and the Interior Department acted properly when they used a land transfer to solve a dispute over a cross on display in the federal Mojave National Preserve .
The case , Salazar v. Buono , stemmed from a 2001 lawsuit challenging a cross erected in 1934 by the Veterans of Foreign Wars .
Frank Buono , an Oregon resident who had served as an assistant superintendent in the park and was a regular visitor , claimed the memorial to World War I veterans was unconstitutional because it gave the impression that the government was advancing a particular religion .
By a 5 - 4 margin , the Supreme Court ruled today that lower federal courts were wrong to dismiss as " evasion " the federal government 's effort to transfer the land underneath the religious symbol .
Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the opinion ( pdf ) for the majority , arguing that the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had failed to consider the profound " dilemma " posed by the case .
The Interior Department could not leave the cross in place without violating the ruling that the display was unconstitutional , Kennedy wrote , " but it could not remove the cross without conveying disrespect for those the cross was seen as honoring .
Deeming neither alternative satisfactory , Congress enacted the land - transfer statute . "
" The statute should not have been dismissed as an evasion , for it brought about a change of law and a congressional statement of policy applicable to the case , " Kennedy added .
Congress had authorized a land swap with the Veterans of Foreign Wars , trading 1 acre of land around the cross in exchange for 5 privately owned acres elsewhere in the preserve .
Previously overseen by the Bureau of Land Management , the site of the cross came under control of the National Park Service when the 1.6 - million - acre Mojave National Preserve was created in 1994 .
The white wooden cross , roughly 5 feet tall , stands atop Sunrise Rock in California 's San Bernardino County .
It has been covered with a large plywood box since a lower court ruled it unconstitutional .
Justice John Paul Stevens dissented today , arguing that the land transfer could itself be considered a promotion of religion .
If the land had been privately owned to begin with , he wrote , there would be no question that the statue is permissible under control of the veterans .
" But the Government does own this land , and the transfer statute requires the executive branch to take an affirmative act -- transfer to private ownership -- designed to keep the cross in place , " Stevens wrote , joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer .
In a brief on behalf of Interior Secretary Ken Salazar , Solicitor General Elena Kagan said there was no reason to conclude that the continued presence of the cross would imply government sponsorship .
The transfer handed over control to the Veterans of Foreign Wars and required the installation of a plaque dissociating the statue from the federal government , she wrote .
" Congress already has taken steps to end any continuing endorsement , " she wrote .
" By ordering the Park Service to install a plaque stating that the cross was erected by the VFW to commemorate fallen service members , Congress has required ' a clearly visible ' statement of the memorial 's secular origin and purpose . "

Sweden is often held up by American pundits and experts as a kind of Utopia , a country to be emulated .
As is often the case when dealing with Utopias however , the complexities of history , culture and policy frequently are shoved aside .
Rather than being guinea pigs in a progressive experiment in social engineering , Swedes are a unique people with a long history .
Therefore , we should question the lazy assumption that good Swedish outcomes ( long life expectancies , social equality ) are due to particular Scandinavian policies ( the welfare state ) .
After all , even before the high - tax welfare state , Sweden was characterized by an even distribution of income , low poverty and long life spans , the same phenomena that today are said to be the result of high - tax welfare policies .
In 1950 , before the high - tax welfare state , Swedes lived 2.6 years longer than Americans .
Today the difference is 2.7 years .
A more reasonable view of why Sweden performs well on many social metrics has its basis in history and sociology : Swedes have for hundreds of years benefited from sound low - level institutions , such as a strong work ethic and high levels of trust and cooperation .
These cultural phenomena do not disappear when Swedes cross the Atlantic to the supposedly inferior “ cowboy ” country .
On the contrary , they appear to bloom fully .
The 4.4 million Americans with Swedish origins are considerably richer than the average American .
If Americans with Swedish ancestry would form their own country their per capita GDP would be $ 56,900 , more than $ 10,000 above the earnings of the average American .
The old Sweden , in contrast , has not done as well in economic terms .
In 1960 taxation stood at 30 percent of GDP , roughly where the US is today .
As taxes rose , economic growth decreased , with Sweden dropping from being the 4th richest country in 1970 to being the 12th richest in 2008 .
Swedish GDP per capita is now $ 36,600 , far below the $ 45,500 of the US , and even further behind the $ 56,900 of Swedes in America .
A Scandinavian economist once stated to Milton Friedman : " In Scandinavia we have no poverty . "
Milton Friedman replied , " That 's interesting , because in America among Scandinavians , we have no poverty either . "
Indeed , the poverty rate for Americans with Swedish ancestry is only 6.7 % , half the U.S average .
Economists Geranda Notten and Chris de Neubourg have calculated the poverty rate in Sweden using the American poverty threshold , finding it to be an identical 6.7 % .
Ironically , this points us towards the conclusion that what makes Sweden uniquely successful is not the welfare state , as is commonly assumed .
Rather than being the cause of Sweden ’s social strengths , the high - tax welfare state might have been enabled by the hard - won Swedish stock of social capital .
It was well before the welfare state , when hard work paid off , that a culture with strong protestant working ethics developed .
As taxes in Sweden have grown rapidly towards taking up half of the economy , that social capital is being eroded .
In the 1990s , supposedly hyper - healthy Sweden established itself as being sickest country in the rich world , in terms of sick - leave .
In addition , half a million working - age people ( compared to a total labor force of four million ) were placed in health - related “ early retirement ” .
Labor union economist Jan Edling calculated that a fifth of working - age Swedes were supported by some form of public unemployment support , including sickness related leave in 2004 , when the economy was growing strongly .
The high - tax state has also created an increasingly threatened middle class .
In a recent study , the Swedish Taxpayers association noted that wealth formation among the middle classes is weak .
There is little correlation between earnings and wealth amongst Swedes .
Instead of building capital , Swedes go into debt : 27 percent of Swedish households in fact have more debts than wealth , compared to between 16 and 19 percent in the US .
With middle class wealth formation being held back by high taxes , Sweden has ironically developed a more unequal wealth distribution than the US .
The Gini coefficient for ownership is almost 0.9 in Sweden , compared to slightly above 0.8 in the US .
In short , there is much to admire in Sweden .
But when it comes to economic policy and copying Swedish institutions , Americans are probably better off being inspired by Swedes in America , rather than Swedes in Sweden .
Nima Sanandaji , is President of the Swedish think - tank Captus and Robert Gidehag is president of the Swedish Taxpayer´s association .
They were assisted by Tino Sanandaji and Arvid Malm , chief economists at Captus respectively the Swedish Taxpayers Association .
The global financial crisis is playing out like a slow - moving , highly predicable stage play .
In the current scene , Western governments are caught between the demands of entitled welfare beneficiaries and the anxiety of bondholders who fear they will be stuck with the bill .
As the crisis reaches an apex , prime ministers and presidents are forced into a Sophie ’s choice between social unrest and bankruptcy .
But with the " Club Med " economies set to fall like dominoes , the US Treasury market is not yet acting the role we would have anticipated .
Our argument has always been that the US benefits from its reserve - currency status , allowing it to accumulate unsustainable debts for an unusually long period without the immediate repercussions of inflation or higher borrowing costs .
But this false sense of security may be setting us up for a truly monumental crash .

There is fresh evidence that time is running out for the dollar - centric global monetary order .
In fact , central banks outside the US are already making swift and discrete preparation for a post - dollar era .
To begin , the People ’s Bank of China has just this week decided to permit a wider trading range between the yuan and the dollar .
This is the first step toward ending the infernal yuan - dollar peg .
While the impetus behind this abrupt change remains a mystery , I have a sneaking suspicion that , as my colleague Neeraj Chaudhary explained in his commentary last week , the nationwide labor strikes were a prime motivator .
In response to the 2008 credit crunch , the Fed printed so many dollars that the People ’s Bank of China was forced to drive Chinese inflation into double digits to maintain the peg .
The pain has fallen on China ’s workers , who have seen their wages stagnate while prices for everything from milk to apartments have skyrocketed .
This week ’s move indicates that , regardless of its own policy motives , the Communist Party can no longer afford to keep pace with the dollar ’s devaluation .
The result will be a shift in wealth from America to China , which may trigger a long - anticipated run on the dollar , while creating investment opportunities in China .
Crash Proof 2.0 : How t... Peter D. Schiff Best Price : $ 1.50 Buy New $ 3.97 ( as of 10:46 EST - Details )
Just days before China ’s announcement , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev rattled his monetary sabre by telling the press of his intention to lead the world toward a new monetary order based on a broad basket of currencies .
Giving strength to his claim , the Central Bank of Russia announced that it would be adding Canadian and Australian dollars to its reserves for the first time .
Analysts suggest that the IMF may follow suit .
While Russia floats in the limbo between hopeless kleptocracy and emerging economy , it does possess vast natural resources and a toe - hold in both Europe and Asia .
In other words , it will be a strategically important partner for China as it tries to cast off dollar hegemony .
The Little Book of Bul ... Peter D. Schiff Best Price : $ 0.05 Buy New $ 1.99 ( as of 05:25 EST - Details )
Speaking of Europe , the major powers there are moving toward a post - dollar world by rejecting President Obama ’s calls to jump on America ’s debt grenade .
The prescriptions coming from Washington translate loosely to : our airship is on fire , so why do n’t you light a candle under yours so that we may crash and burn together .
Given that dollar strength is largely seen as a function of euro weakness ( as Andrew Schiff discussed in our most recent newsletter ) , debt troubles in the eurozone ’s fringe economies have created a distorted confidence in the greenback .
However , as you might imagine , Europe has higher priorities than being America ’s fall guy .
Led by an ever - bolder Germany , the European states are wisely choosing not to throw themselves on our funeral pyre , but to wisely clean house in anticipation of China ’s rise .
In another ominous sign for the dollar , the Financial Times reported Wednesday that after two decades as net sellers of gold , foreign central banks have now become net buyers .
What ’s more , more than half of central bank officials surveyed by UBS did n’t think the dollar would be the world ’s reserve in 2035 .
Among the predicted replacements were Asian currencies and the euro , but  by far  the favorite was gold .
This is supported by Monday ’s revelation by the Saudi central bank that it had covertly doubled its gold reserves , just about a year after China made a similar admission .
There is no reason to assume these are isolated incidents , or that the covert trade of dollars for gold does n’t continue .
To the contrary , this is compelling evidence that foreign governments are outwardly supporting the status quo while quietly preparing for the dollar ’s almost - inevitable devaluation .
What people like Paul Krugman believe to be a return to medieval economics may , in fact , be the wave of the future .
In peacetime , hardened troops will likely tolerate a blowhard general for an extended period ; but when the artillery opens up with live ordnance , an ineffectual leader risks rapid demotion .
The newspapers are now riddled with hints that foreign governments have lost faith in Washington and the dollar reserve system .
It seems to me only natural that after a century of war , inflation , and socialism , the next hundred years would belong to those people who hold the timeless values of hard money and fiscal prudence .
Unfortunately , our policymakers are not those people .

Malcolm Gladwell : straight talk about low carb diets
Twelve years ago , Gladwell hit the nail on the head in his analysis of low carb diets .

My post - workout meal today : large grilled chicken breast , a pound of fried potato wedges and Ajvar on the side .
Pound of slightly thawed strawberries , swimming in vanilla protein powder , as a treat .
It 's just a matter of time now before the insulin shock and fructose - overload sends me into coma and fries my liver .
Bonus material
Following up on my article about the fat fallacy and anti-fat propaganda of the 80s and 90s , I thought it would be fitting to cover the carbophobia of more recent times .
The origins of carbophobia can be traced back to the late '90s .
Just about the same time that the public was starting to realize that dietary fat was not to blame for our steadily increasing waistlines and failed diet attempts .
In this case there 's not a single researcher or study that started it all .
Our fear of carbs started as a consequence of looking for a new scapegoat to blame .
Luckily , Heller , Sears and Atkins were there to satisfy our needs with " The Carbohydrate Addict 's Diet " ( 1993 ) , " The Zone Diet " ( 1995 ) , " Dr Atkins ' New Diet Revolution " ( 1997 ) .
Let 's approach this topic through an outside observer that had some strikingly accurate thoughts about low carb diets at the time they were starting to take off .
I found this incredibly insightful article by Malcolm Gladwell , who has written many great books , such as " The Tipping Point " and " Outliers : The Story Of Success " .
All of which I have read and strongly recommend if you have a remote interest in social phenomenons .
This article is called " The Pima Paradox " but touches on the popularity of diets that were becoming popular at that time ( 1998 ) .
He discusses " The Zone Diet " , Atkins and " The Carbohydrate Addict 's Diet " and I was really surprised to see how well Gladwell understood the underlying issues with these diets .
They were all based on the hypothesis that lowering carbs and controlling insulin was what successful weight loss was all about .
Let me cite a few good passages .
About The Zone Diet , Gladwell wrote : " Does the Zone exist ?
Yes and no .
Certainly , if people start eating a more healthful diet they 'll feel better about themselves .
But the idea that there is something magical about keeping insulin within a specific range is a little strange .
Insulin is simply a hormone that regulates the storage of energy . " ... High levels of insulin are the result of obesity .
They are n't the cause of obesity .
" He 's right on the money .
Studies show similar weight loss with widely varying levels of insulin and there is no evidence for high insulin causing weight gain .
Weight gain and overeating causes high insulin , not the other way around .
Some people in the low carb camp seems to believe otherwise , despite no evidence .
" What Sears would have us believe is that when it comes to weight loss your body treats some kinds of calories differently from others -- that the combination of the food we eat is more critical than the amount .
To this end , he cites what he calls an " amazing " and " landmark " study published in 1956 in the British medical journal Lancet .
( It should be a tipoff that the best corroborating research he can come up with here is more than forty years old . ) " ... Sears concludes from the study that if you want to lose weight you should eat protein and shun carbohydrates .
Actually , it shows nothing of the sort .
Carbohydrates promote water retention ; protein acts like a diuretic .
Over a week or so , someone on a high - protein diet will always look better than someone on a high - carbohydrate diet , simply because of dehydration .
When a similar study was conducted several years later , researchers found that after about three weeks -- when the effects of dehydration had evened out -- the weight loss on the two diets was virtually identical .
" Again , right on point .
Even today , 12 years after Gladwell 's article was published , there 's no compelling evidence that shows the superioriy of low carb diets in the long - term .
Calorie - controlled studies always show similar weight loss when participants are followed up after 12 months ( click here here and here for examples ) .
" The key is n't how you eat , in other words ; it 's how much you eat .
Calories , not carbohydrates , are still what matters . " ... The dirty little secret of the Zone system is that , despite Sears 's expostulations about insulin , all he has done is come up with another low - calorie diet .
He does n't do the math for his readers , but some nutritionists have calculated that if you follow Sears 's prescriptions religiously you 'll take in at most seventeen hundred calories a day , and at seventeen hundred calories a day virtually anyone can lose weight .
" This is key .
A similar thing happens on ad libitum low carb diets .
People reduce calories spontaneously if they 're told to cut carbs out of their diet .
" Food in America has become a recreational activity .
It is divorced from nutritional need and hunger .
We eat to kill time , to stimulate ourselves , to alter our mood .
" This is the main reason people are getting fatter all over the world .
We can't isolate one single factor .
Not fat , carbs or sedentariness .
Our environment does everything to encourage weight gain by presenting us with an unnaturally palatable assortment of different foods that completely screw up our natural appetite regulation .
And we do n't have to expend an iota of energy in obtaining these foods .
The pattern is similar in every area of the world where refined foods are introduced .
There are a few more interesting things being discussed in that article .
If you 're not keen on reading everything , at least hit " ctrl + F " and do a search for " The Photocopier Effect " and " Fat Mobilizing Substance " .
Malcolm Gladwell had more insight than the great majority of diet gurus and health experts out there at the time .
While Gladwell discusses The Zone Diet above , I would n't really want to classify that as a low carb diet unless you compare it with the Standard American Diet .
With 40 % carbs , The Zone Diet should be considered a moderate carb diet .
Besides that , the points made in the article are still valid ( with the exception of his remarks about ketosis as potentially harmful , which is far - fetched and alarmist in this context ) .
Many years ago , when I was a broke student , I would eat tuna with almost every meal .
Tuna on whole grain bread , tuna with rice , tuna in salad , etc .
Since I was on a generic bodybuildingesque diet with 5 - 6 meals a day , I ate a whole lot of tuna .
I did that for a few weeks and then one day found out that I could n't eat a single bite of tuna anymore .
I developed an aversion to tuna that persisted for many years .
That 's how I feel about the low carb / insulin / metabolic advantage - hoopla .
But in this case the aversion seems to be severe and permanent .
That 's why I prefer to let Gladwell speak for me .
The topic has been beaten to death so many times over that I simply refuse to debate it any longer .
Why this aversion ?
I 've done my part on this issue in the past .
With more than 200 comments , " Low Carb Talibans " is still the most commented article on this site , with guest appearances by Tom Venuto , Alan Aragon and Lyle McDonald among others .
Do n't bother to resurrect the debate .
Ain't happening .
Let me state my position on the issue of high carb diets versus low carb diets one last time .
Most people get better results from low carb diets for the simple fact that their diets improve when they make the switch .
Protein and veggie intakes tend to go up a lot and this leads to much better satiety and diet compliance compared to a generic high carb diet .
The latter also tends to be compromised of a greater amount of refined and high calorie density foods .
When people think " high carb " they associate it with rice cakes , pasta and bread .
When people think " low carb " they associate it with meat , eggs and veggies .
Is there a metabolic advantage to low carb diets ?
Of course there is .
As protein intake makes up a larger percentage of calories consumed , diet induced thermogenesis ( DIT ) increases .
A 2000 - calorie diet compromised of 40 % protein is superior to a 2000 - calorie diet compromised of 20 % protein .
The difference would roughly be on the order of 95 calories in favor of the first diet .
A small difference ( small enough to not be detected in studies ) , but a difference nonetheless .
However , the metabolic advantage is due to protein and not specifically related to the carb content of the diet like some people want to believe .
If we compare a high carb , high protein ( 40 % ) , low fat diet to low carb , high protein ( 40 % ) , high fat diet we would n't see a detectable difference in DIT .
Some people do in fact feel better on low carb diets and it has nothing to do with the greater satiety from increased protein or veggie intakes .
Just like some people feel better on higher carb diets .
Problem is a lot of people tend to place themselves in the low carb - category without really having tried the middle ground .
My experience is that a lot of people who readily label themselves as " carb - sensitive " do very well on a moderate carb - approach with the great majority of carbs coming from tubers , fruit , veggies and the occasional starch source .
Today , actually in the last year or so , I have noticed that the low carb - hysteria has waned a bit .
It 's gradually being replaced by the paleo - movement .
While the paleo - movement has its fair share of extremists , it 's still a shift towards a more productive attitude towards diets , as the focus lies more on unrefined foods rather than a specific macronutrient .
I was a carbophobe many years ago .
Trust me when I say that it 's ultimately a highly counterproductive mindset if you 're looking to maintain leanness , performance and your sanity in the long - term .
I 'm lucky that I got out of it .
Since a few years back , at the same time I started using intermittent fasting and developed the Leangains method , I have occupied the middle ground .
There is a place for both higher fat and higher carb intakes depending on occasion .
The exclusion of either one macronutrient breeds a longing for the other .
Eating sufficient amounts of each one on a regular basis is key .
That 's why Leangains is a cyclical diet .
Low carbs , higher fat on rest days , higher carbs and lower fat on training days .
In my experience this is just perfect . *
In Gladwell 's article , I found one comment about leptin that really piqued my interest .
Gladwell writes : " There is also some evidence that if you can keep weight off for an extensive period -- three years , say - - a lower setpoint can be established .
" I'm very curious about what research he refers to here .
It would be great news for anyone looking to reach and maintain low body fat even though they might not have the genetic setup for it .
I 've maintained single digit body fat for the last ten years , despite being fat throughout my teens .
Even though I have proven it possible for a former fat boy like myself to get lean and stay there , I have n't come across any hard scientific evidence for the possibility of lowering your setpoint .
Very interesting .*
If you want to read more about low carb versus high carb , check out Anthony Colpo 's dissection of the topic .
The exchange between him and Michael Eades also makes for some entertaining reading if you have the time . *
Some people in the low carb camp claim that carb intakes have increased the last few decades while dietary fat has n't .
Which simply is n't true .
On average , we 're eating 600 calories more compared to the 1970s , with a higher added intake of fat than any other macronutrient .
Adding to that , physical activity has decreased by 10 % .
Alan Aragon covers this in his latest Research Review .
Some good reading .*
Lessons from " Low Carb Talibans " - Trying to convince someone who does n't really want to be convinced is a complete waste of time .
Using studies to back up your point when your opponent does n't care for it is even worse . -
Placing " Talibans " in the headline of an article is a good way to get tons of hate mail and alienate a large part of your readership .- ... It 's also a great way to boost traffic to your site dramatically .
P.S. Do n't bother trying to resurrect the low versus high carb debate - I 'm seriously through with discussing it .
It bores me to tears .
A Voyage to the Self and the Christ

BODY WEIGHT : 145 lb
The other night I had perhaps one of the most profound experiences of my entire life .
Undoubtedly , I will be contemplating it for some time to come , but these are my thoughts a day or two after the experience .
A bit of background first .
I was born Jewish , and raised as a reform Jew .
That is , my family celebrated the Sabbath , and went to services for the high holy days , but that 's it .
We pretty much paid it lip service .
In the past year , inspired by an acid trip , I 've begun reading about other philosophies and other religions .
However , my readings for the most part have dealt only with Taoism , Hinduism , and Buddhism .
I started out with the intention of gaining greater personal and interpersonal insight with the aid of LSD and MDMA .
After dark , I took two hits of relatively weak LSD blotter .
After an hour or so , I began to notice some initial effects , so I put on the Mindfold , which is a device that blocks all incoming light , even with your eyes open .
I put ' How to Operate Your Brain ' by Tim Leary onto my mp3 player , and listened .
In essence , he says that the mind is like a biocomputer , and we are the master programmers who choose what we put into it .
However , most of the time we surrender that control to the government and other institutions and corporations .
Instead , we should question authority and think for ourselves !
Very simple , yet very important ideas .
Around this point I figured it would be a good time to take the first MDMA pill .
I did so , and started looking through a personal scrapbook I had made half a year ago that included many personally significant photographs .
Immediately I felt a surge of empathy with the people in the pictures , and gained some understanding about them , as I had hoped .
I went online to chat with a few friends , and one of them mentioned art , and it occured to me to look at a book of art by Alex Grey ( who incidentally created the Mindfold ) .
I did so and thought it was cool .
A friend had suggested going into the fetal position on a body pillow in a dark room and flowing with existence .
I did that with some music .
I was astounded by how free , happy , and secure I felt ; feelings which seem to elude me from time to time .
About 20 minutes before doing this however , I 'm fairly certain I took the second MDMA pill .
My memory is a little hazy so I 'm not sure of the exact time .
Before going into the fetal position , I had so much energy that I simultaneously wanted to go everywhere and see everything and to simply sit still .
I ended up sitting , but trembling slightly .
After the fetal position , I returned to my computer to check my e-mail and see who was online .
Suddenly , I was struck by the most tremendous urge imaginable .
I needed to sit down and look at the art book by Alex Grey .
At this point , not even a pack of wild horses could have gotten in my way .
I sat down .
Frantically , I flipped through the pages , looking for something , but I did n't know what .
Suddenly , the words ' FIND CHRIST ' screamed into my consciousness .
I flipped through the entire book as if my life was at stake , but could n't find the picture I was looking for ( entitled ' Christ ' ) .
I tried to find an index but there was n't one .
Finally , I found it .
Time lost meaning .
It could have been day or night , past , present , or future , none of it mattered in the least .
As soon as my eyes landed on the image of Christ , I felt as though Christ himself was staring back at me .
The picture had n't changed , but there felt like a tangible force behind it now .
As we gazed into each other 's eyes , my mind became completely silent .
I was empty - devoid of desires or problems or thoughts .
Yet I was filled with the most amazing awareness and overflowing with unconditional love for everything .
I was content to sit and look upon him for all of eternity .
I somehow managed to scribble down a few sentences in my log during this , including , ' Christ 's love is infinite , all else is irrelevant . ' and ' When the mind is taken away , things seem as they truly are . '
I felt as if he was communicating with me , yet without words .
I closed my eyes and was regaled with a sense of unity , and saw fleeting images of Lao Tzu and of Jesus of Nazareth .
Though I could not actually ' see ' them , their presence seemed to be intuitive .
I opened my eyes , and grabbed a rosary we had received in the mail in some solicitation for money .
There was a metal cross with Jesus on it .
I grabbed it , and kissed it , and tried to imbue the force I was experiencing into it ( to use as a power object ) , yet try as I may , the force would not transfer .
A desire suddenly popped into my head : to experience this bliss forever .
However , Christ seemed to intuit to me that there was still work to be done ( in my life ) .
Moments later , the feeling that the force was about to leave arose , and I felt slightly disappointed .
I looked at the picture , and suddenly it was back to being only a picture .
Still enthralled by this experience , I walked downstairs and spent a little time petting my dog , then stepped outside where it was quite cold .
Even though I only had thin pants and no shirt on , I was comfortable .
I returned to my room and listened to music and meditated for another few hours until I was able to rest .
The last entry in my log was , ' Mission of life : free yourself from Maya . '
For the rest of the next day , my mind was restless and uneasy .
My ego and rational mind had been dealt a serious blow , and accordingly , I was confused .
My rationality immediately began to try to rationalize what had happened .
The only thing it could up with was that peaking on the MDMA , I projected my feelings of love onto the closest available thing - which in this case was a picture of Jesus .
However , this still does n't explain my urge to ' Find Christ ' or how my mind was so silent as if I was in a high meditative state , or why the perceived force spontaneously arrived and departed .
After contemplating the event for another day or two , I reached what I felt was a slightly more complete analysis of what happened .
Enhanced by the LSD and MDMA , my mind entered a state of high meditation , perhaps even satori or kensho , as it's called by the Buddhists .
Perhaps I reached a state of consciousness called Christ - consciousness .
I think that we all are Christ and have this Christ - consciousness in us , yet most of us are n't able to realize it because of Maya ( the grand illusion ) .
Jesus of Nazareth was an extraordinarily enlightened yogi .
He was so established in this ' Christ - consciousness ' that he embodied it totally .
As for the urge to ' Find Christ , ' I still cannot explain , and I doubt my rational mind will ever be able to rationally explain this .
Christ - consciousness
I believe is very similar to Samadhi , in which one experiences union with the non-dual Brahman , yet one maintains one 's duality .
Or perhaps it is beyond that even and Christ - consciousness is simply another label for the Tao .
Perhaps with more time I will gain greater insight into Christ - consciousness and what happened .
OPINION
Where have all the mushrooms gone ?
John Arnold reflects on this mystery , the richness of the Irish language and how so much of it has too been lost
And I 'm back to a mixture of drawing digitally and non-digitally .
Drawing in Photoshop with my Wacom - pen gives me so much freedom , but I missed the feeling and the fluently of drawing with a pen on real paper .
So until I find a way to draw digitally with the feeling of real pen-and - paper ( maybe with a Wacom Cintiq ? ) -
I will look for better ways to draw .
This comic was first sketched with pencil on paper , then setup with pencil on the real paper , after that I inked it with my brush - pen and other pens .
And then I scanned it in , added the text , moved the images a little around and added some effects .
It 's a nice combination , if you ask me .
I 'm really happy with the end result .
Back in march we reported that Star Wars :
The old republic was n’t the only Star Wars mmorpg in development .
Today Sony Online Entertainment announced new MMO universe , this one adopting the animated Star Wars : Clone Wars setting .
It ’s fully a browser - based experience , allowing players to choose to be either a Jedi , Padawan or a Clone Trooper and along - side their favorite heroes such as Anakin Skywalker or Obi-Wan Kenobi .
Sony Online Entertainment and LucasArts are developing Star Wars : Clone Wars Adventures , a free - to - play virtual world based on the Star Wars : The Clone Wars animated series airing on Cartoon Network , set to launch online and in retail stores this fall .
While LucasArts published SOE ’s last MMO based on the George Lucas franchise , Star Wars Galaxies , the San Diego - headquartered studio is both developing and publishing this title .
The companies hope to introduce the Jedi , Padawan and Clone Troopers saga to a new generation of Star Wars fans with Clone Wars Adventures .
In this browser - based virtual world , players will be able can pilot starfighters , fight other starships , duel against “ icon adversaries ” with their custom lightsaber , play minigames like Droid Programming and Speeder Bike Racing , and play an embedded collectible card game featuring characters , creatures , and vehicles from The Clone Wars show .
While Clone Wars Adventures is free , players can purchase a monthly membership with unspecified advantages .
They can also buy outfits , items , and accessories through microtransactions with Station Cash , SOE ’s virtual currency .
As with Free Realms , SOE ’s tremendously successful free - to - play virtual world with more than 10 million users , Clone Wars Adventures is designed to be a safe online environment for kids and families .
It will offer customizable safety options , such as pre-canned chat and playtime settings for younger users .
“ Clone Wars Adventures is the ultimate destination for fans of The Clone Wars series and will bring the action and excitement of the show to players online so they can experience The Clone Wars universe firsthand ” says SOE president John Smedley .
Smedley adds , “ We ’ve worked with LucasArts and Lucasfilm to create a virtual world that is seamlessly integrated with the TV series and a true extension of the show .
It ’s also just flat - out fun to play . ”

Installing STA drivers
STA - Internet access
If you have some other kind of Internet access on your computer ( e.g. via an ethernet cable ) then use the instructions below .
12.04 ( Precise Pangolin )
Open a Terminal and install the bcmwl - kernel - source package :
sudo apt - get update sudo apt - get -- reinstall install bcmwl - kernel - source
Note :
If you see the message " Module build for the currently running kernel was skipped since the kernel source for this kernel does not seem to be installed " then you are missing the appropriate generic linux - header package (s ) .
To test the driver ( and remove the need for a computer restart ) use :
sudo modprobe -r b43 ssb wl brcmfmac brcmsmac bcma sudo modprobe wl
Allow several seconds for the network manager to scan for available networks before attempting a connection .
The bcmwl - kernel - source package should automatically blacklist the open source drivers so that the STA driver is the only one in use .
Back to top
STA - No Internet access
If you do not have any other means of Internet access on your computer , you can install the bcmwl - kernel - source package from the restricted folder under ../ pool / restricted /b/ bcmwl on the Ubuntu install media .
Note :
The bcmwl - kernel - source package depends on the linux - headers packages so you may need to first retrieve the appropriate package (s ) from the online repositories .
A running LiveCD / LiveUSB environment has these packages ( allowing the wireless to work ) , but an installed system may not .
Make sure you have the linux - headers package that matches your current kernel version , plus the appropriate generic header packages so that they are automatically updated on a kernel upgrade .
To find out your current kernel use the command :
uname -r
To find what linux - headers packages you have installed use the command :
dpkg -- get - selections | grep headers
Systems installed from CDROM can add the install CD as a package source and install bcmwl - kernel - source using apt - get as above .
However , if you want to do it manually then the instructions are as follows :
Navigate the install media and install the packages listed below by double clicking OR install the packages consecutively from a Terminal ( in the commands below the install media is mounted at / cdrom , but yours maybe different ) :
../ pool / main/d/dkms cd / cdrom / pool / main/d/dkms sudo dpkg - i dkms * ../ pool / main/p/ patch cd / cdrom / pool / main /p/ patch sudo dpkg - i patch * ../ pool/main/f/fakeroot cd /cdrom / pool / main/f/ fakeroot sudo dpkg - i fakeroot * ../ pool / restricted/b/bcmwl cd /cdrom/pool/ restricted /b/ bcmwl sudo dpkg - i bcmwl - kernel - source *

Installing b43/b43legacy firmware
The Ubuntu kernel now provides the b43 driver , however due to copyright restrictions not the proprietary firmware which is required to run your card .
The following instructions explain how to extract the required firmware .
b43 - Internet access
12.04 ( Precise Pangolin ) - 14.04 ( Trusty Tahr )
Open a Terminal and if you have n't already done so , update your package list :
sudo apt - get update
If you have a b43 card use the command
sudo apt - get install firmware - b43 - installer
or , if you need the b43 legacy driver , use :
sudo apt - get install firmware - b43 legacy - installer
or , ( 12.04 ) if you need a LP - PHY version ( e.g BCM4312 ) , use :
sudo apt - get install firmware - b43 - lpphy - installer
Restart the computer or reload the b43/b43legacy module as outlined in the Switching between drivers section below ( replace b43 with b43 legacy where appropriate ) .
Back to top
b43 - No Internet access
If you do not have any other means of Internet access from Ubuntu , then you will have to download the firmware from another computer with Internet access , from an existing OS on another partition , or before you install Ubuntu .
You will also need the b43 - fwcutter package which is usually included on the install media or can be downloaded from the official online repositories .
Install the b43 - fwcutter package .
This is usually located on the Ubuntu install media under / cdrom / pool / main / b/b43 - fwcutter / or you can download the binary '. deb ' package by following the links on launchpad .
Double click on the package to install or in a Terminal issue the following commands : cd / cdrom / pool / main/b/b43 - fwcutter / sudo dpkg - i b43 - fwcutter *
On a computer with Internet access , download the required firmware file :
b43legacy - http://downloads.openwrt.org/sources/wl_apsta-3.130.20.0.o
b43 ( 12.04 Precise Pangolin ) - http://mirror2.openwrt.org/sources/broadcom-wl-5.10.56.27.3_mipsel.tar.bz2
b43 ( 14.04 Trusty Tahr ) - http://www.lwfinger.com/b43-firmware/broadcom-wl-5.100.138.tar.bz2
For the latest information on what files to download see http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/b43#Other_distributions_not_mentioned_above and http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/b43/developers .
Copy the downloaded file to your home folder .
Open a new Terminal and use b43 - fwcutter to extract and install the firmware :
b43legacy sudo b43 - fwcutter -w /lib/firmware wl_apsta-3.130.20.0.o b43 ( 12.04 Precise Pangolin ) tar xfvj broadcom - wl - 5.10.56.27.3_mipsel.tar.bz2 sudo b43 - fwcutter -w /lib/firmware broadcom-wl-5.10.56.27.3/driver/wl_apsta/wl_prebuilt.o b43 ( 14.04 Trusty Tahr ) tar xfvj broadcom - wl - 5.100.138.tar.bz2 sudo b43 - fwcutter -w /lib/firmware broadcom-wl-5.100.138/linux/wl_apsta.o
Restart the computer or reload the b43/b43legacy module as outlined in the Switching between drivers section below ( replace b43 with b43 legacy where appropriate ) .
Back to top
Switching between drivers
If you card is supported by more than one driver then use the modprobe command to test the drivers .
First unload all conflicting drivers ( this includes removing the driver you 're trying to install ) :
sudo modprobe -r b43 bcma sudo modprobe -r brcmsmac bcma sudo modprobe -r wl
To load a specific driver use one of the following commands :
sudo modprobe b43 sudo modprobe brcmsmac sudo modprobe wl
Allow several seconds for the network manager to scan for available networks before attempting a connection .
After a reboot the system may auto - load a different driver to the one you wanted to use .
Consequently , for permanent use , you may find it necessary to blacklist the driver / module you are not using .
In the command below replace drivername with the driver you want to blacklist :
echo " blacklist drivername " | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-broadcom-wireless.conf
Update the initramfs after any changes to the blacklist files :
sudo update - initramfs -u
Note :
The bcmwl - kernel - source package will automatically blacklist the open source drivers / modules in /etc/ modprobe.d/blacklist-bcm43.conf.

Hand - in - hand with her husband , the mother accused of adultery after picnic passion with lover in a U.S. public park
A married mother charged with adultery after allegedly having sex with a man in a public park , arrived at court yesterday hand - in - hand with her husband .
Suzanne Corona , 41 , faces prosecution under the rarely used law after she was caught with 29 - year - old Justin Amend .
The pair were arrested on suspicion of having sex on a picnic table close to a children 's play area in a park in the small upstate New York town of Batavia .
[ caption ] [ caption ]
They were charged with public lewdness but mother - of - three Corona was hit with an additional charge of adultery because the arresting officer said he knew she was married .
Amend was not charged with adultery because he said he did not know Corona was married .
Under a law enacted during the early 1900s , adultery is a criminal offence punishable by a fine and prison sentence .
The law has rarely been used but remains on the statute books of ten U.S. states .
Section 255.17 of the New York State penal law states : ' A person is guilty of adultery when he engages in sexual intercourse with another person at a time he has a living spouse , or the other person has a living spouse . '
It is now considered a Class B misdemeanour and is punishable by a £ 350 fine and 90 days in jail .
[ caption ]
[ caption ]
Legal experts said Corona was only the 13th person in New York in the past 40 years to be charged with adultery .
Corona and Amend were spotted by police sitting on a picnic table in full view of adults and children in the park .
When officer Matthew Baldwin approached the couple , they insisted they were ' just talking ' .
Corona was fully clothed but Amend 's shirt was off and his trousers were unbuttoned as Corona sat on his lap .
Genesee County District Attorney Lawrence Friedman said : ' It 's quite rare .
I 've been in the office for 28 years and I recall one other time that we prosecuted somebody for adultery . '
Corona was full of apologies after her arrest .
She said she was no longer having sex with her husband , Joe , and had been drunk .
[ caption ] [ caption ]
She said : ' One thing led to another and this is what ended up happening .
' I feel terrible , especially for my family .
It 's an embarrassment for my family .
It just happened .
There was no reason for it .'
Corona denied they were having sex and said they had chosen a picnic table out of the view of others in the park .
She later made a brief appearance at Genesee County Courthouse where she arrived with her husband .
Corona did not enter a plea but instead said she planned to challenge the ' constitutionality ' of the laws making adultery a crime .
In an impromptu press conference afterwards she apologised to mothers while denying that children could see anything , The Batavian newspaper reports .
She also denied a police accusation that Justin Amend had his trousers down .
Both denied that his genitals were exposed and said the whole affair should be a private matter between her and her husband .
Her husband of six years said he planned to stand by his wife and help her fight the adultery charges .
The Batavian newspaper claimed he also said intends to be married to her for ' another 40 years ' .
Researchers have published the largest - existing study on the genetic causes of autism , comparing 996 autistic individuals to 1,287 people without the condition .
Their results , which appear today in Nature , may provide unexplored avenues for treatment research , but also show in new detail the disorder 's sheer genetic complexity .
For example , they have found " private mutations " not shared between people with autism and not inherited from their parents .
According to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , one in 110 children in the United States has autism spectrum disorder , and that the prevalence of autism among eight - year - olds has increased 57 percent from 2002 to 2006 .
There is no known cure , although intensive behavioral therapy helps some kids .
Hilary Coon , Ph.D. , a lead author on the study and research professor of psychiatry at the University of Utah School of Medicine , said while research shows scientists are making progress in understanding the causes of autism , it is increasingly clear that autism is a multifaceted disorder with both genetic and environmental causes .
" We are whittling away at it , " Coon said .
" But a brain - related disorder , such as autism , is amazingly complex .
It 's not really one entity . "
[ University of Utah press release ]
For this study , researchers at the international Autism Genome Project wanted a closer , more detailed picture of the over 100 genes commonly linked to autism .
They looked for rare variants –small deletions or additions to the DNA sequences that make up these genes .
They found that people with autism had a higher number of these variants than those without the disorder , and that some of these DNA differences were not inherited .
That means these DNA changes occurred either in the egg cell , sperm , or in the developing embryo .
" Most individuals that [ sic ] have autism will have their own rare form , " genetically speaking , concludes senior author Stephen Scherer , a geneticist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto , Canada .
That said , the team found that genes deleted in autistic patients tended to perform similar tasks .
Many were involved in aspects of cell proliferation , such as organ formation .
A number participated in development of the central nervous system and others in maintaining the cytoskeleton , which protects the cell and helps it move .
" These are not random hits in the genome " and clearly have some connection to autism , says Jonathan Sebat , a geneticist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York state .
[ Science Now ]
Some believe that looking more closely at these variants may eventually lead to novel treatments .
Two categories of genes were affected more frequently than others : those coding for the neural cell development , and those involved in the signalling or " communication " between cells .
Many of these same genes are thought to play a role in other neuro - development disorders .
There may even be some overlap with conditions such as epilepsy and schizophrenia , the researchers said .
" These and other recent findings have very real potential to lead to the development of novel interventions and treatments for these disorder , " said Louse Gallagher , a professor at Trinity College Dublin , one of the universities in the consortium . [ AFP ]
So what 's the next step towards such treatments ?
For now , it 's more big genetics studies .
The Autism Genome Project has enrolled another 1,500 families and hopes for their next testing phase to look at people 's complete genomes and exomes ( the part of the genome that codes for RNA or protein ) , reportsNature 's blog The Great Beyond .
The study has been hailed as a positive step by researchers , though one can imagine the parents of autistic children still feeling frustrated by the slow pace of progress .
Perhaps to avoid giving false hopes , Dr Gina Gomez de la Cuesta of The National Autistic Society was cautious in her assessment of the study , saying :
" This study furthers our understanding of genetic variation in autism , however there is a great deal more research to be done .
Research into autism is constantly evolving but the exact causes are as yet still unknown .
The difficulty of establishing gene involvement is compounded by the interaction of genes with the environment .
Genetic testing for autism is still a long way off , given that autism is so complex . " [ BBC ]

One of the fastest ways to make women with disabilities seem pathetic and worthless is to erase or ignore their lives .
Why should the Feminist movement celebrate women like Helen Keller , when everyone knows that Keller ’s entire contribution was she learned how to talk – and that was entirely Anne Sullivan ’s work , after all .
This is , of course , completely untrue [ 1 .
Well , not the bit about the water , but that it ’s the sum total of Keller ’s accomplishments ] , but there was a concentrated effort to ensure that Keller ’s accomplishments were ignored .
“ Radical Marxist ” is n’t as nice a story as “ deaf - blind woman overcomes ” .
If you learned about Helen Keller in school at all , you probably learned the same pablum - esque story I did : Keller was a horrible brat of a child who screamed and kicked and was bad .
Then , Anne Sullivan , that angelic woman , came along and , through her virtuous patience , finally got Keller to learn .
She stuck Keller ’s hand under the well water , and spelled “ water ” into her hand .
And suddenly , Keller learned that “ water ” meant this stuff pouring over her hand .
And then many years later she graduated from Radcliff College , and this is why all the students in my class should try their hardest , because look at how much Helen Keller accomplished , The End . [ 1 .
I think I ’ve just described the plot of The Miracle Worker – another reason why I ’m irritated that the show ’s being put on .
Ooh , let ’s perpetuate the idea that Keller ’s life began and ended at that water pump ! ]
This idea of Keller is so pervasive that even books written about Keller in her lifetime – books that she wrote the introduction for – include the same story .
To be vain and quote an essay I wrote last semester :
The only blind person who is given any voice or agency within the work [ Ishbel Ross ’ Journey Into Light : The Story of the Education of the Blind ] is Helen Keller , who wrote the forward for the book , and is presented as “ [ rising ] above her triple handicap to become one of the best - known characters in the modern world . ” …
[ D]espite dedicating a whole chapter to Keller , Ross makes no mention of Keller ’s politics or activism , instead describing Keller ’s grace , “ agelessness ” , and book collection .
No mention of her membership in the Wobblies [ 1 . Industrial Workers of the World .
They ’re still around . ].
I guess that did n’t fit the narrative .
I learned about Helen Keller ’s actual life story by reading the book Lies my Teacher Told Me . [ 1 .
Loewen , James W. Lies my Teacher Told Me : Everything your American History Textbook Got Wrong , New York : Touchstone , 1995 . ]
It ’s a book that ’s a bit hard for me to evaluate properly because I went to school in Canada and it ’s focused on American education and teaching .
The section Keller appears in ( cleverly titled “ handicapped by history ” ) talks about hero - building and erasing things that add complications in our respected leaders .
About Keller , Loewen writes :
Keller ’s commitment to socialism stemmed from her experience as a disabled person and from her sympathy for others with handicaps .
She began by working to simplify the alphabet for the blind , but soon came to realize that to deal solely with blindness was to treat symptom , not cause .
Through research she learned that blindness was not distributed randomly throughout the population but was concentrated in the lower class .
Men who were poor might be blinded in industrial accidents or by inadequate medical care ; poor women who became prostitutes faced the additional danger of syphilitic blindness .
Thus Keller learned how the social class system controls people ’s opportunities in life , sometimes determining even whether they can see .
Keller ’s research was not just book - learning : “ I have visited sweatshops , factories , crowded slums .
If I could not see it , I could smell it . ”
At the time Keller became a socialist , she was one of the most famous women on the planet .
She soon became the most notorious .
Her conversion to socialism caused a new storm of publicity – this time outraged .
Newspapers that had extolled her courage and intelligence now emphasized her handicap .
Columnists charged that she had no independent sensory input , and was in thrall to those who fed her information .
Typical was the editor of the Brooklyn Eagle , who wrote that Keller ’s “ mistakes spring out of the manifest limitation of her development . ”
Keller recalled having met the editor : “ At that time the compliments he paid me were so generous that I blush to remember them .
But now that I
Have come out for socialism he reminds me and the public that I am blind and deaf and especially liable to error .
I must have shrunk in intelligence during the years since I met him ”
She went on : “ On , ridiculous Brooklyn Eagle !
Socially blind and deaf , it defends an intolerable system , a system that is the cause of much of the physical blindness and deafness which we are trying to prevent . ” [ 1 .
LMTTM , 22-23 ]
Among other things , Keller helped found the American Civil Liberties Union , donated money to the NAACP , supported birth control , was part of the women ’s suffrage movement , and spent time in Halifax . [ 1 .
What ?
I like my city !
She spoke at the closing ceremonies of the Nova Scotia School of the Deaf and Dumb .
I ’ve read her letters to the principal .
I get kinda wibbly .
Helen Keller was here ! ]
When we talk about Women ’s History – and I understand Women ’s History month is in March in the US [ 1 .
It ’s October in Canada . ] , so that ’s not too long from now – we are doing something wrong if we do not include the lives of women with disabilities .
Helen Keller is n’t the only woman with disabilities who has been ignored , erased , or sanitized for public consumption – it happens over and over , to queer women , to women of colour , to women who are ‘ marked ’ as ‘ not- mainstream ’ .
I think we can do better than this .
I think we ’re brave enough to not only confront that important women of our past participated in and encouraged others to participate in abuse , neglect , genocide of certain groups of women , but also brave enough to celebrate histories outside the mainstream .
I came across this picture while going through some older Venger folders .
This cool pic was created by John West , the colorist for the first issues of .
He wanted to throw together a quick piece that would have Black Mercy and the new Venger in it .
I do love what he came up with .
As to the Venger series well work is still going on issue 3 and the Venger Special .
I 've been revising scripts while the art teams are doing their thing .
I 've also been trying to outline a few more stories featuring other members of the cast .
Hopefully I 'll finish them and have more info on creative teams soon .

Hello , NG !
This game was made in three days to warm myself up to programming and game development again after my 5 month break from flash .
I wanted to get proficient at programming again so that I would be good to make [ Visible ] III .
Well , it served its purpose , now I hope you enjoy some puzzley goodness .
Note :
The loading problems this experienced during the initial launch are fixed .
Sorry about that .
Goddammit Brian Herbert .
How did you publish this without my knowledge ?
Why the fuck are you writing these ?
No one gives a shit what happened between Dune Messiah and Children of Dune .
One of the reasons the Dune series is so awesome is that it ’s about fate , destiny , the timelessness and steadfastness of the universe .
The time skip between each novel ( look at the jump between Children of Dune and God Emperor of Dune ! ) is meant to illustrate and emphasize these qualities .
By trying to fill in the gaps between the novels , you are minimizing the lore , mystery , and impact of each of your father ’s books .
You know what , though , I think that if your books were well written , I would n’t mind .
I would just make the derp face and keep reading despite the fact that I think some gaps are better left unfilled .
But your books are not well written !
An example I ’ve blogged about before :
“ Inside [ Sheeana ’s ] head , the fascinating and ancient voice of Serena Butler once again bubbled up from deep within her Other Memories .
Sheeana carried on her conversation aloud .
" Tell me one thing : How can Serena Butler be among my ancestors ? ”
If you dig deep enough , I am there .
Ancestor after ancestor , generation after generation …
Sheeana was not so easily convinced .
“ But Serena Butler ’s only child was murdered by thinking machines .
That was the trigger of the Jihad .
You had no heirs , no other descendants .
How can you be in my Other Memories , regardless of how far back I go ? ”
She looked up at the strange forms of the sandworms , as if the martyred woman ’s face might be there .
Because , Serena said , I am .
The ancient voice said no more , and Sheeana knew she would get no better answer . “
- Hunters of Dune , 278- 279 ( Herbert , Anderson )
Do you expect me to read this and say , " Oh , you ’re right , that makes sense .
That explains a lot ? ”
It ’s not even like you explain it later , you NEVER address this again !
BECAUSE I AM ???
That ’s not an argument you put in a book that ’s about to be published !
That ’s an argument you use on a playground .
In second grade .
When you ’re asked to justify your self - proclaimed statement that you are awesome .
“ Because I am ! ”
Your writing is not worth paying for .
Trust me , when I heard that Frank Herbert ’s son had found a treasure chest filled with his father ’s notes on the Dune series and would be tying up the loose ends left at the end of Chapterhouse : Dune , I was overjoyed !
“ Who the fuck are those old people at the end ?
What ’s going to happen between the Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres ?
How does Murbella and Duncan ’s relationship turn out ?
How much more fucking ass does Miles Teg kick ” , asked I at 14 years of age .
Finally !
I would receive an answer to these questions .
But then I read your prequels to Dune , your so - called “ Legacy of Dune ” and “ Prelude to Dune ” trilogies .
After reading them , I thought , “ Perhaps Brian Herbert is not the best representative to write the ending to one of the best and most enduring Sci - Fi classics of all time . ”
I was absolutely correct .
The answers you gave me to the questions that I had were poorly thought out , rushed , implausible , and quite simply ridiculous .
Furthermore , your books are RIDDLED with inconsistencies .
Even fan fiction writers pay more close attention to the works that they write about than you did to your father ’s lasting legacy .
Also , you use Deus ex machina not as a last resort to any given problem , but as a commonly occurring plot element .
Speaking of fan fiction , let me read to you the words in the jacket of Paul of Dune :
“ Dune , Frank Herbert ’s classic , ended with Paul Muad ' Dib in control of the planet Dune .
Herbert ’s second Dune book , Dune Messiah , picks up the story several years later when Paul ’s armies have conquered the galacy and Paul has become a religious figure .
But what happened between Dune and Dune Messiah ? ” ( Emphasis added )
That is straight up fucking fan fiction !
The title of a Harry Potter fan fiction that I found off of Google : “ What Happened Between Those 19 Years ? ”
This story is an account of what may have happened between the last chapter of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and the epilogue of the same book .
My point is that the premise and idea behind the two works is the same .
In your latest demonspawn , The Winds of Dune , you describe “ What happened after Paul Muad ' Dib walked into the desert at the end of Dune Messiah ? ” I ’m assuming that you talk about how Jessica and Irulan find out about how Paul Atreides , the Kwisatz Haderach , used his prescient abilities , risking his name and reputation , in order to set in motion the Golden Path .
The path that he could not follow but that he entrusted to his newly born son , Leto the Second .
They also probably find out that all the evil that was done in Paul ’s name and the tarnishing of his reputation was worth it for the survival of the human race .
“ But wait , ” some might say , “ You have n’t even read the book , how could you possibly know what it ’s about ? ”
How , you ask ?
Well because I read a bit of the jacket cover AND BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT FRANK HERBERT SAID FUCKING HAPPENS AFTER PAUL ATREIDES WALKS INTO THE DESERT IN CHILDREN OF DUNE and GOD EMPEROR OF DUNE .
You ’re adding nothing to the series , Brian Herbert .
You are simply creating side quests and side characters that we , as fans of Dune , care nothing about .
You have n’t revealed anything really original in your novels .
The only surprising thing that you published was probably the fact that what the Honored Matres were running from was a revived Machine empire , but even that was n’t your idea .
It was your father ’s .
In his notes .
You are a mediocre writer at best , writing fan fiction and capitalizing off your father ’s success , thinking that you have some legitimacy for writing these novels because you are the great Frank Herbert ’s son .
Another point that I would like to make is this :
You have been pumping out novels pretty much non -stop since 1999 .
A book ( sometimes multiple books ) per year .
Now , I appreciate hard work and I applaud your ability to get things done , but let me offer a point in contrast .
Your father , Frank Herbert spent about 3 - 6 years ( 9 years for Children of Dune ) planning out each of his novels .
This ensured that he had the right wording , the right character development , and great thematic ( religion , politics , natural resources , loyalty , betrayal , etc etc. ) plot development to fit his imagination and great vision that he had of the Dune universe .
The result was a rich , dense , full environment .
We laud JRR Tolkien ’s Lord of the Rings and Bioware ’s Mass Effect for environments such as these .
You on the other hand , have been pumping out books each year for the sake of pumping out books .
This seems to indicate to me that you are simply ( as I mentioned before ) milking your father ’s success and collecting the cash from it .
Finally , one thing that I have been reluctant to mention is that I also see Kevin J. Anderson ’s name next to your name .
Now Kevin J. Anderson is an author I used to respect .
I read his Star Wars Expanded Universe works , namely the Jedi Academy trilogy , when I was younger and I loved them .
I loved Kyp Durron , Admiral Daala and the novel Sun Crusher .
I wanted to read more about this period of time , so I went on to read the “ parallel novel ” I , Jedi by Michael A. Stackpole and loved that too .
So much that whenever I played any game from then on , I named my player profile Corran Horn .
Now I fear that my young age and immaturity had clouded my judgment on your works and that perhaps your books were actually trash .
I ’ll have to re-read those books .
So anyways , my main point is :
Please stop ruining Dune , Brian Herbert .
Get your fucking hands off it and send someone else your father ’s notes .
Then we can have a gigantic book burning and pretend your books never happened and a qualified author who takes his or her time with it can write the real ending to Dune .
P.S. I will be checking out your books Paul of Dune and The Winds of Dune ( no way am I paying for that shit ) from the library today .
I will be sure to write a followup post ridiculing these works further .
Less than seven months after staging its first hockey game , Fenway Park will host its first soccer match since 1968 on July 21 when a Scottish club team takes on a Portuguese team in an exhibition .
The Celtic Football Club will take on the Portuguese Sporting Clube de Portugal at 8 p.m. ET on July 21 -- 10 days after the end of the upcoming World Cup -- while the Red Sox are on the West Coast .
" I 'm excited to welcome Celtic F.C. and Sporting C.P. to Boston for their exhibition soccer match at Fenway Park , " Boston Mayor Thomas Menino said via a press release .
" Soccer is a global game and this match will provide another opportunity to showcase Boston as a truly global city attracting fans from around the world and highlighting the people , culture , and local businesses that make our city so special .
Both teams have many loyal supporters throughout our city and I look forward to this matchup with great anticipation . "
Tickets , which will range from $ 20 - $ 120 , will go on sale at noon on June 22 .
The game will be broadcast live on NESN .
On Jan. 1 , Fenway hosted its first hockey game as the Bruins beat the Flyers in the NHL's Winter Classic .
The match will be the 19th soccer game played at Fenway Park .
The last one came on July 9 , 1968 when the Boston Beacons faced soccer legend Pele and his Brazilian club , Santos F.C .
Netzpolitik zum Staunen Silvio Duwe
Diskussionsrunde im Technikmuseum zu den Internetthesen des Bundesinnenministers .
Bild : S. Duwe
Innenminister de Maizière wünscht sich in seiner Grundsatzrede ein vergessliches Internet und stellt sich hinter die Vorratsdatenspeicherung
Wenn sich Politiker aus der Union , zumal Innenminister , zum Internet äußern , fällt regelmäßig der Satz , das Internet dürfe kein " rechtsfreier Raum " sein .
Innenminister Thomas de Maizière hebt sich in diesem Punkt wohltuend von vielen seiner Kabinettskollegen ab .
In seiner Rede zu einer " gemeinsamen Netzpolitik der Zukunft " betonte de Maizière vielmehr , dass eine Politik , die das Internet ausschließlich als Sicherheitsrisiko betrachte und in erster Linie Misstrauen gegen den Bürger hege , nicht der Ausgangspunkt staatlichen Handelns sein könne .
Wer sich angesichts dieser Tonart Hoffnungen auf einen Verzicht auf die umstrittene Vorratsdatenspeicherung oder gar eine wirklich moderne Netzpolitik erhofft , wird allerdings enttäuscht .
Thomas de Maizière stellt seine Thesen zum Internet vor .
Bild : S. Duwe
Wer Thomas de Maizière reden hört , könnte ihn fast schon für einen Liberalen im besten Sinne halten .
Gleich zu Beginn seiner Rede betont der Innenminister , welche Werte ihm nicht nur in der Gesellschaft , sondern auch im Internet wichtig sind : Freiheit , Selbstbestimmung und Eigenverantwortung sind seine Prinzipien .
Auch die Freiheit , Dummheiten zu begehen , gehöre ausdrücklich mit dazu – solange dadurch kein Dritter Schaden nimmt .
Als " Ellenbogenfreiheit " will de Maizière dies ausdrücklich nicht verstanden wissen – er weiß jedoch auch , dass " Respekt und Rücksichtnahme " nicht staatlich angeordnet werden können .
Vorratsdatenspeicherung notwendig
Doch , obwohl er das Recht auf informationelle Selbstbestimmung " als klassisches Abwehrrecht gegen den Staat " auch im Internet anerkennt , betont er die Notwendigkeit der 2007 von der Justizministerin Brigitte Zypries ( SPD ) auf den Weg gebrachten Vorratsdatenspeicherung .
Und da hört der liberale Geist seiner Rede auch schon auf - eine schrankenlose Anonymität könne es im Internet nicht geben , so de Maizière , denn " für Raubritter und echte Piraten wären das paradiesische Zustände " .
Da sich niemand wünsche , auf hoher See unerkannt flüchtenden Piraten zu begegnen , brauche es eine " vernünftige Balance zwischen Anonymität und Identifizierbarkeit " .
Die Anforderungen für die Identifizierung mittels der gespeicherten Daten müssten jedoch verhältnismäßig sein .
Maßstäbe dafür seien die Frage danach , welche Grundrechte betroffen seien , ob der Betroffene sich im " privaten , sozialen oder öffentlichen " Bereich des Netzes bewegt und ob er einen Anlass für die Identifizierung gegeben hat .
Vorrang für Selbstregulierung vor neuer Rechtsetzung
Das Urteil des Bundesverfassungsgerichtes vom März diesen Jahres ( siehe : Kein Fest für Filesharingfreunde und Sieg oder Niederlage ? ) , in welchem die Hürden für die Nutzung der Vorratsdaten erhöht wurden , kritisierte der Innenminister .
Das Gericht begründete seine Entscheidung unter anderem damit , dass eine anlasslose Speicherung von Verkehrsdaten ein " diffus bedrohliches Gefühl des Beobachtetseins " hervorrufe .
De Maizière will sich aber in seinen Entscheidungen nicht auf solche diffus bedrohlichen Gefühlen orientieren , sondern an Fakten .
Würden bestimmte Delikte nicht mehr bekämpft werden , weil sie nur noch online statt offline stattfänden , fürchtet der Innenminister das Vertrauen in Staat und Netz gleichermaßen schwinden .
Trotzdem sieht de Maizière viele Vorgänge im Netz bereits durch bestehendes Recht ausreichend geregelt .
Zudem habe Selbstregulierung Vorrang vor neuer Rechtsetzung .
Erst wenn existierende Gesetze und Selbstregulierungskräfte nicht mehr greifen , will de Maizière neue Gesetze einführen .
Diese sollten jedoch " technikneutral " gestaltet werden , damit die Rechtsordnung nicht wegen jeder technischen Neuerung geändert werden müsse .
Dass die Gesetze der Technik hinterherhinken , empfindet der Minister dabei durchaus positiv : Hätte der Gesetzgeber 1835 auf jene Ärzte gehört , die vor Geschwindigkeiten jenseits von 40 km/h gewarnt haben , stünden wir heute vielleicht nicht " in diesem schönen Lokschuppen , sondern auf einem Ponyhof " , so de Maizière bei seiner Rede im Deutschen Technikmuseum .
Den Ansatz des Gesetzes zu Googles Street View hält er daher für falsch .

An eigenen Vorschlägen bringt der Innenminister einen " digitalen Radiergummi " und ein Verfallsdatum für Daten ins Gespräch , um dem Netz künftig " in bestimmten Bereichen das Vergessen oder zumindest das Nichtwiederfinden beizubringen " .
Weiterhin sprach sich de Maizière für ein " privates Darstellungsrecht " , ähnlich dem vom Presserecht bekannten " Recht auf Gegendarstellung " aus .
Damit solle sich jeder wehren können , über den etwas Falsches oder Ehrenrühriges im Internet kursiert .
Verbunden werden soll dies nach der Vorstellung des Ministers mit einem Anspruch des Betroffenen gegenüber Suchmaschinenbetreibern , die eigene Darstellung auf Platz eins der Trefferliste zu setzen .
Wie dies konkret umgesetzt werden soll , verriet de Maizière allerdings nicht .
" Digitale Rücksichtnahme "
Eher durchsetzbar dürfte hingegen die Idee sein , Diensteanbietern " rücksichtsvolle Grundeinstellungen " vorzuschreiben .
Anbieter , die ihre Kunden durch Voreinstellungen dazu verleiten , Daten über Dritte preiszugeben , müssten dann selbst ein gewisses Haftungsrisiko tragen .
Auch hier wird de Maizière jedoch nicht wirklich konkret .
Die Verantwortung für eine " digitale Rücksichtnahme " verteilt sich nach Ansicht des Innenministers ohnehin auf Nutzer wie Diensteanbieter gleichermaßen .
Die Nutzer müssten " von Kindesbeinen an " lernen , dass ihre Entfaltung im Netz auch in die Freiheit anderer greifen könne .
" Klatsch und Tratsch " auch über nicht anwesende Dritte über Dritte sei jedoch " zumindest im persönlichen und familiären Bereich " als Ausübung grundsätzlicher Freiheit zu sehen .
Peter Schaar , der Beauftragte für den Datenschutz und die Informationsfreiheit , wirkt skseptisch .

" Gefahrgeneigte Dienste " und Sicherstellung des Angebots bei Naturkatastrophen
Neben der Verpflichtung der von Anbietern " gefahrgeneigter Dienste " , zu denen de Maizière nicht nur Internetprovider , sondern auch private WLAN - Betreiber zählt , ihre Dienste so abzusichern , dass über sie beispielsweise keine Viren verbreitet oder unbefugt genutzt werden , sieht der Minister jedoch auch eine Pflicht des Staates , den Netzzugang sicherzustellen .
Es sei zu klären , ob es eines Gesetzes bedarf , welches die ausreichende Versorgung mit Internet auch im Falle von Naturkatastrophen oder im Verteidigungsfall sicherstelle , wie dies bereits für Post - und Telekommunikationsdienstleistungen gelte .
Zudem müsse der Staat die Online - Angebote der Behörden weiter ausbauen .
Dabei soll besonderes auf jene Dienste ein Augenmerk gelegt werden , welche besonders häufig nachgefragt werden oder wo ein besonderes Einsparpotential besteht .
Beispielhaft nannte de Maizière hier die Kfz - Zulassung oder den Bafög - Antrag .
Diese Angebote sollten jedoch auf längere Sicht den bisherigen Behördenkontakt nicht vollständig ersetzen .
" Zeit des Staunens über das Internet vorbei "
Minister de Maizière beendete seine Rede mit den Worten , dass die Zeit des Staunens über das Internet nun vorbei sei .
Auch die Opposition ist wenig erstaunt – allerdings über die Rede : " Sie war so unkonkret , weichgespült und beliebig wie erwartet " , erklärte Halina Wawzyniak ( Linke ) .
Sie hätte sich ein umfassendes Bekenntnis zur Netzneutralität gewünscht .
Malte Spitz ( Grüne ) vermutet , der Minister wolle " unter dem Deckmantel der Datensicherheit [ … ] mehr Kontrollen und Überwachungspflichten aufbauen " .
Klarere Worte zu Netzneutralität und Anonymität im Internet hat auch Jimmy Schulz ( FDP ) vermisst .
Jedoch lobte er de Maizière auch für sein Bekenntnis zu Eigenverantwortung und Selbstbestimmung und sein Versprechen , die Online - Angebote von Behörden weiterzuentwickeln .
Seine Ideen hat der Minister in 14 Thesen zusammengefasst , die einen Monat lang von den Internetnutzern bewertet und um eigene Ideen erweitert werden sollen .

Is our universe housed in a black hole ?
Or did it exist before the Big Bang ?
If so , we could solve the mystery of dark energy — surprisingly , it ’s all down to the humble neutrino .

A black hole , according to Juan Maldacena , can be described by the 2 - D event horizon surrounding it , every bit of information , spin , charge , etc , is mapped onto the horizon with one bit corresponding to one planck area of the event horizon .
What this means is as a black hole consumes matter or energy , that information is added to the area of the event horizon , and because the event horizon is 2-d , and because the interior of a black hole is volume , as the size of a black hole grows , the density ...

The balloon inside balloon theory of matter and antimatter universes on opposite entropy path published in year 2003 has actually predicted that the outer antimatter universe is turning into a black hole gradually due to opposite entropy path .
As such our universe is inside a black hole which is turning into a black hole .
See the attached paper .

Your mission , should you choose to accept it , is to go undercover as a neutrino and investigate whether these elusive particles are driving dark energy and if they put thein the Big Bang .
The operation could take you to a universe inside a black hole , and lead you to investigate whether time stretched before the big bang .
Let ’s start with a little bit more about your assumed identity as a neutrino .
Your mother was a proton who met up with three other protons deep inside a star .
There was some nuclear fusion , she transformed herself into a neutron , and you popped out .
You did n’t stick around very long , though .
You have no charge and almost no mass , so you barely interact with the other particles , zipping through space , stars , and planets almost as if they are n’t even there .
So far , that ’s the standard life story of a neutrino .
But Stephon Alexander , a physicist at Haverford College , Pennsylvania , is shaking up that formulaic plot .
What if , he ponders , time and our universe existed before the Big Bang ?
What if this prior version of the cosmos contracted down to a finite size , bounced , and started to expand outwards again ?
In that case , neutrinos , usually dismissed as being a ghostly particles with little tangible influence , could have had an extremely profound effect on the cosmos .
Picture yourself as a neutrino in such a contracting universe , wedged against other neutrinos like so many subatomic sardines , one hundred of you crowding every cubic centimeter of space .
Under such circumstances , you and your comrades could form a new state of matter called a , Alexander hypothesizes .
This would act something like a superfluid — a fluid that does n’t lose energy to friction .
( If you stirred some superfluid creamer into your superfluid coffee , it would just keep swirling around the mug , never settling down . )
It ’s a nice plot twist , but what does it have to do with the universe that we see around us ?
The answer is that a compressed neutrino condensate could produce some very familiar effects that as yet have no explanation .
Energy from the condensed neutrinos would set the universe expanding — fast .
Cosmologists already believe that soon after the Big Bang , the universe went through a short period of rapid expansion , known as " inflation , " but they have not been able to figure out why it occurred .
Now , with the help of a $ 65,000 grant from FQXi and colleagues at Penn State University and Haverford , Alexander is investigating whether the humble neutrino holds the key .
A bouncing universe is only one possibility for how a neutrino condensate might form .
Another is based on the notion that a collapsing star could squeeze neutrinos into a condensate , on its way to becoming a black hole .
In that case , our universe might actually have formed in the neutrino soup housed inside a black hole .
A universe in a black hole may seem like an outlandish idea , but if correct , we still live within a neutrino condensate , which could be causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate .
Astronomers have observed such an acceleration , and usually attribute it to some mysterious “ dark energy .
” A strange parallel between neutrinos and dark energy gives Alexander a hint that he ’s on the right trail .
Neutrinos come in three , and they are able to flip , or oscillate , between them .
Think of the neutrino as the ultimate dish of Neapolitan ice cream , which spontaneously transforms from vanilla to strawberry to chocolate and back again .
Surprisingly , the frequency at which neutrinos flip from one flavor to the next seems to be linked to the density of dark energy in our universe .
" This is very surprising , " says Alexander .
" Two different types of physics that should have nothing to do with each other " appear to be built on the same bedrock .
Yet physicists still do not understand why neutrinos oscillate .
Could it be that the flavor - flipping is the direct result of traveling through a neutrino condensate ?
" A neutrino moves in that medium like a boat moving in water , " explains Alexander .
Perhaps neutrino oscillation is like that boat bouncing on the waves .
Philip Phillips at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , an expert on what happens when exotic materials are squeezed down into new states of matter , finds the idea " truly novel . "
" Alexander has combined ideas from my field of condensed matter and put them to use in his own , " he says .
While condensed matter physicists have produced examples of superfluids and condensates of other types of exotic matter , Alexander ’s neutrino condensate cannot be cooked up in the lab because neutrinos are too slippery to capture and bundle together .
But Alexander hopes to make testable predictions based on his theory that link the characteristics of neutrinos to the observed properties of dark energy .
" We can use the universe as a laboratory to test particle physics , " he says .
Lee Smolin , a theoretical physicist at the Perimeter Institute in Ontario , is a fan of Alexander ’s original thinking .
" He has a very fertile creativity combined with an independence of mind , " he says .
So will neutrino condensation turn out to be the right answer to these cosmic riddles ?
Perhaps .
As Smolin puts it , " We do n’t know if it is true , but it is something that , so far as we know , might be true . "

Do n't mention the mockingbird !
The reclusive novelist who wrote the classic novel that mesmerised 40 million readers
In the 50 years since Harper Lee published her classic novel that mesmerised 40 million readers , she has barely written another word – and turned into an almost total recluse .
So when her friends agreed to give our reporter an introduction , it was on one strict condition ... Do n’t mention the Mockingbird
Despite the thick , black sunglasses , there is something familiar about the frail 84 - year - old woman as she is helped falteringly towards the lake shore .
A delighted smile flickers across her face as ducks and Canada geese flock round to feed on the scraps of bread brought from the care home where she lives in a modest apartment .
Unhappy :
The reclusive Harper Lee with child actress Mary Badham , who played Scout in the film of Mockingbird
Dressed in a clean but faded T - shirt and loosely fitting gingham slacks , she attracts barely a glance from passers - by .
Yet hers is the face which has stared from the cover of a book that has hypnotised more than 40 million readers around the world , one that has frequently been rated as one of the ten most important books published in the past century .
She is Harper Lee , whose only book , To Kill A Mockingbird , won the Pulitzer Prize , is translated into nearly 50 languages and was turned into the Oscar - winning 1962 film starring Gregory Peck .
It also made Harper into a multi-millionairess .
To kill a mockingbird has been rated as one of the ten most important books published in the past century
Nervously , I approach the novelist , carrying the best box of chocolates I could find in the small Alabama town of Monroeville , a Hershey ’s selection costing a few dollars .
I start to apologise that I had n’t brought more but a beaming Nelle – as her friends and family call her – extends her hand .
‘ Thank you so much , ’ she told me .
‘ You are most kind .
We ’re just going to feed the ducks but call me the next time you are here .
We have a lot of history here .
You will enjoy it . ’
It was the most fleeting of conversations , but that is hardly surprising .
Harper has said precious little in public since the publication of Mockingbird 50 years ago next month .
She has written nothing else since , save a few short stories in the early Sixties .
Yet on the July 11 anniversary , thousands of Mockingbird Groupies , as her fans are called , will converge on Monroeville for a three - day festival in celebration of her work .
No one expects Harper to give a welcoming address .
Indeed , she has spent the past five decades living in almost total seclusion .
Even when she travelled to the White House to receive an award from President George W. Bush three years ago , she did so under the strict condition that she would answer no questions and make no acceptance speech .
Nobody knows what she does with her wealth .
Her friends say material goods are unimportant to her and that if she gives to charity , she does so anonymously .
Secretive : Harper Lee in Monroeville , where she refuses to discuss her famous novel
For much of the past 50 years , she has shunned the formality and racism of her native Alabama to make her home in a tiny flat on Manhattan ’s Upper East Side .
Only now , towards the end of her days , has Harper returned to live in a sheltered housing complex in her childhood home town of Monroeville .
I went to Alabama in an attempt to answer the great mystery of why she – like that other American literary legend J. D. Salinger , who died in January – should have spent almost half a century in silence .
Why did Harper Lee , like J.D. Salinger choose to spend almost half a century in silence ?
Her friends agree to introduce me to her on one condition : that I make no mention of ‘ The Book ’ , as people here refer to it .
Based on a few gnomic utterances over the years , many literary commentators have attributed Harper ’s solitary life and subsequent failure to publish another book to her alarm at the tidal wave of praise for her Mockingbird , in which the racial bigotry of the South is witnessed through the eyes of a little girl , Scout .
Others have suggested that perhaps she only had one great book in her , and that she knew that every subsequent attempt would be regarded as a disappointment .
But according to confidants , many of whom have known her since childhood , what Harper has really found a burden is her enduring sadness about the book ’s underlying themes .
They say that while To Kill A Mockingbird is ostensibly a courtroom thriller – in which Scout ’s compassionate and principled lawyer father Atticus Finch defends a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman – Harper drew on deeply painful family secrets to create her protagonists .
Oscar - winning : Gregory Peck as Atticus with co-star Brock Peters in the film of ' To kill a mockingbird '
Furthermore , her liberal views on race were extremely unpopular in her native Deep South .
Indeed many in her own family were unhappy with the tone of her book .
‘ I ’m not a psychologist , but there ’s a lot of Nelle in that book , ’ said 87 - year - old George Thomas Jones , a retired businessman who has known Harper and her family since she was a girl .
‘ People say the publicity the book got turned her into a recluse but publicity did n’t ruin her life : I do n’t think Nelle ’s ever been a real happy person . ’
Mr Jones said that Harper ’s father Amasa Coleman Lee , a former newspaper editor , lawyer and state senator who was clearly the model for Atticus Finch , was ‘ a real genteel man , who listened more than he talked . . . but he sure did n’t show much affection .
' I used to caddy for him on the local golf course .
He was so formal that he would wear a heavy three - piece suit , shirt , tie and stout shoes to play golf , even in the heat of the summer . ’
In an episode that foreshadows the compassionate and fiercely moral hero Atticus , played by Gregory Peck in the movie , Harper ’s father had defended two black men charged with murder in a celebrated case in 1919 .
After they were convicted and hanged , he never practised again .
But unlike the fictional Finch , Mr Lee was a staunch segregationist who supported the harsh ‘ Jim Crow ’ laws of the American South .
Harper Lee 's book has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide
In the novel , Scout lives in fear of a ‘ malevolent phantom ’ , a psychologically disturbed neighbour called Boo Radley , who ultimately saves her life .
While it is clear that the character is in part based on a reclusive neighbour , in reality , it was Harper ’s mother Frances who was the source of much terror and unhappiness .
Suffering from depression and violent mood swings , friends in the close - knit Alabama town say that Frances allegedly twice tried to drown her daughter in the bath .
As a result , perhaps , the young Harper was regarded as a difficult and aggressive child who would think nothing of punching other children who annoyed her .
‘ When you passed by the Lee house , Mrs Lee would be sitting in a swing with just a stone face , ’ said Mr Jones , ‘ looking dead ahead , emotionless . ’
Other neighbours recalled she would sometimes shout nonsensical invective at passers - by .
Mr Jones added : ‘ Nelle always seemed to be on the defensive when she was a little girl .
The book did n’t make matters any better .
People here recognised it was based on her life .
' My late wife was her golfing partner and she knew never to ask her about it .
It ’s not just something she did n’t want to talk about – it ’s a subject you would n’t want to touch with a ten - foot pole .
‘ I do n’t think Nelle is lonely , necessarily .
This is just the life she has chosen to lead .
She could afford a lot better , but maybe this is what makes her feel safe after a life starved of affection . ’
‘ She touched the hearts of readers but I do n’t think she knew much about her own heart . ’
Harper ’s biographer , the American academic Charles Shields , said that her mother Frances was descended from slave - owners who had farmed cotton around Monroeville , where they built a stately plantation house .
In her younger days , Frances was considered a brilliant pianist , but by the time Harper was born in 1926 , she seemed to have lost all interest in life due to depression .
Harper ’s older sister , Alice – who , remarkably at 98 , still practises law in an office above a Monroeville bank – said : ‘ My mother was a highly nervous person but it was no problem .
There was nothing abnormal . ’
Alice is still close to Harper and helps handle her financial affairs .
I asked whether her sister ever regretted writing the book .
‘ I do n’t think she has any regrets , ’ Alice replied with a frown .
‘ But we talk about the book only in relation to business . ’
The young Harper once dreamed of becoming a lawyer like both her father and sister .
But she was diverted from that path by her lifelong friendship with Truman Capote , the author of Breakfast At Tiffany ’s and In Cold Blood , who was a childhood neighbour much like Dill , Scout ’s best friend in Mockingbird .
The young Capote had already begun to work on stories .
‘ I convinced [ Harper ] she ought to write too , ’ he said later .
‘ She did n’t really want to but I held her to it . ’
Writing did not come easily to Harper .
Sometimes she would labour for a dozen hours before finishing a single page .
But it was her only life .
Her mannish haircuts and hatred of make - up led to speculation that she was a lesbian .
However , Mr Shields believes she was just shy and , like Charlotte Bronte , had an unrequited crush on a married man , her literary agent Maurice Crain .
She wrote short stories about racial prejudice in college and moved to New York in the mid-Fifties .
There she rented a cheap apartment and attempted to earn enough money to write by working as a reservation clerk with the BOAC airline .
To Kill A Mockingbird began its existence as a series of anecdotes drawn from her childhood .
However , Harper was either so naive or so traumatised that she seems to have failed to recognise its semi-autobiographical nature until after it was published .
Writing did not come easily to Harper .
Sometimes she would labour for a dozen hours before finishing a single page .
But it was her only life .
Mr Shields said : ‘ She touched the hearts of readers but I do n’t think she knew much about her own heart . ’
In Monroeville , there was sharp criticism as the book became a bestseller .
‘ People recognised people they knew in the book .
She got hate mail , ’ said Mr Shields .
The critics included her other sister , Louise .
‘ She felt it was too much dirty laundry , ’ added Mr Shields .
Initially , there was talk of more books .
Harper assured her agent in the early Sixties that she had started a new novel with the working title The Long Goodbye .
It never appeared .
According to Alice , the reason is that the manuscript was stolen by a ‘ burglar ’ .
Others , however , claim that by the mid-Sixties , Harper was drinking , some would say excessively .
Mr Shields said : ‘ I think she drank to overcome her shyness and because her support group , small to begin with , had eroded .
Maurice Crain was dying of cancer .
Truman Capote had drifted off into a sea of alcohol and drugs , while her editor Tay Hohoff , who had spent two - and - a - half years working with her on Mockingbird , had died suddenly .
Early in her career , the military academy West Point , the American equivalent of Sandhurst , dispatched two officers to meet Harper in the hope of persuading her to address cadets .
One of the pair , Brigadier Jack Capps , said last week : ‘ It was mid-morning when we arrived at her little apartment and she said , “ Would you like a drink ? ’’ and she mixed a martini and then she said , ‘‘ Let ’s go to lunch . ’’
She had another Martini before lunch and she agreed to speak . ’
A friend of Harper ’s said : ‘ Nelle was not an alcoholic but she enjoyed a drink .
She did n’t flaunt it but Monroeville is Bible Belt and her sister , Alice , did not approve .
Nelle finally gave it up when her health began to fail .
She decided to move back to Monroeville only after she had suffered a stroke about five years ago . ’
She initially moved in with Alice , but now lives in sheltered accommodation after suffering further health problems .
Despite her illness , or perhaps because of it , she seems finally at peace with herself .
But ‘ The Book ’ is still taboo .
Harper Lee is credited by many with playing a big part in a sea-change in attitudes in the Deep South – not least in Monroeville .
However , even today the old prejudices refuse to die .
‘ We have wonderful coloured help , ’ one contemporary of Harper told me as three black maids bustled around his mansion .
I also learned that many white children are still being educated at private ‘ segregation academies ’ set up after the federal government enforced the integration of state schools .
At next month ’s 50th Anniversary Celebration Weekend , however , black and white youngsters will stand side - by - side for a marathon reading of the book .
Harper has been invited to join them , but friends say , even now , hearing the words of Scout and Atticus read out loud will bring back too many painful memories .
Rather than confront the ghosts of her past yet again , Harper plans to spend the anniversary in her apartment .
There , with her desk , her computer and her comfortable armchair , she can muse on the great changes that she has helped to bring to the South , on her timeless novel and on the childhood trauma that shaped it .

TORONTO –
The leaders of the world ’s eight top industrial democracies on Saturday welcomed Israel ’s decision to ease the blockade on the Gaza Strip but called the current tensions in the Hamas - controlled territory “ not sustainable .
” The countries – the US , Britain , France , Germany , Italy , Canada , Japan and Russia – said in a joint statement that “ current arrangements are not sustainable and must be changed .
” The statement was released at the end of a meeting in Canada of the eight powers , and ahead of a meeting of a larger group of 20 nations , including China and India .
While expressing regret for the loss of life on the Mavi Marmara on May 31 , the G - 8 said it approved of Israel ’s decision to set up an independent commission to investigate the incident .
In addition , the G - 8 asked all parties to abide by UN Security Council Resolution 1860 to guarantee the stream of humanitarian aid to Gaza , calling for a change to existing policies .
While welcoming the government ’s decision to ease the Gaza blockade , it urged “ full and effective implementation of this policy in order to address the needs of Gaza ’s population for humanitarian and commercial goods , civilian reconstruction and infrastructure , and legitimate economic activity .
” The statement added , however , that Israel ’s security concerns were legitimate and needed to be protected .
Reiterating its statement from the previous year , the G - 8 demanded the immediate release of IDF soldier Gilad Schalit , abducted four years ago on the Gaza border .
Additionally , the G - 8 called on all states to implement UNSC resolution 1929 and expressed deep concern for Iran ’s lack of transparency regarding its nuclear program and declared intention to enrich uranium to almost 20 percent .
“ Our goal is to persuade Iran ’s leaders to engage in a transparent dialogue about its nuclear activities and to meet Iran ’s international obligations , ” the statement said .
The G - 8 statement on Iran came on the heels of the US House of Representatives vote for its own new and harsher sanctions against Teheran on Friday .
“ After recent years of trying to work through the dual - track approach , the countries have decided to take more stringent actions against Iran despite hesitation from some , particularly Russia .
“ It is not surprising that the countries decided to specify their support for UNSC 1929 because of recent activities and discussion on these issues .
It will be interesting to see if these discussions are carried on to the G - 20 in light of Brazil and Turkey ’s recent activity on this issue , ” said Jenilee Guebert , director of Research at the G - 8 Research Group at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto .
During last year ’s summit in L’Aquila , Italy , the G - 8 urged Iran to comply with existing UNSC resolutions and the IAEA with regard to its nuclear program and emphasized their commitment to resolve the matter through diplomatic channels .
L’Aquila was also the first time the G - 8 mentioned President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by name and condemned his declarations denying the Holocaust .
In March , G8 foreign ministers reiterated their support for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) and continued commitment to work toward the reduction of nuclear weapons and the cessation of all nuclear weapons test explosions .
The foreign ministers ’ statement echoed the G8 ’s past commitments to the NPT at the 2009 summit in L’Aquila , and in Hokkaido , Japan , in 2008 .
The leaders turned to foreign policy matters after finding themselves at odds over how to continue to spur world economic growth in the aftermath of the worst recession since the 1930s .
The countries were divided over whether to continue government stimulus spending , as the United States wants , or to cut mushrooming deficits , as Europe and Japan want .
On the March sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan , the leaders cited a report that found that the ship had been sunk by a North Korean torpedo .
The leaders said : “ We condemn in this context the attack which led to the sinking of the Cheonan . ” Japanese officials said that the Russians were the only ones in the G - 8 to resist tougher language condemning North Korea .
An official in the Russian delegation , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the leaders were meeting , said that Russia still did not consider the results of the commission to be final and because of this , felt that condemning Pyongyang further could lead to negative consequences .
The G - 8 communique , citing concerns they had raised at last year ’s summit in Italy , said , “ We urge the government of Iran to respect the rule of law and freedom of expression as outlined in the international treaties to which Iran is a party .
” On Afghanistan , the statement said that a conference in Kabul in July would be an important setting for assessing progress in implementing commitments made in January to train more than 100,000 additional security forces by the end of next year .
The G - 8 leaders said it was important to accelerate efforts to make sure the country ’s own security forces can “ assume increasing responsibility within five years . ”
Psychic and medium Derek Acorah has reportedly sparked a backlash from fans after cancelling a gig in Scotland due to " unforeseen circumstances " .
The 60 - year - old had been due on stage at the Citadel centre in Ayr on Saturday night , but hundreds of fans were left disappointed when they arrived to discover that the show had been postponed , the Daily Record reports .
One disgruntled supporter told the newspaper : " We were told it was due to unforeseen circumstances .
How can a psychic cancel his show due to unforeseen circumstances ?
It does n't say much for his talents . "
Another , named Rubin Maflure , complained that she was especially furious as she had waited years to see the former Most Haunted star .
She said : " I hope Mr Acorah never comes back again and I will never speak this man 's name again . "
A spokesman for Acorah said that the star was left stranded while travelling to the venue after his crew filled his van with the wrong fuel at a motorway service station .
He added : " They contacted the venue to say there was no tow truck available to tow them for many hours .
A new date will be announced soon . "

Turns out the most depressing things sold at Walmart are n't found inside the store .
A couple allegedly offered to sell their 6 - month - old baby for $ 25 to two strangers in a Salinas , California Walmart parking lot .
According to the AP :
" Patrick Fousek , 38 , and Samantha Tomasini , 20 , were arrested early Wednesday , hours after Fousek allegedly approached two women outside Walmart and asked if they 'd like to purchase his child .
The women initially thought Fousek was joking , but when he became persistent , they became suspicious and reported it to police
When police arrived at their house , they found Fousek and Tomasini high on — you guessed it !— meth .
Child Protective Services took the baby , and Fousek and Tomasini have been charged with being under the influence of narcotics and child endangerment .
And that 's your depressing Walmart story of the week .
The Senate failed to say no to $ 35 billion worth of tax breaks for the oil and gas industry on yesterday .
I know , double negatives .
But that ’s the easiest way to describe it .
You see , Senator Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) introduced a provision that would have limited write offs for drilling expenses , eliminated a tax deduction for the capital costs of oil and gas wells and repealed a tax deduction for domestic production of oil and gas .
He needed 59 additional votes .
He got 34 .
So , the Senate said no to no tax breaks : the oil and gas companies get to keep them .
The low vote may be a warning shot for President Obama : those same breaks are included in his proposed budget for next year .
While I did n’t expect the measure to pass , I thought that there might be more support – the timing was pretty good considering Obama ’s “ fire and brimstone ” speech hammering BP .
A poll showed that 75 % of Americans blame BP “ a great deal ” for the spill ( and I ’m still scratching my head trying to figure out who the 2 % of respondents are who thought BP was n’t to blame at all – really , people ? ) .
Anti-oil company sentiment is probably at its peak right now so if you ca n’t get this measure through this year … well , I do n’t see it happening next year .
Sanders , however , did n’t focus on the spill , though he did make reference to the environment , garnering support from organizations like the Sierra Club .
Instead , Sanders stressed the economics of the provision , writing to his colleagues :
Over the last decade , the five largest oil companies ( Exxon Mobil , Chevron , ConocoPhillips , BP and Shell ) made more than $ 750 billion in profits .
These profitable companies simply do n’t deserve tax relief .
With a record - breaking $ 13 trillion national debt and an unsustainable federal deficit , the last thing we should be doing is giving tax breaks to oil and gas companies that have been making enormous profits .
Sanders went on to note that Exxon Mobil , which he called “ the most profitable corporation in the world ” not only paid no US taxes last year , but also received a $ 156 million tax refund .
Other federal tax refunds from last year included $ 19 million to Chevron and $ 157 to Valero Energy .
Nonetheless , Sanders ’ arguments failed to sway Republican votes and most Democrats , despite the fact that the bill was co-sponsored by some fairly high - powered Democrats including Sen Frank Lautenberg ( D - NJ ) .
No word yet on whether there might be an alternate proposal .

Exclusive : Google Buys Invite Media
UPDATE : Google has now confirmed the deal .
— — ——
Google has indeed bought ad technology start - up Invite Media , I ’ve confirmed with multiple sources .
As I wrote last month , Invite is a three - year - old “ demand - side platform ” designed to help buyers navigate high - volume display - advertising exchanges –like the one Google launched last year .
I do n’t have a price for the deal nailed down , but I believe it ’s in the $ 70 million range .
Google ( GOOG ) declined to comment ; I have n’t heard back from Invite Media CEO Nat Turner .
People familiar with the transaction say Google ’s plan is to leave Invite running as a standalone unit , which will work at arm ’s length with exchange ’s like Google ’s AdX , as well as competitors like OpenX , Yahoo ’s ( YHOO ) Right Media and Microsoft ’s ( MSFT ) AdECN .
That makes sense , because ad buyers who use Invite , like Publicis ’s Vivaki , expect to be able to buy inventory from multiple exchanges .
But over time , Google does plan on investing in Invite and integrating it with DoubleClick for Advertisers , its ad - serving technology .
Invite users would n’t be required to use DFA , but the two would be designed to match up seamlessly , sources said .
It will be interesting to see what becomes of Invite ’s competitors , like MediaMath , Turn and X+1 , in the wake of this deal .
Venture capitalists have poured money into demand - side platforms in recent years , but I ’ve heard increasing skepticism about valuations those investors are seeking .
And now the most obvious buyer , with the deepest pockets , is off the table .
Turner and his co-founders started Invite Media when they were still undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania ; the company has offices in Philadelphia and New York City .
Investors include Comcast ’s ( CMCSA ) venture arm and First Round Capital .
Invite had previously considered selling to Omniture last summer , but that deal went away after Adobe ( ADBE ) purchased the analytics company .
While I ’m really passionate about eating healthy , my eating habits were n’t always great .
In fact , they were absolutely terrible for most of my life .
For the longest time I really did n’t understand the quality of the foods I was putting in my body , how they affected me , and why sometimes I would go on massive eating binges .
My eating habits soon changed the one week I kept a food journal using an online tracker and tracked my calories for every meal , every snack , and recorded any food that entered my body .
It was an eye opening experience for me and if you have not tracked your calories , or kept a food journal before , it can be a very positive experience for you as well .
This food journal series will teach you the basics so you can get the most out tracking your eating habits .
Here are 7 compelling reasons why you should try to keep a journal , even for only a couple days :
1 ) Learn How To Control Your Calories
I think my most important lesson was learning more about calories in foods I eat on a regular basis .
For example , as I was tallying a dinner I just ate at a Greek restaurant , I did n’t realize that the generous 5 tablespoons worth of olive oil I had with a pita was a solid 550 calories ( 1 tablespoon of olive oil has 110 calories ) .
Then the cup worth of hummus I inhaled was a good 430 calories on top of that .
By the time I was done tallying my meal , I was like , “ Wow , I just ate 1500 + calories of food and I was n’t even that full .
Oops . ”
Conversely , you may realize that certain days , or meals you ’re eating far too few calories , but I never had that problem .
2 ) Understand Your Sources of Calories
Calories are n’t just about total calories , but about the breakdown of protein , carbohydrates , and fat , which are 3 nutrients that provide energy for your body .
You ’ll also keep track of alcohol you drink , which is the other element that provides calories to your body , but is not a nutrient .
You may realize 70 % of you calories are coming from carbohydrates , which is far higher than even what the USDA recommends ( which is already high ) , or you might realize you only have 10 % of your calories from protein despite being an active individual .
Learning more about the calorie breakdowns in the foods I ate and each day as a whole was probably the second most helpful part that I found to keeping a food journal .
3 ) Get a Feel For Portion Control
By learning more about calories , you also learn more about portion control and the types of foods you can eat in larger portions like lean meats , vegetables , and certain fruits , and the types of food you want to eat sparingly .
Overall , you become far more cognizant of portion control .
4 ) Identify Situations Where You Binge
Every once in a while ( ok , maybe all the time ) I would inhale really unhealthy food in outrageous proportions until I was about to explode .
Why did I do this ?
Well , I did n’t really know why until I started recognizing the situations I was in that would set off an epic eating binge .
There were usually a set of factors that would set off my eating binges , such as having too much alcohol at dinner , or having a very small lunch , or light breakfast , which put my hunger into overdrive later in the day .
Sometimes eating was more emotional ; my problem was that I went on binges to celebrate , and when I was down in the dumps .
5 ) Provides a Hard , Objective Record
Many times in our minds we will trick ourselves into believing we did n’t eat something , or we did n’t eat that much unhealthy food .
When you have a written log , or journal , it takes the guess work and the guessing games out of the equation .
You will know exactly how you are eating and that objective feedback can help inspire change .
6 ) Identify If You Have a Calorie Surplus , or Deficit
Not only does a food journal tell you the total calories you are eating , but you can also figure out how many more , or less calories you are eating relative to your calorie burn .
If you eat more calories than you burn , you gain weight , and if you eat less , you lose weight .
Calculating your calorie burn can be a little tricky as I describe in my how to calculate your calorie burn article , but for most people the basic calorie burn equations work pretty well .
Some calorie trackers I ’ll be introducing have ways to make calorie deficits for the day show up in green , and calorie surplus show up in red .
These markers can be a BIG motivator .
7 ) If You Saw a Nutritionist , You Would Keep a Food Journal Anyways
If you go see a nutritionist , one of the first tasks you will be assigned is keeping a food journal .
This helps the nutritionist analyze your eating habits so he , or she can make suggestions as to how you can change them over time .
If you are doing this on your own , you ’re going to be analyzing your own eating habits on a less detailed level of course , but it ’s still very , very helpful exercise .
I only had the patience to keep a food journal for about a week , maybe even less , so I ’m not saying you have to keep a food journal the rest of your life .
A few days is better than nothing .
Maybe a couple days during the week and the weekend could be very beneficial for you .
Our habits are subconscious , so by making yourself conscious of how you eat by keeping a food journal , it makes changing your eating habits a whole lot easier .

After two brothers fell to assassins ’ bullets , Senator Edward M. Kennedy received repeated threats that he , too , would meet the same fate , according to thousands of pages of documents released Monday by the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
“ A warning to the Kennedys , ” read a letter sent in 1968 to the police in Edmonton , Alberta , one of scores of death threats against Mr. Kennedy .
“ John Kennedy number one assassinated , Robert Kennedy number two assassinated , Ted Kennedy number three assassinated on a set date of Oct. 25 , 1968 . ’’
The threats , some of which resulted in investigations and another that merely resulted in warnings to Mr. Kennedy ’s office , are contained in more than 2,200 pages of documents released by the F.B.I. covering 1961 to 1985 .
Some of the threats were made by members of radical groups , including the Ku Klux Klan , “ Minutemen ” organizations , and the National Socialist White People ’s Party .
There is very little in the files on the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident , in which a young woman drowned after Mr. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , drove off a bridge on Martha ’s Vineyard .
“ The F.B.I. had no investigative role in this case , since there were no violations of federal criminal law involved , ’’ the bureau wrote in a summary , explaining that most of the documents in its files were clips from newspapers and other public sources .
But the file does contain a teletype to the director of the F.B.I. on July 19 , 1969 , flashing the first news of the drowning , and initially misidentifying the woman , Mary Jo Kopechne , as “ Mary Palporki . ”
“ On this date Dominic J. Arena , chief of police , Edgartown , Martha ’s Vineyard , advised body of female found in overturned car in water , ’’ it read .
“ Tentatively identified as above , who was former secretary to former Senator Robert F. Kennedy .
Mr. Arena confidentially advised that driver of automobile was Senator Edward M. Kennedy who was uninjured , stated fact Senator Kennedy was driver is not being revealed to anyone . ’’
In his memoir , “ True Compass , ’’ Mr. Kennedy recounted writing a letter to the Los Angeles district attorney asking him not to seek the death penalty for Sirhan Sirhan , the assassin of his brother , Robert F. Kennedy .
One of the F.B.I. files recounts the unsubstantiated claims of a prisoner who served time with Mr. Sirhan , and who said that Mr. Sirhan had tried to hire him to kill Mr. Kennedy .
“ He advised during this time subject offered him one million dollars and a car in exchange for killing Senator Kennedy , ’’ according to the file .
There are many uncorroborated rumors and threats in the files .
One of the more tantalizing ones , according to a summary by the bureau , contained a report of a rumor from an informant suggesting that organized crime wanted to attack “ the character of Edward and Robert Kennedy and their brother - in - law Peter Lawford by working through associates of Frank Sinatra to compromise them at a New York party . ’’
“ In the convoluted rumor , both Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe were to be involved , ’’ the bureau wrote .
“ The F.B.I. did not consider the rumor solid , and no other mention of it appears in the file , suggesting that the informant did not supply any corroboration to the story . ’’
There were also intriguing glimpses of the relationship between the Kennedys and J. Edgar Hoover , the longtime F.B.I. director .
In October 1964 , Mr. Kennedy , then recovering from a near - fatal airplane crash that year , wrote Mr. Hoover to ask if he would contribute an essay for a book Mr. Kennedy was compiling of personal recollections about his father , Joseph P. Kennedy .
“ It is my hope that you would like to put down your thoughts about significant events involving my father , especially anecdotal accounts that would contribute to a profile of a man who has great warmth and affection and , at the same time , commands strong loyalties from those who know and have worked with him , ” he wrote .
Mr. Hoover agreed , but only after aides combed their files for anything on the elder Kennedy .
A memo on their search revealed that Mr. Kennedy had been a “ special service contact ” of the Boston office of the F.B.I. for 11 years and was on a first - name basis with Mr. Hoover .
“ The F.B.I. has never conducted a complete investigation of Mr. Kennedy ; however , a limited inquiry was made in May 1951 , at the request of the Department , ’’ they wrote .
“ This concerned an allegation that Mr. Kennedy , then owner of the Merchandise Mart in Chicago , had given $ 100,000 for the removal of Government offices from that building .
No specific facts were developed and the inquiry was closed on 6 - 7 - 51 . ”
The memo also noted that in 1953 the State Department had sent information about Mr. Kennedy , but the rest of the entry was blanked out .
A few weeks after receiving Mr. Kennedy ’s request , Mr. Hoover sent an essay that covered seven double - spaced pages .
Mr. Hoover noted Mr. Kennedy ’s service on the new Securities and Exchange Commission and as the leader of a group trying to reform the Merchant Marine .
He then recalled Mr. Kennedy ’s service as ambassador to England , where he controversially said that England was not prepared to fight Nazi Germany and , in March 1938 , opposed the United States ’s entry into the looming war in Europe .
“ For this , ” Mr. Hoover wrote , “ Joe Kennedy was accused of being pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic ! ”
Mr. Hoover wrote in 1955 that Mr. Kennedy had written him saying that he understood Mr. Hoover was interested in running for president .
“ He urged me to run for this position either on a Republican or Democratic ticket , guaranteeing me the largest campaign contribution I would ever get from anyone , and his personal services as the hardest campaign worker in history . ”
Mr. Hoover respectfully declined .
“ I explained to him that I have never had any political ambitious and that I have always felt what contribution I can make to my country can best be given in my present position as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation . ”
Government Services :
Where the Customer is Always Wrong
In the normal course of affairs , when we consume services offered on the market , we expect only to get the services we ask for , and to pay for just what we get .
If we do n’t want the service a business is providing , we do n’t have to consume it or pay for it .
And if someone else offers a superior version of the service on terms that we prefer , we can take our business elsewhere .
Reader reactions to the Red & Black Cafe story , where the manager of an anarchist coffee house in Portland evicted a cop , are especially interesting against this background .
One particular refrain can be summarized as “ Just wait ’ll you need a cop ! ”
For example , Big Mack asks : “ I wonder if they would be willing to tear their phones off their walls so that in case of a fire or a robbery , they wo n’t have to ‘ bother ’ the 911 operators by asking for a responder to come over to help . ”
Let ’s do a little thought experiment : Imagine a bakery that , instead of selling you what you ask for when you go inside , enrolls you on their customer list against your will , charges your account for whatever package of goods they think you should buy , and sends someone to collect the bill at gunpoint .
If you want any of the pastries or loaves they have on display , you ’re expected to take them along with the bakery ’s choice of other offerings whether you want them or not .
And if you walk in to pick up a loaf of fresh - baked bread , and the baker beats you senseless or tasers you , you ’d better not complain if you do n’t want to be called a hypocrite .
After all , you badmouth the baker , you dirty stinking hippie , but you sure do n’t mind coming to him when you want bread !
Anyway , you little ingrate punk , I ’ve seen what it ’s like when people do n’t have bread , and believe you me the bakers are the only thing standing between you and hunger !
Think about it .
Do you think bread is something we would n’t have if there were n’t a special class of bakers who forced us to consume it on their terms , and collected payment from us by force ?
Do you think our need for bread obligates us to obey the orders of bakers without question , or let them beat us up when they ’re having a bad day ?
Obviously not .
Because bread is something that people can provide for themselves with a household oven , or organize with their neighbors to produce through neighborhood bakery exchanges , or purchase from any number of competing bakers who have to offer an appealing product to willing buyers .
There ’s no technical reason the supply of bread ca n’t be organized in any way the people who consume it prefer .
Would n’t it be great if everything was like bread ?
Inter have deservedly won the Champions League – beating this season ’s champions of England , Spain and then Germany on the way to collecting the trophy .
Jose Mourinho has conquered Europe again , Inter have won the treble for the first time in the history of Italian football , and Italy retains its four Champions League places ahead of Germany .
There were no surprises in the starting XIs – they were as predicted by ZM in the preview .
Inter went with their 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 , with Goran Pandev and Samuel Eto’o on the flanks very deep and Wesley Sneijder in the hole .
Javier Zanetti was deployed in midfield , Christian Chivu at left - back , despite suggestions they could be the other way around .
Bayern also played their standard shape , a 4 - 4 - 2 / 4 - 2-3- 1 , with Arjen Robben hugging the touchline looking to come inside , and Hamit Altintop playing a slightly more central position on the opposite flank .
Thomas Muller played behind Ivica Olic .
Sneijder key in the first half
The most notable feature of the game was how close Wesley Sneijder played to Diego Milito .
Some have occasionally questioned why Inter ’s shape is termed as a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 rather than a 4 - 3 - 3 ( the difference can often be subtle ) but tonight showed why , because Sneijder spent the night ahead of the two wide players .
Indeed , the shape often looked more like a 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 , because whilst Pandev and Eto’o had strict defensive jobs , Sneijder had something approaching a free role .
His role is something sides have become slightly unaccustomed to facing ; as outlined here before , there is a distinct lack of ‘ classic ’
No 10s in European football at the moment .
Sneijder ’s movement in behind the main striker caused Bayern no end of problems , which started because Bayern had a numerical disadvantage in midfield , 3 v 2 .
If Mark van Bommel got goalside of Sneijder , it would mean that Bastian Schweinsteiger would be forced to compete with Javier Zanetti and Esteban Cambiasso , conceding the midfield to Inter .
Therefore , van Bommel was forced to step up ahead of Sneijder , meaning he and Schweinsteiger cancelled out Zanetti and Cambiasso , who ( whilst not particularly creative players anyway ) did n’t influence the game much in an offensive sense .
Sneijder , therefore , was left to be picked up by Martin Demichelis and Daniel van Buyten – who were preoccupied with stopping Diego Milito , one of those forwards with a tremendous ability to occupy two centre - halves at once .
For the first goal , van Buyten got himself far too deep behind Demichelis .
His positioning was actually OK if Bayern were simply dealing with Milito as the only threat , but Sneijder ’s position so high up the pitch meant that van Buyten ’s ‘ covering ’ position left Sneijder with space , and he passed the ball easily for Milito to finish brilliantly .
A not dissimilar situation occurred just before half - time when the Dutchman shot straight at Butt in one - on - one situation – Bayern simply could n’t cope with Sneijder .
Bayern struggle in the final third
Bayern dominated possession – Inter were fairly happy to let them have the ball in deep positions , and had a system of ‘ casual ’ pressing rather than the intense style used by Barcelona at points in this Champions League run .
Bayern worked the ball well in wide areas , and whilst Eto’o and Pandev were doing good defensive jobs , Bayern ’s wingers were dropping deep and their full - backs were pushing on , meaning Inter ’s full - backs and wingers were sometimes forced to swap around .
Not an ideal scenario for Inter , and Bayern had plenty of crossing opportunities .
Bayern were unable to take advantage of this , though .
With neither Olic nor Muller great aerial targets at the best of times , let alone against Lucio and Walter Samuel , Bayern were slightly too keen to come inside and try and play through the congested centre of the pitch .
When the wingers and full - backs did get down the line they often found themselves in great positions , but Arjen Robben , Philip Lahm and Hamit Altintop all wasted chances to put a killer ball in .
In the case of Robben and Altintop , this is perhaps the price you pay for fielding inverted wingers – they can shoot , but they often find it difficult to cross .
Interestingly , the one time a Bayern player found himself free in a dangerous position was Mark van Bommel ’s dragged shot wide in stoppage time at the end of the first half – not the player you ’d expect to be causing an immediate goal threat .
There is a sense that a ’ surprise ’ player in an attacking position is the best way to open up Inter when they ’re defending solidly within their own area – against Barcelona , for example , they coped with everything Barca could throw at them , until Gerard Pique came up from the back and there appeared to be confusion about how to deal with him .
Muller wastes chances
That said , Bayern did create .
Three decent chances fell to Thomas Muller , but the young forward was unable to convert them .
Firstly a half - chance at the near post in the first ten minutes , secondly a clear one - on - one that he played straight at Julio Cesar , thirdly a volley he hit into the ground when in space on the penalty spot .
In terms of positioning , movement and work rate , Muller is excellent and is widely recognized as being a tremendous talent , but tonight showed that in front of goal , he ’s not yet up to scratch .
He has scored in just one game in this Champions League run – against Maccabi Haifa on the opening day – and has often failed to make things happen for Bayern in the penalty box , particularly against Fiorentina and against Manchester United when Bayern were slightly fortunate to progress .
His opportunities were no more presentable than Milito ’s , both of which were dispatched excellently .
The man signed from Genoa last summer wrapped the game up with his 70th minute strike , as Inter got the ball to him in space , allowing him to run at the hapless van Buyten .
Samuel Eto’o will be praised for his defensive role , but he was a key part in the second goal .
First he held off Badstuber , luring him into a crazy challenge he was never going to win .
Then , he despatched the pass into feet for Milito .
Finally , he got himself level with Milito and into the box , forcing Martin Demichelis to track him , rather than ’ sweeping ’ behind van Buyten .
All this may sound fairly basic , but it is partly the fact that Eto ’o is a forward playing out wide that helped him hold off the challenge , and then have the determination to get himself into the box .
A winger may not have done the same .
Inter see the game out
As we have come to expect , Inter defended solidly and brilliantly within their own area .
The two defensive midfielders sat extremely deep and never looked to get remotely forward in the second half , even when the more attack - minded Dejan Stankovic was brought on .
Muller ( dropping deep ) and Schweinsteiger ( moving forward ) struggled to find space in that zone , and so the ball was generally held in wide areas .
Bayern still struggled to test
Inter too much considering the amount of possession they had , despite the arrival of Mario Gomez and Miroslav Klose , two players who like crosses .
It was surprising that van Gaal did not opt to use Danijel Pranjic , a good crosser of the ball , who could have replaced Badstuber , a full - back reluctant to attack .
There was a feeling that if Inter scored the first goal , they would win the game .
And so it proved – Lucio , Samuel and Cambiasso were absolutely superb , and whilst Mourinho should be rightly praised for organising his defence so well , we should not forget that Inter ’s defenders are naturally superb players .
Defensive organisation is vital in winning trophies but individual performances have shone through against Barcelona and Bayern – further emphasized by van Buyten ’s nightmare at the other end .
Inter deserved European champions
The tie against Barcelona was ridiculously tight and could have gone either way , but it ’s hard to fault Inter .
Despatching the best teams from the three other major European leagues along the way , whilst wining their own domestic league , would suggest that this is a fitting triumph .
What is different from last year , where Mourinho ’s Inter crumbled against Manchester United ?
Half the team .
Of Mourinho ’s favoured XI in the second half of the season , the five furthest forward players – Thiago Motta , Wesley Sneijder , Samuel Eto ’o , Goran Pandev and Diego Milito , as well as Lucio , the centre - back , are all in their first season at the club .
That ’s 6 out of 11 players – last year ’s side was not “ Mourinho ’s ” , it was the players he had inherited .
Creating such a successful side with so many new recruits is a remarkable achievement , as is managing to transform goal - hungry forwards like Eto’o and Pandev into hard - workers defensively , even if some will complain that this is robbing the world of some exciting attacking play .
But Mourinho ’s brief was to win the Champions League , and he has done that .
The final question about Inter : are they a defensive side ?
It ’s easy to say that they are , especially considering the reputation of both Mourinho and Italian football in general .
This has slightly clouded the judgement of many who have n’t watched them on a regular basis – they have played some excellent football , and characterizing a side as ‘ defensive ’ when they regularly play a Sneijder - Pandev - Eto ’o - Milito quartet is rather harsh .
Yet in the final three matches of this Champions League run they have had less than 35 % of possession in each ; Jonathan Wilson has discussed whether this ( successful ) approach will be a turning point in football .
The answer to that might have to wait for a few years , but the acclaim for Inter can begin immediately .
Defensively brilliant , ruthless in the penalty area , and possessing some of the best players in the world , this is a superb
Inter side that have equalled the achievements of the much - praised Barcelona side of last season .

Here is a terrible , tragic story about the separation of an elderly gay couple by Sonoma County , California , the subsequent death of one member of that couple , and the auctioning of their property .
A suit has been filed .
Clay Greene , the surviving member of the couple , has filed suit against the county and the auction company .
The National Center for Lesbian Rights is helping with his suit and organizing the " visibility campaign " to spread the word of this terrible story .
The story has received no proper news coverage just , which means all the stories are based on Greene 's lawyer 's account of what happened , but if it 's even half as bad as the NCLR makes it sound it 's a miserable , enraging injustice .
( Repeal of Proposition 8 , the ballot initiative that re-banned gay marriage , will not be on the ballot in California this year , in part because established gay advocacy groups thought it might be too hard to campaign for it , what with the Tea Parties and what - have - you . )

The video of my debate with my friend Michael Sizer on morality is now available .
This debate took place in March 2010 AD at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo , Canada .
At some point I may post segments and make a few comments .
For example , at one point , when it came to the question about harm causing in the Bible I misspoke ;
I wanted to distinguish between me taking it upon myself to taken an innocent life -- on the one hand -- and a governing body prescribing capital punishment on a guilty person -- on the other .
Yet , I accidentally said , " innocent " for both .
I also made a statement about the difference between us , humans , and other animals when I meant to note a difference between us , humans and animals ( not other as if we are animals ) .
As for my approach well , I am not a Christian apologist so that I can defend some generic “ g , ” “ o , ” “ d . ”
One flier for the event states that I was " supported by Creation Ministries " which I was not ; they seemed to assume that I was being supported by Creation Ministries International because it was what I wrote about morality for their main atheism essay ( found here www.creation.com/atheism ) that brought Michael and I together — also see my responses to comments that it has received .
The following clip is from part 8 , t=6:55 and I believe that it cuts to the core of any and every atheist versus Christian debate on the issue of morality : his answer is nonsensical to me and my answer is inconceivable to him .
I give Michael credit for his honestly as when your debate opponent applauds for you , it really says something ( although , my statement is in no way original to me but is right from the New Testament ) .

Hey Everybody ,
In this post I ’ll be discussing some of the best affiliate networks , and provide people alternatives to sticking with Clickbank .
There ’s nothing wrong with Clickbank as such , but the problem is , that it can be pretty competitive .
If you just branch out a little , you ’ll find there are other networks , with great physical products that convert extremely well and have less competition .
I have harped on about this next point a lot , but I do n’t care , I ’m going to continue to harp on because it will help you .
When you are considering a product to promote make sure you choose BUYER keywords to target , do NOT fall into the trap of targeting info seeker keywords ( end of rant ) .
The reason I slotted that in there , was because in the Clickbank Marketplace when you are looking at products to promote , some of the easiest keywords to make money with are product names , and product name review .
However although there is still plenty of easy money to be made targeting these keywords in Clickbank , and variations of these , there is a sea of opportunity out there , with less competition when you venture to other networks .
I for one prefer to promote physical products , although I do still promote a lot of digital stuff from Clickbank too .
So with that said , I have listed below some other networks that you might like to consider .
Keep in mind that Clickbank auto - approves all affiliates , but most other networks are not that easy .
This does n’t mean you ca n’t get in , because you most certainly can , but there are some things that you might like to consider to help your chances , which I have also listed below .
Getting Accepted Into a Network
You need to have a some form of a website in most cases .
If you do n’t have a website , then you can just buy a domain and set up a wordpress blog template of one , add 6 - 10 articles on the niche topic , make it look pretty , and off you go .
Also quite a few , but not all networks , require telephone contact with you before they will accept you , this is mainly the CPA networks .
So make sure that you do not miss the call from them , or you ’ll instantly get rejected .
When you are filling out the ‘ your experience ’ field on the application form , ensure you make yourself sound as good as you can .
I am not suggesting you falsify information , I am just saying that the more detail , and the more you can show them that you have a clue and know what you are talking about , the much higher the chance of getting accepted .
It ’s all pretty easy really , in fact I applied for new affiliate network the other day , and they called me , and the questions they asked where the following :
How do you drive traffic ?
( SEO , PPC etc … )
What sort of traffic to you drive ( highly targeted keyword specific traffic )
Where does your traffic come from ?
( country , say USA and UK )
What offers are you considering promoting in our network ?
If you were accepted today how long until you started driving traffic ?
What sort of websites do you build ?
( this depend on your approach , but saying article sites is fine )
These are all pretty straight forward questions , but it helps to have a good answer ready to give them .
Oh yeah and try not to say that you have no experience , because if you ’ve read my blog posts and are on my list then , you ’ll have learned a fair amount , so you are experienced , even if you have n’t made the money yet , it will come soon … .
Best Affiliate Networks
Commission Junction – are probably the largest affiliate network there is , and they have a huge range of niches and products .
They are a great network , but what I do n’t like about them is that it ’s a little tricky to navigate to the offers , as the layout is not that user friendly .
But there are a HUGE amount of buyer keyword opportunities for products that you can target in here .
Linkshare –
These guys are not that hard to get accepted into , which is good , and they also have a large range of products to promote , including some great electronics and gadgets .
ShareAsale – Another decent sized network , and again acceptance is not too hard here either .
Commission payments are good too .
Market Health –
This is a great natural health market place , with great commissions and a large range of products .
MoreNiche –
Yet another great health network , with products for all sorts of conditions .
The payments are decent too , and the landing pages pretty good .
Max Bounty –
These guys are a CPA network , and they have a lot of different offers , ranging from debt relief and insurance to health and beauty .
There are of course many other networks out there that are also good , however these are some of the best affiliate networks .
So remember the tips I mentioned about getting accepted , and all the best !

the thing about a ' dot - gov ' at the end of your web site is that you know it is credible information , so I really think that patients ought to start there .
Look for the ' dot - gov ' ....
During National Health IT week ( June 14 - 18 ) , most of the emphasis will be on electronic health records ( EHR ) , insurance and billing systems which will have a delayed and only indirect effect on consumers ' health and perceptions of healthcare reform .
The Obama administration is spending tens of billions of dollars on health information technology ( HIT ) yet it is nearly impossible for consumers to locate and use government health information because it is scattered across dozens of uncoordinated web sites produced by different agencies .
Furthermore none of these sites are well aligned with the top health issues of interest to consumers that have been identified in surveys by Susannah Fox of the Pew Internet and American Life Project .
Reaching a major milestone , Resounding Health™ has now united government consumer health information into a single medical knowledge base that can be customized to meet individual consumers ' needs for personalized and participatory medicine .
Tara Parker - Pope of the New York Times told NBC Today Show host Matt Lauer in 2008 there are many great health information sites but " the thing about a ' dot - gov ' at the end of your web site is that you know it is credible information , so I really think that patients ought to start there .
Look for the ' dot - gov ' .... "
This is much easier said than done .
Agencies like the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA.gov ) , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC.gov ) , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH.gov ) and the Department of Agriculture ( USDA.gov ) each publish their own consumer health information that is disconnected from similar , often repetitive and sometimes inconsistent information published by their sister agencies .
Take the NIH .
Resounding
Health™ researchers identified more than two million pages of health information at its nearly two dozen different institutes where each is focused on its own alphabet soup of abbreviations , acronyms and medical terms that are meaningless to most consumers .
Each of these institutes maintains its own web site with different , and often overly complicated , user interface designs , terminology , search functions and site maps .
Doctors and information engineers at Resounding Health™ have now combined all of this information into a single knowledge base and organized it using their proprietary Medical Ontology Engine .
Users can not only easily search this knowledge base , but can create customized remixes of the information for their own unique needs , and include information from elsewhere on the web , using Resounding Health 's powerful CaseBook™ technology .
Resounding Health helps users collect , organize , personalize , store and easily share the results of their research with friends , family and healthcare providers .
Dr. Alan Littleford , co-founder and head of technology development at Resounding Health said : " For the average consumer , the NIH is a medical Tower of Babel .
Resounding Health™ is the universal translator . "
These unique capabilities , as well as the focus on one - stop shopping for authoritative government health information , distinguish Resounding Health from other health verticals such as MayoClinic .
com and WebMD .
Take the example a pregnant woman who has just been told by her doctor that she may have a serious condition called preeclampsia .
Preeclampsia is a common complication of pregnancy that affects blood pressure and kidney function .
In order to locate government information on this disease , the patient would have to go to at least six different sites : NICHD ( National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ) for pregnancy information , NHLBI ( National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute ) for information on high blood pressure and NIDDK ( National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ) for information on the kidney function .
Then , if she wanted information on treatments , she would have to go to FDA.gov because none of the diseases at NIH.gov are linked to information on drugs , side effects , brand names , generics , etc. provided by the FDA .
For additional treatment options , she would have to visit NCCAM ( National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ) .
All of these centers and agencies are branches of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( DHHS.gov ) which operates yet another consumer health portal healthfinder.gov .
" For the average consumer , these multiple complex steps are impossible and instead they 'd just type their disease into a general search engine and end up with who knows what , " said Dr. Mark Boguski , co-founder and Chief Medical Officer at Resounding Health .
Resounding
Health™ lets them search all of these government health information sources in a single step and provides a comprehensive summary of all relevant information that can be easily saved and shared for later discussion with their healthcare provider .
Resounding Health 's knowledge base and CaseBook™ technology is also powering other medical web sites including Celebrity Diagnosis™ , the premier source of Teachable Moments in Medicine™ for increasing consumer health awareness and medical knowledge .
Future releases of Resounding Health™ will enable users to link CaseBooks to their personal electronic medical records ( EMR ) such as Dossia Indivo , Microsoft HealthVault and similar products from HIMSS , the Healthcare Information Management and Systems Society .

The two biggest contractors on the doomed ID cards scheme will escape any serious financial impact , as the government will not cancel their deals .
With today 's announcement that ID cards will be scrapped within 100 days , it 's emerged CSC and IBM will simply have the scale of their tasks reduced .
CSC is operating the 10 - year , £ 385 m application and enrolment contract .
A Home Office spokesman told The Register that because the technology will be used for passports and in issuing ID cards to foreigners - which will go ahead - the firm will not be affected .
Likewise there will be no significant impact on IBM 's seven - year , £ 285 m National Biometric Identity Service deal .
It will now only need to store biometric data relating to passports and asylum applicants , however .
The only ID card contractor facing the exit is Thales .
The Home Office said it is in negotiations to part ways on a relatively meagre £ 18 m deal to build the National Identity Register .
A spokesman declined to discuss what settlement the government hoped to achieve .
The government said today the Identity Documents Bill would save the exchequer £ 86 m over four years .
News that only a small proportion of that figure will come from breaking contracts means redundancies are on the way at the Identity and Passport Service ( IPS ) , the Home Office Agency responsible for deploying ID cards .
A spokesman declined to discuss the scale of the job losses today , saying talks with permanent staff will begin in the next few weeks .
Already though , 60 temporary workers at the IPS '
Durham site have been told they will leave three months early . ®
Located on a 322 sq. ft. corner lot in Tokyo , the Penguin House by Japanese architect Yasuhiro Yamashita of Atelier Tekuto , is quite a small house – only 899 sq. ft. floor space .
However , through ceiling height manipulation and streamlined natural light , it seems larger than it actually is .
The openness of the space in this modern Japanese home is an illusion ; by cutting off the corners of the structure , the award - winning architect brought natural light into the house .
Through a mixture of high ceilings , an efficient use of the space , extending the sidelines and a streamlined staircase design – the house feels bigger although none of the rooms are larger than 200 sq. ft .
The Penguin House has three floors ; you will find a music room on the first floor , a small bathroom and bedroom on the second floor and a living / working area on the top level with wall - to - wall windows , almost like a light - box , letting in light and views of the surrounding neighborhood .

An influenza specialist who previously led the World Health Organization 's ( WHO's ) flu program and now works for Novartis , has recommended that developing a prepandemic vaccination to get a grip on the next flu endemic , a thought that other experts are welcoming with concern or cynicism .
Dr. Klaus Stohr , ex-Director of the WHO 's Global Influenza Programme , suggests developing a vaccine including a " cocktail " of flu strains considered apt to cause the next epidemic , together with an adjuvant ( immune - system stimulant ) .
He proposes the plan in an opinion article released yesterday online by Nature .
The proposal of prepandemic vaccine has been around for years , stimulated by some researches implying that adjuvants can make flu vaccines defensive against more than just the particular viral damage they are based on .
But since of a lot of doubts like an approach , together with security questions and the volatile timing of epidemics , it has never got much footing .
Stohr says that prepandemic vaccination would help deal with the problem when an epidemic virus surfaces .
It takes around 6 months to develop and generate a well - suited vaccination for it , as was exhibited last year with the epidemic H1N1 virus .
He says that this idea can also help lessen the massive scarcity of production capacity to meet worldwide requirements .
The found poetry of state terror continues its strange mutilations of the English language .
The bizarre verbal heavings of Donald Rumsfeld , for example , are rightly celebrated as choice examples of the genre .
And noted English playwright David Hare once fashioned a whole play built largely on the " thought - tormented music " wrought from verbatim transcripts of the principal authors of the war crime in Iraq .
In this regard , as in almost every aspect of the Terror War , " continuity " has been the hallmark of the Obama Administration .
But we would do the progressive , forward - looking president a grave disservice if we were to imply that this dynamic , historic figure has confined himself to mere continuity .
No , in field after field of governmental endeavor , Barack Obama has striven mightily not just to uphold the many authoritarian and militarist innovations of the Bush Administration , but to expand them -- increasing their scope and depth , codifying , normalizing and making permanent many practices which his predecessors had enshrouded with ambiguity , deception and deliberate murk .
Bush and Cheney were afflicted with a vestigial embarrassment at the howling illegality and constitutional subversion of many of their Terror War policies , and seemed to fear these acts would provoke some kind of public outcry or political controversy -- or even prosecution -- should they be made too explicit .
But our cool , savvy and thoroughly post - postmodern president carries none of that dead lumber from our long - vanished past .
Where Bush was content with smirks and hints about his assassination program , Obama is bold , sending his security chief to declare openly before Congress that the president now has the unrestricted right and power to murder anyone , Americans included , in cold blood , by the simple expedient of declaring his victim a suspected terrorist of some vague description .
Whereas Bush and Cheney usually resorted to backroom bureaucratic knife - twisting or bombastic but empty public threats to try to silence and cow officials who expose high crimes of state , the Obama Administration brazenly brings down the draconian power of federal prosecution against whistleblowers .
Our progressives - in - power will not just take away your government job or bluster at your editors if you give your fellow citizens a glimpse of the blood - soaked sausage - making that goes on behind the imperial curtain ; no , they will put you in the penitentiary , to rot away with murderers and child abusers , which is where they rank all such treacherous tellers of truth .
So we should not be surprised to find the Obama Administration outstripping its mentors and models from the Bush years in the production of Orwellian nomenclature .
Nor is it remarkable that these perversions of language are leading to further perversions of law , morality and plain common sense .
We refer to the recent story in the Los Angeles Times about the vast expansion of the CIA 's powers to murder people in Pakistan with missiles fired by robot drones .
These remote - control killings were originally aimed at specific , known , named individuals suspected of being top " militant " leaders .
But now , people are being targeted not because of any action they are known or alleged to have taken , but simply because they seem to fit an arbitrarily designated " pattern of life " -- even if the remote - control killers do n't know the victim 's name .
This " pattern " is put together from clumps of data gathered by surveillance robots hovering high in the sky above Pakistani towns and villages , watching people as they go about their ordinary business , and from whatever bits of local gossip the CIA can glean from paid operatives raking through their neighbor 's private lives .
Naturally , the CIA refuses to describe " the standards of evidence " by which it decides to kill unknown , defenseless people with missile strikes on houses , compounds and neighborhoods .
And of course , the Agency claims it is targeting only " militants " ( however that infinitely elastic term is being defined these days ) .
Yet at the same time , the Terror War operatives cannot resist boasting that they are sweeping up so much information that they can determine " the characteristics of individual people . "
And since is it the pattern of observed daily life that yields the designation of a person as a " militant , " the CIA must inevitably be tracking countless numbers of innocent people as well .
Otherwise , how could they discern specific " patterns of life " that indicate the existence of a hitherto unknown " militant " within a given population ?
You can only get such data by observing that population as a whole .
In other words , the program , for all its technological whizbangery , is essentially a crude KGB - style rape of the privacy of individual human beings , whose lives are a forced open book , with every action and interaction being judged by a remorseless spy , holding the power of life and death in his hands .
People who act " suspiciously " -- by unknown criteria , determined in secret -- can be killed without warning , without trial , without charge , without even their names being known to their killers .
But here , of course , our thoroughly modern president outstrips the KGB , which usually picked off its victims piecemeal , quietly , individually .
Nowadays , we send heavy missiles screaming through the sky to destroy whole buildings and city streets in order to kill one unnamed , unknown suspect who has somehow exhibited the wrong " pattern of life . "
In almost every case , many people -- sometimes dozens -- die with the victim , regardless of the " pattern of life " they displayed for the deadly peeping toms on the Potomac .
As the Times notes , this particular tactic of state terror was initiated in the last year of the Bush Administration , but has been greatly expanded and " even streamlined " by the Obama Administration .
The result has been the deaths of hundreds of people .
As the Times reports :
Of more than 500 people who U.S. officials say have been killed since the pace of strikes intensified , the vast majority have been individuals whose names were unknown , or about whom the agency had only fragmentary information .
In some cases , the CIA discovered only after an attack that the casualties included a suspected terrorist whom it had been seeking . ‬
The CIA was directed by the Bush administration to begin using armed drones to track Osama bin Laden and other senior Al Qaeda figures , as well as Taliban leaders who fled to Pakistan 's tribal areas after the Sept. 11 attacks .
President Bush secretly decided in his last year in office to expand the program .
Obama has continued and even streamlined the process , so that CIA Director Leon E. Panetta can sign off on many attacks without notifying the White House beforehand , an official said .
Missile attacks have risen steeply since Obama took office .
Note the telling little details .
In some cases , it is only after an attack that our CIA guardians ( or more likely , their paid private contractors ) discover there was a suspected militant among the smoking , stinking pile of dead bodies that their drones have left behind .
And the " vast majority " of these officially claimed 500 victims ( the true number of dead is much greater , of course ) were killed on the basis of " only fragmentary information " at best .
What 's more , the LAT reports that these deadly attacks are being carried out in Pakistan at the rate of one every three and a half days .
Let 's be clear .
A program like this , conducted on such a broad and relentless scale , is in no way aimed solely at eliminating individual " militant leaders " or even " insurgent networks . "
It is , quite demonstrably and unarguably , a terrorist campaign , designed to terrorize the target populations into acquiescence with the attacker 's agenda .
Again , despite its use of advanced technology and sophisticated Orwellian techniques -- Big Brother in the sky , with a bomb -- it is no less primitive , morally and politically , than a carload of fireworks and fertilizer left to explode on a city street .
The only result of the program will be to engender more hatred of the United States ( and of the vaunted " civilized values " the United States purports to represent ) , and to provoke more retaliation , more bloodshed , more extremism .
This is the " pattern of death " that a system based on terror , violence and domination will inevitably produce .
You can pervert the language that surrounds it , cloaking it with security - geek jargon , or fine phrases about freedom and security ; you can tell jokes about it , turning stone - cold mechanized killing based on " fragmentary information " into a jolly jape to titillate sycophantic journalists and vacuous celebrities .
You can do anything you like to disguise the reality of your terrorist campaign -- but you cannot change that reality on the ground where it is occurring , nor stop the reverberations from your evil and idiotic actions from spreading their turbulence in ways you have never foreseen , and can never control .
SANTA ANA – A former police officer accused of defrauding clients while working as a private investigator surrendered to authorities Tuesday after a warrant was issued for his arrest when he failed to appear in court as promised for his arraignment .
Kevin Michael Sianez , 53 , of Fountain Valley was charged last week in a 63 - count criminal complaint that includes three misdemeanor charges of conspiracy to commit a sexual assault of an animal by posting ads on Craigslist to have women engage in bestiality with his dog .
He was arrested Thursday by investigators from the Orange County District Attorney ’s Office Investigators , but was transported to Western Medical Center after claiming to be suffering from a heart condition .
Sianez then did not show up for scheduled arraignment Monday .
When he again failed to appear Tuesday morning , Superior Court Judge Erick Larsh issued the warrant for his arrest .
Sianez was being held on $ 180,000 bail late Tuesday afternoon .
Prosecutors contend Sianez , a former Santa Ana and Stanton police officer , operated a private investigation service from November 2005 to June under several names , including KMS Investigations , Fore - Front Investigations and 4 Front Investigations .
Sianez is accused of falsely identifying himself to clients as a licensed private investigator , posting false online reviews to increase his web presence and misleading people into thinking he operated a nationwide network of offices .
Instead , he had a small suite office in Fountain Valley with less than five employees , primarily family members , prosecutors said .
He allegedly did little work on his cases , and defrauded properly licensed investigation firms by subcontracting work to them without paying .
Sianez is charged with 20 counts of grand theft by false pretense , 12 counts of fraudulently using an access card , two counts of second - degree commercial burglary , five counts of possession of a firearm by a felon due to a 1998 conviction for stalking , four counts of theft with a prior conviction , four counts of obtaining electricity services through false representation and one count each of identity theft , perjury , computer access and fraud and possession of ammunition by a prohibited person .
He is also facing misdemeanor charges , including three counts of conspiracy to commit sexual assault upon an animal , two counts of dissuading a witness from reporting a crime , three counts of obtaining electricity services through false representation and one count each of criminal threats , unlawful representation as a private investigator , engaging in the business of private investigation and doing business without a valid license .
Sianez is facing sentencing enhancements for aggravated white collar crime over $ 100,000 and property damage over $ 65,000 .
If convicted , he faces up to 38 years in state prison .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Scientists have found out how some fat cells are turned into calorie - burning brown fat known as brown adipose tissue rather than into the white fat associated with obesity .
The discovery may help researchers develop ways to fight the obesity epidemic that is sucking up health budgets and resources in rich nations and quickly spreading to the developing world .
Stephan Herzig of the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg , who led the study , said scientists could now try using stem cells to generate brown fat cells in a lab dish to then implant them into the body and help speed up calorie burn .
“ Now that we know some of the signals that are required to generate brown cells , we have the tools to put everything together and try it out , ” he said in a telephone interview .
Stem cells are the driver cells from which all other cells develop .
Rates of obesity have risen dramatically in recent decades in affluent nations , and more Western - style diets and less exercise mean that corpulence is taking hold in developing populations too .
Already , two - thirds of U.S. adults and nearly one in three children are overweight or obese -- a condition that increases risks of diabetes , heart disease and other chronic illnesses .
FOX - 2 ENZYME IS THE TRIGGER
Experimenting on mice in the lab , Herzig and a team of scientists in Germany and Switzerland found that an enzyme called COX - 2 triggers development of fat cells to become brown fat , instead of white fat .
White adipose tissue hoards fat by using our bodies -- particularly our bellies and thighs -- as a large storage unit , while brown adipose tissue is a sparse form of fat that helps keep newborns warm and helps adults burn calories .
Once activated by cold temperatures , brown fat burns calories faster than regular fat .
The researchers , whose study was published in the journal Science on Thursday , also found that mice who were genetically engineered to produce high levels of COX - 2 burned energy faster and were protected from obesity .
Scientists estimate that as little as 50 grams of brown adipose tissue in a normal adult human would be enough to increase energy consumption by 20 percent .
“ That ’s not a lot of brown fat , but a big increase in energy burn , ” said Herzig .
“ And this type of transplantation idea has been tried out with other types of animals and other types of cells , so in principle it works . ”
COX - 2 is critical for the production of prostaglandins -- hormone - like substances that play a role in a wide range of functions essential to a healthy body , including regulation of the immune system .
Painkilling drugs called COX inhibitors like aspirin and ibuprofen block COX enzymes .
But Herzig said this does n’t mean that taking these drugs makes you fat , since the COX - 2 function needed for brown fat to burn calories operates differently .
We are now at the point where one can only sit back and cackle as the insanity unravels .
The president earlier agreed with his supervisor that the Economy is doing swell on a day when the market posted the 5th highest TRIN rating in history , the ECB is saying all is well even as Europe is about to implode , and now , S&P has just announced it has put Moody 's on creditwatch negative , the reason : " We believe there may be added risk to U.S. - based credit rating agency Moody 's business profile following recent U.S. legislation that may lower margins and increase litigation related costs for credit rating agencies . "
Just so you understand what is going on here - S&P : a credit rating agency , is downgrading Moody's , a credit rating agency , on concerns finreg will impair credit rating agencies .
Well , if " suiciding " your chief competitor is the best way to approach this situation , whatever works ...
Next week , Moody 's downgrades S&P , followed by another downgrade of Moody 's by S&P , until both companies bankrupt each other with a mutual D rating .
John Nash would be so proud .
Full press release :
Overview
We believe there may be added risk to U.S. - based credit rating agency Moody 's business profile following recent U.S. legislation that may lower margins and increase litigation related costs for credit rating agencies .
We are placing our ' A - 1 ' short - term rating for Moody 's on CreditWatch with negative implications .
We expect to resolve the CreditWatch listing in the near term .
Rating Action
On June 29 , 2010 , Standard & Poor 's Ratings Services placed its ' A - 1 ' short - term rating for Moody 's Corp. on CreditWatch with negative implications .
Rationale
The CreditWatch listing reflects our view that an increased level of business risk is likely following the announcement that the Financial Reform Conference Committee has reconciled bills from the U.S. Senate and House , and that the agreed upon legislation could result in a change in the applicable pleading standards for certain litigation brought against rating agencies .
According to our ratings criteria , we place ratings on CreditWatch when , in our view , there is a 50 % chance or more of a rating change , and CreditWatch reviews can be the result of regulatory changes ' impact on an issuer 's business .
The agreed upon legislation contains a provision whereby investors may be able to sue rating agencies if they can show that the agency knowingly or recklessly failed to conduct a reasonable investigation of the factual elements relied upon by a credit rating agency 's rating methodology , or obtain a reasonable verification of those factual elements from independent third - party sources .
While we believe it is likely that the new pleading standard will lead to an increase in litigation - related costs at Moody's , whether the new pleading standard would potentially increase the likelihood of successful litigation against Moody 's will be determined in the future by the courts .
Moody 's management has stated that it plans to adapt its business practices in an effort to partially offset any potential new litigation risks associated with the legislation .
Nevertheless , we believe that Moody 's may face higher operating costs , lower margins , and increases in litigation - related event risk , which would likely increase its business risk ( see discussion under Litigation in our Encyclopedia of Analytical Adjustments for Corporate Entities -- part of our Corporate Ratings Criteria ) .
In addition , if the final legislation removes many or all references to nationally recognized statistical rating organizations ( NRSROs ) from federal regulations , it may reduce investor demand for ratings .
While we believe the latter change is unlikely to meaningfully impair Moody 's business position over the near term , we plan to consider its long - term impact .
As per our criteria , greater business risk and lower profitability would be key factors in a potential downward revision of our evaluation of Moody 's business profile or a potential rating downgrade .
In addition , Moody 's business will likely undergo noticeable changes due to new global regulations and the U.S. legislation 's impact on industry risk , which are business risk considerations under our criteria .
While a potential weakening of Moody 's business profile is the driver for our CreditWatch listing , we will also consider the potential longer - term impact on the company 's financial profile ( see our business and financial risk profile matrix under the Analytical Methodology section of our Corporate Ratings Criteria ) .
The company currently has a strong financial profile , in our view , as demonstrated by good levels of profitability , a high level of conversion of its EBITDA generation to discretionary cash flow , low leverage , and high cash balances .
At March 2010 , Moody 's EBITDA margin was 46 % , the company 's conversion of EBITDA to discretionary cash flow was 45 % , our measure of total lease - adjusted debt to EBITDA was 2.0x , and cash balances were $ 504 million .
CreditWatch
We anticipate resolving the CreditWatch listing over the near term , following our review of the final legislation and its potential long - term impact on Moody 's business position .
In the event of a rating downgrade , we do not anticipate the short - term rating would be lowered to below ' A - 2 ' .
An affirmation of the current ' A - 1 ' commercial paper rating would likely involve a conclusion that the final legislation and new global regulations would not increase risk to Moody 's business position .
Who could have ever thought that charts and graphs might have anything to do with funny memes ?
No offense to statistics aficionados , but definitely not us , regular people .
Although graph designs and pie charts are seemingly the easiest way to convey important information , the themes are usually bland and remind us of our time at school .
Except for these unexpected , and frankly , really funny statistics , covering everything from daily life experiences to viral trends and random facts .
These funny graphs are the unholy love child of bored office workers , music and pop culture .
The types of graphs and their mash - up with music might find their origins in Something Awful forums – a darker corner of the internet that has just celebrated their 20th anniversary .
No matter what , these funny pie chart memes and graphs will definitely make your office - bored self , laugh .

Tens of thousands of people have been stopped in the street and searched unlawfully under controversial section 44 anti-terrorism powers , the Home Office has revealed .
Fourteen police forces are urgently trying to find the individuals involved so they can apologise to them after being told by the Home Office that errors had been found in the way 40 separate stop and search operations were authorised since the powers were introduced in 2001 .
Nick Herbert , the police minister , said in a Commons statement that the mistake was discovered after a freedom of information request triggered a review of the Metropolitan police 's section 44 records .
" The Met identified an authorisation from April 2004 which had not been confirmed by a Home Office minister within the statutory 48 - hour deadline for confirmation , " Herbert said .
" Subsequent investigations revealed that approximately 840 were stopped and searched in the relevant area during the period of the invalid authorisation . "
The Met is urgently considering what steps to take to contact the people involved .
The discovery triggered a Home Office search last month through all the records dating back to the introduction of section 44 in February 2001 .
The search revealed that 14 forces had unlawfully used their counter - terror stop and search powers in 40 different operations .
The Home Office said that in most of the cases authorisations were issued for periods beyond the 28 - day statutory limit for each operation or were not signed off by ministers within the statutory 48 - hour deadline .
The disclosure is another major blow to the police use of section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 , under which anyone can be stopped in a specific area without any need for suspicion that an offence is being committed .
The powers were used to stop 148,798 people last year and have been used repeatedly against peace protesters and photographers .
In a landmark judgment in January the European court of human rights ruled that the blanket use of section 44 across the whole of London was unlawful .
It criticised the lack of legal safeguards against abuse in the way the operations were authorised .
Coalition ministers stressed today that they had repeatedly criticised the arbitrary use of section 44 .
The home secretary , Theresa May , has said that the use of such counter - terror powers will be reviewed , with safeguards introduced to curb excesses .
Herbert said : " I am aware there is considerable concern about the operation of section 44 stop and search powers going beyond these authorisation errors .
" The government is committed to a wider review of counter - terror legislation , including the operation of section 44 stop and search provisions .
" Whilst I take some reassurance from the fact that no errors have occurred since December 2008 , when the authorisation process was tightened , I want to assure the House that there will be utmost vigilance in future .
" It is with the need for this in mind that I have instructed Home Office officials unconnected with the administrative process to conduct the internal review of procedures . "
The Met and City of London police have made the greatest use of stop and search , with 10 of the 40 illegal operations being in London .
Thames
Valley police were responsible for six of the illegal operations , Sussex five and Greater Manchester three .
Corinna Ferguson , a lawyer for Liberty who acted in the successful court of human rights challenge , said : " We are grateful to the government for making these blunders public , but they merely highlight the ongoing dangers of secret stop and search authorisations .
" This is one of many objections to a power that has been found unlawful in the court of human rights and has been more of a hindrance than a help to anti-terror policing . "
Senior police officers defended the continued use of section 44 .
Chief Constable Craig Mackey , the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) head for stop and search said : " Powers to stop and search can play an important part in keeping our communities safe from terrorism but should always be used in a proportionate way , recognising the critical need to retain local confidence .
" Where mistakes have been made in the application of these powers it is vital that we learn from them .
" In December 2008 the use of Section 44 was reviewed through Acpo and the National Policing Improvement Agency and practice advice issued to forces , supported by training .
No errors have been found in the application process since that date . "
He said each of the forces concerned , along with the Home Office , would " look at the implications where mistakes were made and Acpo will support that process " .
Mackey insisted that used correctly , section 44 powers could create a hostile environment for terrorists to operate in and help protect the public .
Just - released figures for the use of Terrorism Act 2000 powers show there were 148,798 stop and searches under section 44 in 2009 , a 40 % fall over the previous year .
A total of 688 arrests were made as result of these searches , an arrest rate of 0.5 % .
The Home Office statistics reveal there were 207 terrorism arrests in 2009 compared with 174 the previous year .
The 207 arrests led to 56 people being charged but only 23 of them for terrorism - related offences .
The rest were charged with non-terrorism crimes .
Ninety - five people were released without charge , and alternative action – mainly cautions or immigration proceedings – was taken against the remaining 56 .
The figures show there were 131 people in prison for terrorist or terrorist - related offences on 31 December 2009 .
The Conservative - Liberal Democrat coalition has proposed a ban on the identification of men accused of rape .
Which means that most men arrested on suspicion of rape will never be named because the vast majority never get to court .
What an absolute disgrace that the one issue relating to tackling sexual violence the new government proposes would end up being a shot in the arm for some rapists .
Unless 94 % of women are lying , then there are a shed load of guilty men getting away with rape , including those who are reported to the police .
If this law is passed they will be able to relax in the knowledge that if , as in the majority of cases , it does not even get to court , no one will be any the wiser .
When the arrest of black - cab driver John Worboys was made public many other women came forward ; ditto the teenagers in the notorious Owen Oyston and Peter Martin case back in the 1990s ; ditto the other victims of serial rapist and murderers John Duffy and David Mulcahy ; ditto countless other cases .
To grant anonymity would be to remove the one opportunity many women have of seeing their rapist questioned , let alone convicted .
" What about those falsely accused ? " I hear you cry .
" Their lives are ruined . "
In reality , rape is not really seen as a heinous crime , only those cases Whoopi Goldberg notoriously described as , " rape - rape " .
Indeed , the most commonplace rapes – those committed by partners , friends , acquaintances , family members and work colleagues – are often not considered rape at all , which is why the vast majority never get to court or are acquitted if they do .
A fair number of celebrities including footballers , musicians , actors and authors have been accused of rape in the past and do not seem to have suffered longer term .
To say that an accusation ruins lives is perhaps a sweeping generalisation .
Most arrests for rape do not get reported in the press unless the accused is famous or the circumstances highly unusual .
If such cases do make a brief mention in the local paper it is often no more than the community will already have learned from local gossip .
If we are to go down this road in order to protect those wrongly or falsely accused , why not extend it to murder , child abuse , and theft from employers – all of which carry a significant stigma .
Accusing a white person in a public sector role of racism is pretty damning in terms of reputation and career prospects , but I do not hear similar cries for anonymity .
Passing this law would boost the widely held belief that most women who report rape are lying .
The latest research on false allegations found that the figures are around the same as with other crimes .
If a woman is found to have made a malicious accusation of rape she loses the right to anonymity .
Media coverage of false allegations far outweighs reports of men arrested for rape .
Besides which , since when do laws get changed as a result of a tiny number of cases ?
Feminist lawyers are already in discussion about challenging this preposterous proposal through the sex discrimination and human rights legislation ( while we still have it ) .
To grant anonymity in rape cases we are saying that the problem is not with the estimated 75 to 95 % that never get reported ; the 94 % of reports that do not end in a conviction on the charge of rape ; or the widespread belief that women out drinking , flirting or just plain breathing ask for all we get .
The problem , according go the new government , is the fact that a tiny percentage of men accused are innocent .
Shame on the government .
Let 's campaign to ensure this proposal falls at the first hurdle .

Hackee Becomes Hacker as Palin has Johnston Computer Hacked
Advertisements
In the world of Sarah Palin , accusations are confessions and should always be taken thusly .
Palin ’s outrage over the email hacker was simply one finger pointed outward while four more pointed back at herself .
Palin has not only hacked a colleague ’s computer , but was also a party to harassing Levi Johnston ’s sister into getting rid of online photos during the campaign .
But Palin ’s harassment of the Johnston family apparently did not end there .
It seems that in 2008 , Sarah Palin and the McCain campaign had Mercede Johnston ’s computer wiped clean of all photos .
Mercede reported today on her new blog that she has always kept thousands of pictures on her computer and that during the campaign Levi and Bristol Palin yelled at her repeatedly telling her Sarah wanted her to take down her online photos of the Palin family , Trig , and Levi .
Mercede complied with this request .
But it got stranger .
The Johnstons were not to be trusted to answer their own phone or door during the campaign , and Mercede reports that “ two ladies ’ were sent to their house to keep her from talking to outsiders .
Mercede could not go to school due to the overwhelming curiosity and questions of everyone including teachers .
To put this in perspective , the Obama children ( whose father is actually President ) go to school every day .
During the time the two ladies were staying with the Johnstons ( one wonders if this is also during the time the Palins lent a phone to Mrs. Johnston which later was traced and led to her arrest for a crime that landed her in jail while Todd Palin ’s sister was guilty of similar crime but escaped an equivalent punishment , but I digress ) , Mercede ’s computer was suddenly wiped clean of … everything on it .
At least one of these ladies was actually on the payroll for the McCain campaign , as reported by Regina at Palingates .
Mercede recounts :
“ One morning I woke up to log on to my computer and to do some school work .
When I turned it on it would not let me log in .
It just went directly to the original Windows background …
There were absolutely no files , all my desktop icons were gone , and there was not ONE photo on my hard drive besides the “ Sample photos ” which came with the computer .
I immediately started to freak out and yell for my mom .
We called the local repair shop and I had my computer in his hands within hours .
He had my computer for about a week and called me to ask if he could keep it longer because he was very “ fascinated ” by how there was nothing left on it , and that it appeared to have been completely wiped clean .
He had worked on my computer previously so he KNEW there were once thousands of pictures , school work , documents , etc .
He also asked if I would n’t mind if a few computer friends / techs come in from Fairbanks and Washington .
By the time early December rolled around he told me he had over 12 techs look at my computer and that they spent days and days working on it , and searching for what had gone wrong , and could not figure it out …..
It was later that I started to put the puzzle pieces together , especially after the computer Tech said this had to be the work of someone from the Secret Service , or from some other branch of the government , because what happened to my computer was remarkable .
It did not click until just recently that perhaps the ladies who were supposedly “ protecting us ” by answering our phone , were really there to protect the Palins and had cleaned out my computer just to make sure there was nothing incriminating on it which might have caused a problem for the campaign . ”
Computers do not erase themselves magically .
Someone with a motive to hide the photos Mercede had on her computer got access to it and deleted them .
Mercede tells us of the Palins ’ harassment of her regarding the photos and comments she would leave online .
We also know that Sarah Palin had photos removed from her own parents ’ home during this time , as her father had unwittingly shown photos Palin did n’t want the world to see .
Concurrently , the Alaska Governor ’s website photos were also scrubbed .
By now , you ’re asking yourself what Sarah was trying to hide .
Or maybe you ’re sympathizing with a private Palin who just wanted her personal life kept personal .
But we all know Palin is n’t a private person .
Her use of her family and her children in particular is so well known her children are now referred to as “ props ” .
Palin is no Hillary Clinton in this regard ( or any other , I might add ) .
So , what ’s the big secret ?
That , my friend , is the subject of much debate – but this writer has been told that at least one photo exists that the world has not seen from the time period right before Palin “ gave birth ” .
( Update : I have been told of the photo , but have never seen it myself ) .
This photo rests in the hands of someone who is too scared to let it out , so let ’s just say the rumors that had been running wild through Alaska about Sarah and Bristol Palin in the months before Palin “ gave birth ” centered on a supposedly pregnant Bristol and an unpregnant Sarah and many photos seemingly confirm this rumor .
And why should this matter to America ?
It could be argued ( and I suspect it will be one day ) that Palin is a saint for adopting her fifth child .
And perhaps in this regard she will deserve some credit , as adoption is a wonderful thing .
But that wo n’t change the fact that Palin has presented her fifth child as her bona fides to the Pro-Life ( Anti-Choice ) movement .
It wo n’t change the fact that Palin lied to the American people as a Vice Presidential candidate .
And it wo n’t change the fact that Palin has some very suspicious medical records for someone who claims to be “ Pro - Life ” .
And it certainly wo n’t change the fact that whatever went on in the Palin family does not smack of family values .
It has the distinct odor of a cover - up for the sake of image , with no regard for the children involved .
But perhaps the most important aspect to this story is the lengths to which Palin , or someone working on her behalf , is willing to go in order to cover up whatever secrets she ’s hiding .
She had no qualms about infringing upon the liberty and freedom of the Johnston family in order to ruthlessly protect her own image and it ’s more than suspicious that Mrs. Johnston was arrested right after the campaign ( December of 2008 ) and locked up in a facility run by a Sarah Palin appointee whose management of the prisons has caused the prison guards ’ union to give him a vote of no confidence as well as causing an inmate to sue Sarah Palin in federal court over his alleged mistreatment .
In other words , this is not a prison you want to be in , especially if you are a perceived threat to Sarah Palin .
All of these actions speak to an already established pattern of Palin ’s ; she ’s a thug , a bully , and a person who views herself as above the law .
The computer of a young girl was wiped clean and the tech thinks only the Secret Service , or some other extremely advanced expert , could have done such a thorough job .
Sarah Palin was harassing Mercede about the very pictures on her computer that got wiped .
Palin willingly harassed a young person under the age of 18 in order to protect her own image .
This is the same Sarah Palin who was once warned by a judge to leave her sister ’s children alone , to stop “ abusing them ” by harassing their father .
Of course , Sarah did n’t listen to the judge then , and that situation turned into Troopergate .
Sarah Palin has an established pattern as an unconscionable liar , abuser , and bully .
She wraps her predatory ambition in the flag and a cross , but the damage she leaves in her wake does n’t resemble any of the values of this country or of Jesus .
“ I ’ll do whatever I want until the courts tell me I can ’t . ” ~~ Sarah Palin , Mayor of Wasilla
The next time Sarah Palin opens her mouth , twits a tweet , or takes to her Fraudbook page to denounce someone , remember the email hacker and Mercede Johnston ’s computer , and ask yourself what Sarah is really telling us .

Toronto Police are on the defensive this week as they attempt to defend their heavy - handed tactics during the G20 .
To prove the seriousness of the threat to public security , they took police on a tour of weapons confiscated from activists .
Only there 's a problem : some of these weapons were taken from people who were n't demonstrators .
And some of them were n't weapons — the police proudly displayed the blunt arrows and chainmail they confiscated from a live - action role - player who was taking the train to a game :
In addition to the arrows – which Mr. Barrett made safe for live - action role playing by cutting off the pointy ends and attaching a bit of pool noodle covered in socks – police displayed his metal body armour , foam shields and several clubs made of plastic tubing covered with foam and fabric .
Mr. Barrett said he was " appalled " at the placement of his chain - mail beneath a machete .
He regularly takes public transit from his Whitby , Ont. , home to Centennial Park to play the game , called Amtgard , while wearing the 85 - pound armour and is worried people will think : " Oh my God , that 's one of the terrorists from G20 . "
' Weapons ' seized in G20 arrests not what they seem

You can choose to ignore the weepiness if you want , though .
You might even find something useful to do while you wait out all those drawn - out dramatic pauses .
Sucked in ... The final eight MasterChef wannabes get all dramatic with Heston Blumenthal in London .

There have been other cooking shows before , of course , but it ’s hard not to be impressed by the role MasterChef has played in boosting the culinary confidence of a nation .

Fans divided over Joanne 's treatment
MasterChef : Latest news
------------------------
Yes , truth is , there are plenty of reasons to love MasterChef .
It ’s inspiring and it makes people think about what they ’re actually eating .
Not since Paris Hilton starred in her first unfortunate reality television show , One Night in Paris , has anything been so effective at making us think twice before putting something in our mouths .
We see pasta being made from scratch .
We learn how to shuck oysters and salt an eggplant and how to make our macaroons sleek and shiny — this all amounts to a better world .
As long as the cooking - to - crying ratio is tipped in favour of the cooking , it ’s an easy show to love .
But now , night after night , it ’s starting to feel like the artistic direction is influenced not so much by a Nigella Lawson as a Nigel Tufnel .
Spinal
Tap is the best comparison for the sort of kitchen behaviour that has become embarrassingly mock - rockstar - ish .
Of course , reality TV is not a genre that has ever shied away from histrionics but MasterChef has amped everything up to 11 this season and you have to wonder if it ’s a sustainable tactic .
Tension is created in the usual overwrought style .
Judges Gary , George and Matt do their best to outdo Hitchcock as masters of suspense .
And for all the cutting and slicing that happens in front of the camera , we know that the more important stuff is happening behind the scenes in the editing suite .
But there ’s still a lot of fun to be had with the ridiculous dramatics as long as you know where to look .
Keeping one eye on the Twitter news feed and one on the telly is a good way to cope .
Perhaps you ’ll even enjoy a lively game of MasterChef bingo while you watch ( thanks to writer Clem Bastow , you can find cards for this game online ) .
In small ways such as these , the overemotional MasterChef moments can be skilfully wrangled back to the realm of the pisstakingly bearable .
And thank god , because it really is such a splendid show most of the time .
And , like every fine melodrama , half the fun is in anticipating the action , a TV version of pantomime ’s , ‘‘ HE’S BEHIND YOU ’’.
The creators have so skilfully presented the stars of the show that , as the series reaches its final stages , the stories almost write themselves .
For example , if we imagine ourselves as flies on the wall of the MasterChef kitchen , we look on knowingly as Callum expertly shifts his manner from tearful to cheerful with a twitch of his nose .
Marion smiles a smile so saint - like that stigmatas spontaneously appear on both hands and feet .
The blood is quickly wiped away with Handee Ultra in accordance with health , safety and sponsorship guidelines .
Aaron gets the final two letters of his chosen facial expression confused and comes out with a smirk instead of a smile .
It ’s a catastrophe reminiscent of the paprika / nutmeg incident .
‘‘ I ’m kicking myself ! ’’ he wails .
Claire decides to recreate the melancholy mien of a distant relative and her eyes suddenly become misty lagoons .
Adam gets sniffly just watching .
Meanwhile , Joanne ’s pout is offered a spin - off show of its own .
‘‘ Think from the heart and the rest will take part ! ’’
George bellows and Alvin , always a sucker for poetry , starts bawling .
Over in the corner , one solitary tear slides competitively down Jonathan ’s bestubbled cheek , but that shot does n’t make the final cut so we never find out he has feelings .
Matt Preston saunters in and smashes some perfectly good crockery , announcing that everything ’s disgusting , until he notices several emotionally shattered contestants cracking open cyanide pills .
He quickly explains he means disgustingly good .
Everyone sobs with relief and kisses his feet .
Realising he ’s become a caricature of himself , Matt starts weeping , too , until Gary sashays in and cheers everyone up with a trip to London .
Money starts raining down inexplicably from the ceiling and everyone goes back to whooping with delight .
The winner of MasterChef 2010 is MasterChef 2010 .
If only we could slice up this brilliant but ludicrous show and just keep the part that does n’t treat us like idiots .
Then those over - the - top , manipulative moments that make us groan like we ’ve just eaten something rotten , can be chucked into a bin labelled with those legendary words of eliminated contestant Matthew : ‘‘ An offal mistake ’ ’ .

Antarctic glacier melting due to hidden ice ridge ( rather than climate change )
An underwater ridge could explain why a major glacier in the Antarctic is melting more quickly than ever before , according to a new study .
Scientists used a robot submarine to make a 3D map of the ocean under the ice shelf at the end of the Pine Island Glacier in western Antarctica .
They discovered that the ice was no longer resting on a subsea ridge that had slowed the glacier 's slide until the early 1970s .
The discovery means that the glacier 's more rapid melting in recent years could be due to the flow of warmer sea water beneath it rather than climate change , as had previously been believed .
Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey have been inspecting the glacier and believe that a deepsea ice ridge is behind it melting more rapidly
Adrian Jenkins , of the British Antarctic Survey , said the study raised ' new questions about whether the current loss of ice from Pine Island Glacier is caused by recent climate change or is a continuation of a longer - term process that began when the glacier disconnected from the ridge ' .
Loss of contact with the subsea ridge meant that ice was flowing faster and also thawing more as sea water just above freezing flowed into an ever bigger cavity that now extended 30 km beyond the ridge .
Antarctica is key to predicting the rise in sea levels - it has enough ice to raise sea levels by 187 ft if it all melted .
West Antarctica's thaw accounts for 10 per cent of the recent rise in sea levels , with the Pine Island glacier melting far more quickly in recent decades .
Scientists detected a ridge beneath the glacier which has now vanished
Satellite photographs in the early 1970s had shown a bump on the surface of the ice shelf , indicating the subsea ridge .
That bump has vanished and the submarine found the ridge was now up to 100 metres below the ice shelf .
' We found something very unexpected , ' said co-author Pierre Dutrieux , from the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) .
' Acoustic instruments on the submarine told us that there was a ridge at the bottom of the ocean , sitting transverse to the flow of ice . '
' Some decades ago , the glacier was sitting on this ridge and the friction of the ridge was restraining the flow of the glacier , ' he explained .
' When the glacier became detached from the ridge , the ice flow was able to accelerate significantly . '
Dutrieux said the ice may have started thinning because of some as yet - unknown mechanism linked to climate change , blamed mainly on mankind 's use of fossil fuels .
' It could be a shift in the wind , due to a change in climate , that pushed more warm water under the shelf , ' he said .
A chunk of ice that has started to break away from the Antarctic ice shelf .
A new study has shown that a submerged ice shelf may be to blame for some recent melting of a glacier
Dr Dutrieux said : ' We now know that there is relatively warm water beneath this floating ice so this warm water could have been able to melt the base of the ice shelf .
' Another process leading to the ice becoming detached from the ridge could have been a change in the water properties that was grinding the shelf from beneath . '
The U.N. panel of climate scientists projected in 2007 that world sea levels could rise by between 7 - 24 inches by 2100 , excluding risks of faster melting in Antarctica and Greenland .
The study was published in the journal Nature Geoscience .
Starbusians throughout the United States are no doubt cheering today 's news from the mothership : " We 're very excited to announce that coming July 1st : Free. 1 click .
No registration WIFI at all US locations ! "
As my friend @sfslim replied , " Sadly , given @Starbucks ubiquity , this may be the closest we get to nationwide municipal Internet access for years . "
ReadWriteWeb reports that the newly free access is part of a planned " free access to paid content " offering to roll out in the fall :
According to Starbucks , this new service , called the " Starbucks Digital Network , " will give users who surf the Internet from U.S. company owned stores access to " various paid sites and services such as wsj.com , exclusive content and previews , free downloads , local community news and activities , on their laptops , tablets or smart phones . "
Besides the Wall Street Journal , Starbucks ' partners include Apple 's iTunes , The New York Times , Patch , USA TODAY , Yahoo and ZAGAT .

As promised , a few more camping photos , as well as the recipe for the grilled tofu and soba noodles I made the second night out .
As I mention down in the recipe head notes , aside from grilling the tofu , I prepped everything before we left for Salt Point State Park .
The pre-cooked soba noodles hung out in the cooler in a plastic bag next to the garlic - cilantro dressing , which stayed bright green , ready to go in a little jar .
It worked out great , dinner came together in no time , and for the most part I could sit around and read , or wander about with my camera .
This ( above ) was n't far from our campsite .
Just a walk down the hill .
You can't see them here , but there were seals lounging around on rocks just off - shore , and seagulls cherry - picking stranded critters out of the tide pools .
A walk in the opposite direction led to Gestle Cove , a protected area , where we sat with the sun setting behind us , looking at all the different seaweed , driftwood , and rock shapes washed up on the beach .
If you find yourself in that neighborhood ( Sonoma / Mendocino coasts ) , but are n't necessarily the camping type , I also love the Mar Vista Cottages .
We stayed there last year for a couple nights .
Each cottage has a kitchen , and you can pick fresh produce from the organic garden to cook with .
Fresh eggs from the hens on the property are delivered by basket each day .
It 's a great base to explore that part of the coast .
A number of you were asking about past camping trips .
This adventure to Whiskeytown Lake in Shasta County was particularly painful memorable .
Aside from that , I posted a few cooking / camping links a few years back .
And for those of you who missed the last write - up , here 's the Soup au Pistou on the dinner menu the second night we were there .
I have to say , as much as I enjoy camping on occasion , I do feel the need to balance them out with slightly posher get - aways ; ) ...
So , now it 's my turn to throw things back in your direction .
What 's your all - time favorite camping memory , best meal , or absolute favorite campground ??
If you had to pick just one to share .
Looking forward to hearing some of your stories .

My heart wanted to ask her :
What will it take for Jews to say , Enough !
My heart wanted to ask her :
What will it take for Jews to say , Enough !
By Tema Okun
I ’m not very proud of myself right now .
Yesterday , I was one of those shouting at the men and women who had come with their Israeli flags , their righteous arrogance , their anger to disrupt our protest organized to declare support for the Freedom Flotilla and the Free Gaza movement .
Central to this story is that I am a Jew .
I am a Jew who has spent four summers in Palestine witnessing the toll that more than 40 years of Israeli occupation has taken on a people and on a land .
I am a Jew who has come to understand , as the sign I was holding yesterday attests , that we are forsaking Jewish values for the sake of a Jewish state .
And because I have seen Palestinian homes demolished for illegal Israeli land grab , because I have met the fathers and mothers and children suddenly homeless , because I have seen the 30 foot Wall standing like a sentinel on the landscape separating Palestinian farmers from their fields and livelihoods , because I have witnessed the disdain of young Jewish soldiers for the elderly , the pregnant , the young that they so thoughtlessly control at the checkpoints , because I have seen the Jewish settlers taking over hillside after hillside of Palestinian land , I feel literally sick about what is being done in my name .
“ We are doing what has been done to us , ” I found myself shouting at one of the women standing underneath an Israeli flag , unable to stop myself from making this dangerous comparison that I know is sure to inflame .
She turned to me , with as vile a tone as I had just offered , charging “ how dare you trivialize the Holocaust ?
Have we put people in gas camps ? ”
I had no reply , having started the obstructive exchange , but my heart wanted to ask her if this is what it will take for her and others like her to come to their senses ; at the point Israel begins to put people in camps and gas them , then will we say “ enough ” ?
At what point do we begin to wonder whether we have become the very thing we say we fear ?
To my mind , Israel reached that point long ago ; the Jews who uncritically support all that Israel does have reached that point ; and ironically , tragically , I have reached that point myself .
I have become what I say I fear as I yelled at another older man , standing quite calmly beside me , doing nothing to provoke like his other Israel - supporting companions .
He started off with a simple question , one I do n’t even remember now , and my mind went blank as I began yelling at him “ we ’re selling our souls to the Devil , ” “ we ’re selling our souls to the Devil ” – I must have repeated the line 5 or 6 times with a very loud and agitated voice .
My fear shut me down , reduced me to a recitation of angry slogans , direct cousin to the fear that brought those who tolerate no criticism of Israel to the rally to shout us down .
You see , my fear is that the Jewish community is growing in its capacity to justify anything and everything in the name of Israel .
We have , as I shouted so loudly to the man standing so quietly beside me , sold our soul to the Devil in the belief that somehow that will make us safe .
Five minutes watching any footage of the damage wrought on innocent civilians in Gaza a year ago ; five minutes reading about the humanitarian and economic devastation , a collective punishment on families , women , and children who live there ; five minutes talking to any Palestinian who has lost a home , a job , loved ones to Occupation will testify to our collective ability to deny our culpability in the oppression of a people and a land .
Their fear , well I can’t really speak to that , because I am so much more afraid of what we are becoming than of any threat .
I am more concerned about what it means to survive as a Jewish people if we become completely defined by our stubborn unwillingness to see the “ other ” as human , as complex , as complicated as we see ourselves .
Those holding the Israeli flags yesterday do not see Palestinians as the men , women , and children they are , with their own individual hopes , desires , longings .
They do n’t understand that Palestinian parents witnessing the killing of their children by bombs dropped on Gaza grieve as hard and deep at these deaths as Israelis do when their loved ones are killed ( which happens much less frequently , not that I want to suggest a competition about death counts ) .
They do n’t understand that Palestinian men , women , and children enjoy eating good food , drinking strong coffee , telling stories with family and friends in the same ways that we enjoy doing those same things .
All they see is threat and this fear allows them to justify anything .
And me , I do n’t see these diehard Israel supporters as human in my turn , because I hate their inability to see the Palestinians as fully human , and as a result I am unable to appreciate their complexity , their complications .
And so it goes , this cycling around of fear and hatred .
I expect and want more from myself than this .
I know I am capable of it because I have seen this capacity in other areas of my life .
What will it take , I wonder , for the Jewish community to wake up to what we are doing ?
What will it take , I wonder , for me to bring compassion to this question ?
For what I know for sure is that any hope for our collective survival , our collective ability to thrive , depends on our ability to see ourselves in the other .
This skill starts with us , this skill starts with me , and so I ’m not very proud of myself right now .
Originally published at Mondoweiss .
The first of three investigations into the CRU emails has been released .
You can read the British House of Commons ’ entire report here , but I found the summary on page 7 to be just as useful .
In part , it reads :
We believe that the focus on CRU and Professor Phil Jones , Director of CRU , in particular , has largely been misplaced .
Whilst we are concerned that the disclosed emails suggest a blunt refusal to share scientific data and methodologies with others , we can sympathise with Professor Jones , who must have found it frustrating to handle requests for data that he knew – or perceived – were motivated by a desire simply to undermine his work .
In the context of the sharing of data and methodologies , we consider that Professor Jones ’s actions were in line with common practice in the climate science community .
It is not standard practice in climate science to publish the raw data and the computer code in academic papers .
However , climate science is a matter of great importance and the quality of the science should be irreproachable .
We therefore consider that climate scientists should take steps to make available all the data that support their work ( including raw data ) and full methodological workings ( including the computer codes ) .
Had both been available , many of the problems at UEA could have been avoided .
We are content that the phrases such as “ trick ” or “ hiding the decline ” were colloquial terms used in private e-mails and the balance of evidence is that they were not part of a systematic attempt to mislead .
Likewise the evidence that we have seen does not suggest that Professor Jones was trying to subvert the peer review process .
Academics should not be criticised for making informal comments on academic papers .
In the context of Freedom of Information ( FOIA ) , much of the responsibility should lie with UEA .
The disclosed e-mails appear to show a culture of non-disclosure at CRU and instances where information may have been deleted , to avoid disclosure .
We found prima facie evidence to suggest that the UEA found ways to support the culture at CRU of resisting disclosure of information to climate change sceptics .
The failure of UEA to grasp fully the potential damage to CRU and UEA by the non-disclosure of FOIA requests was regrettable .
UEA needs to review its policy towards FOIA and re-assess how it can support academics whose expertise in this area is limited .
DeSmogBlog also has a great summary which you can read here .
We know that the system of climate science is not perfect , and that the folks at CRU did not handle things in the best of ways all the time , but who ever does , especially when you are the target of organized campaigns to discredit your field ?
The real problem , though , is that everyone who keeps up with North American or British news heard that climate scientists were accused of fudging and manipulating data .
There is no evidence to support these allegations , and the House of Commons ’ report confirms this .
However , I ’m not naive enough to believe that the media will cover the result of this “ scandal ” as intensely as they covered the allegations themselves .
Imagine that you read in the newspaper that a man has been charged with murder .
It will be months before you find out the verdict of his trial , and unless it ’s OJ Simpson , you probably wo n’t hear the verdict at all .
Many , perhaps most , people would assume that the man is guilty .
We assume that allegations have merit , when – at least when it comes to climate science – they just as often do not .

The SSV Robert C. Seamans safely docked this morning in Honolulu , Hawaii at 0800 .
Docklines now tether the ship to a distant shore and her flags fly proudly in the steady northeast trade winds .
The stunning backdrop of the Diamond Head volcanic crater silhouettes the tall masts of our ship as we conclude the final moments of our voyage .
We mustered one last time on the ship ’s quarterdeck to say goodbye to our shipmates and to reflect on our accomplishments .
We have completed the Plastics at SEA : North Pacific Expedition 2012 , an historic , 2,600 - nautical mile , 36 - day journey .
Through the teamwork and exceptional efforts by the entire ship ’s crew of 38 people , we have successfully sailed the Robert C. Seamans from San Diego , CA through the North Pacific subtropical gyre and down to the Hawaiian Islands .
Our oceanographic research mission has been fulfilled by our dedicated scientists , researchers , and hardworking crew who spent countless hours deploying sampling equipment and tallying the plastic pieces retrieved in our nets .
The ship was kept safe and running smoothly by the never ending vigilance and constant care from her devoted …

You 're an elite knight tasked with protecting the kingdom from relentless hordes of orcs .

The Beatles crossing Abbey Road .
Jimi Hendrix kneeling over a burning guitar .
Bo Diddley ’s horn - rim glasses and square Gretsch .
Elvis Presley ’s pompadour .
Rock ‘n ’ roll has been defined by images as much as by power chords and amps that go to 11 .
But as many people know , there ’s a thriving global punk scene with its own images that has been largely invisible to the mainstream since its inception in the ’70s .
And one of the most popular icons of this underground is Maximum Rocknroll magazine .
“ I think of that picture of Robert Plant with his arm in the air , with the mic and the light shining behind him , bare - chested with the vest thing on , ” said Paul Curran , longtime volunteer with Maximum Rocknroll .
“ We ’re the opposite of that . ”
Maximum Rocknroll has been a beloved indie music publication for more than a quarter - century .
The monthly magazine survives on a shoestring budget and an army of volunteers , whom it lovingly calls “ shitworkers . ”
This year MRR released its first photography issue in quite some time , interviewing punk shooters and showcasing contributions from MRR ‘s global readership .
Punk ’s in - your - face aesthetic is as different from detached rock stars as Maximum ‘s anti-commercial stance is from corporate magazines .
Despite the dire financial straights of many media outlets , including MRR , the photo issue has sold out , proving there ’s still life underground .
Read on to see photos from the issue and take a look inside a world of cramped basements and distorted guitars .
Update :
This is not MRR ‘s first photography issue , as the post originally stated , but it has been a while since their last one .

The Mummies ruled the low - fi roost for the late ’ 80s and early ’90s , touring around in a derelict ambulance and leaving a trail of rags in their wake .
In addition to curating MRR ‘s weekly photo blog , Murrmann is photo editor for Mother Jones and contributes to San Francisco photo collective Hamburger Eyes .
Magazine spreads and album jackets have boasted many celebrated names , but MRR intentionally approached lesser - known contemporary shooters for its photography issue .
“ We try and get across the idea that you could be on stage , you could be writing the scene report , you could be taking the photo , ” said English transplant Layla Gibbons , one of two magazine coordinators at MRR .
“ The reader is the person that creates punk . ”
Former coordinator Mark Murrman nurtured the issue from a desire to interview Bay Area shooter Chris “ Canderson ” Anderson ( not Wired magazine editor - in - chief Chris Anderson ) .
“ The intention was just that there ’s a lot of great punk photographers out here , ” he said , speaking on the phone from his desk at Mother Jones .
“ Not only whose work should be seen but it would be interesting to know more about them . ”
Maximum has a long - standing policy of not accepting advertisements , reviewing albums or interviewing bands on major labels or labels distributed by majors .
Regardless of the draw bigger acts may have had for newsstand sales , no photographs were run of anyone who had left the underground .

One of San Francisco ’s first punk bands , Crime ’s greatest moment of notoriety was playing San Quentin Penitentiary while wearing police uniforms .
Lily Chou is a traveling photographer who runs the website Jetlag Rocknroll .
Maximum Rocknroll began as a Bay Area radio show in the late ’ 70s .
The loudest voice and driving force behind the microphone was Tim Yohannan .
Alongside other future luminaries Jello Biafra , Jeff Bale and Ruth Schwartz , the staff pushed politics and activism on listeners in between spinning the latest punk records .
In 1982 the radio show staff conspired with Biafra ’s upstart Alternative Tentacles record label to release the double - LP compilation Not So Quiet on the Western Front .
The project intentionally focused on lesser - known bands from places not affiliated with a nationally known scene , and the MRR founders included politicized essays and a newsprint booklet designed by participants .
Thus Maximum Rocknroll was born .
The magazine quickly became recognized as an authoritative voice propelled by Yohannan ’s hardline ethics and a transient crew of volunteers .
Readers were invited to contribute , creating a diverse and international dialogue through letters , scene reports and interviews .
Other articles railed against the empty commodification of culture politics .
MRR was never a profit - seeking endeavor , and extra cash flow is routinely donated to smaller fanzines , labels and special projects .
Volunteers were received with open arms –- mohawks not required .
Along with stature came criticism .
Maximum is often pegged as a monolithic entity espousing the one true philosophy of punk .
Derided as politically correct scene police , malcontents and former columnists have started alternative rags to circumvent the perceived ethics or aesthetics .
“ We cover DIY , underground punk rock , ” said Curran , who has been with the magazine since 1983 .
“ I guess some people will get all uppity about it , ‘ Oh why wo n’t you take this , or this , or that ?’.
To us it ’s because that ’s not what we want .
Go start your own magazine . ”

9 Shocks Terror was a Cleveland hardcore band that toured and recorded for more than years .
Canadian photographer Jason Penner shoots for fun , plays bass in bands and runs Primitive Air - Raid Records .
MRR has been there through every stage of punk ’s anti-style and documented each one in its pages .
The genre ’s visual language has always been an international collaboration , starting with the Ramones ’ debut platter in 1976 , which effectively deflated the then - rampant deification of musicians .
Roberta Bayley ’s shot of the band standing before a brick wall was as shocking as the record ’s shorter , louder , faster songs .
The vanguard of this style bounced back and forth between New York and London .
English bands took the confrontational look of their peers and contorted it by shredding their clothes and coloring their hair .
When records landed from abroad , American bands took this new image and appropriated the style once more .
The visual cliches of punk revolve around the postcard pastiche of England ’s 1977 or American hardcore ’s watershed 1982 scene .
Historical reverence has become a unifying thread that ties disparate communities together , making widespread scenes instantly recognizable while adding their own embellishments .
“ The Indonesian scene is more crusty , whereas the Russian scene is more ’90s emo and hardcore and youth crew .
Everyone has a different perspective on what punk or what hardcore is but then there are definitely connections , ” said coordinator Gibbon .
“ Making things happen in different ways because of where they live , but doing it because they have to do it . ”
Photo : Warkrime , by Larry Wolfley .
Bay Area band Warkrime has riled audiences with its confrontational attitude toward political ideologies and flippant use of derogatory terms .
Larry Wolfley was recently asked by producers of American Idiot : The Musical to provide photographs from Gilman Street to be projected during the show .
The media often stereotype punk as being violent , drug - fueled and nihilistic .
And sometimes rightly so .
Places and periods — early ’ 80s East Coast hardcore and Orange County , California — have deservedly bad reputations for violence .
London , New York and San Francisco have always been rife with drugs .
But while celebrities of the scene are capitalizing on former notoriety in recent books and movies , MRR has always supported a more politicized form of anarchy .
“ Rather than the fucking American Hardcore movie where people were like , ‘ Dude , everything was so crazy back then , ' ” Curran said .
“ Yeah , there was crazy stuff too but there was also stuff like a cool teenage band that plays bicycles .
There was all kinds of things going on . ”
The early ’90s saw the advent of a musical movement dubbed Riot Grrrl .
This aggressively feminist movement abandoned punk ’s traditionally secretive stance and worked to subvert the media spotlight .
“ I came up in that era where it was sort of a weird thing of using the media to get women into punk , ” said Gibbon , who was in the early - 90s English band Skinned Teen .
“ Bikini Kill had this thing where they were like , ‘ Girls should rule towns , ’ so they wanted to appeal to every girl . ”
Efforts to engage the media in a constructive manner resulted in misunderstanding , misrepresentation and eventually a backlash .
Magazines focused on bands ’ confrontational dismantling of sexuality to discuss femininity , abuse and rape .
MRR interviewed the contentious band Bikini Kill and ran the complete transcript .
“ The way that that was projected , it just sort of becomes another aesthetic , another image , ” Gibbon said .
“ Especially with the way that [ Bikini Kill frontwoman ]
Kathleen Hannah was depicted in the media , as ‘ She ’s an angry stripper . ’
It just kind of reduces a complicated subject to a cypher rather than a complete person .
You just become a cartoon . ”

Cheap cameras and an endless amount of exposures are fueling a flood of new images from around the world .
The idea of community running through punk invites novices to the table while also informing the style of shots .
“ They ’re all from the crowd .
They ’re all fucking coming at you .
I also love the ones that are n’t bands , too , ” Curran , who also contributed a couple pictures , said .
“ Two kids sitting at the door of Gilman .
Just looking snotty . ”

For the photography issue , Murrman put a call out over the internet asking people to submit shots of scenes from around the world .
More than a thousand images came in response , from places as remote as Indonesia , Poland and Taiwan .
A dream list of interviewees was drafted and requests sent across the States , South America and Europe .
One common snipe at punk is that it ’s white , male - dominated , and middle class .
Prior to taking over as coordinator , Gibbon interviewed women for MRR who had been essentially written out of punk ’s history .
Similarly the magazine focuses on the contributions of gay people and racial minorities to the scene .
“ I see a lot of races , I see a lot of women –- not saying that was all affirmative action , either .
Right now especially there is a lot of that in the scene , ” said Curran .
“ But I ’m sure that on Mark ’s part he looked at this pile and thought , ‘ Are there enough women represented ? ' ”
Photo : Human Eye , by Chris Anderson
Detroit band Human Eye has a penchant for constructing its own sci- fi masks and throwing fish heads around during shows .
Chicago - born Chris “ Canderson ” Anderson regularly contributes photos to the website Victim of Time .
Participants , from interviewees to the people who submitted images , are from the scene .
None are being paid for the time they spend at shows or editing their shots .
Murrman , who pursued journalism prior to becoming photo editor , started shooting as a hobby .
“ I think that the community aspect comes out the most in the interviews , ” said volunteer Curran .
“ You see that these are n’t people who are photographers at shows ; these are punks at the shows who are good at taking pictures .
They ’re not there as photographers .
And that probably is a uniquely punk thing . ”

The Feelers raged around the world before crashing and burning at the end of the decade .
Brazilian Mateus Mondini makes up one - half of photozine Fodido e Xerocado .
The volume of content pouring in killed the idea of running large - format pictures , and instead , three - page variations for pictures were created by the zine ’s layout designer .
Contributors with several shots would have dedicated space with the rest of the pages creating an international hodgepodge .

Toronto ’s Career Suicide has been touring the globe on the strength of its blistering hardcore assault .
German shooter Patrick Baclet just published a collection , Out of Vogue .
Maximum has amassed an impressive collection of photographs over its long existence .
Reader - contributed scene reports are responsible for the bulk of the archive , but because of the magazine ’s focus on contemporary bands , the organization of the photos leaves much to be desired .
“ It ’s five boxes of photos from fucking 25 years ago .
That ’s it , that ’s the filing system , ” said Curran .
“ [ Yohannan ] was not an archivist , and I ’m really amazed he even kept these photos .
He just kind of threw things away willy - nilly . ”
Despite talk of publishing a proper photo book or making images available online , progress has stopped at a Monday photo blog .
An archival site , Operation Phoenix , has made the magazine ’s first 50 issues available as PDFs .
Carrying on in print will require careful steps .
Most major competitors of MRR have disappeared , but the empty playing field has not made life easier for the struggling magazine .
Higher - quality covers to appeal to more retailers , pushing merchandise and accepting advertisements from corporations are current arguments to decide the fate of an enduring institution .
“ I think that when the magazine has to compromise its values significantly it should n’t exist , ” said Gibbon .
“ We have talked about the end times , but I ’m optimistic and I think that we have a few more years of fraught existence before that ’s a reality . ”

Image caption Police have been criticised for their use of stop and search powers
Thousands of people across the UK might have been stopped and searched illegally , figures released by the Home Office suggest .
Powers under section 44 of the Terrorism
Act were used in " error " after the proper authorisations were not given .
In one example , for April 2004 , the Met Police wrongly stopped 840 people .
Dozens of other examples from across the UK have been uncovered before rules were tightened in 2008 .
Police Minister Nick Herbert said administrative errors were to blame and he has ordered an internal review of procedures .
The Metropolitan Police is also urgently considering what steps can be taken to contact the individuals concerned .
Extremists
Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 allows police to stop and search someone without suspicion that an offence has occurred .
The controversial powers can be used only in specific areas on the orders of a police chief , with later approval by the home secretary .
Stop and search can work well when it is carried out with the support and understanding of the community Chief Constable Craig Mackey , Acpo
Supporters say such powers can make it harder for extremists to carry out reconnaissance in public areas , such as near high - profile tourist attractions .
But critics , including the government 's reviewer of terror legislation , Lord Carlile , say they unfairly target some ethnic groups and increase community tensions .
The Met is responsible for the vast majority of section 44 operations , many of which take place in Westminster and at major transport hubs or " iconic " tourist sites such as Buckingham Palace .
The force only discovered the April 2004 blunder after a request was made under the Freedom of Information Act earlier this year .
Officials researching stop and search authorisations found a Home Office minister had not signed within 48 hours .
A Met spokesman said the mistake was not noticed in 2004 due to an " oversight " and procedures have been reviewed .
Analysis Can it get any worse for Section 44 ?
The anti-terrorism stop - and - search powers have been a source of complaint for almost a decade .
In 2009 , Lord Carlile , the independent reviewer of terror laws , said the use of Section 44 gave rise to more " assertions of excessive and disproportionate police action " than any other counter - terrorism measure .
When the European Court of Human Rights declared the powers illegal in January , it said they did not contain " adequate legal safeguards against abuse " .
Now comes the revelation that police were unlawfully granted the powers to carry out stops 40 times .
Several thousand people may have been affected and in theory they could sue the authorities for compensation .
But identifying them and proving they were stopped could be a problem - for instance , one force , the Met , has deleted records of stops carried out in 2001 .
But with the terrorism threat level still at " severe " and growing concern about security during the 2012 London Olympics , ministers wo n't rush to ditch the powers .
Instead , expect a review to conclude that Section 44 should be re-fashioned so that it complies with human rights laws and is applied more sparingly .
Asked whether the force now faced a flood of legal actions , he said : " It is a matter for individuals to seek legal advice in relation to this issue . "
The spokesman also denied the force had misled the public , saying : " The Met first became aware of the issue in April 2010 during the process of compiling data in answer to a Freedom of Information request .
" All public statements issued before that date were made in good faith and there was no intention to mislead the public . "
The Met case sparked a trawl for errors across the UK .
Officials discovered 33 occasions when forces asked for a 29 - day search window , even though the legislation only allows a maximum of 28 days .
In two cases , forces asked for 30 days .
' Public confidence '
The Home Office has written to each of the 14 police forces concerned to alert them to the errors .
It said the forces were now in the process of assessing how many individuals were illegally stopped and searched and would " do their best to contact those involved " .
Security Minister Baroness Neville - Jones said : " I am very concerned by these historical administrative errors .
To maintain public confidence in our counter - terrorism powers , it is absolutely crucial all those responsible for exercising them do so properly .
" I take these matters extremely seriously and have instructed the department to conduct an urgent review of current procedures to ensure that errors can be prevented in future .
" The government is already committed to undertaking a review of counter - terrorism legislation which will include the use of stop and search powers in section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 .
We shall make our findings known as soon as possible . "
Officials at the Home Office , National Policing Improvement Agency ( NPIA ) and Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) are examining the mistakes .
The 40 flawed operations uncovered by officials include three which have previously been identified as being based on flawed paperwork .
The forces involved are : Metropolitan Police , North Yorkshire , Hampshire , Bedfordshire , Essex , Greater Manchester , Fife , South Wales and Thames Valley .
Invalid operations linked to Sussex Police and South Wales Police have been highlighted to Parliament previously .
Acpo lead officer on stop and search , Chief Constable Craig Mackey , said : " Stop and search can work well when it is carried out with the support and understanding of the community .
Used correctly , it can create a hostile environment for terrorists to operate in and help protect the public . "
In January this year , the powers were ruled illegal by the European Court of Human Rights .
The new coalition government has said it is reviewing their use , as part of a wider overhaul of anti-terror legislation .
The Water Conflict in Ecuador
Powerful interests are colliding in Ecuador , and at the center of it all is water .
The South American country is trying to decide who has the rights to water , who will control it , how will it be developed , and who will benefit .
While a series of public consultations is part of the picture , political negotiations are being overshadowed by an upwelling of determined protest .
The sides of the conflict can be summarized as the government and big business vs. the indigenous communities , but of course it ’s more complicated than that .
The Ecuadoran Constitution , approved in 2008 , states , ‘ The human right to water is fundamental and unrenounceable .
Water is a strategic national asset for the public use , inalienable , irrevocable , unappropriable and essential for life . ’ ( my translation )
Many people in Ecuador feel that this means that water can not be privatized , but can only be managed by the public authorities .
Nevertheless , several multinational corporations have acquired concessions to provide water services .
For example , in Guayaquil a foreign owned company , Interagua , received a concession to develop the drinking water supply in 1991 , funded by an Inter - American Development Bank loan .
Interagua continues to make profits , but despite the residents paying and paying on that loan , thousands of people in Guayaquil still do n’t have potable water service .
In other areas , international companies have received concessions to construct reservoirs for electricity generation and to transfer water to other regions , to the detriment of local and downriver people .
In other cases , mining operations have been allowed to use and contaminate water sources .
Impunity Watch says , “ Forty - five percent of water resources have been privatized through legal concessions , but one percent of those using water resources consume sixty - four percent of the water available and eighty - six percent of Ecuadorians consume just thirteen percent of the country ’s water . ”
The result has been years of protests organized by the historically marginalized indigenous groups and campesino organizations .
And not the harshly - worded - letter variety of protest , either , as they see a resource essential for their livelihoods , water , taken out of their hands and given to wealthy businesses .
The response has involved thousands of people blocking roads , marching in the streets and rioting , and there have been violent confrontations that have resulted in arrests and even death .
Over the last year , the government has been working on passing a new water bill , the Hydraulic Resources Law , which would , as I understand it , allow the concessions to stand , codify privatization of water rights and centralize decision - making at the state level , possibly further excluding traditional local water - management structures from the process .
In the last weeks an estimated 10,000 protesters have descended on the capitol city of Quito , trying to stop the bill as it comes before the national assembly .
They argue that the Law would violate the constitutional guarantee that water is a public asset , as well as the constitutional guarantee that environmental and ecosystem interests be preserved .
The protesters have had some measure of success , as the bill has not come up for a vote .
Just this week , a proposal to postpone consideration until after a public consultative process of three to six months , which many feel is intended to diffuse and undermine the protests without offering real hope for change , failed .
The political maneuvering continues , but at the very least the indigenous and campesino groups are being seen as a force to be reckoned with .
Control of natural resources has long , perhaps always , been a source of contention in poor and developing countries .
To utilize the resource to the benefit of anyone , public or private , takes money to construct infrastructure and develop processes .
If the local governments ca n’t afford it , outside capital fills the gap .
But that leaves local people with fewer resources and less control over their lives .
As frustration , anger , and in the case of a fundamental need like water , fear , grows , people look for ways to get control back .
The form that struggle takes , and how successful it is , varies by location .
In Ecuador the struggle continues , with much bitterness on both sides .
Water is a life and death issue , and here at least , traditionally powerless people are not backing down .

In nature , evolution takes place over eons : A slow accumulation of adaptations gradually produces new traits and species .
But evolution can also happen on a small and fast scale in the laboratory .
The approach is called “ directed evolution , ” and scientists are using it to generate proteins that do not occur in nature — for example , cancer drugs , new microbial enzymes for converting agricultural waste to fuel , or imaging agents for magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) .
Most protein structures are so complex that it ’s nearly impossible to predict how altering their structure will affect their function .
So the trial - and - error approach of directed evolution is usually the fastest way to come up with a new protein with desirable traits , says Dane Wittrup , an MIT professor of chemical and biological engineering who uses directed evolution to discover new antibodies that target cancer cells .
Such experiments often yield proteins that researchers never would have come up with on their own .
“ It ’s like Christmas every morning , ” says Wittrup .
For example , let ’s say you want to create an antibody that will bind to a certain protein found on tumor cells .
You start with a test tube full of hundreds of millions of yeast cells , engineered to express a variety of mammalian antibodies on their surfaces .
Then you add probes containing the molecule you want your new protein to target , allowing you to pick out the proteins that bind to it .
Next , you take the proteins that bind the best and mutate them , in hopes of generating something even better .
This can be done by irradiating the cells , or by forcing them to replicate their DNA in a way that is prone to mistakes .
Those new proteins are screened the same way , and each time , the best candidates are used to create more proteins .
“ At the end , you have proteins that bind very tightly and specifically , ” says Wittrup .
“ In the lab , it ’s the same rules as natural evolution , but we get to set the criteria for who survives . ”
Wittrup and his students recently created a new antibody that binds tightly to tumor cells and to a radioactive compound used for chemotherapy , potentially allowing for very precise targeting of the cancer treatment .
First developed about 15 years ago , directed evolution has become common in many labs , and easy enough that a first - year graduate student can produce a suitable protein in a couple of months , Wittrup says .
He and others at MIT , including Bruce Tidor , professor of biological engineering and computer science , have also tried to design proteins more precisely , using computer models to predict how changes in a protein ’s sequence will affect its structure and function .
In 2007 , their simulation successfully produced a new version of the cancer drug cetuximab that binds to its target with 10 times greater affinity than the original .
However , this approach is very expensive and only works when researchers start with a great deal of information about the protein interactions being modeled .
“ In a limited way , we could do rational design , ” says Wittrup .
“ Fifty years from now , maybe everyone will be doing that . ”

Unless it is .
Movies suck , and harder lately , goes the meme , because of the increasing intrusion of suits into the filmmaking process , creating that downward spiral of quality and taste known as Development Hell .
Not like the old days , as director Taylor Hackford reminisced last week , when " The Louis B. Mayers or the Harry Cohns of the world were always out there looking for commercial stuff that might sell , whatever it might be , but they also went with their gut on certain other things . "
Here 's a story from the old days .
In 1946 , Jack Warner optioned a nonfiction book by Robert Lindner , a psychoanalyst who used hypnosis to treat a sociopath named Harold and wrote such cinematic sentences as , " No accounting of the psychopathic syndrome … can be considered even relatively complete if it confines itself solely to the precipitating mechanisms . "
The first draft was written by Theodor Seuss Geisel , who quit after it became apparent the producers had not read the book , and went back writing children 's fare .
Several drafts followed , including one by Peter Viertel ( African Queen ) and one co-written by Lindner himself .
In 1947 , a very young Marlon Brando screen tested for the part .
The project remained in limbo until 1954 , when the success of black - and - white juvie movies – and media attention like Newsweek 's cover , " Our Vicious Young Hoodlums : Is There Any Hope ? " – prompted Warners to dust off the property for some down and dirty profit .
They approached B - movie director Nicholas Ray , who had become fascinated with adolescent angst ever since he had caught his 13 - year - old son Tony screwing his wife , Gloria Grahame .
Ray responded with a treatment for a movie he wanted to call " Blind Run . "
The studio insisted he use the title of the book : " Rebel without a Cause . "
Ray wanted the lefty playwright Clifford Odets ; the studio insisted on Leon Uris , not yet the writer of Exodus .
Uris ' treatment " made me vomit , " Ray later said .
Then came a 164 - page draft called " Juvenile Story " by novelist Irving Shulman ( Amboy Dukes ) ; in that one , Jim gets shot by police and Plato blows up his house with a grenade .
The studio was ready to dump the project .
The artistic interference continued beyond the script .
The studio wanted Tab Hunter and Debbie Reynolds in the James Dean and Natalie Wood roles ; five days into shooting , the studio decided that based on the success of East of Eden , the film would now be in color and the scenes Dean was n't in would have to be cut .
Oh , and Dean would lose the glasses he wears in the black - and - white footage .
Ray was forced to scrap his vision of the ending – Plato falls from atop the Planetarium – because it cost too much .
After the first screening , Jack Warner told Ray to cut 45 minutes .
And then the star died a month before the movie was released .
That film turned out all right .

Jan Reschke und Benjamin Knaack Von
ITHACA , NY — The Byzantine Empire , the Eastern continuation of the Roman Empire , is in grave danger and will soon fall to united armies of Ottoman Turks , Cornell University history professor Wallace Schroeder warned Monday .

In a speech delivered to more than 300 students , Schroeder said that the Empire , having never fully recovered its unity and strength following the violent sacking of Constantinople by Christian crusaders in 1204 , remains a severely truncated shadow of its former self .
Once a powerful bulwark against the Muslim armies of the Middle East and Anatolia , the Byzantine Empire now faces its most formidable threat yet , the Ottoman Turks .
" It is clear that this situation is very grave indeed for the Byzantines , " Schroeder said during the one - hour address in Room 101 of Uris Hall .
" By this point , their army consists entirely of mercenaries and inexperienced would - be landholders who are serving temporary stints in the military , merely in the hopes of being granted huge amounts of farmland in the central Anatolian plain under the greatly unprofitable ' feudal levy ' system .
This rather ragtag bunch is altogether no match for the extraordinarily well - trained janissaries of the upstart Ottoman clans . "

The U.S. , long interested in the Byzantine Empire for its strategic location and close proximity to Eastern spice and silk markets , is following the developments closely .
" The stability of Byzantium is extremely important to the United States , " said U.S. Sen.
Claiborne Pell ( D - RI ) , a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
" Certainly we 're concerned about the Ottomans ' ambitions and the threat they pose to the security of the spice routes .
Rest assured we 'll be in close contact with the Venetian city - state and the Frankish duchies on this matter . "

Cornell University history professor Wallace Schroeder .
Despite a pledge of full military support from President Clinton and the threat of severe U.S. economic sanctions against the Ottomans , many seriously question the Byzantines ' ability to withstand a Turkish siege .

" Even if the United States were to deploy 20,000 of its finest horse - mounted warriors to the Near East and cut off all opium exports to the Turks , it is still unlikely that that would be enough to stem the tide of history , " said Arthur V. Wills , a Duke University professor of Near Eastern Studies and noted Byzantine scholar .
" The reality is , U.S. aid or not , the once - great Byzantine Empire will in all likelihood not survive the 1290s . "
Philip A. Brannock , visiting professor of Near Eastern Studies from Cambridge University , agreed .
" I must concur with my esteemed colleague , " Brannock said .
" How easily we forget what an imposing force the Ottoman Turks are .
Even an extremely capable and prestigious ruler like Holy Roman Emperor Charles V bent to their will , eventually ceding much of his Hungarian possessions to them . "

While the volatile Byzantine situation is drawing the attention of scholars and government officials , perhaps no one is monitoring the developing crisis more closely than Kathleen Altman , a Cornell sophomore majoring in English .
" Professor Schroeder said that everything through the end of the Hundred Years War is going to be on the midterm , " the 19 - year - old from Syosset , NY , said , " so I guess we 'll definitely have to know all the stuff about the Ottomans .
Oh , my God , I have to pass that test . "

Shortly after announcing a blockbuster deal to acquire Palm , HP confessed that it would be " doubling down on webOS , " with near - term plans to " scale it across multiple connected devices . "
We took the liberty at that point to assume this meant that a larger webOS - based device was at least sitting around in the rear of someone 's mind , and now it sounds as if Palm loyalists may actually have something tangible to look forward to .
According to an unsubstantiated report over at the Examiner , an " insider at HP " has informed the site that " a webOS tablet under the code name HP Hurricane could be released the third quarter of this year . "
This all lines up well with what we 've heard over the past few weeks :
HP pledged to take webOS to places it has never been , strong whispers emerged that the HP Slate was being shelved , and now , people close to the HP camp have given a name to a purported webOS tablet slated for Q3 .
There 's obviously no telling if this is simply hot air being blown , but we would n't be shocked to see HP nail down a webOS slate in time for the sure - to - be - rockin ' 2010 holiday buying season .
Or maybe we 're just crossing our fingers , humming aloud and praying to our lucky stars that this all pans out .

What Initially Attracted Me To MailChimp
Honestly , what attracted me initially to Mailchimp was that they offer a trial period in which their service is free for up to 2000 subscribers .
Note :
There ’s a major limitation on the number of emails you are allowed to send with a free MailChimp account .
Also , the autoresponder feature is disabled which makes a free account much less useful ..
I know , I ’m cheap .
I ca n’t help it .
The Asian in me always prevails .
Even though all of the top bloggers use Aweber , I opted for Mailchimp because of the free startup cost .
That and my buddy Sid Savara was also using MailChimp and highly recommended the company .
Anyways , in using both email providers extensively and having learned the ins and outs of both services , I discovered the pros and cons of each which I ’ll enumerate below .
Who Has The Better Form Design Tools ?
If you are a half decent web designer , you ’ll definitely prefer Mailchimp over Aweber in terms of form design .
MailChimp let ’s you either design your forms entirely from scratch or use their GUI to design a professional looking form .
They have many templates to choose from , but if you want to do everything yourself , they also give you the raw code and you have full control over the look and feel of everything .
I found that the design freedom that MailChimp provides was especially useful when designing popup forms .
Aweber on the other hand , seems to steer you towards using one of their pre-baked form templates .
If you stray from their template , then you have to do a little bit of hacking to get things looking the way you want .
For example , getting the popup signup form working on Aweber the exact way I wanted it to look took me several hours .
I basically had to download the javascript from their site , figure out how their code was written and then tailor it to how I wanted it .
Otherwise , I would have been limited to their templates which I did n’t really like .
In addition , the Aweber popup code did n’t work properly across all web browsers and I had to fix this manually .
( Updated : This problem has been rectified )
Mailchimp also offers a more flexible interface with which to design HTML emails and they ’ll also host the images for you .
Aweber does not offer an image hosting service as far as I can tell ( Updated : Aweber will now host unlimited images for you ) .
One annoying thing about Mailchimp that I wanted to mention is that you can have only one signup form per list .
In Aweber , you can have as many forms as you want per subscriber list and you can track the performance of each one independently .
But with Mailchimp , all signup form code is the same for a given list as is the CSS .
What this means is that you ca n’t really test different form designs and it ’s kind of a pain to include multiple signup forms on the same page .
Overall however , I like MailChimp ’s interface better even though their website is a bit slower than Aweber ’s because of all of the graphical functionality baked into the UI .

Who Has Better Email Tracking ?
When I first switched over from Mailchimp to Aweber , I immediately noticed how much better Aweber ’s email tracking capabilities are compared to MailChimp .
With Aweber , you can tell exactly who has opened your email and exactly which links that they have clicked on and when .
With Mailchimp out of the box , you do n’t have any of this information .
( Update : MailChimp has improved upon this such that the 2 services are now on par )
Instead , MailChimp puts stars next to each of your subscribers which provides a vague metric with which to measure the quality and interest of your readers .
In addition , MailChimp does not track users who sign up for your newsletter but do n’t confirm their email .
Aweber is also better when it comes to tracking clicks within an email .
Whenever you use a link in an email with click tracking enabled , Aweber displays the link using the exact same URL from your domain .
Mailchimp on the other hand , uses a super long and obscure link which is then redirected over to your site .
In general , readers are more hesitant to click on links with a super long and cryptic URL .
With Aweber , the destination URL points straight to your domain and the click is still tracked .
As a result , I ’ve seen a dramatic increase in click throughs when I made the switch over to Aweber .
In addition to all of this , Aweber also provides conversion tracking if you sell products and you can also track how each reader traverses through your website from an email campaign .
One final super annoying thing about Mailchimp is that you ca n’t send an email to multiple lists at the same time .
Therefore , if you want to send an email to more than one list , you have to replicate the email campaign and re-send each time .
This can get very tedious .
Overall , Aweber is much more powerful than MailChimp when it comes to tracking users .
Edge : Aweber
Who Has Better AutoResponders ?
Both MailChimp and Aweber offer an easy way to set up a series of follow up emails .
However , both have their pros and cons with the way their auto responders are implemented .
What I like about Mailchimp is that you can setup autoresponders such that only a subset of your email list will receive your follow - up emails based on when they signed up for your newsletter .
For example , if I only want recent subscribers from the last month to receive one of my autoresponders , I can simply specify this using MailChimp ’s autoresponder interface .
With Aweber however , this is not that easy to do .
With Aweber , each and every one of your subscribers is tagged with a message number which indicates which followup emails they have received already .
To prevent a subscriber from receiving a specific followup email , you must set the subscriber ’s message number to be higher than the email sequence number .
For example , if a particular subscriber ’s message number is 4 , that means that that subscriber has already received follow - up emails 1,2 and 3 .
So if I have a 7 part follow up message sequence and I write a brand new followup email ( message 8 in the sequence ) , there is no real way for me to prevent this subscriber from receiving message 8 unless I make his or her message number higher than 8 .
But if I do this , then that subscriber will never receive messages 4,5,6 or 7 .
On the flip side , Aweber ’s method of managing followup emails allows me to know exactly which subscriber has received which follow up emails and when .
With MailChimp , I really have no clue who has or has n’t received a particular email .
Overall , I kind of prefer Aweber ’s method of managing follow - ups but it is basically a wash depending on your preference .
Edge : Even
Who Has Better Support ?
There is no contest here .
Aweber has the better support hands down !
Aweber offers both phone and email support during regular business hours .
Mailchimp however , only offers email support .
As a result , if you have a pressing issue or question , you will have to wait up to 24 hours to get a response from MailChimp .
This is the # 1 reason I made the switch from MailChimp to Aweber .
Usually support does n’t come into play unless something goes wrong .
Here is my tale of woe .
One day , MailChimp decided to arbitrarily suspend my blog from using its service .
I received a cryptic email out of the blue telling me that my email service had been suspended and they did n’t give me a reason .
Since MailChimp does n’t have phone support , I had to wait a day to receive a response .
In fact , because I could n’t get a human on the phone , it took me 2 days just to find out why I was suspended .
In the end , they told me that I had violated their terms of service because they classified my website as a get rich quick scheme .
Long time readers of MyWifeQuitHerJob.com know that this blog is certainly not about getting rich quick .
Plus , I did n’t sell anything on my blog at the time either so Mail Chimp ’s reason for banning me was completely uncalled for .
In any case after a few emails back and forth , I found out that they basically did n’t like the title of my free ebook .
Here is the exact email reply I received .
Hello Stephen , https://mywifequitherjob.com/starting-your-own-business-does-not-have-to-be-risky/ which leads to How To Create A Profitable Online Store In 5 Easy Steps .
MailChimp does not allow content that references the terms “ make money at home ” , ‘ get rich quick ’ , or other similar terms .
These keywords overlap keywords used by ISPs and SpamCop organizations to block content associated with spammers from those industries .
This generates too much risk for us to encounter automated spam filter blocks for all of our customers .
This is n’t an issue of the legitimacy of your business and we certainly do n’t have anything personal against your content , however we do have to protect the deliverability of all our customers and the risk associated with these terms is too great for us to take on at this time .

Note :
My blog is not about getting rich quick or making money from home .
Sure , I could have changed the title of my ebook but I was not willing to make changes based on my email provider .
As a result , I had to make a mad scramble to switch email providers right away .
In any case , Mailchimp has to do what they have to do in order maintain email deliverability and I do n’t necessarily blame them .
But the key thing to note here is that they banned me without warning with absolutely no notice and the decision was final .
Do you want to take this risk with your email provider ?
Thankfully , the transition from MailChimp to Aweber was relatively easy and straightforward .
In general , I think it ’s better to start out with the right email provider from the start rather than having to switch later on .
Edge : Aweber
Mailchimp Vs Aweber
There are a few good things about MailChimp that I did n’t mention and should be considered as well even though most people probably wo n’t take advantage of these features .
MailChimp has an interface that allows you to access your entire database of subscribers from an API .
If you do a lot of coding or database manipulation , their API will allow you to easily manage your subscriber database in PHP or any popular scripting language .
Overall , when it comes to design and programmability , Mailchimp is more powerful than Aweber ( Update :
This is no longer true .
Aweber also now offers a powerful API interface ) .
However , once I switched over to Aweber , I realized how much more powerful their tracking and email management features were compared to Mailchimp .
You only have to design your forms once but tracking is something you ’ll be doing all the time .
In addition , the delivery rate of emails was better with Aweber as well which is extremely important .
In addition , having phone support is priceless .
That and getting suspended without warning by MailChimp left a really bad taste in my mouth .
If they simply gave me an early heads up , it would have made my life much easier .
Trust me .
There ’s nothing more frustrating than not being able to get someone on the phone when something goes wrong .
Bottom line .
Would you trust a crucial part of your business to a company that provides unresponsive customer service ?
In any case , I highly recommend Aweber overall .
If you do decide to go with Mailchimp however , I would read their terms of service extremely carefully before signing up .
One particular thing I want to highlight is that if you do any sort of affiliate marketing on your site , then I would stay away from MailChimp .
After all , affiliate marketing appears to be against their terms of service .
Any violation and you could be suspended without warning .
It ’s just not worth the risk .
Update : MailChimp refutes this claim about affiliate marketing saying that they only impose temporary bans when certain links in emails are blacklisted .
What ’s nice about AWeber is that they let you know BEFORE you send your email how likely your email will hit someone ’s spam folder and whether you are accidentally using blacklisted links in your email .
Executive Summary
For those of you who do n’t like to read and just want to cut to the chase , I ’ve summarized the distinguishing features between the 2 services in the table below .
Aweber is the email marketing provider that I use for this blog and my other online businesses and I wholeheartedly recommend them .

Do you suffer from hair envy ?
Is your hair curly , but you wish it were straight ?
It ’s more common than you think .
People admire hairstyles that they think they ca n’t achieve on their own .
People who have curly or wavy hair , want to have straight hair .
It goes the other way around too .
For this particular instance , let ’s say you have curly hair , and you want to get it straight .
You do n’t want to spend a fortune on hair products that you are n’t sure will work .
There are some home remedies to straighten hair naturally .
You might be able to find most of the items you ’ll need in your own kitchen .
One remedy you can use to straighten your hair involves coconut milk and lemon juice .
Pour eight ounces of coconut milk into a cup or a glass .
Add in the juice of one full lemon .
It is best to use the juice from the actual fruit , not lemon juice from a bottle .
Mix the contents thoroughly and refrigerate it .
You want to leave the mixture in the refrigerator until you see a creamy layer on the top .
Before getting your hair wet , apply the cream to your hair .
Make sure you get every strand of hair covered with this mixture .
Wrap your hair in a towel for about an hour and then wash your hair like your normally would .
If you use this concoction three times a week , your hair should straighten gradually over time .
Another kitchen concoction you can use to straighten your hair naturally , is to use milk , honey , and strawberries .
Use one cup of milk and add in a few drops of normal honey .
Mash up a few strawberries and add them to the mixture .
Apply this to your hair , making sure you get every piece of hair that you can , and wrap your hair in a towel for about two hours .
Wash your hair with a mild shampoo as you normally would .
Brush your hair using a wide toothed comb , and blow your hair dry with a hair dryer .
This should allow the hair to come out straighter than before .
Using hot oil on your hair is another way to straighten hair naturally .
You can use any type of oil , coconut oil , or olive oil .
Heat the oil so it ’s warm and apply it to your scalp .
You do n’t want the oil to get too hot , or you ’ll burn yourself .
Once your scalp is thoroughly covered with the warm oil , wrap your head with a hot towel and let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes .
Wash your hair like normal , and it should come out straighter than it normally would .
Using a hair dryer can get your hair straight , but it may take a while .
It ’s all in the process of how you blow dry it sometimes .
You will need to get some straightening balm .
A straightening balm will make it easier to hold your hair straight for a longer period of time .
After washing your hair with your regular shampoo and conditioner , brush through the strands with a wide toothed comb .
Apply the straightening balm to the ends of your hair and a little bit more at the roots .
Use your comb to comb the balm through the hair .
Using a comb to apply the balm ensures you get maximum coverage .
Next , divide your hair into layers .
Start at the bottom layer first and begin to blow dry .
Use a round brush to brush your hair straight as you blow dry .
Work your way through the lower layer until the hair is completely dry and straight .
Move on to the next layer and so on .
Even if you do n’t have straight hair , it is possible to get it straight all by yourself .
Using some of these home remedies to straighten hair naturally , will have you looking fabulous in no time .

Republicans do not want to abandon the pro-drilling image they cultivated so successfully and probably could not be rid of it even if they wanted to since it is now so embedded in their ideological fabric .
But they also do not want to risk an election - year backlash in the aftermath of the gulf crisis , particularly if the damage becomes as extensive as some experts fear it could .
And they are heartened by polls showing that while public support for drilling has dropped since the accident , most Americans still support offshore oil production .
At the same time , Republicans would not mind hitting the Obama administration , which itself was pursuing expanded drilling , for what Mr. Pence characterized as a slow response to the spill — a complaint the White House says is groundless and politically motivated .
But even as they zero in on the administration ’s handling of the disaster , Republicans risk emphasizing the dangers of offshore drilling and alarming the public even more about the ramifications of coastal exploration .
For now , Republicans have adopted a multifaceted approach as they try to finesse the issue .
First , call for an inquiry to determine what caused the accident , so as to be able to reassure the public that a recurrence can be prevented .
Then , raise the possibility that the White House could have done more , a position that suggests that some of the damage could be a result of bureaucratic inertia rather than a hazardous energy operation .
And , finally , point out that Republicans have called for a broad energy program of which offshore drilling is only one element and that federal revenues generated by drilling would be put toward developing alternative fuel sources .
In discussing the BP accident in recent days , Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio , the Republican leader , has called it a “ reminder that America needs an all - of - the - above energy strategy to create jobs , lower energy prices and clean up our environment . ”
President Obama can be applauded for his decisiveness in dispatching the chronically insubordinate Stanley McChrystal , but we are still left with a disaster of a war in Afghanistan that cannot be won and that the country as a whole will not support .
No one in official Washington is leveling with the public about what is really going on .
We hear a lot about counterinsurgency , the latest hot cocktail - hour topic among the BlackBerry - thumbing crowd .
But there is no evidence at all that counterinsurgency will work in Afghanistan .
It ’s not working now .
And even if we managed to put all the proper pieces together , the fiercest counterinsurgency advocates in the military will tell you that something on the order of 10 to 15 years of hard effort would be required for this strategy to bear significant fruit .
We ’ve been in Afghanistan for nearly a decade already .
It ’s one of the most corrupt places on the planet and the epicenter of global opium production .
Our ostensible ally , President Hamid Karzai , is convinced that the U.S. cannot prevail in the war and is in hot pursuit of his own deal with the enemy Taliban .
The American public gave up on the war long ago , and it is not at all clear that President Obama ’s heart is really in it .
For us to even consider several more years of fighting and dying in Afghanistan  at a cost of heaven knows how many more billions of American taxpayer dollars  is demented .
So here ’s a 28 minute movie about the current patent system in the USA .
It ’s a good study about how absurd a patent system for pure mathematical formulas is and might become in other countries .
Do n’t shoot me for having an opinion , but I got some problems with it :
It does n’t really explain the problem for non-technical people .
I ca n’t use this to show a friend what might become a problem in Europe , because I would have to explain a lot myself : what is a « troll » , what is software exactly , … On top of that I think more examples like the Beethoven part could ’ve been given to make this movie a lot less abstract .
The main reason why I think this movie is not of any value is the license .
It ’s licensed with a creative commons attribution non-derivatives license ( CC BY - ND ) .
This means I cannot make any alterations to the movie , nor make subtitles which go more into detail , neither can I fix the sound in some parts of the movie , neither can I fix problems from the previous paragraph , … before I would screen it at my university .
When I asked someone involved in the movie if that ’s really okay for him , a non-derivatives license , he responded : yes .
I think ND , as FSF believes too , is good for “ opinion stuff ” .
I do n’t think ND is good for “ opinion stuff ” at all though .
When you make something around your opinion , you have three reasons for doing so :
You want to be informative towards a certain public
You want to persuade people for a certain cause
You want to start a discussion
Since we live in a democracy , the latter is very important .
People wo n’t change opinion because of a movie , they will change their opinion in debate .
Not letting people make derivatives of a work equals taking away a manner of speech .
So in the end , with a ND licensed work around someone ’s opinion , I cannot make the movie better for the same cause , neither can the other party take the movie and highlight their problems from the same perspective .
I do not support this at all and in my opinion it makes this movie worth almost nothing .

The Playlist reveals that Robert Rodriguez( Sin City , Predators ( producer ) has been offered the directors chair for the upcoming X - Men Origins : Wolverine spin off , Deadpool , starring Ryan Reynolds ..
Robert Rodriguez has been offered to direct " Deadpool " by 20th Century Fox tipped to us by the latest issue of Production Weekly and confirmed to us by a sources very close to the project .
It is something he is considering , but that 's it at the moment .
Its been fairly quiet on the Deadpool front for a while .
Last we heard the script was being finalized by the Zombieland writing team , Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick , and Ryan Reynolds said he was happy with the direction it was going .
Now , if this is true , Rodrieguez may be considering taking the reigns .
I 'm not his biggest fan , and think that most of the time his movies are all style over substance , but that being said , Deadpool may be right up his alley .
Many fans were left disappointed ( to say the least ) by the Merc With A Mouth 's big screen debut in Wolverine , but Reynolds has said that this upcoming solo movie will go a long way to righting a lot of those wrongs .
As for Rodrieguez , well , Fox have also recently offered him the Planet Of The Apes reboot on which he passed .
Will he follow suit with Deadpool ?

Prime Minister John
Key says he is will pursue the idea of leasing two giant pandas from China for 10 years , when he visits the country next week .
Mr Key says it would be very expensive : as well as an annual leasing fee , there would be the cost of building a special enclosure , and hiring specialist panda staff .
Mr Key will visit China during a trip to Asia next week .
He says offering kiwi as a possible trade for the pandas is an option , given the national significance of the two species to China and New Zealand .
Mr Key says the Government would make sure any kiwi involved in a swap were treated properly in China .

Ridlon ( Sharkman ) has been writing a number of fantastic articles on shark diving and some of the best shark dives in the world .
People who love shark diving love the posts and those that are deathly afraid of sharks , get some weird rush of impending doom when they armchair quarterback them .
But …. what I have been wondering is : what if you have never before done a shark dive and want to ?….. do these posts scare you into or out of it ?
My First Shark Dive
I sat down today to write the shark diving page for our website and realized that I have been leading or participating in shark dives for 16 years and so my level of comfort is different ( some would say abnormal ! ) than a first timer .
So I thought back to my first shark dive and I remember it quite well .
It was in Tahiti and we were just a small group of paying divers going out to swim on the reef and feed some sharks .
At this point in my career I had been an instructor for 6 years and had literally thousands of dives but I was nervous as hell .
And I felt stupid about that .
I did n’t sleep well the night before .
I could see the newspaper headlines now , “ Honeymooners die in shark attack ” .
Everyone would sigh and say , “ oh , and they were just starting their new life together , how tragic . ”
We got in the water ( probably me last , I do n’t remember ) and during the dive I bet I looked more like a whirling dervish than a diver .
I kept spinning around waiting for the attack that , of course , never came .
I just knew those man ( and woman ) eating great white look alikes ( read … .. 4 foot black tip reef shark puppy dogs ) where going to catch me from behind .
I tried to stay in the middle of the “ pack ” and look like one of strong and young , rather than the old , sick and helpless waiting to be picked off .
I try to think about this when I take people shark diving for the first time in order to empathize with their fears and help alleviate them .
Here are twelve honest realities and thoughts for the newbie about diving with one of the greatest marine apex predators on the planet .
Twelve Tips for First Time Shark Divers
1 . In 16 years of shark diving and many of those doing the feeding myself , I have only seen two attacks .
One was a shark who took the opportunity to snag an unsuspecting snapper ( meaning the fish not a photographer ) and the other …oh well … never mind .
No , seriously , it is so extremely rare that a shark attacks on a shark feeding dive that I would feel safer spending a lifetime in the company of sharks than spending two weeks driving the 405 freeway in Los Angeles .
2 . If you want to be attacked by a shark , take a bunch of bait , get in the water and then NOT give it to them , you know , like being a spear fisherman …no thanks !
3 . It does NOT matter which side of the boat you get in on .
We used to run our shark dives from 17 ’ inflatable boats .
When divers would see a shark on one side of the boat , they would make their entry on the other side , three feet away .
Makes you laugh now , but it really happens …. a lot !
4 . If you are nervous …it ’s normal .
You will hear a great deal of joking around on a shark dive , do n’t listen to it .
It ’s just people who are MORE nervous than you trying to purge their anxiety .
5 . Here ’s a reality check .
You ’re not at the top of the food chain anymore …
BUT REMEMBER , you are not on a shark ’s normal diet either .
There are definitely tastier things in the ocean than soggy white meat covered in a neoprene sponge cake !
6 . If it ’s your first shark dive and you are unsure , situate yourself in the middle of the group .
You ’ll feel safety in numbers being surrounded by your own species .
Sharks tend to me more assertive if you are alone with them .
7 . Do n’t go out on a shark dive if the visibility sucks .
Clear water allows you to see the sharks and not be so scared .
Having one materialize out of the murk in front of you can be unnerving .
And most shark bites are cases of mistaken identity , so murky water can be a factor in that .
8 . Tell the dive leader it ’s your first shark dive .
They will ( should ! ) give you more attention , re-assure you during the dive and keep you close to them .
Of course , if they are the one feeding you ’ll be closer to the bait and the sharks !
9 . If you plan to shark dive on your next vacation , read about it but DON ’T read every horror story you can get your hands on , that ’s just plain DUMB .
Inform yourself .
10 . Start Small .
Do n’t make your first shark dive with 15 foot Tiger and Bull sharks .
Even the names evoke visions of fear .
Dive with small sharks like black tip or white tip reef sharks .
Then work your way up .
11 . Some divers feel safer with a camera in front of them like a barrier .
BUT do n’t get in the habit of pushing sharks away with it unless absolutely necessary .
We give a conflicting message if we bait the water for attraction then push them away and say , “ no , bad shark ” .
12 . Dive with someone you trust but also be realistic .
I will go to great lengths to be sure the shark dive is as safe as it can be but I cannot “ save ” you from a shark .
If you want 100 % safe , stay in the boat .

TAIPEI , Taiwan —
It 's a 3.5 million - square kilometer stretch of ocean , speckled with some 200 coral atolls , some submerged or so tiny they hardly deserve to be called islands .
Welcome to the South China Sea , an obscure patch of global real estate that you 're likely to hear more about in coming years .
Six Asian countries have long had competing — at times comical — claims to various islands here , sending token military forces to occupy barren rocks at great expense in the name of national pride .
What 's new is China 's muscle - flexing , which , if trends continue , could make the South China Sea one of Asia 's most dangerous flash - points .
Fueling tensions in the sea are untapped oil and natural gas reserves , China 's growing strategic interest in protecting sea lanes by which it gets some of its oil , and Beijing 's desire to develop a " blue - water " navy capable of projecting power far beyond China 's shores .
The U.S. is paying closer attention to the South China Sea , after China reportedly threatened U.S. energy firm ExxonMobil with retaliation if it continued oil exploration off Vietnam in waters China considers its own .
And last year Chinese military vessels harassed U.S. surveillance ships in the sea .
Earlier this month , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates made what 's believed to be the highest - level public U.S. remarks to date on the issue .
" The South China Sea is an area of growing concern , " he said at a security forum in Singapore .
" This sea is not only vital to those directly bordering it , but to all nations with economic and security interests in Asia . "
Gates repeated the U.S. ' longstanding policy that it takes no position on conflicting sovereignty claims in the South China Sea .
But he said the U.S. believes " it is essential that stability , freedom of navigation , and free and unhindered economic development be maintained " and that " we object to any effort to intimidate U.S. corporations or those of any nation engaged in legitimate economic activity . "
Here 's a primer on the issue :
1 ) Why does America care ?
The U.S. objects to any attempts to intimidate American energy companies operating in the South China Sea , which stretches from China all the way south to Indonesia .
It also insists on the right of free navigation in international waters , defined , in accordance with customary international law , as any waters beyond 12 nautical miles from a nation 's shoreline .
China says its sovereign territorial waters extend 200 miles from its shores , and makes a historical claim to almost all of the South China Sea , according to a backgrounder from the Heritage Foundation .
China also says that any ship traversing the sea should first obtain Chinese permission .
It has long complained about U.S. intelligence - gathering from spy-planes and spy - ships operating off its coastline .
2 ) Who else claims territory in the South China Sea ?
Taiwan , Vietnam , the Philippines , Malaysia and Brunei also claim all or some of the South China Sea .
Vietnam and China both claim the Paracels islands ( known as the Xisha in Chinese ) , which China has controlled since a 1974 battle with Vietnam that left 18 dead .
The other four countries as well as China and Vietnam also claim some or all of the Spratly Islands ( known as the Nansha in Chinese ) further south .
China 's hold here is more tenuous ; a skeleton force occupies nine speck - like islands , while Taiwan holds the largest island Itu Aba ( or Taiping island , in Chinese ) , Vietnam holds 29 islands , the Philippines eight and Malaysia three , according to Michael Richardson , a visiting researcher at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies , in a recent commentary .
More than 70 Vietnamese sailors died in the latest military clash in the Spratlys , with China in 1988 .
3 ) What 's new about China 's behavior ?
China has built up its small military presence in the Spratlys .
It angered Vietnam by issuing a unilateral fishing ban in the South China Sea , then boarding and seizing Vietnamese fishing boats who did not observe that ban .
Longer - term , China is building up a massive naval base on its southern island of Hainan from which it will be able to project power into the South China Sea .
The base will house China 's new nuclear - armed submarines , as well as its first aircraft carrier , expected to enter service by 2012 , and many other warships .
Perhaps most significantly , China has recently begun to define its claim of sovereignty over the South China Sea as a " core interest , " say analysts , using new language that puts the sea on par with Beijing 's claims over Taiwan and Tibet .
Veteran China watcher Willy Lam calls it part of China 's " red-line diplomacy . "
" These red lines define China 's core interests , " said Lam at a recent talk in Taipei .
" Now , China is increasing its core interests .
The latest development is that China also considers the South China Sea as its ' core interest ' — it 's asking the U.S. and other countries not to interfere with its ' core interests ' in the South China Sea .
It 's drawing red lines around the entire sea . "
Wendell Minnick , Asia bureau chief for Defense News , wrote in an email that Gates ' remarks in Singapore were a " surprise . "
" Clearly China 's decision to include the South China Sea as a ' core interest ' is something unnerving , " said Minnick .
Southeast Asian nations are also increasingly worried , according to Arthur Ding , a Taiwan expert on military issues who also attended the Singapore conference .
He said he 's heard rising concerns from southeast Asian officials , especially those from Vietnam and the Philippines , about China 's growing " assertiveness . "
And he highlighted Chinese general Ma Xiaotian 's mention of the South China Sea in a Q&A session in Singapore .
" The South China Sea had become so quiet , or at least not as much of an issue as the Taiwan Strait and the Korean peninsula , " said Ding .
" So this [ Ma 's remarks ] really surprised me . "
4 ) What are the most plausible conflict scenarios ?
One worry is an incident at sea — say , a collision between a U.S. surveillance ship and a People 's Liberation Army ship leading to loss of life — that could escalate due to miscalculation and lack of communication .
One such incident took place in 2001 between a U.S. spy-plane and a Chinese fighter jet .
The U.S. and Chinese militaries established a hotline in 2008 , but China often simply refuses to pick up the phone out of pique , according to a recent Defense News report .
But the nations most likely to come to blows in the South China Sea may be China and Vietnam .
Hanoi was incensed by Beijing 's treatment of its fishing boats last year and lodged a formal protest .
It continues to see the Paracels as its territory , illegally occupied by the Chinese .
Anti-China nationalism runs strong in Vietnam and is easily inflamed .
The two nations ' militaries have twice skirmished in the South China Sea , in 1974 and 1988 .
China 's moves appear to have already started a regional arms race , analysts say .
" Some southeast Asian nations are starting to beef up their armed forces to hedge growing Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea , " wrote Ian Storey , fellow of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore , in a recent commentary .
Defense News ' Minnick said that Singapore , Malaysia and Vietnam had " gotten into the submarine game , " and that " there are more concerns of an underwater collision than an accidental war " in the South China Sea .
" Many of the countries now deploying submarines are not familiar with underwater rules of right of way , " Minnick said .
" There are clear demarcations for direction and depth that are not being followed by some of the more inexperienced countries .
And then there 's Chinese submarines roaming around as well .
So it 's getting crowded underwater . "
Meanwhile , one side effect of China 's new claim may be to strengthen the U.S. ' budding ties with Vietnam .
" The U.S. is moving closer to Vietnam , and better military - to - military relations are expected to improve this year as China rattles the saber more , " said Minnick .
5 ) Are there any efforts to resolve South China Sea disputes ?
In 2002 the concerned nations signed a " code of conduct " agreement on the South China Sea .
But the deal has n't yet been fully implemented , largely due to China , analysts say .
" China perceives the South China Sea as its territory , so it thinks ' Why do I have to implement the code of conduct ? ' " said Ding , the Taiwanese expert .
Last year , Vietnam and Malaysia submitted their formal claims to territory in the South China Sea .
China immediately protested , rendering the claims invalid , a move that further ratcheted up ill will .
The issue has quieted down in recent months , but the underlying territorial disagreements are far from being resolved .
" Somehow , ways must be found to prevent emotive nationalism and militarism from upsetting the uneasy status quo in the South China Sea , " wrote the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies ' Richardson .
Mystery # 3 : What Happened to the " OF " ?
Why is it " Cup Noodles " instead of " Cup of Noodles " ?
The Answer :
There is a little void at the bottom of the cup !
Invisible to the naked eye .
That 's the reason for the packaging overkill and the peek - a- boo lid trick .
They are trying to hide this no - noodle zone from prying eyes !
It also explains why the " OF " is missing .
To include that one word would imply that the cup is full of noodles , not just that it contains some noodles , some air .
Bastards !
Now that I 've found the secret space , I intend to use this information .
Mostly I 'll use it to surprise other Cup Noodle eaters with a hidden tea bag or a teaspoon of unsweetened cherry Kool - Aid powder .
Or maybe I 'll just fill it full of barbecued pork , and smuggle some nutrition into my lunch .

Pango is a library for laying out and rendering of text , with an emphasis on internationalization .
Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is needed , though most of the work on Pango so far has been done in the context of the GTK + widget toolkit .
Pango forms the core of text and font handling for GTK + - 2.x .
Pango is designed to be modular ; the core Pango layout engine can be used with different font backends .
There are three basic backends , with multiple options for rendering with each .
Client side fonts using the Free Type and fontconfig libraries , using HarfBuzz for complex - text handling .
Rendering can be with with Cairo or Xft libraries , or directly to an in - memory buffer with no additional libraries .
Native fonts on Microsoft Windows using Uniscribe for complex - text handling .
Rendering can be done via Cairo or directly using the native Win32 API .
Native fonts on MacOS X using CoreText for complex - text handling , rendering via Cairo .
The integration of Pango with Cairo ( http://cairographics.org/) provides a complete solution with high quality text handling and graphics rendering .
Dynamically loaded modules then handle text layout for particular combinations of script and font backend .
Pango ships with a wide selection of modules , including modules for Hebrew , Arabic , Hangul , Thai , and a number of Indic scripts .
Virtually all of the world 's major scripts are supported .
As well as the low level layout rendering routines , Pango includes Pango Layout , a high level driver for laying out entire blocks of text , and routines to assist in editing internationalized text .
Pango depends on 2.x series of the GLib library ; more information about GLib can be found at http://www.gtk.org/.

Earlier this month , the World Bank opened up its data and launched a new website – data.worldbank.org – where users will be able to browse and filter more than 2,000 financial , business , health , economic and human development indicators from World Bank data sources that had mostly been available only to paying subscribers .
( Not at your computer ?
Find the info you need on the World Bank ’s new Datafinder iPhone app . )
The Open Data Initiative , as it ’s called , was built by Development Seed , a Washington , D.C. - based strategic consultancy and open source product development company .
Feedback has been positive :
In the first week of its launch , the site attracted more than 132,000 unique visitors — a 224 % increase in visitors compared to old Data site section .
For the sustainable transport and urban planning world , these open data sets could prove highly valuable .
A quick look at the “ Urban Development ” topic shows 14 different indicators , including things like the number of passenger cars per 1,000 people and transport sector gasoline fuel consumption per capita .
World Bank Group President Robert B. Zoellick recently explained ( see his video below ) that it ’s important to make data publicly available because , “ Statistics tell the story of people in developing and emerging countries and can play an important part in helping to overcome poverty . ”
By the same token , they can play an important part in helping to overcome pollution , congestion , inaccessibility and other mobility - related concerns plaguing many of the world ’s most iconic cities .
The idea is that people will be able to reveal solutions to common urban problems by creating new tools , applications and “ mash - ups ” using World Bank data .
Just two weeks ago , the World Bank announced the Apps for Development competition ( sign up here for email updates ) , which is similar to innovation contests like Apps for Democracy , an invitation for developers to create Web - based solutions for D.C. residents based on publicly available local data ( check out examples like D.C. Pedestrian , which shows the best walking routes based on things like level of safety and public transportation options ; and DC Bikes , a guide to local bike routes , bike thefts and bike sales . )
In New York City , the BigApps contest solicits entries for how to make the city more transparent , accessible and accountable ( last year ’s Grand Prize winner was WayFinder NYC , a mobile app that shows users the closest mass transit stations . )
There ’s a U.S. national project , too , called Code for America , which encourages designers and developers , as well as city governments , to think of ideas for how Web applications can improve civic life .
These efforts are part of a larger trend to use data as a way to increase government accountability and transparency , as well as foster citizen collaboration and public participation , in cities around the world ( see this example from the UK government ; and another in Canada . )
Now that the World Bank is going more global with its data , it ’ll be interesting to see other countries – from Brazil to India – jump on the bandwagon and open their bandwidth .
If BP ’s board were to choose another chief executive , Mr. Dudley would be a leading internal candidate .
The former head of BP ’s Russian joint venture , TNK - BP , Mr. Dudley was forced to flee Russia after a bitter dispute with the company ’s Russian partners .
He has since kept a low profile at BP , serving on its board .
In a statement Friday , Representative Bart Stupak , the Michigan Democrat who was one of Mr. Hayward ’s harshest interrogators , said the BP chief had been “ evasive and obstructive ” in his testimony .
“ Whether this change in gulf leadership for BP will be productive remains to be seen , ” Mr. Stupak said .
“ I expect that Mr. Dudley will take a much more cooperative and open approach to answering our questions and responding to the needs of the gulf region .
If not , his tenure will likely be as short lived as Mr. Hayward’s . ”
Throughout the crisis , the company has publicly insisted that Mr. Hayward ’s job is secure and that he remains very much in charge of the company .
Mr. Gowers , the spokesman , said the board did not consider replacing Mr. Hayward at its meeting Monday .
At the outset of the crisis , the cherub - cheeked Mr. Hayward , 53 , appeared to almost relish his sudden celebrity .
He played down the environmental consequences of the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion and repeatedly blamed Transocean , the rig owner , for the accident .
He readily gave television interviews and took to quoting Winston Churchill and comparing BP ’s response to the spill to World War II ’s illustrious seaborne evacuation at Dunkirk .
But as the crisis wore on , a visibly tired Mr. Hayward repeatedly displayed a tin ear and became prone to embarrassing gaffes .
Perhaps worst of all was his comment on May 31 , when he said he would like the disaster to end because “ I ’d like my life back . ”
He later apologized .
The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss Israel 's storming of a Gaza - bound aid flotilla .
( ( Chip East / Reuters ) )
The United Nations Security Council is calling for an impartial and transparent investigation of Israel 's commando raid on ships taking humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip
In a statement , the Security Council condemned the acts that resulted in the loss of civilian lives and expressed deep regret at the loss of life and injuries sustained during the naval raid .
At least nine people were killed after Israeli troops stormed a flotilla of Gaza - bound aid ships early Monday in international waters .
Israel says its soldiers were defending themselves , but a number of countries have condemned the raid .
After an emergency meeting and marathon negotiations , the 15 council members agreed early Tuesday on a presidential statement that was weaker than that initially demanded by the Palestinians , Arabs and Turkey .
A copy of the UN statement says the council is calling for a " prompt , impartial , credible and transparent investigation conforming to international standards . "
A cautious White House said Tuesday that it supports the resolution calling for an investigation into the raid .
But White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the predawn raid on international waters , which left at least nine people dead , does nothing to change the " trusted relationship " between the U.S. and Israel .
" We are greatly supportive of their security , " Gibbs told reporters Tuesday .
" That 's not going to change . "
Gibbs said the U.S. backs the Security Council 's call for " a credible investigation , including international participation . "
The Security Council also said in the statement that the situation in Gaza is " not sustainable " and called for a " sustained and regular flow of goods and people " to Gaza .
Egypt announced Tuesday that it would temporarily open a blockaded border crossing with Gaza to allow aid to pass , prompting several thousand people to rush to the only crossing point not fully controlled by Israel , The Associated Press reported .
Turkey condemns raids
The raids prompted condemnation from a number of countries — including Turkey and China — and several countries have called on Israel to end its blockade of Gaza .
Turkey 's prime minister is calling Israel 's raid on a Gaza - bound Turkish aid vessel that killed nine people a " bloody massacre , " and warns that no one should test Turkey 's patience .
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told parliament that " this bloody massacre by Israel on ships that were taking humanitarian aid to Gaza deserves every kind of curse . "
He said the Israeli action was an attack " on international law , the conscience of humanity and world peace . "
Erdogan called on Israel to immediately end its " inhumane " blockade of Gaza .
Turkey , usually an Israeli ally , said Monday it was recalling its ambassador for consultations and calling off military exercises with Israel .
Passengers off ships
The statement also requested the immediate release of ships and civilians detained in Israel .
Yigal Palmor , a spokesman for Israel 's Foreign Affairs Ministry , told CBC News there is nobody left on the ships and that passengers who identified themselves were taken to the airport , while the others were detained .
Palmor also said a number of questions — including who would carry out the investigation and how it would be handled — need to be answered before Israel can respond to the UN call for an inquiry .
He said there is no way for Israel to respond to a " proposition " or " advice " that has not taken the form of an official plan , noting that he believes Israel 's investigation will " bring out all the facts , " which would be shared with " friendly " countries .
The CBC's Margaret Evans said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to meet with Israel 's security cabinet when he returns home Tuesday , having cut short his visit to North America .
' It seems to me the choice is clear , ' Nancy Pelosi said to a receptive crowd of progressives Tuesday .
' Democrats want to rein in Big Oil , the Republicans say no .
Democrats wanted to rein in health insurance costs , the Republicans said no .
The Democrats are reining in Big Banks , and the Republicans are saying no . '
Hecklers disrupt Pelosi speech
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shouted over vociferous protesters Tuesday as she tried to assure attendees at a progressive conference that Democratic leaders will get the country back on track .
About 20 members of the disability rights group ADAPT began shouting just minutes into her speech , creating an uncomfortable atmosphere for Pelosi , who came to speak to a sympathetic liberal audience .
The group is calling for the passage of the Community Choice Act , which would make it easier for the disabled to receive care in their own homes instead of at nursing homes .
Pelosi paused to listen to their message but decided to continue the rest of her talk anyway .
" You have made your point , " she told them .
" I 'm going to make my speech over your voices . "

The protesters did n't relent , chanting " our homes , not nursing homes , " again and again over the next 20 minutes .
A second group of protesters also held a banner right — right in front of the stage — which read " Stop funding Israel terror . "
Other audience members at the " America 's Future Now " gathering in Washington who were sitting close to the stage stood up during the speech to show their support for Pelosi , clapping again and again as the speaker kept speaking .
" Listen , I 'm used to noise , " she quipped .
" I talk to the Democratic caucus every single day . "
When she finally settled into her speech , Pelosi blamed the exploding national debt on the Bush administration and said Democrats ' push to invest in education , job creation and health care would bring America out of its financial troubles .
" President Obama and the Democratic Caucus have saved this country from a financial crisis created under the Bush administration , " she said .
She blamed Republicans for deregulating big oil , assuring the receptive crowd that BP would be held accountable for its handling of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
And she had harsh words for Wall Street , as the House and Senate get set for a final conference committee on a financial reform bill .
" No longer will recklessness on Wall Street be able to cause joblessness on Main Street , " she said .
" No longer will those on Wall Street be able to privatize the gain and nationalize the risk , send the bill to the taxpayer if things don?t go their way , " she said .
She said the oil spill crisis highlighted the difference between Republicans ' and Democrats ' approach to problem solving .
" It seems to me the choice is clear , " she said .
" Democrats want to rein in Big Oil , the Republicans say no .
Democrats wanted to rein in health insurance costs , the Republicans said no .
The Democrats are reining in Big Banks and the Republicans are saying no . "
Doing unto others
JOHN STUART MILL argued in the 19th century that an individual should be free to do as he pleased , so long as he did not harm anyone else .
The ban on smoking in pubs , bars and company cars — in effect , in all enclosed public spaces — that came into effect in England in 2007 was informed by such thinking .
Brought in to protect the health of non-smokers who worked in or frequented such places , it seems to have worked .
Research published on June 9th shows that , since the ban , fewer people have been admitted to hospital with symptoms of a heart attack .
Second - hand smoke from a smouldering cigarette is far more noxious than the nicotine - infused fumes inhaled by the smoker .
In the minutes after a neighbour has lit a cigarette , a passive smoker 's chances of suffering an immediate heart attack rise rapidly as toxins in the fug make his blood stickier .
His long - term risk also rises , as narrowing arteries threaten him with heart disease and his chances of developing lung cancer and numerous other nasties also increase .
Anna Gilmore of the University of Bath and her colleagues looked at how many people were admitted to hospital with a heart attack in England between 2002 and 2008 .
About 110,000 people are struck down each year ; almost a fifth of them die before they reach hospital , and a further tenth within a month of going into one .
Ms Gilmore and her team found that , in the 12 months after the smoking ban came into force , some 1,200 fewer people were admitted to hospital with heart attacks than even the prevailing downward trend had suggested was likely .
That drop of 2.4 % saved £ 8.4 m in emergency hospital care .
When the ban took effect , England was the largest jurisdiction to forbid smoking in enclosed public spaces .
Studying a large population tends to give a more accurate result than studies of smaller places such as Scotland , parts of Italy and New York state , where more impressive reductions have been claimed .
When the town of Helena , in Montana , banned smoking for six months , for example , hospital admissions for heart attacks almost halved from seven to less than four a month .
Ms Gilmore reckons her figure , which covers far more people , is more robust .
Because heart disease is the most common cause of death in wealthy countries , even a relatively small reduction in heart attacks is good news for a great many people .
In Britain , the freedom to smoke remains , but not at the expense of others .
For months , rumors have been doing the rounds over the internet that Team Ico ’s – ICO and Shadow of the Colossus will be coming on a single Blu-ray , remastered in HD , to the ps3 , but with Amazon France now listing the game it seems all but confirmed that the game will indeed be hitting the ps3 next year .
Amazon France is currently listing the game for a whopping EUR 69.95 which hopefully is just a placeholder price and it is expected that the pack will be released June 2011 .
Counting on the success of God of War Collection , Sony has said that they are planning to release a bunch of classic ps2 games , remastered in HD , so we ’re guessing this is a clear indication of more classic ps2 games will be coming to the ps3 .

Following fan speculation ranging from Johnny Depp to Neil Patrick Harris to Eddie Murphy , Hollywood Life is now reporting that Joseph Gordon - Levitt may be in talks to play The Riddler in a third Christopher Nolan Batman movie .
Gordon - Levitt is , of course , a major player in Nolan ’s upcoming ( non-Batman ) film , Inception and apparently Nolan was a big fan of Gordon - Levitt ’s work on the set .
Earlier Batman rumors linked to the actor included the far - fetched notion that Gordon - Levitt may replace Heath Ledger ( with whom he starred in 10 Things I Hate About You ) as The Joker .
Not surprisingly , representatives for both Nolan and Gordon - Levitt have flat out denied that rumor , but recent talk surrounding a turn by Gordon - Levitt as The Riddler may be more valid .
More after the jump …
According to Hollywood Life , an “ insider close to Christopher Nolan ” had this to say :
“ Chris really dug Joseph [ as an actor ] .
There was a joke at first between them [ on the set of Inception ] that Joseph wanted to read for Batman 3 and things heated up as filming continued .
It ’s not 100 % confirmed that he ’s getting [ the role of The Riddler ] but there ’s certainly talk about it .
Joseph is definitely on the short list . ”
As many have pointed out , this is all a little premature as a script for the film has n’t even been written yet .
Still , being that I ’m a huge fan of Gordon - Levitt ’s work myself , I do n’t mind indulging in the gossip .
For my money , the young actor is already proving to be among the greatest of his generation .
With solid performance after solid performance in films from Brick to Mysterious Skin to The Lookout ( and do n’t forget Angels in the Outfield ! ) , Joseph Gordon - Levitt has shown that he can convincingly play the gambit of tones , emotions , and characters .
Any fears that had arisen with G.I. Joe : The Rise of Cobra about Gordon - Levitt working in the mainstream were squashed with 500 Days of Summer and his subsequent Saturday Night Live appearance .
It seems this guy can do it all .
What do you think ?
Would you be excited about Joseph Gordon Levitt as The Riddler , or are you still holding out for Johnny Depp ?
( NaturalNews ) Asthma , cystic fibrosis ( CF ) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) are serious and even life - threatening conditions .
However , these health problems share something with a usually minor infection -- the common cold .
The connection ?
Rhinovirus ( RV ) , a single - stranded RNA virus from thefamily , causes the majority of colds and RV is also known to trigger exacerbations of CF , asthma and COPD .
But now University of Michigan at Ann Arbor scientists have found that a natural substance , the flavonoid quercetin , puts the brakes on the ability of RV to replicate .
It also fights inflammation .
According to their research just presented at the American Thoracic Society ( ATS ) 2010 International Conference held in New Orleans , That 's great news not just for people looking for a possible cure for the common cold but especially for those suffering from conditions like COPD and CF that rob them of the ability to breathe .
For example , COPD ( which includes emphysema and chronic obstructive bronchitis ) causes coughing , wheezing , shortness of breath , chest tightness , and other symptoms .
According the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute , COPD is a major cause of disability and the fourth leading cause of death in the United States .
CF is an inherited chronic disease that affects the lungs and digestive system of about 30,000 children and adults in the US .
It causes the body to produce a thick , sticky mucus that clogs the lungs and can lead to life - threatening lung infections .
For their study , the University of Michigan research team decided to test quercetin on cells infected with RV .
A phytochemical found in the skins of apples , red onions and other foods , quercetin is known to be a powerful antioxidant with antihistamine and anti-inflammatory properties .
So the scientists hypothesized that quercetin might reduce the ability of RV to spark an inflammatory response .
That 's important because inflammation causes oxidative stress which can disrupt the function of epithelial cells ( cells that line cavities and structures ) inside airways , negatively impacting the ability to breathe .
Their lab experiments with RV infected cells showed that the researchers were right .
The results suggested that quercetin actually inhibited the ability of the virus to replicate .
The flavonoid also appeared to reduce the RV - triggered immune system response that can cause cytokines ( proteins that are secreted by specific cells of the immune system ) to induce excess inflammation .
the researchers stated .
As NaturalNews has previously reported , evidence has been accumulating over the past several years that shows phytonutrients such as quercetin are powerful protectors of health ( https://www.naturalnews.com/027409_foods_meal... ) .
For example , the flavonoid may protect brain cells and help prevent dementia ( https://www.naturalnews.com/002509.html ) .
A study by University of South Carolina research found quercetin can boost exercise endurance , too ( https://www.naturalnews.com/026591_quercetin_... ) .
In February 2009 , Attorney General Eric Holder said that the Drug Enforcement Agency , DEA , would end its raids on state - approved marijuana dispensaries , saying President Obama 's election campaign position condoning medical use is " now American policy . "
In July 2009 , during a packed 12 - hour hearing in which hundreds testified , the Colorado Board of Health rejected a proposal to limit the number of patients that could be served by each caregiver or dispensary to five .
Then in October , the Obama administration clarified Holder ’s February statement , telling federal authorities not to arrest or prosecute medical marijuana users and suppliers who are n't violating local laws .
The policy decisions bolstered a business model used by most existing dispensaries -- based on serving 400 or more patients -- and spawned many more , and offered a measure of certainty to investors who helped bankroll the growth in retail outlets .
Regulatory Whiplash
Since , then public officials have been scrambling to control a movement that has grown into a largely unregulated industry sector that is maturing , with retail storefronts , prominent advertising and large - scale operations .
The Denver City Council passed a slew of new dispensary regulations in January , aimed at bringing order to industry chaos and revenue to city coffers .
Councilman Charlie Brown , who sponsored the ordinance , says , “ Six months ago Denver and Colorado were the Wild West of medical marijuana , with unregulated and untaxed dispensaries opening almost daily and the number of registered patients soaring . ”
Now , an applicant for a dispensary license must submit a floor plan and security plan and apply for a zoning permit , sales - tax license and a burglar - alarm license .
Fees top $ 5,000 annually , plus ongoing sales tax .
Brown says crafting the ordinance was “ like trying to pick your teeth with a rattlesnake . ”
Nearby Boulder passed a similar ordinance in 2009 .
Dispensaries and grow operations there generated about nearly $ 74,000 in sales - tax revenue , though most of the estimated 105 businesses did n't open until September or later .
( In Los Angeles , the city council is poised to pass regulations aimed at reducing the current 545 dispensaries to about 70 , mostly through license fees and zoning . )
Colorado dispensary owners and industry representatives have mostly receptive to such regulations .
Medical marijuana attorney Rob Corry says , " With taxation comes legitimacy .
This industry is one of the few that is asking to be taxed and legitimized to join the rest of the business world . "
“ We welcome taxation and regulation , ” says Jack Cary , a partner in Greenwerkz , a Denver dispensary .
" It ’s time for society at large to benefit from this plant , by collecting tax revenue . ”
The Colorado Senate is now crafting an additional layer of regulations and fees .
A bill introduced by state Sen.
Chris Romer , creates new requirements for the state 's dispensaries and may institute an excise tax similar to that placed on the sale of liquor .
“ I believe that a highly regulated business structure is required to separate the medical marijuana industry from black market operators , ” Romer says .
Once legislation is passed at the state level , Romer believes “ new business people will quickly enter the market and increase the status and quality of the wellness models . ”
Cary , of Greenwerkz , agrees , sounding very much like a business - schooled entrepreneur .
“ There is a lot of investment money waiting on the sidelines , investors waiting to see what the rules are , waiting until an investment is not so high - risk , ” he said .
“ I am a little surprised at how many dispensaries did pop up .
Like any gold rush , any boom , there ’ll be a bust .
There will be a shakeout . "
How It Works
In Colorado , a medical - marijuana patient must see a licensed physician who provides written documentation of a “ debilitating medical condition . ”
As defined by the law , these maladies may include cancer , glaucoma , AIDS or HIV - positive status , seizures , severe pain or severe nausea or severe muscle spasms .
Medical use , according to the law , covers “ the acquisition , possession , production , use , or transportation of marijuana or paraphernalia related to the administration of such marijuana to address the symptoms . ”
A doctor ’s visit typically costs about $ 150 and may consist of a five - to ten- minute conversation across a table .
Some dispensaries host doctors on site .
Web sites list regular doctors ’ hours .
The state charges a $ 90 processing fee and the dispensaries usually adds on notary or other smaller handling charges , for a total patient cost of about $ 250 .
Then there ’s the product .
An ounce of medical marijuana currently costs about $ 350 and is considered sufficient to last about six weeks for the average patient .
Oftentimes , a dispensary offers a discount to a patient , who then lists it as his or her “ primary caregiver . ”
A patient may possess up to two ounces of pot or six plants for personal use , and a dispensary may have on hand two ounces of pot per patient .
A dispensary may provide a grower with its patient list ; a grower may house six plants per patient on the premises .
Dispensaries , however , are far more than smoking dens .
Marijuana is bought and sold in a dizzying list of edible forms , such as as caramel corn made with marijuana - laced butter , medicated chocolate covered cherries , rice sticky , rice - cake treats treats , frozen pizzas made with pot .
Mile High Ice Cream in Denver makes dozens of flavors with marijuana .
There are bottled sodas , pills , and tinctures .
Dispensaries also sell routine and advanced drug paraphernalia , including pipes , lighters , scented candles and smokeless “ delivery systems ” called vaporizers , the latter of which can cost several hundred dollars apiece .
Many dispensaries have expanded far beyond the sale of medical marijuana .
They offer massage , acupuncture and other alternative healing methods , usually arranging for appointments with patients and providing the space for a practitioner to operate .
There 's even an industry trade group , the Colorado Wellness Association , formed in October 2009 , whose public affairs officer happens to be a former state senator , Bob Hagedorn .
“ I ’ve visited about 80 dispensaries in the Denver metro area , ” says Hagedorn said .
“ I ’d say 10 percent are very serious about the wellness side of things .
Fifty percent are interested in moving product .
The other 40 percent is a balance of those two . ”
Dr. Feelgood , I Presume ?
Dr. Rita Starritt has been keeping regular hours at the Green Ribbon Clinic , a subsidiary of the Herban Wellness dispensary next door , on the fourth floor of a downtown Denver office building .
On a recent Tuesday , three patients sat in the waiting room filling out medical history forms similar to those handed out at any doctor ’s office , while Starritt met with patients in an adjacent office .
“ Very few are turned down , ” she said .
“ Most have already read Amendment 20 to see what qualifies .
Mostly I see if they meet those qualifications . ”
She ’s turned down people with temporary conditions , women who are pregnant or breastfeeding .
“ I ’m not sure it helps everybody , ” Starritt said .
“ But I ’m not adverse to recommending it if I think it will help the patient and their condition . ”
Starritt says many of the people she sees complain of back pain .
“ Many have tried Vicodin or ibuprofen , they ’ve already tried everything else before they come here , ” said Starritt .
Others do n’t have health insurance and the access to traditional medicine it brings .
Consciously or not , doctors have become part of the public debate .
In August , the state health department released a study that showed 15 doctors were responsible for 75 percent of the 10,000 patients then on Colorado 's medical marijuana registry .
One estimated granting 1,750 cards .
Starritt , who estimates she 's seen 600 patients in her part - time role , acknowledges as much in her doctor 's note on the Herban Wellness Website : “ I do believe that sometimes patients are fraudulent both in my regular primary care office as well as the marijuana evaluations but I think it is a doctor ’s responsibility to believe his patients for the most part .
I do find this incredulous , but I do not deny these patients their cholesterol or blood pressure medications because perhaps they are not completely truthful . ”

Colum McCann to Adapt Joyce 's " Ulysses " Into New Series for HBO
Fresh from winning the National Book Award for his novel " Let the Great World Spin , " Irish - American author Colum McCann has agreed to adapt James Joyce 's " Ulysses " into a new original series for HBO starring Colin Farrell , Brendan Gleeson , Jeff Goldblum , and Kate Winslet .
" We are going to shoot every page , " said McCann .
" Ulysses is about nothing if not language , and HBO has hired me to make sure that all that wonderful language makes it to the screen .
"
The series will run 18 episodes over two years and will all take place during one long day in June as Leopold Bloom travels through the streets of Dublin , interacting with the ghosts of Irish history .
" It 's going to be great , " said McCann .
" Drugs , sex , adultery , violence , poetry .
There 's a villain .
This one - eyed nationalist fellow .
While it 's all a bit dark and fantastical , in the end it 's about how hard married love can be , which is something I think all Americans can appreciate " McCann has been hosting Bloomsday readings at the Ulysses Bar in New York City 's Financial District for over ten years .
He 's been longing to see Ulysses as a long - form serial television drama ever since hearing Colin Farrell 's rendition of " The Scylla and Charybdis " section of the novel .
" We wanted Colin Farrell and we got Colin Farrel , " said McCann .
" I can't think of a single better person to play Stephen Dedalus .
And with Jeff ( Goldblum ) along for the ride as Leopold , we really can't lose . " McCann is no stranger to screenwriting .
In 2005 , his short story " Everything in This Country Must " was turned into a short film by Gary McKendry and nominated for an Academy Award .
In addition to the " Ulysses " project , McCann is also working with producer J.J. Abrams to adapt " Let the Great World Spin " into a film scheduled for release in 2012 .
"
If James Joyce were alive today , he probably would n't watch much TV , " said McCann .
" But this is n't TV .
It 's HBO . "
Can you imagine treating your doctor this way ?
Unfortunately , this is how many web developers and software developers are treated regularly by clients .
Due to website development being a pretty new occupation , there are still a lot of people out there that do not understand what goes in to making that cool website , or that awesome online application .
I have personally been on the receiving end of some pretty ridiculous and outright stupid requests by clients .
It is so common , that sites like Clients From Hell are able to exist and be filled with stories which at first seem totally fictional .
But they are not .
But go and speak to someone who works in web development and ask them about horror clients .
Every one of them will have a story to tell you .
My theory is that because the average person only sees the front end of websites , they have no idea of the coding work and time it takes to create a good web product .
They do not get to “ look under the hood ” and see all the scripts , calls , CSS styles , etc .
If they did , there would be more understanding that this is REAL work , not just a hobby people do on computers in their spare time .
( Also , many “ discount ” operators such as outsourced development teams & unqualified designers help to perpetuate a myth that this work is cheap & easy to do )
Think about industries where customers have a better understanding of who the end result is produced :
– Customers would not tell a mechanic to throw in free extras just because they are in the engine anyway .
– Clients would not ask an architect to totally redesign a building plan once it is done , by 9 am the next day , because their 6yr old son did not like it .
– House painters are not asked to re-paint a house for free , because the colour now looks different when viewed in the morning sun .
– Lawyers are not asked to work on a case for free , just because it may look good in their resume later .
Sadly , elements of all these things exist within the current client - web developer dynamic .
I , for one , hope this changes soon .
Polish authorities have arrested at the request of Germany a suspected Mossad agent thought to have played a role in the Dubai assassination of a Hamas commander , German prosecutors said Saturday .
“ He was arrested in Warsaw and is suspected of being involved in illegally obtaining a ( German ) passport , ” a spokesman for German federal prosecution said , confirming a report in German magazine Der Spiegel .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It ’s now up to the Poles to decide if they are going to hand him over to Germany . ”
According to an article to be published Monday in Der Spiegel , the suspect identified as Uri Brodsky was arrested early June on arrival at Warsaw ’s airport on suspicions that he helped a member of the hit squad get a German passport in June 2009 .
Mahmud al - Mabhuh , a founder of the military wing of the Islamist Hamas movement which controls Gaza , was found dead in his room in the Al Bustan Rotana hotel near Dubai airport on January 20 .
Dubai police have released extensive surveillance camera footage they say shows the team of suspects from the hit squad they have linked to the Mossad .
The Hamas man had been drugged and then suffocated .
Twelve British , six Irish , four French , one German and three Australian passports were used by 26 people believed linked to the murder , according to Dubai police .

In many cases , the documents appeared either to have been faked or obtained illegally .
The issue caused a diplomatic row in which the five countries whose passports were used called in Israeli envoys for talks .

Israel is currently trying to explain to the world why it was justified in slaughtering civilians aboard the Flotilla .
The rationale behind the melee is that Very Dangerous Persons were bringing Very Dangerous Items into Gaza .
These items included things like …cement .
You see , according to psychic David Frum , the cement would n’t be used to rebuild Gaza ’s infrastructure , most of which was totally obliterated during the 2008 conflict ( some estimate 70 % of Rafah city needs to be rebuilt , ) but rather to build bunkers for Hamas .
We know the cement would be used for bunkers because Frum tells us so , and Frum knows this because Israel told him .
Israel harbors a plethora of prescient visions about the nefarious ways Palestinians would use all kinds of products .
They even have a list !
Check it out ( via Sully ) :
These may seem like weird , arbitrary things to ban ( Nutmeg ? ) but a sick thread of authoritarian genius ties these items together .
Notice the prohibited items ( seeds , chickens , donkeys , horses , goats , cattle , wood for construction ) .
These are tools used by autonomous nations composed of a self - sustaining population .
Israel forbids these items because it wants Gaza to remain crippled and dependent upon it .
There are two ways to destroy a nation and its people : absolute slaughter , which Israel demonstrated it is not above doing in short , violent bursts until the world recoils in horror and shames it into ending the siege , or slow suffocation via blockades .
This list illustrates how to strangle a population .
As for newspapers and music , well , the reasons for their presences on The List should be obvious , too .
An educated population is a dangerous population , and music is cathartic and motivational for human beings , particularly among young revolutionaries .
Music creates solidarity , and it can be used as a way for slaves to communicate with one another .
Music ( especially hip hop ) is considered to be so dangerous in Gaza that Hamas sometimes self - censors its own people .
The Flotilla travesty was simply the logical next step in Israel ’s fascist behavior .
The Jewish state has been systematically slaughtering the Palestinian people , and when it ca n’t get away with committing genocide , it strangles Gaza with blockades .
And when the world attempts to break that blockade , the IDF storms a ship sailing in international waters , and slaughters nine civilians .
This is n’t about cement , or nutmeg .
This is about Israel asking Palestinians to live impossible lives of starvation and humiliation , and then clutching its pearls in mock surprise when Palestinians — and international activists — fight back .
Update :
The dangerous Flotilla cargo included “ toys , some wheelchairs and a lot of used clothes . ”
Ten months after it debuted rudimentary malware scanning in Snow Leopard , Apple this week quietly added a signature for a third piece of malware , security researchers reported Friday .
According to U.K - based antivirus vendor Sophos and U.S. Mac security company Intego , Mac OS X 10.6.4 , which Apple released this past Tuesday , includes an update to XProtect .
Dubbed that because the malware signatures are contained within Snow Leopard ’s “ XProtect. plist ” file , the feature debuted in August 2009 with the launch of Mac OS X 10.6 .
At the time , Apple included detection for only two pieces of malware , Trojan horses named “ RSPlug.a ” and “ Iservice ” by Symantec .
The 10.6.4 update added a scanning signature for another Trojan , which Symantec has labeled as “ HellRTS . ”
According to Sophos , which calls the same Trojan “ OSX / Pinhead - B , ” and like Symantec has had protection in place since April , hackers have disguised the threat as iPhoto , the photo management software that ships with new Macs .
The masquerade is meant to dupe users into installing the backdoor malware .
Apple did not note the change to XProtect ’s signature list in the release notes for Mac OS X 10.6.4 , a fact that Sophos ’ Graham Cluley found curious .
“ You have to wonder whether they ’re keeping quiet about an anti-malware security update like this … for marketing reasons , ” speculated Cluley , a Sophos senior technology consultant , in a post to a company blog .
“ Shh !
Do n’t tell folks that we have to protect against malware on Mac OS X ! ”
Computerworld confirmed that detection for HellRTS has been added to XProtect .
plist .
Not surprisingly , both Sophos and Intego — each sells Mac security software — dismissed the update .
“ Although I welcome Apple doing something to reduce the malware problem on Mac OS X , I do n’t consider it a replacement for real anti- virus software , ” Cluley asserted .
“ So Apple ’s anti-malware feature now protects against three types of malware , ” said Intego on its Web site .
“ Intego ’s VirusBarrier X6 protects against all known Mac malware . ”

PASCAGOULA , Miss . --
An illegal immigrant was wearing an " I 'm hiding from the cops " shirt when he was arrested on child molestation charges , authorities said today
William Velasquez Castillo , 27 , was arrested by U.S. Marshals in Lucedale late Wednesday evening , Jackson County Sheriff Mike Byrd said .
Investigators have been searching for Castillo since April 3 when a 10 - year - old girl told investigators he molested her in a vehicle in Ocean Springs , Byrd said .
Castillo's last known residence was on Derry Street in Ocean Springs , the sheriff added .
A warrant was issued for Castillo on April 23 and detectives believe he fled the area shortly after learning he was wanted by authorities , Byrd said .
Castillo was discovered by authorities at the Dorsett Hotel on Main Street in Lucedale .
" At the time of his capture William Castillo was wearing a T - shirt that stated , ' I 'm hiding from the cops . ' "
Castillo was in the Jackson County Adult Center awaiting an initial appearance at 2 p.m. today .
There is also a hold placed on Castillo for the U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement .
" ICE has their own investigation , " Byrd said .
Raw organic Kosher centrifuge - extracted virgin coconut oil
How coconut oil is harvested and extracted
Using virgin coconut oil
( Natural News )
People who really know about health know about .
It 's the oil of choice for health - conscious people , and it's used in everything from smoothies ( delicious ! ) to personal care products .
You can use coconut oil both inside and outside your body .
It 's even useful for cooking because coconut oil has a much higher temperature tolerance than even extra virgin olive oil .
Its fat molecules stay intact , in other words , at higher stovetop temperatures , so that makes it safer for use as a cooking oil .
It 's also widely used inas a stabilizer and source of delicious plant - based fats with their own unique nutritional properties .
Virgin coconut oil is 44.6 % lauric acid , 16.8 % myristic acid , and 8.2 % palmitic acid , and it 's composed mostly of medium - chain - fatty - acids ( MCFA ) .
MCFAs are widely regarded as extremely useful for providing sustainable energy due to their molecular structure .
Many bodybuilders and athletes rely on MCFAs as a key part of their high - performance diets .
I 've been an advocate of organic virgin coconut oil for years , recommending all the top companies such as Nutiva ( www.Nutiva.com ) and Vivapura ( www.VivaPura.net ) .
They provide outstanding coconut oil products that I use myself on a regular basis .
Now , we 've teamed up with The Raw Food World to acquire a large shipment of 100 % raw , organic , Kosher , centrifuge virgin coconut oil from the Philippines that 's available in the NaturalNews Store starting today .

If you want glass containers , choose the 16 oz .
containers instead . )
Ever wonder how premium coconut oil is actually made ?
Here 's where ours comes from :
First , whole coconuts are collected fresh off the tree , then shelled to remove the outer shell ( the brown skin ) .
The white coconut meat is removed and ground at low temperatures into granules .
These granules are then dried at 104 - 113 degrees Fahrenheit for 2.5 hours .
Once dried , the coconut granules are loaded into a customized cold - process expeller that squeezes out the oil .
This is also done at 113 degrees or lower in order to preserve the raw nutrients .
The oil that comes out is then loaded into a centrifuge machine that spins it at high speed to remove any moisture or particulate matter .
( The solid coconut matter that comes out is used to make coconut flour , which can be substituted for wheat in baking recipes . )
The resulting oil is called " Virgin Coconut Oil . "
It is then poured into the final containers , labeled and shipped .
Note that there is no cooking , pasteurization , fumigation , hydrogenation or other artificial process involved .
This is all about harvesting the coconut meat , drying it , then pressing out the oils to be captured , filtered and packaged .
It is probably the most natural process you can find for consuming coconut oil other than picking and eating the coconut yourself .
Coconut oil has a surprisingly long shelf life -- up to several years on the shelf due to its ability to naturally resist oxidation .
When stored in the refrigerator , it is naturally a solid .
When warmed in ambient room temperature , it becomes a liquid .
Here are several ideas for using coconut oil .
If you 're right now cooking in a pan with something like olive oil , try replacing that with coconut oil .
Coconut oil resists creating high - heat carcinogens , meaning you can cook with it at higher temperatures without poisoning your food as often happens with corn oil , soybean oil or other cheap , low - end vegetable oils .
Secondly , you can add coconut oil to just about any smoothie to give it a fatty " ice cream " flavor and texture .
Try blending frozen fruit with palm sugar and coconut oil !
It makes a delicious , ice cream textured dessert that will just blow your mind with its nutritional potency , too .
( Your kids can eat this all day long , guilt free ! )
If you 're into raw foods recipes , you 'll find yourself using coconut oil for all kinds of things .
Especially desserts , where coconut oil is often part of the icing that goes on the raw cake or pie .
It 's super delicious !
( And also guilt free ... )
You can use coconut oil in practically any recipe that calls for vegetable oil or shortening .
Shortening , by the way , is just hydrogenated vegetable oil .
I hope you never eat that because it 's terrible for your health .
Replace it with coconut oil for the sake of your health ... Coconut oil can also be used as a partial replacement for .
It does n't quite have the butter taste , but it 's close , and the healthy fats in it resemble butter in many recipes .
( Try replacing half the butter in a recipe with coconut oil . )
Finally , you can use this coconut oil to .
Melt a small amount ofin a pan with coconut oil , add some medicinal herbs or tinctures , and you 've made your own skin salve !
Coconut oil is a wonderful base for all sorts of personal care products .
I 've even seen it packaged as a personal lubricant ( no kidding ! ) .
It 's great for skin , hair , face and your entire body , head to toe .
The key is getting the good quality coconut oil that has n't been cooked .
That 's why you 'll really like what we 've acquired for you here :
It 's a premium - grade coconut oil that 's perfect for smoothies , cooking , baking and personal care needs .
Get some while our supplies last .
As with most of our specials , this is a one - time shipment that will probably be sold out within a few days .
You 'll really enjoy this oil .
I 'm stocking up on some for my own kitchen !
Ian Holloway may always be remembered for his treatise on the importance of getting a result , in which he used the analogy of pulling a dodgy bird in a nightclub .
" She might not be the best looking lady we ended up taking home but it was still very pleasant , " he said , as part of his entry into football 's all - time list of humorous quotations .
The problem with Holloway 's girl - in - a - taxi line was that it served to reinforce the impression of him as some sort of dugout comedian , which , in truth , his frequent appearances on Sky Sports ' Soccer AM programme did nothing to dispel .
When he was sacked as the manager of Leicester City in May 2008 , his future looked anything but amusing and it was hard to see where and how he could reinvent himself .
The idea that it would be at little Blackpool and he would finish his debut season in charge with a fairytale promotion into the Premier League would have had most people scoffing .
No one is laughing now .
Except , perhaps , Blackpool 's bank manager .
Holloway 's triumph at Wembley in the play - off final against Cardiff City and over the course of the season has been built on more than sterling man‑management .
During his year away post - Leicester , Holloway reflected on the importance of going all - out to win matches and once installed at Bloomfield Road he insisted on a bold 4 - 3 - 3 formation , with a trio of genuine strikers .
Fortune has favoured his bravery , no more so than here when his full - backs resembled auxiliary wingers and tangerine shirts passed and moved beautifully during a memorable first half .
Blackpool were clinging on at times in the second period but , as the champagne corks popped at full time and the pipe dream became gloriously real , Holloway could savour vindication of the most satisfying variety .
Here was a football man having reminded everybody of his true worth .
For Cardiff , the disappointment cut to the core .
After a season pockmarked by winding - up petitions and self - imposed transfer embargoes , they had dared to hope for the happy ending that would have wiped away their troubles .
Instead , it was Blackpool who hit the £ 90 m jackpot .
Will Cardiff 's fiscal saviours from Malaysia now come through for them and can they keep hold of their key players ?
Holloway 's brief upon taking the Blackpool job was to prevent the club being relegated into League One .
They had one of the lowest wage bills in the Championship , standing at £ 6 m , and when Holloway claimed that promotion was a possibility people thought he was being flippant .
Yet his belief has proved contagious , while his commitment to expansive , attacking football has had a liberating effect .
He has preached a gospel of ' ' No fear ' ' and , on a picture ‑perfect afternoon , it felt as if the favourites , Cardiff , were the ones with everything to lose .
There was plenty to enjoy about the match , from the smoothness of Blackpool 's passing in the first half to Peter Whittingham 's vision for Cardiff and Michael Chopra 's razor - sharp little runs .
It was even possible for the neutral to revel in the Disneyland defending on show .
All that the centre - halves were missing were the over - sized shoes and giant ears but it made for a thrilling playground - style shoot - out .
Cardiff 's game - plan needed to be revised when Jay Bothroyd went off .
The influential centre - forward laboured through 15 minutes before he accepted the inevitable .
Should he even have played ?
Passions bubbled furiously .
There was even a flare - up between Mark Kennedy and his Cardiff team - mate Anthony Gerrard , the substitute , as the latter warmed up on the touchline .
Holloway ran the gamut of emotions .
The heart fluttered when Chopra hit the woodwork for the second time while the flappings of his goalkeeper , Matt Gilks , did little to engender calm .
There was a desperation about Blackpool 's rearguard action at the death .
But they came through and though Cardiff may argue they deserved better there could be no dampening the Blackpool celebrations .
On the brink of ruin 11 years ago when Karl Oyston became their chairman , this promotion means they have travelled from the bottom division to the top in the space of nine years .
Blackpool 's finest hour is said to be the FA Cup final of 1953 , when some bloke called Matthews wrote his name into folklore .
Thanks to Holloway , Wembley now holds fresh glories for the club .

LONDON - Oil gushing from an undersea well in the Gulf of Mexico has damaged BP 's reputation and share price but accidents involving other companies in less scrutinized parts of the world have avoided the media glare .
Investors have knocked around $ 30 billion off BP 's value since an explosion at a drilling rig killed 11 people and began an oil spill the London - based major is struggling to plug nearly a month after the accident happened .
The U.S. media and political machine has turned its full force on BP and U.S. President Barack Obama has set up a commission into the leak which is sending an estimated 5,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) into Gulf of Mexico waters .
In contrast , the international media has largely ignored the latest incidents of pipeline damage in Nigeria , where the public can only guess how much oil might have been leaked .
The most recent damage in Nigeria , which has not been attributed to militant attacks that have preyed on Nigerian oil infrastructure for years , forced U.S. operator ExxonMobil to relieve itself of contractual obligations by declaring force majeure on its exports of Nigerian benchmark crude .
The light sweet crude is particularly well - suited for refining into gasoline and is regularly supplied to the United States , the world 's biggest oil burner .
Exxon declined the opportunity to give details of the damage , clean - up or repair work .
An industry source , who declined to be named , said 100,000 bpd of oil had leaked for a week from a pipeline that has since been mended .
" If this ( the BP spill ) were in the Niger Delta , no one would be batting an eyelid , " said Holly Pattenden , African oil analyst at consultants Business Monitor International .
" They have these kind of oil spills in Nigeria all the time . "
SHARE PRICE IMPACT
BP 's share price has fallen around 18 percent since news of the fire at the drilling station on April 20 , while Exxon shares were largely unchanged after the force majeure announcement .
The largest operator in Nigeria , Royal Dutch Shell has clashed with the Nigerian government for decades following numerous spills in Africa 's largest energy producer .
Shell said in a statement on its website that its Nigerian joint venture cleans up oil spills as quickly as possible , no matter what their cause , but is sometimes delayed by security concerns or because some communities deny access .
The Anglo - Dutch major said the volume of oil spills in Nigeria for its joint venture was almost 14,000 tonnes last year , the equivalent of around 280 bpd , mainly because of militant attacks on facilities .
" It ( the U.S. ) is without doubt the worse place for BP to lose their political capital , " said James Marriott , oil and gas analyst at environmental organization Platform .
" If the U.S. administration gets aggressive against BP , then it's a problem for them offshore , onshore in terms of shale gas , for conventional gas , refining , some cross - border projects with Canada and further afield . "
In the United States , BP 's massive spill and the risk of an environmental catastrophe could have implications throughout the industry as it has reopened the debate about deepwater drilling .
Analysts say , however , the world is hugely dependent on deepwater drilling to secure oil supplies .
The ExxonMobil force majeure relates to shallow offshore oil , but much of West Africa 's crude production , like that in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico , is deepwater .
Analysts say it is unrealistic to veto deepwater drilling if the world 's oil needs are to be met .
" Perhaps in terms of health and safety regulation ( things will change ) , but not in terms of drilling , " said Angus McPhail of Wood Mackenzie consultants .
" It is not really feasible to stop drilling altogether as long as there is good demand for the product ....
It would be total economic madness . "

The number of US troops in Afghanistan is to reach 100,000
There are more US troops in Afghanistan than Iraq for the first time since Saddam Hussein was toppled in 2003 , officials say .
New Pentagon figures show there are currently around 94,000 troops in Afghanistan compared to 92,000 in Iraq .
President Barack Obama has pledged to withdraw all combat troops from Iraq by the end of August .
Up to 50,000 are expected to remain there until the end of 2011 to help train and equip Iraqi forces .
In December , Mr Obama announced he was sending an additional 30,000 troops to help battle the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan .
The total number of American troops in the country is expected to reach around 100,000 later this year , while Nato allies contribute another 47,000 soldiers .
US troops first fought in Afghanistan shortly after the September 2001 attacks on New York and Washington .
England were the better side , but struggled to make their dominance count and came close to losing the game .
The USA ’s 4 - 2 - 2 - 2 shape caused problems and prevented England ’s full - backs from getting into the game .
England started with their usual shape from qualification , Wayne Rooney partnering Emile Heskey upfront .
In Gareth Barry ’s absence , Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard played together in midfield and James Milner started on the left – although only stayed there for half an hour .
The US also fielded their usual shape , a 4 - 4 - 2 / 4 - 2-2 - 2 that saw Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey supporting Jozy Altidore and Robbie Findley .
Steve Cherundolo started ahead of Jonathan Spector after the latter ’s poor run of form .
Firstly , we must clear one thing up about England ’s formation , as it has been expressed as both a 4 - 4 - 2 and a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 throughout Fabio Capello ’s reign in charge .
The two systems look different in pure numbers but can be similar on the pitch – if one striker drops off and the wingers push on in a 4 - 4 - 2 , you have a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 fairly seamlessly .
England , however , played a 4 - 4 - 2 in this match .
Wayne Rooney did not play between the left - winger and right - winger , he played upfront and , in fact , often in advance of Emile Heskey for much of the game .
One of the biggest issues from the game was always going to be the question of whether the Gerrard - Lampard combination worked .
Slightly surprisingly , they were given the freedom to dovetail at will throughout the game , rather than one of them being given a specific brief to sit in front of the defence .
When this has happened before , it has often resulted in an unbalanced centre of midfield with both looking to make forward runs , but both were responsible positionally whilst getting forward when appropriate , and it ’s fair to say that defensively , England rarely had problems stemming from a position those two were meant to be occupying ( with the obvious exception of the goal , for which the blame is clearly not with the midfield ) .
The problem with declaring the system a ( partial ) success , though , is that they were never going to be tested in that respect anyway .
In Michael Bradley and Ricardo Clark , the US play two defensive - minded midfielders that rarely look to link up directly with the forwards .
They leave that to the wide players – and in fact , the full - backs offer more attacking threat than the central midfielders .
It ’s simply not possible to treat this as an audition for the Gerrard - Lampard partnership being deployed against sides that play a deep - lying forward or an offensive central midfielder , where their defensive abilities would come under a lot closer scrutiny .
Heskey plays role brilliantly
Another classic England - related debate concerns
Heskey , a notoriously goal - shy striker that many fans would prefer to see nowhere near the squad .
This game showed his value to England , however – he constantly won aerial balls , held the ball up , and ( perhaps surprisingly ) showed very good movement when England ’s creative players got the ball .
He had done his job within the first five minutes with his assist for Gerrard ’s goal – receiving the ball to feet , playing a simple pass for an onrushing midfield player , and England were ahead .
As seems to have happened in every opening game of major tournaments in recent years , England went ahead and then became sloppy .
The US goal was unfortunate and was slightly against the run of play , but England were not controlling the tempo of the game , nor were they dominating possession as well as they should have .
Both Gerrard and Lampard played some awful passes and demonstrated exactly why so many believe England ’s poor ball retention skills will prevent them from winning this competition .
On paper the technical qualities of the England central midfield pairing are far superior to their opposite numbers on the US side , but Bradley and Clark were not overawed and did their calm , unspectacular jobs well .
US ambitious in possession
Firstly , the problems Oguchi Onyewu suffered throughout the game are documented in the three pictures here .
This problem was something ZM highlighted when previewing the US side – see the bottom picture here .
Some might say he was “ Doing a Vermaelen ” .
Great credit should go to Bob Bradley for getting his wide players into advanced positions .
Donovan and Dempsey came off the flanks to provide a threat from a position England are n’t used to dealing with .
The England full - backs were forced to play very narrow , and this in turn opened up space on the flanks .
This helped the US full - backs , because they constantly looked to bomb forward and provide the width that was lacking when the front four all moved centrally .
Although they rarely had a direct influence on the game , it stretched the England defence and helped the attacking quartet find space .
An example of this was the early headed chance for Altidore – the crossing opportunity was there because of Cherundolo ’s 50 - yard decoy run from full - back ( see bottom picture ) .
Many sides would have kept their full - backs at home against an England side containing plenty of pace , but the US ’ attacking instincts paid off .
In particular , Donovan ’s advanced position made it very difficult for Ashley Cole to get forward , and he rarely had an influence in the attacking third .
This is a key part of stopping England – with no left - footed attacking player , they rely on Cole for attacking width on that side , and with the right - winger Aaron Lennon asked to hug the touchline and generally not being involved in build - up play , England found it difficult to create chances , especially with Bradley and Clark patrolling the midfield side - by - side and tracking the runs of Gerrard and Lampard well ( after the goal ) .
Late on
Neither side really used substitutions to change the game in terms of tactics and formations .
England started to push forward late on but this forced their centre - backs into a high line , and exposed the lack of pace at the back .
Jozy Altidore outpaced Jamie Carragher incredibly easily and had his shot turned onto the woodwork by Green .
Carragher looked a yard off the pace for the entirety of the second half , diving in and getting himself in poor positions .
England ’s best opportunities were when the US defence became narrow , and a late ball was played to one of the two wide players .
Aaron Lennon did his job well – he got to the byline and put in a couple of excellent balls , whilst also playing a good through ball for Heskey who shot straight at the goalkeeper .
Shaun Wright - Phillips wasted a good chancend did little of note in his hour on the pitch .
Conclusion
England rarely start well in major tournaments , and the result was not entirely unpredictable .
We should avoid going overboard , but the game presented so many problems for Capello – Milner ’s indiscipline , King ’s fitness worries , Carragher ’s lack of pace , Green ’s confidence after his mistake , Heskey ’s wastefulness ( despite his otherwise excellent display ) .
England ’s formation as a whole did n’t look to be the problem , but this game suggests that stopping Rooney getting on the ball and stopping Ashley Cole getting forward stops England .
The one bright spot was the right - hand side , where Lennon and Glen Johnson attacked well and created chances .
The US will be delighted with the result .
Bradley ’s instructions to the wide players helped the US get a grip on the game and caused England problems – a straight 4 - 4 - 2 v 4 - 4 - 2 would probably have resulted in England dominating to a greater extent , but Donovan and Dempsey ’s position put pressure on the England central midfielders and the England full - backs .
There were issues at both ends of the pitch , however .
The centre - backs get dragged towards the ball too easily , leaving gaps in the defence – if those gaps are filled by the full - backs , then easy balls to the opposition wingers can cause problems .
Meanwhile , the Findley - Altidore partnership worked reasonably well but was fairly easy to read – there ’s surely a need for one to drop off to a greater extent , in order to provide the US with a different option when they win the ball .

Not since the Ayatollah Khomeini sentenced author Salman Rushdie to death for The Satanic Verses has a work of fiction excited as much controversy as Bret Easton Ellis ’ American Psycho .
Described variously as ” the most loathsome offering of the season ” ( Roger Rosenblatt in The New York Times ) and ” a how - to manual on the torture and dismemberment of women ” ( Tammy Bruce of NOW ) , Ellis ’ novel has made even some die - hard advocates of free speech wish the book off the face of the earth .
After months of rage and recrimination , 60,000 copies of Psycho were finally shipped to bookstores late last month .
The book , virtually unchanged from the versions leaked to the press last fall , arrives with such a heavy burden of notoriety that the complaints — if not the sales — are sure to be furious .
The first shock waves hit last August when female employees at Simon & Schuster , the book ’s original publisher , caught wind of its content and began to protest its publication .
Soon afterward , both TIME and Spy magazines obtained copies of the manuscript , described the controversy at Simon & Schuster , and detailed the book ’s gruesome scenes of women being tortured and killed by a Wall Street yuppie named Patrick Bateman .
Within days , Simon & Schuster canceled the novel , prompting cries of corporate censorship .
Ellis was allowed to keep his $ 300,000 advance , and 48 hours later his agent , Amanda ” Binky ” Urban of ICM , sold the book to Vintage — Random House ’s highly esteemed trade paperback division — for an undisclosed figure ( estimates range from $ 35,000 to $ 350,000 ) .
Sonny Mehta , the president and editor - in - chief of Knopf ( another division of Random House ) , who purchased the book , consulted neither Vintage staffers nor the imprint ’s publisher , Jane Friedman , defending his acquisition by referring to the book as ” serious . ”
Mehta ’s decision made headlines anew .
New York magazine did a cover story on Ellis ; CNN ran excerpts from the book on its show business segment .
And Tammy Bruce , president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Organization for Women , called for a nationwide boycott of all Vintage and Knopf books , with the exception of those by feminist authors .
The boycott went into effect on Nov. 19 with a 15 - minute recorded message featuring an excerpt from American Psycho on the Los Angeles NOW chapter ’s telephone hot line .
Bruce ’s initiative , which , according to booksellers , has been unsuccessful , was not sanctioned by NOW ’s national board of directors .
The directors chose a different course of action :
They requested a meeting with Mehta to ask that he cancel the novel .
Mehta refused to see them .
From L.A. , Bruce plans to expand her NOW chapter ’s boycott to all - out Psycho warfare .
” The boycott is just one element of the protest , ” she says .
” You wo n’t see books being burned or fireworks when the novel is published .
What you will see is our attempt …to show the gatekeepers of this culture … that the women of this country will no longer tolerate gratuitous violence for the sake of profit and entertainment . ”
Plenty of people , including many in the publishing industry , agree with Bruce .
While most of the nation ’s estimated 20,000 bookstores have agreed to sell the book — if only out of a sense of responsibility to the First Amendment — scores of booksellers and at least one distributor , Bookpeople in Berkeley , Calif . , have refused to carry it .
Bookpeople issued a statement saying , ” We do n’t wish to represent that part of our culture : the exploitation of sadomasochism . ”
Hilary Sio , manager of New York City ’s Three Lives & Co. bookstore , says , ” We ’ll probably special order it for someone who really wants it .
But we will not be carrying it . ”
Other retailers have decided not to offer the book because of its perceived lack of literary merit .
Says Judith Walker of The Corner Bookstore in Albuquerque , N.M. : ” My job is to provide my customers with the best cross section of literature I can find , and Mr. Ellis is a terrible writer , always has been .
As a bookseller , good writing is my agenda , not violence against women . ”
Some publishers feel the same way , among them Phyllis Grann , president and chief executive of G.P. Putnam ’s Sons .
” I ’ve read the book , ” she says , ” and as a woman I certainly would n’t publish it .
I found the extreme graphic - ness of the descriptions of the mutilation of the women highly disturbing and very distasteful .
But just as I have the right to reject something , other people should have the right to publish it . ”
Roger Straus Jr. , president and chief executive of Farrar , Straus and Giroux , is less flexible .
One of publishing ’s most respected and outspoken figures , Straus says American Psycho is ” the most revolting book I have ever read .
To say that it has any redeeming social value , or that mainstream film and television contain equally offensive material , is bullshit .
The horrors perpetrated on women in that book go far beyond anything that has either been written or depicted .
I ’m sorry .
I just do n’t see the thing as being defendable . ”

One of the most frustrating features of this crisis is that we do n’t really know which effects of the spill will be most catastrophic .
Here is one that seems both horrific and likely .
High concentrations of methane gas – in some cases approaching 1 m times the normal level – have been found around the BP oil spill , raising fears it could create an oxygen - depleted “ dead zone ” where marine life cannot survive .
Dead zones are areas in the water where algae blooms as it feeds on nutrients in high concentrations of foreign matter , such as methane , in this case , or , more typically , the components of farmland fertiliser runoff into the water .
The algae gorge , reproduce quickly and then , in turn , are eaten by bacteria in a process that depletes the immediate area of oxygen .
Fish and other sea life cannot survive in these zones , leading scientists to call them “ dead ” .
That the spill could cause a dead zone in the Gulf would be yet another negative for the environment , already suffering from the destruction of marine nurseries and bird nesting grounds in the wetlands and projections of negative impacts on sea life along the Gulf Coast .
The knock - on effect would be a pocket of the Gulf where fishermen would find no fish or other sea creatures to harvest .
The site where large concentrations of methane has been found is in a six - mile radius around the spill , where John Kessler , assistant professor in the Department of Oceanography at Texas A&M University , has just returned from a 10 - day research trip .
From a previous trip last year to the same area , he has identified the rise in methane to the Deepwater Horizon accident .
Methane is a key component of natural gas , such as ethane and propane , and it accounts for 40 per cent of the weight of material emanating from BP ’s leaking well .
Last year the concentrations of these gases were at normal levels of one to two parts per million .
This year , the concentration of methane dissolved in the seawater is 100,000 times more and , in some places , approaching 1 m times more , he said .
While methane may be toxic to various marine organisms , one of the focuses of Kessler ’s research is investigating if the high concentration of methane could lead to a feeding frenzy by marine microorganizations that feed on this hydrocarbon , depleting the oxygen in the area and creating a dead zone .
“ There are some drawdowns in oxygen , ” Kessler said .
“ It ’s significant ; we notice it .
It ’s there . ”
But whether it will increase enough to cause a dead zone remains to be seen , he said , with significant factors being how high the concentrations of methane will get and how long they will remain at these enhanced levels … [ emphasis added ]
Paul Gray , bassist with the heavy metal band Slipknot , was found dead in a hotel room in Urbandale , Iowa , today .
Police do not suspect foul play , the Associated Press is reporting .
A hotel employee found the 38 - year - old musician in the room .
An autopsy is scheduled for tomorrow .
Urbandale is a suburb of Des Moines , where most of the band grew up .
Slipknot , which formed in 1995 , is known for wearing grotesque masks while performing .
The band 's first album sold more than a million copies .
At less than 12.5 miles ( 20 km ) , it has a long way to go to realise Cecil Rhodes 's dream of a Cape - to - Cairo railway , but at least it 's a start .
The R24bn ( £ 2.15 bn ) Gautrain was launched in South Africa today , just in time to carry World Cup football fans and to usher in a new dawn in the chequered history of African railways .
The Gautrain is the first high - speed urban train on the continent , capable of 100 mph and hailed as an antidote to Johannesburg 's notorious traffic jams .
The first route links OR Tambo international airport to Sandton , the commercial hub of Johannesburg .
Like Britain's Heathrow Express , it takes about 15 minutes and is far quicker than travelling by road , but it compares favourably in price at just R100 ( £ 8.94 ) .
When the Guardian took a test ride of the Gautrain recently , progress was comfortable if a little cautious .
The train had a sleek silver and gold exterior , but the inside was unnervingly familiar : the Electrostar carriages , built by Bombardier Transportation in Derby , are also used by various British operators .
Less familiar is their cleanliness , at least for now .
What seems the epitome of mundane routine for the average British commuter is being seen as near miraculous in a city where , like Los Angeles , the car is king and the train is nowhere in sight when navigating the sprawling suburbs .
A crowd gathered at 5.24 am this morning for the train 's inaugural journey .
One traveller , Narcizo Makwakwa , told the BBC he took the train from Sandton to the airport " just for a joy ride " , adding : " After this , I am going to work but I had to see it .
I could n't wait for the past seven years for this , it is beautiful . "
When it first appeared the Gautrain would not be ready , officials were quick to point out that it was never intended to be a World Cup project .
But now that the first leg is able to carry fans from the airport to Sandton , where many will be staying , it seems to have become part of the euphoria engulfing the country before kick - off on Friday .
However , like the hosting of the tournament itself , there are questions over who wins and who loses from the Gautrain , which has been criticised for running behind schedule and over budget .
The fares – collected with a pre-paid smart card rather like London 's Oyster card – may seem cheap by British standards but are likely to be too expensive for the majority of South Africans .
The air - conditioned train will eventually link Johannesburg , the nation 's commercial capital , with Pretoria , the administrative capital 31 miles away , in a 40 - minute journey .
This will be a tremendous boon to the mostly middle - class drivers who sometimes crawl in traffic for more than two hours .
The Gautrain will also connect with Park Station in Johannesburg 's less salubrious downtown .
But critics say this excludes the millions of poor people who live in townships such as Soweto .
They are forced to rely on minibus taxis on some of the world 's most dangerous roads , and metro commuter trains which have a reputation for overcrowding , muggings and cancellations due to strikes .
The transport divide reflects how geography shaped South African society under racial apartheid , with black people forced into townships on the outskirts of cities .
Even today , many black workers are forced to rise before dawn and spend a high percentage of their earnings to reach their workplace .
South Africa is this month marking the 150th anniversary of the country 's railways , but intercity services are now generally infrequent and little used by residents .
In the age of the car and plane , the train has become almost a tourist novelty – most notably the five - star luxury Blue Train .
But for now , the launch of the Gautrain , along with state - of - the - art World Cup stadiums , is being championed as proof that South Africa is no longer travelling second class in the world .
" It has created a feeling of national pride , " said government minister Jeff Radebe .
" South Africans can achieve the impossible when we put our minds to it . "
What do countries do when they run out of oil ?
That ’s the question posed by Oxford University ’s Joerg Friedrich in a fortcoming journal piece in Energy Policy ( already available here ) .
Friedrich give three examples of strategies taken by countries facing this very issue in the past , which go like this .
First , you can opt for predatory militarism , where Japan before and during World War Two provides his case study .
According to Friedrich , “ the spectre of future resource shortages had played an important part in shaping Japan ’s imperialist strategy ever since the end of World War One … when an American oil embargo became imminent , in 1941 , Japan pre-emptively attacked the US and radicalized its war of conquest in order to gain access to the oil supplies of the East Indies ” .
A second strategy , he reckons , is totalitarian retrenchment , which is what North Korea did after the Cold War .
“ When subsidized deliveries of oil and other vital resources from the Soviet Union were disrupted , the ‘ Hermit Kingdom ’ reacted in a shockingly reckless way .
Elite privileges were preserved in the face of hundreds of thousands of North Koreans dying from hunger . ”
Third , he offers what he calls socio-economic adaptation – which , he argues , is what Cuba successfully achieved when faced with the same challenges as North Korea .
While the end of subsidized deliveries from the USSR presented a massive challenge here too , “ there was no mass starvation comparable to North Korea .
Instead , Cubans relied on social networks and non-industrial modes of production to cope with energy scarcity and the concomitant shortage of food .
They were actively encouraged to do so by the regime in Havana ” .
It ’s an engaging analysis , and worth reading the whole thing – and I absolutely share Friedrich ’s concern about the risk of hugely damaging zero sum games as resources get scarce .
But as with many other peak oil analyses , I hesitate about the implied assumption that the answer to peak oil is necessarily local .
I ’d love to hear Friedrich ’s take on what might an internationalist approach to managing increasing resource scarcity might look like .
Cuba ’s hardly the best case study for examining that , of course , given that it also faces the small matter of a US trade embargo .
But it ’s still a big – and largely unexamined – question .

The recent victory of workers at Rio Tinto ’s huge mine in the small town of Boron , tucked away in southern California ’s high desert , is a textbook case of how to win against a giant transnational corporation .
“ It was David vs. Goliath , ” International President Bob McEllrath said in the latest issue of the Dispatcher , publication of the International Longshsore and Warehouse Union ( ILWU ) .
Some 570 miners , their families and their union in Boron faced down Rio Tinto , the giant conglomerate operating mines in five continents , in a hard fought battle to save their union , their working conditions and their town .
In the end , after a 15 - week lockout , ILWU Local 30 members approved a new contract May 15 , pushing back the package of 81 “ take - away ” demands they had rejected one day before the Jan. 31 lockout .
“ We ’re going back with our heads held high , but we ’re also guarded about dealing with a company that locked us out , ” said Terri Judd , Desert Storm veteran and official spokesperson for Local 30 members during the lockout .
Under the original management takeaway ultimatum , the company demands included authority to cut employee pay at will , to give raises to those of their choosing , to convert full - time jobs into part - time positions , and to do away with seniority .
The new six - year contract that members approved by a 75 percent vote margin guarantees annual wage increases of 2.5 percent across the board , provides a $ 5,000 one - time bonus per worker , protects full - time jobs and seniority rights , and sends scabs packing , the Dispatcher reported .
Local 30 President Dave Liebengood praised the membership for “ sticking together and fighting for the best agreement we could from a company that wanted to destroy our union . ”
“ We did n’t get everything we wanted , and we had to make some compromises , ” Liebengood added , “ but the final contract was a real victory for us . ”
The compromises included replacement of guaranteed pension benefits with a 401 ( k ) savings plan for new hires , according to the Dispatcher .
The miners and their union fought off a powerful and resourceful transnational corporation that walked away with nearly $ 5 billion in profits in 2009 despite the global recession .
But the widespread united action with which the workers and the ILWU met the company ’s challenge was no less powerful and resourceful and , in the end , perhaps more so .
ILWU President McEllrath said , “ Beating back Rio Tinto was a huge undertaking and a victory for the labor movement . ”
He noted the new contract “ sets the standard higher for other mining contracts . ”
The ILWU International , working with Local 30 , mounted a national and international campaign of solidarity with the aim of guaranteeing the unity and wellbeing of Local 30 members and their families during the lockout while exerting maximum pressure on the company in the U.S. and globally .
( For more detailed information refer to the April / May 2010 issue of the Dispatcher www.ilwu.org).
McEllrath credits the victory “ to the courage and effort by the members and leaders of Local 30 , and to the solidarity within our ranks and from those around the world who still believe :
An injury to one is an injury to all . ”

WASHINGTON – The American Civil Liberties Union submitted comments to the Advisory Committee on Blood Safety and Availability urging the committee to reassess the Food and Drug Administration ’s policy ( FDA ) on blood donation by gay and bisexual men .
The FDA policy , enacted in 1985 , recommends that men who have had sex with another man even one time since 1977 should be banned from donating blood .
In its comments , the ACLU recommended that the committee base its policy on factual evidence , rather than sexual orientation .
“ The FDA should be basing its policy on facts and not stereotypes , ” said Laura W. Murphy , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
“ If gay and bisexual donors can be screened for donation without causing risk to our nation ’s blood supply , they should be .
The FDA ’s policy wrongly implies the mere fact of sexual activity with another man poses a risk of HIV transmission .
The advisory committee must review its policy and follow science in this issue .
To do otherwise would be discriminatory and unconstitutional . ”
Gay and bisexual men , intravenous drug users , people who have had sex for money and people who have tested positive for HIV disease are currently the only groups of people banned from donating blood .
Though this policy excludes all gay and bisexual men regardless of their individual sexual histories or HIV risk , other individuals who are also at increased risk for HIV , including people who have heterosexual sex with someone who they know to be HIV positive or people who have had sex with a commercial sex worker , are prevented from donating blood for only a year .
While there is no constitutional right to donate blood , government policy regulating the blood donation field must not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation by adopting differing standards for conduct that poses similar risks , based solely on the identity of those engaging in such conduct .
In other words , gay and bisexual men cannot constitutionally be singled out for differential treatment solely because of their sexual relationships .
" Eligibility for donating blood should be based on scientific evidence , not stigmatizing and outdated stereotypes , ” said James Esseks , Director of the ACLU LGBT & AIDS Project .
“ We know that many straight people have HIV .
If the existing screening methods are sufficient to protect the blood supply from straight people with HIV , then the government needs a really good reason for having a different rule for gay and bisexual men .
It 's not clear that it does . "
Yiting Cheng just finished up a master ’s degree in design , but she could already teach James Bond a thing or two about stashing valuables .
For her thesis project , Cheng designed a series of eight objects that ingeniously store secrets–from passwords to money to drugs to IDs .
And you can see all of them in this nicely shot video ( our favorite is the secrete drawer , hidden in the edge of a table , which is only accessible when attach a magnetic pull ) :
According to Cheng :
This project is about concealing valuables , secrets , bad habits and
personal information in our workplaces .
Here , hidden spaces / messages
were created within 8 general objects such as wood boards , lamps and
disposable coffee cups .
How ?
By utilizing stereotypes and visual
camouflage .
We make judgments based mainly on our experiences and what
we see .
This dependency on visual information can create large blind
spots .
Thus , usual stereotypes of how we perceive solid , transparency
and lighting are employed in this project to play with notions of “ solid
and void ” and “ true and false . ”
In other words , she hides things in plain sight , by hiding them inside objects so familiar that you ’d never question their integrity .
Q , eat your heart out .
Jimmy Dean , the musician and founder of the Jimmy Dean line of breakfast products , died on Sunday at age 81 .
To commemorate the entrepreneur 's passing , let 's look back on his company 's wondrous inventions .
Like " Pancakes & Sausage on a Stick . "
Jimmy Dean was one hell of an American .
Born in Texas in 1928 , Dean made his name as a country singer , but dabbled in acting ( starring as an ersatz Howard Hughes in the James Bond movie Diamonds Are Forever ) before founding his own sausage company in 1969 .
The Jimmy Dean Meat Co. was a successful endeavor , and he sold it to Sara Lee in 1984 , staying on as a spokesman until 2003 , when the company dropped him — pissing him off to no end .
" The company told me that they were trying to attract the younger housewife , and they did n't think I was the one to do that , " Dean said at the time .
" I think it 's the dumbest thing .
But you know , what do I know ? "
But the things we will always remember Jimmy Dean for are the super gross meals his sausage company produced .
It 's unlikely that Dean himself was involved in the creation of products like the " Bacon Breakfast Skillet " ( a bag of " precooked bacon chips " and various chemicals intended to be thrown in a skillet with six eggs ) , especially since most of these were introduced after his acrimonious departure from Sara Lee .
But for better or worse , this is how JImmy Dean will be remembered :
Pancakes and Sausage on a Stick ( Chocolate Chip )
This is a next - level offering : Something vaguely gross ( pancake wrapped around sausage ) , presented in a way that makes it grosser ( on a stick ) , with the addition of a single element that increases the grossness exponentially ( chocolate chips ) .
Sadly , Jimmy Dean no longer offers the chocolate chip variety — blueberry , however , is still alive and kicking .
One pancake and sausage is 20 % your recommended daily allowance for fat .
Breakfast Bowls : Pancakes and Syrup & Sausage Links
It 's pretty hard to choose which " breakfast bowl " is the grossest , but at least the other bowls seem like meals that could be bowl - based meals in some alternate universe ( " Ham , Eggs , Potatoes and Cheddar Cheese , " say ) .
I cannot imagine a universe where pancakes and sausage makes sense as a meal to be served in a bowl .
And yet :
Here it is .
One bowl is 52 % of your RDA for fat .
Bacon Breakfast Skillets
As I said above , this is just a sack , of , like , chemicals , and potatoes , and " bacon chips , " that you cook with six eggs and , presumably , a whole bottle of Pepto - Bismol .
According to the ingredients list , there are peppers and onions somewhere inside the skillet sack , but on the other hand , " MAY ALSO CONTAIN SMOKE FLAVORING , " so , take your chances .
One bag ( four servings ) is 80 % of your RDA for fat .
Sausage , Egg and Cheese on a Croissant with Diced Apples & Seasoned Hash Browns
Which are the diced apples , and which are the seasoned hash browns ?
It 's very hard to tell by the picture , but I think the ones in the goop are the apples , and the other ones are the hash browns .
That is definitely a croissant , though it's from the school of thought where a croissant is just a funny - shaped bagel .
One entree is 46 % of your RDA for fat .
D- Lights Turkey Sausage Whole Grain Bagel
Ugh .
I mean : Turkey sausage ?
On whole grain ?
Give me battered meat on a stick any day of the week .
Finally , in the hopes that we might remember Dean for his terrific songs , quick wit , and entrepreneurial spirit as much as for the products that bear his name , here 's his Grammy - winning " Big Bad John " :

Jack Algiere , farm manager at the Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture , inspects a young crop of sungold cherry tomatoes in one of his green houses on June 11 .
Stone Barns is a sustainable farming and learning facility for children and tour groups featuring Blue Hill , a top quality restaurant located on the property in Pocantico Hills , Hudson Valley , N.Y .

The tomato is by far America 's most popular home garden crop .
1 BIOLOGIST , 2,500 HEIRLOOMS 1 BIOLOGIST , 2,500 HEIRLOOMS
When is enough enough ?
Never , if you ask heirloom tomato lover Carolyn Male .
Male , author of 100 Heirloom Tomatoes for the American Garden ( Workman Publishing ) , has grown more than 2,500 varieties of heirlooms , several of which she believes only she and one other person in this tomato - loving world are growing .
" Why did I become this passionate about heirlooms ? " the biologist asks .
Her answer : " The biological diversity translates into tremendous varieties of colors , shapes , tastes and even foliage . "
She says she has introduced several hundred varieties of heirlooms to the USA .
Male was raised on a farm in Loudonville , N.Y. , where her parents grew " round , red tomatoes . "
" I find them boring , " she says .
She would be interested in hybrids , however , if it were possible to introduce certain disease tolerances into heirlooms from hybrids , she says .
But even so , her favorites , and she 's back growing tomatoes in Salem , N.Y. , remain heirlooms .
" Everytime I get a new ( seed ) , " she says , " I ca n't wait to see what will grow . "
Longing for a perfect tomato ?
If so , whether you grow your own or plan to buy them at the farmers market , you 're one of the millions counting down the days to the first taste of this summer 's vine - ripened fruits .
And if you 're seriously tomato - obsessed , you 're in good company there , too .
" You take a bite and it 's rapturous , " says Laurel Garza , owner of Heirloom Tomato Plants , a nursery in Southern California .
" People 's eyes roll back in their heads . "
But wait .
Is Garza talking about heirlooms or hybrids ?
The tomato - obsessed have firm , sometimes fanatical , opinions as to which is superior , with heirlooms getting most of the snooty vote .
But Garza is talking about both .
She and a growing number of tomato aficionados are challenging tomato lovers to sample certain hybrids that burst with flavor and thumb their noses at diseases .
" There are a few carefully selected hybrids that are just as good as heirlooms , " she says .
" I taste everything I sell .
Tomato love is something we do not take lightly . "
The tomato is by far America 's most popular home garden crop .
The obsessed will tell you that the quality of fruit picked in the garden when fully ripe far surpasses anything available on the market , even in season .

Heirloom die -hards may disagree , but Garza argues that some hybrids have earned the right to share the tomato tiara with heirlooms .
These are not your daddy 's hybrids .
They 're a big improvement over those produced in the early 1900s , designed to give tomatoes a longer shelf life , better disease resistance and productivity .
To produce hybrids , scientists cross - breed several plants , giving the hybrid offspring the best qualities of both parents .
Heirlooms , on the other hand , have been passed down from generation to generation .
They are prized for their diversity of color , but they can be hard hit by diseases and have smaller and later yields .
Which hybrids are getting good reviews ?
In a taste test reported in the March issue of Martha Stewart Living , the little hybrid Sapho is savored among several dozen others .
George Ball , chairman of W. Atlee Burpee & Co. , says his Brandy Boy won a blindfold taste test over Brandywine , considered a champion heirloom .
Park Seed sold out its
Glory seeds this season .
One of Garza 's favorites , Sun Gold , is also a staff favorite at White Flower Farm in Connecticut and Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture in New York 's Hudson River Valley .
Jack Algiere , the manager at Stone Barns , grows heirlooms and hybrids .
Last summer , when late blight hit , he had to tear out many plants , but not Sun Gold or Mountain Magic , the only tomato known to be resistant to late blight .
The disease hit a wide geographic area last summer from South Carolina to Maine and west to Ohio .
Tomato growers were as distraught as the Whos in Whoville after the Grinch struck .
What 's the difference ?
But Mountain Magic was steadfast .
Chef Dan Barber says the hybrid " tastes every bit as good " as an heirloom .
His Blue Hill restaurants at Stone Barns and in Manhattan serve organic produce from Algiere 's fields .
The chef used Mountain Magic as one of his premiere tomatoes .
" In August , we use tomatoes in every course , " he says .
" It 's the time of year when tomatoes are the most important part of the menu . "
Mountain Magic is the magic of plant breeder Randy Gardner , who developed it when he worked at North Carolina State University .
He is retired from the university but still works with several other plant breeders , including Martha Mutschler at Cornell .
That 's how Mountain Magic came to Algiere and Barber — Mutschler does tomato testing at Stone Barns .
" I think they taste just as good or better than heirlooms , " Mutschler says .
Gardner acknowledges that " some of the people who grow heirlooms wo n't admit the hybrids are good . "
And so the arguments will continue between the heirloom lovers and the hybrid fans .
The line is drawn in the garden dirt .
Gardner calls for a truce .
" There does n't need to be a war , " he says .
Tomato varieties number in the thousands , have many wonderful and different flavors , and more are on the way .
There are so many subtle differences it's as much fun as wine and olive oil tasting , Garza says .
So what 's to fight about ?
" People need to give hybrids a chance , " she says , laughing .
" If they do n't , it 's because they 're snobs and do n't know any better . "

Here 's one tangible upside to society 's dysfunctional love affair with Facebook :
The social network has so much information on people 's moods and activities that it can now predict how you 'll feel after you do something .
Facebook data science manager —yes , that job exists — Cameron Marlow tells the San Francisco Chronicle that female Facebook users generally become less happy after they become engaged , but cheer up to new levels of happiness after marriage — when the men promptly become more negative .
Says the MIT doctorate holder , " These fit the gender stereotypes so perfectly that it 's almost uncanny . "
Further confirmation of conventional wisdom :
Though women fare better , open relationships suck for pretty much everyone , reducing positive feelings 15 percent compared with being single .
Facebook also thinks it 's close to being able to predict whether you 'll like certain day to day activities .
Which sounds creepy , but not nearly as creepy as it is when you consider how sloppy Facebook is with your personal data and how reckless the company is about privacy controls .
On the other hand , if Facebook can prevent you from wasting irrecoverable hours of your life on terrible installments of Real Housewives of New Jersey or of the Iron Man movie franchise , maybe it 's all worth it .

Whatever Lifts Your Luggage , George
ROTFLMAO , as the kids say / said .
George Rekers explains what he was doing in Europe for ten days with a male escort he hired on Rentboy.com : he was attempting to cure him — the escort — of his homosexuality .
Like John the Baptist and Jesus , I have a loving Christian ministry to homosexuals and prostitutes in which I share the Good News of Jesus Christ with them ( see I Corinthians 6:8 - 11 ) .
Contrary to false gossip , innuendo , and slander about me , I do not in any way “ hate ” homosexuals , but I seek to lovingly share two types of messages to them , as I did with the young man called “ Lucien ” in the news story .
Joe has the whole thing — go read it , go read it this instant .
And you know ...
I 'm sure anti-gay preachers and groups that want to " cure " gays would get a lot more takers if more gay people knew that the " cure " involved all - expense - paid trips to Europe and large fees for our time .
Hell , my boyfriend and I volunteer to accompany George Rekers on this next trip to Europe ( provided there 's no sex , just easily - tuned - out bible verses ) .
Getting back to George : Pam at the Blend thinks this may be the best excuse ever ...
If you talk with my travel assistant that the story called " Lucien , " you will find I spent a great deal of time sharing scientific information on the desirability of abandoning homosexual intercourse , and I shared the Gospel of Jesus Christ with him in great detail .
" Sharing scientific information on the desirability of abandoning homosexual intercourse " is n't all that catchy — so let 's just stick to " lifting your luggage , " okay ?
UPDATE : I propose that " whatever floats your boat " be immediately retired in favor of " whatever lifts your luggage . "
And , once again , the Miami New Times broke this story .
Read Penn Bullock and Brandon K. Thorp 's hilarious takedown of George Rekers here .

There are some days that I look around and wonder how my life got so complicated .
It ’s common to want to step back , take a deep breath , and live more simply .
Many of us look at our hectic lives and wonder how we can back to a time when things were simpler — and maybe a little better .
Simpler living has been connected to reduced stress , and increased feelings of well - being .
Lower stress not only helps you feel better , but being able to relax is healthier for you as well .
If you are looking for ways to de-stress , you can start by encouraging a simpler lifestyle .
Chances are that you will feel better and be healthier , too .
Here are 6 ways that you can simplify your life :
1. De-Clutter Your Home
One thing you can do to help simplify your life is to get rid of the clutter in your home .
A living space full of items that you do n’t need , and may not even want anymore , really does affect how you feel .
Plus , having all that stuff can weigh down on you , even if you are n’t planning on moving it anywhere .
I ’m always amazed at what a difference it makes when my home feels more open and clean .
You can go slowly , or tackle all the clutter at once , but get rid of those things you do n’t use or want anymore .
You can sell it , donate it or give it to loved ones who need it .
2. Limit Your Family ’s Activities
Extracurricular activities can be fun .
It may be important to you to volunteer .
But if everyone in your family has three different places to be , it starts to get ridiculous .
Many of us are over - scheduled , and it becomes stressful — not to mention expensive .
Evaluate where you are in life , and what activities is makes sense to do .
Choose one or two things that you enjoy for now , and cut back on the rest .
Limit your children to one or two extracurricular activities each term .
It may force your family members to choose what the really want to focus on , but it will significantly reduce the scheduling stress in your life .
And you ’ll have more quality time to spend as a family .
3. Stop Buying
Things
This is n’t a blanket ban on buying things .
But it is a call to carefully consider your purchases .
Make conscious spending decisions .
Think about whether you really need ( or want ) the item in question .
Give yourself a week to think about it .
I ’ve bought many things that I thought were just great — until I realized half the stuff was ignored after a couple of weeks .
Even if it looks like a really good deal , stop and think .
You ’ll have more money in the bank , and less clutter in your home , if you reduce the amount of stuff that you buy .
4. Distance Yourself from Negative People
Life becomes complicated when you have negative people in your life .
While you might not be able to cut some people out altogether , there are some “ emotional leeches ” that you can slowly distance yourself from .
Look for supportive people , and strive to be a supportive person yourself .
You will feel more uplifted , and you will feel less of a drain from toxic relationships .
5. Plan Your Meals
It ’s amazing how much simpler your life seems when you take time to plan meals .
Plan ahead , and make a shopping list .
You can plan meals that are simple and fast to make .
Consider crock pot meals that require little energy .
Slow down and share a meal with your family .
Getting back to the simplicity of the kitchen reminds you to relax and enjoy the company of your loved ones .
Plus , you ’ll spend less money on takeout .
6. Get Automated
When possible , consider automating what you can .
Running programs on your heating / cooling system , setting timers on your sprinklers , and setting up automatic bill pay ( to go with automatic deposit ) are just a few ways that you can reduce stress and simplify your life , since you wo n’t have to actively do all of these items .
Technology has provided us with options to streamline our lives , and in many cases a small amount of set - up work can greatly simplify your life down the road .
Of course , any changes you make will need to stick and that can only come with letting go of some of the habits and thoughts you may have developed over time and making core changes in your lifestyle .
But as you do this , you will find that the benefits are well worth it .
Now your turn .
Do you struggle to get on top of your life ?
What have you tried that works and what does not ?

Everybody knows robots can't love .
It is their greatest failing as human analogues , their most profound tragedy as thinking entities and possibly their ultimate undoing ( depending on whether or not they 're facing the Care Bears that day ) .
But science does n't like to be told what they can , ca n't or just plain should n't do , so they 're giving it a shot anyway :
Here are five robots intended to either feel human emotions , inspire human emotions , or through their actions otherwise care for us in our hours of need .
Notice I say that 's what they 're âintended for.â 
All they actually do is murder the part of your mind responsible for registering danger , so that you will never feel safe again .
5 Robots That Teach Us How to Love

People in Japan do n't like to have sex .
That might come as a surprise to you if you live basically anywhere else in the world as , from an outsider 's perspective , it seems like everything they export is actively trying to rape everything else they export .
But it 's true :
They just do n't .
They have one of the lower birth rates in the world , and it 's estimated that only 34 percent of Japanese couples have sex on a weekly basis whichâ¦ actually explains everything about Japan perfectly , come to think of it .
So what are they doing to fight it ?
Manufacturing new and presumably jellyfish flavored aphrodisiacs ?
Offering classes in the art of love - making ?
Perhaps just focusing more on the effectiveness of fertility drugs , so that what twisted , crying , tentacle - based biannual sex does occur will result in more babies ?
Nope , none of the above !
The answer is somehow robots .
This is Yotaro , and aside from drifting through the vast emptiness of space , devouring the life - force of all planets he stumbles across , he 's also meant to help combat the low birth rate problem in Japan .
Butâ¦ how ?
Anybody with a strong opinion and a girlfriend can tell you that make - up sex happens , but is fearsex a thing ?
Are the inventors hoping to terrify young males so much that the blood will flee from their heads , occupy their boners , and try to hide inside the nearest vagina ?
According to Hiroki Kunimura , the inventor of Yotaro , that hideous monstrosity up there is meant to âtrigger human emotions , so humans want to have their own baby .â 
Listen , man :
That logic only works if you subscribe to the belief that the only thing that can kill a baby is another baby , and you 're hoping the citizens of Japan will start procreating solely to build a wave of toddlers that will swarm over and destroy Yotaro by sheer numbers alone .
My vegan friends depend upon farmers markets and CSAs for most of their food supply .
When you ’re trying to make ethical food choices , it makes sense to get your produce directly from local farmers .
But recently I ’ve noticed that many small , organic farms use fertilizers based on animal products .
Fish emulsion and fish meal from the commercial fishing industry , as well as manure , blood , bone , and feathers from factory - farmed animals are often used in lieu of chemicals .
Although vegan , plant - based fertilizers do exist and a few farms specialize in vegan growing practices , it ’s not the norm .
If you ’re vegan ( or simply concerned with animal treatment ) , what do make of this moral quandary ?
Do you seek out growers that use only vegan fertilizers ?
Or perhaps you accept that you ca n’t control every facet of your diet ?
Are you surprised that organic farms use by - products of the meat industry to avoid chemical inputs ?
Post your thoughts as a comment !

If you were going to pick an adjective to describe the Central Intelligence Agency , “ open ” would n’t immediately spring to mind .
But according to Carmen Medina , who recently retired from the CIA and will speak at Gov 2.0 Expo , openness is just what the agency needs .
Medina ’s Role at the CIA :
Carmen Medina : I just retired after 32 years at the CIA .
I spent 25 years as a manager of analysts .
In the mid part of this decade , I was sort of the number two in charge of analysis and also ended in charge of the Center for the Study of Intelligence , which is kind of like the Agency ’s think tank and lessons - learned center .
During my career , I was a bit of a heretic in the organization , though a successful one I guess , in that I always questioned how things were done .
From the beginning , I was really interested in how information technology and the Internet had the potential to change the way we did our business .
So back in the late ’90s , I was pushing hard to get all of our work online , even though a lot of people in the agency were skeptical about it .
Social media and extreme views :
CM : What the Internet allows , if you ’re an individual that has an extreme view , is the ability to broadcast that view in the privacy of your den .
You can get information to support your view without having to go to any unusual places that would attract suspicion .
You can find other people who hold the same views that you do .
You ’re able to hide in plain sight , basically , while you ’re doing that .
While I ’m a strong believer in the Internet and social networking , like everything else that ’s happened in human history , it also offers a lot of potential for people who are not well - intentioned .
How our ideas about privacy have to change :
CM :
It struck me two or three years ago that our historical concepts of privacy were dependent upon what the technologies were at the time .
So in my view , privacy is going to have to adjust to what is now possible .
While some of the things that are now possible are scary to people , many add to the public good .
I ’ll say it in a more generic way :
If you ’re using the power of social networking or monitoring to prevent activities that the community has decided are illegal , because there is law , then I do n’t think you have the privacy to do illegal things .
Some concepts of privacy , that we thought were rights , are going to have to give way as we find out that social networks are just a lot more efficient , and monitoring and digital ubiquity are all more efficient ways to enforce laws , for example .
That ’s a big thing in Britain .
I mean God only knows how many cameras they have on their streets .
And they ’re using it in ways to fight crime that , frankly , I do n’t think is yet possible in the U.S. because of our privacy concerns .
It ’s going to be very tricky .
A not - well - intentioned government , or a government with authoritarian tendencies , is going to use these technologies in ways that the citizenry would n’t approve of .
But that government is not going to give them a chance to approve it .
But let me also give you the other side of it .
Government is viewed as inefficient and wasteful by American citizens .
I would argue that one of the reasons why that view has grown is that they ’re comparing the inefficiency of government to how they relate to their bank or to their airline .
Interestingly enough , for private industry to provide that level of service , there are a lot of legacy privacy barriers that are being broken .
Private industry is doing all sorts of analysis of you as a consumer to provide you better service and to let them make more profit .
But the same consumer that ’s okay with private industry doing that is not okay , in a knee - jerk reaction , with government doing that .
And yet , if government , because of this dynamic , continues not to be able to adopt modern transactional practices , then it ’s going to fall further behind the satisfaction curve .
We have to rethink government along these lines .
And it ’s interesting to me that at least in the British election , it ’s out there as an issue in an explicit way that it has yet to be in the U.S .
How failure to share information leads to more failure :
CM : One of the objections to social networking and transparent collaboration that you get at an agency like the CIA , is that when you are really doing something where you cannot have failure , the work has to be tightly controlled .
It has to be much more point - to - point and hierarchical .
I thought that was a stupid argument that needed to be taken apart .
The first two - thirds of my Expo talk will use the chronology of the 2003 blackout as an example .
One of the main utilities had made a decision to buy a different process software , and so they were no longer paying for the upgrades to the old software .
Some of those bugs , that would ’ve otherwise been fixed , brought the system down .
I ’m going to talk about why high - reliability , high - risk organizations should be adopting the principles of transparent and collaborative work first , because when these kinds of organizations have catastrophic failure , it ’s usually because of stovepipes and lack of systemic awareness .
Since I come at this like a manager , I ’m going to also talk about what it means for managers when you adapt transparent , collaborative , networked work .
Most of what old - style managers are accustomed to doing is based on the industrial way of working .
But if you create a transparent collaborative network , the manager becomes a monitor of the network ’s health and the network ’s talents .
They make sure the mission is done , rather than acting as a quality control officer over every step of the process .
Why previous attempts to share intelligence have failed :
CM :
In every instance that I can think of , people get sucked in by the technology solution without looking at the culture and the way people are doing the work .
And when you overlay this new shiny toy on old processes , you actually make everything worse .
People decide they have to create a big program and ask for a new budget line , and it has to be rolled out with bells and whistles .
Then the contractors come along and see real opportunities for billable hours .
So instead of getting modest iterative development , you get this massive program that takes 10 years to roll out .
And you ’re still working on implementing a technology that ’s now three generations old .
I ’ve seen that happen .
But I still think it can be done .
Most of what we would want to achieve we can achieve with existing technologies .
You ’ve got to start with the process .
You have to change the objectives of the intelligence business to a certain degree .
Make it less hierarchical and less about the “ definitive answer . ”
Once you agree that things could work differently , then different technological solutions will become apparent .
The way government adopts technology is broken :
CM : There ’s a tradition of huge IT programs and huge IT departments .
And part of that is because that ’s how you play the budget game with Congress .
But now we ’re moving into a world of apps .
People are rolling out for pennies on the dollar little apps that can do essentially what a huge big government program is supposed to do .
Five years from now , it ’s going to be unsustainable for government to still be saying it needs five years and $ 2 billion to create a new information - sharing system .
It ’s nuts .
Can we crowdsource intelligence gathering ?
CM :
The intelligence community is betting that a closed network of limited people can actually be smarter about the world than the open network out in the world .
And as a citizen , I do n’t think that ’s a good bet .
In fact , people have been saying that for a while .
There ’s a move toward greater openness called “ outreach . ”
But outreach is a very old - style static process : an event here , an event there .
You ’re always going to lag , and you ’re always going to have less information about the world around you because you ’re within a closed network .
I strongly believe that .
I ’ll probably get in trouble for saying it , but that ’s my view .
There are ways to create trusted networks , and it would be fascinating to do some prototypes on that .
Look at what happened when Steve Fossett got lost .
Satellite images were farmed out to people to see if they could find anything .
Another example is Mechanical Turk .
I ’ve joined Mechanical Turk .
I ’ve done little tasks on it .
If you can itemize a job into small , discreet discrete tasks , then you can farm it out to large networks of people .
You could create trusted networks like Proctor & Gamble and some of these other companies do .
There ’s just huge potential there .
This administration and these policymakers need to ask for this kind of stuff .
It ’s like if you ’re raising money .
You ’ve got to make the ask .
If you do n’t , you do n’t get it .
With something as important as the intelligence community , something that ’s also difficult to change , you ’ve got to make the ask .

In what N. Irish Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness described as a “ raid , ” the Israeli Navy again commandeered an unarmed , peaceful ship in international waters , the Rachel Corrie , in a bid to prevent wheel chairs from reaching the blockaded people of Gaza , an Occupied Territory of which Israel controls the borders , air and sea .
The Irish government ( the ship took off from Ireland ) is furious .
And for once it is agreed with by Northern Ireland in the UK , with the deputy first minister condemning the raid as a “ completely unacceptable and unjustified use of force ” .
McGuinness insisted , “ The Rachel Corrie should have been allowed to proceed to Gaza without Israeli aggression , ” adding , “ This is an attack on an Irish flagged vessel and it demands a strong response by the Irish government . ”
Note : an earlier version of this posting omitted the “ Northern ” in Northern Ireland .
Regrets for the confusion .
Though the case is being treated as an anomaly that breached accepted procedures , a senior agency official acknowledged that there were no written guidelines on the handling of such letters , and that there was no way to know whether similar correspondence had prompted arrests and deportations .
If the investigation bears out what officials have learned so far , “ it also flies in the face of our stated priorities to target criminal fugitives , ” said the official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the agency had not authorized further discussion of the case .
So far , it appears that Ms. Jamieson ’s Jan. 10 letter to the president reached the executive secretariat of the immigration enforcement agency on March 8 .
The secretariat , which handles all official correspondence , sent it to the New York field office the next day , asking for help in drafting a response .
The letter explained that Ms. Jamieson , 42 , had filed a petition seeking a green card for her husband on the basis of their 2005 marriage .
But before they met , Mr. Takoulo , who first arrived in the country on a temporary business visa , had applied for political asylum and had been denied it by an immigration judge in Baltimore , who ordered him deported .
Only if the agency ’s chief counsel in Baltimore agreed to reopen the case , the letter said , could that order be suspended long enough for the couple to safely go to federal immigration headquarters in Manhattan for an interview to prove that their marriage was not a sham .
Mr. Takoulo , who had helped write the letter , recalled how he had imagined the president would react .
“ My hope was that he would call the chief counsel and say , ‘ This is ridiculous  just open this case , ’ ” Mr. Takoulo said , adding : “ He ’s even said on TV that he needs engineers . ”
Inside the National Weather Service office in Slidell , Louisiana ( map ) , data screens are showing clear skies over the Gulf of Mexico .
But lead forecaster Robert Ricks , who 's coordinating 12 - hour emergency shifts to provide information to people combating the Gulf oil spill , knows not to drop his guard .
" Just when you think everything 's fine — that 's when it can go wrong , " said Ricks , who was also on duty in 2005 as Hurricane Katrina pummeled Slidell .
Ricks and fellow Gulf forecasters could soon be back in the hot seat :
The 2010 Atlantic hurricane season starts June 1 , and the latest predictions say the season will be much feistier than 2009's .
Hurricane forecasters at Colorado State University predicted in early April that the season will see 15 named storms that will spawn 8 hurricanes , half of which will be major storms , with winds exceeding 110 miles ( 177 kilometers ) an hour .
With oil still flowing from the site of the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico — and no end in sight — it 's possible that a hurricane could send lingering oil surging toward Gulf shores , experts say .
( See pictures of giant " domes " being built to help contain the leaking oil . )
" Say the oil spill remained and [ another ] Katrina hit , " said Nan Walker , a physical oceanographer at Louisiana State University ( LSU ) in Baton Rouge .
" The oil could be propelled onto land by the storm surge and monster waves . "
Ron Kendall , chair of the Department of Environmental Toxicology at Texas Tech University in Lubbock , made a more dire prediction : " You put a major hurricane in there , you ’re liable to have oil in downtown New Orleans . "
Gulf Due for a Busy Hurricane Season
The National Hurricane Center released its official 2010 predictions May 20 , and early " signs are suggesting it will be busy , " according to James Franklin , branch chief of the center 's Hurricane Specialist Unit in Miami .
Warm water is a key hurricane ingredient , and the waters in the tropical and eastern Atlantic are warmer now than they 've ever been in recorded history , Franklin said .
Plus , the ongoing El Niño event , which tempered hurricane activity in 2009 , is expected to dissipate this year .
( See " 2009 Hurricane Season Quietest in Decades . " )
Hurricane winds move counterclockwise , so a storm passing southeast of the spill could push oil away from the Gulf shore , into open waters .
However , if a storm moved west of the slick — along the same track as Katrina — it could squeeze oil toward the northern Gulf Coast , and " that scenario looks pretty grim , " according to LSU 's Walker .
But since there 's no precedent — no one knows of a previous hurricane hitting oil - covered waters — it 's impossible to predict what could happen , experts warn .
Oil Spill Gone Before Big Storms Arrive ?
A hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico would also impact oil - spill recovery teams , according to Doug Helton , incident operations coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
Boats , planes , and remotely - operated vehicles would have to be brought in if a storm was bearing down , he said .
Likewise , booms — buoyant tubes that encircle sensitive areas to keep oil at bay — could be displaced or even shredded by the giant waves .
Still , such speculation might be moot , noted Gregory Stone , director of LSU 's Coastal Studies Unit .
June hurricanes are usually weak , and by the time the heavy hitters arrive in August , the oil may be mostly cleaned up .
Hurricane winds and waves could actually help the oil - soaked Gulf by further diluting what 's left of the oil , allowing the environment to break some of it down , Stone added .
However , diluted oil means smaller particles , which could more easily infiltrate wildlife - rich marshes .

Gulf Oil Spill Has Residents " Scared to Death "
Sitting on his moored boat in St. Bernard Parish , third - generation shrimper George Barisich said that waiting for the oil spill feels like anticipating the approach of a hurricane .
" It ’s looming out there , and we do n’t know exactly where it ’s going to go , " said Barisich , who , unable to shrimp in the oil - soaked Gulf , has been spending his time tidying up his freshly painted trawler .
" I 'm scared to death . "
Barisich has been here before :
His boat and house were mostly destroyed by Hurricane Katrina , which walloped this low - lying parish southeast of New Orleans .

A $ 75 million movie from MGM about a Chinese communist invasion of the United States .
A brazenly patriotic smack - down of Obama - era socialism .
Centering around an Afghanistan war vet .
Starring Tom Cruise ’s son .
Featuring music by Toby Keith .
With a plot devised with help from the RAND Corporation .
A hard - core remake of Red Dawn .
I know what you ’re thinking – because it ’s what I ’ve been thinking since I first heard details about all this several days ago .
This is all some sort of gag , right ?
Hollywood does n’t do this sort of thing .
This is n’t the 1980 ’s anymore .
Wake up !
This is the era of Avatar , of Fahrenheit 9/11 , of Sean Penn hanging with the mullahs in Iran .
The communist Chinese are n’t our enemy – they ’re our friends !
They make our TVs and T - shirts and disposable ink cartridges .
Our real enemies are American corporations , environmental polluters , and all those blonde chicks on Fox News .
Get your head in the game , Apuzzo .
You ’re daydreaming again !
Apparently not .
Difficult as this is to believe , MGM is indeed now in post - production on what appears to be an extravagantly hardcore remake of John Milius ’ 1984 film , Red Dawn .
Details of the project are starting to emerge from people who ’ve read the script ( see Latino Review ’s synopsis of the plot here , or The Awl ’s account here ) , and to say that the new film ’s creators are ‘ pulling no punches ’ would be an understatement .
The new Red Dawn looks to be one of the most intensely anti-communist films since My Son John from 1952 .
Yet it ’s set in the world of today .
First , let ’s back up a bit .
If you ’re not familiar with the original Red Dawn – a minor film in its day that ’s become something of a cult classic – the film depicted an all - out invasion of the United States at the height of the Cold War by the combined forces of the Soviet Union and communist Cuba .
We never really see much of the invasion , however , or learn a great deal about its immediate provocation .
Almost the entirety of the film is spent following a spirited resistance group made up of high school kids played by then up - and - coming stars Patrick Swayze , Charlie Sheen , C. Thomas Howell , Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey .
Basically , the kids get hold of some weapons , fight the Russkies in the Colorado hills , kick a lot of commie - Spetsnaz ass , and otherwise shout “ Wolverines ! ” ( their high school mascot ) about every 5 minutes when they are n’t speeding away in a pickup truck .
The film came out while I was in high school , and I thought it was a hoot – although one sensed at the time that the filmmakers were struggling somewhat against their modest budget .
Like a lot of high school guys at the time , I had the hots for Lea Thompson – I was a lot more interested in her than in the AK - 47s and RPGs , frankly – but still I liked the concept of fighting commies on American soil , and Red Dawn delivered on that score like few films I ’d ever seen .
[ Chuck Norris ’ Invasion U.S.A. raised the ante on that scenario the following year – the 80’s were really something . ]
In the new Red Dawn , the invading Chinese army apparently uses the pretext of America ’s current economic decline to invade .
Here ’s how AOL ’s Daily Finance site summarizes the plot :
Set against the backdrop of contemporary politics , the film begins with an American withdrawal from Iraq .
The President decides to redeploy troops to Taiwan , where escalating Chinese militarism is threatening America ’s ally .
At the same time , he also welcomes the former Soviet republic of Georgia into NATO , unleashing Russian worries that America is spreading its sphere of influence deep into Eastern Europe .
Having destabilized relations with two of the world ’s largest powers , the President then claims that the U.S. is only partly to blame for a global economic meltdown , further escalating tensions with China and ultimately leading to the invasion of the Pacific Northwest .
The RAND Corporation apparently had some input on this scenario .
And as invasion scenarios go , this is a reasonably plausible one – for a Hollywood thriller , at least .
What ’s more interesting to me are the actual details of the Chinese - communist occupation .
While details are still a bit sketchy , a lot is given away from behind - the - scenes photographs from the set .
I ’ve put together a little collage below of what are apparently propaganda posters spread by the film ’s Chinese invaders :
Are we getting the picture here ?
Is it just me , or is there something distinctly Obama - esque about these posters ?
What these posters reveal is that the Red Dawn remake may actually go where the original film did not go ( largely due to the fact that the original was made during the Reagan Administration ) , which is in equating certain tendencies in contemporary American liberalism with Chinese - style communism (! ) .
That would be an extraordinary thing for a Hollywood studio to do nowadays .
The UK ’s Guardian reports , for example , that the Chinese have American ‘ collaborators ’ who help them in their occupation .
[ Shades of V here . ]
I wonder who those ‘ collaborators ’ would be ?
To reiterate , I ’m still stunned by all this .
I ’m expecting to wake up and find it ’s all a dream – that I ’ve been floating in one of those alternate - reality tanks from Avatar , believing that I ’m still living in 1985 and reading a Tom Clancy novel after football practice .
I have a million questions , all of which boil down to : how did this movie get greenlit ?
How did this one slip by ?
All the right people are getting angry about this film : specifically , the state - controlled Chinese press , and The New Yorker .
The Awl is absolutely furious over the film , and you can sense the familiar rhetorical patterns forming : that the film is ‘ racist , ’ ‘ paranoid , ’ ‘ Sinophobic , ’ ‘ provocative , ’ etc .
Of course , it might be interesting for someone to ask the Tibetans or the Taiwanese what they think of all this .
For more details about this film , visit the MGM website or this Red Dawn fansite , and we ’ll otherwise keep you updated on all this as more information becomes available .
Here is some behind - the - scenes footage of the film ’s shoot in Michigan .
The film will be released November 24th , 2010 .
It ’s being directed by Dan Bradley , a stunt coordinator and second unit director who ’s worked on some of Hollywood ’s biggest productions ( Independence Day , the Bourne films , the Bond films , the Spider - Man films , Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull , etc . )
The film will star Connor Cruise ( son of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman ) ; Chris Hemsworth of Star Trek , and Isabel Lucas of Transformers .
Final footnote : the one time I met John Milius a few years back , we spent about three hours talking about the White Rajah of Sarawak … and about Mao. Although John was n’t involved in writing this new film , I ’m wondering what he thinks of all this .

[ UPDATE # 2 : I just spoke to an executive at MGM , and he provided us with some exciting details about the film .
Additionally , he confirmed a few basic points about the film : 1 ) the negative cost for the film is actually around $ 42 million ; 2 ) Red Dawn as yet has no release date due to the complex situation at MGM ; 3 ) Connor Cruise appears in the film , but is not actually the film ’s main star .
We ’ll have a lot more to report about Red Dawn down the line . ]

My grade - school education in mathematics included a strict prohibition against mixing apples and oranges .
As an adult buying fruit , I often find it convenient to mix the two .
If the price of each is the same , the arithmetic works out well .
The added thrill of doing something forbidden , like eating dessert first , comes free .
In any case , the prohibition against combining apples and oranges falls away as soon as we care about what two subjects , different in some respects , have in common .
I want to mix apples and oranges by insisting on the important features shared by poetry and applied mathematics .
Poetry and applied mathematics both mix apples and oranges by aspiring to combine multiple meanings and beauty using symbols .
These symbols point to things outside themselves , and create internal structures that aim for beauty .
In addition to meanings conveyed by patterned symbols , poetry and applied mathematics have in common both economy and mystery .
A few symbols convey a great deal .
The symbols ’ full meanings and their effectiveness in creating meanings and beauty remain inexhaustible .
Consider the following examples , which involve a beautiful poem of A. E. Housman ( 1859 –1936 ) and some applied mathematics from my own recent research .
In August 1893 , Housman wrote :
With rue my heart is laden
For golden friends I had ,
For many a rose - lipt maiden
And many a lightfoot lad .
By brooks too broad for leaping
The lightfoot boys are laid ;
The rose - lipt girls are sleeping
In fields where roses fade .
The surface meaning is simple : I regret that my friends , once young , have died .
At that level of sophistication , the surface meaning of The Odyssey is equally simple : Odysseus has trouble getting home .
Below the surface of Housman ’s poem , though , multiple meanings ( social , personal , and allusive ) interact .
The poem ’s social meanings arise from its time and place .
The 63 poems in the collection A Shropshire Lad ( of which this is number 54 ) describe the nostalgia of a country boy who moved to the big city .
The poems , published in 1896 , resonated widely in English society , where the population was rapidly urbanizing .
By 1900 , England would become the first country in the world to have most of its people living in cities .
The poem also had personal meanings for Housman .
The scholar Archie Burnett ’s 2003 essay “ Silence and Allusion in Housman ” showed that many of his poems were “ for Housman a means of finding a voice for the love that dare not speak its name , a way of breaking silence , a veil for disclosure , at once catering to reticence and facilitating expression . ”
In May 1895 , Oscar Wilde was sentenced for the crime of “ gross indecency ” ( homosexuality but not buggery ) to two years ’ imprisonment with hard labor .
Housman ’s Shropshire 54 seems benignly neutral about boys and girls , maidens and lads , and Housman went to great lengths from his youth onward to conceal his homosexuality .
But his passionate objection to society ’s treatment of homosexuals , including Wilde , is clear in several poems in A Shropshire Lad and in his later writings , as the critic and scholar Christopher Ricks demonstrated in his essay “ A. E. Housman and ‘ the colour of his hair ’ ” in 1997 .
Among the personal meanings of “ With rue my heart is laden ” is what Housman dared not say .
This poem also has allusive meanings for those who read it with the literary background that Housman brought to writing it .
In Cymbeline ( act 4 , scene 2 ) , Shakespeare wrote a beautiful song of mourning for a boy , Fidele , thought to have died ( but only drugged in a deep sleep ) :
Golden lads and girls all must ,
As chimney - sweepers , come to dust .
Here are Housman ’s “ golden ” “ lads ” and “ girls . ”
John Sparrow in 1934 noted echoes of Shakespeare ’s dirge in this and two other poems of Housman’s .
Beyond the specific words , Housman echoes Shakespeare ’s point that mortality masters all .
But there is more to this allusion , as the poet and critic Rosanna Warren has pointed out .
Fidele is in fact a young woman , Imogen , in boys ’ clothing .
In Shakespeare ’s time , the female role of Imogen would have been played by a boy or young man , giving the audience a male actor playing a female ( Imogen ) pretending to be a male ( Fidele ) .
Given what is now clear about Housman ’s sexual orientation , it seems plausible that Housman , consciously or not , identified with the doubly cross-dressing Imogen / Fidele , and nurtured a hope that his poems , if not he , would live .
The economy of the poem is evident in the many images compressed into eight lines and in the questions left unanswered .
As the poem opens , the narrator speaks of his rue- laden heart , raising the question :
Why is he sad ?
The second line explains why : his friends are gone .
Where have they gone ?
Wait till the second stanza .
Who were the rose - lipt maidens ( echo of Othello act 4 , scene 2 , as noted in Archie Burnett ’s 1997 edition of Housman ’s poems ) and lightfoot lads in lines 3 and 4 , and what were his relations with them ?
What happened in those friendships ?
The narrator never says .
Instead he speaks of brooks too broad for leaping , evoking not slender streams easily leaped but a broader , slower descent to the sea in the fullness of time .
Only in the last three lines , where the boys and girls are laid in death , in fields where roses fade , do we finally learn that his friends are gone not only as a result of migration ( possibly ) but also as a result of mortality .
Additional questions remain .
Why is the narrator ’s mourning plural and anonymous ?
( The Oxford English Dictionary does not support any sexual interpretation of “ laid ” at the end of line 6 , as the earliest sexual use of “ lay ” or “ laid ” dates from 1932 . )
Turning from meanings to patterns , we face another mystery .
How do the combined patterns of the symbols , on the page or spoken , evoke so much beauty ?
The patterns in these eight lines interweave meter , rhyme , ending accent , internal repetition , play on the letters r and l , alliteration , du - bi - du consonants , and two layers of chiasmus , within two symmetrical stanzas .
Each line is written in iambic trimeter , and each set of four lines constitutes a quatrain .
With rue | my heart | is laden
For gold | en friends | I had ,
For man | y a rose | - lipt maiden
And man | y a light | foot lad .
By brooks | too broad | for leaping
The light | foot boys | are laid ;
The rose | - lipt girls | are sleeping
In fields | where ros | es fade .
The irregularity of the anapests in lines 3 and 4 relieves the repetitious symmetry of the other lines .
The rhyme scheme is equally simple : abab .
The ending accent alternates feminine ( “ laden , ” “ leaping ” ) and masculine ( “ had , ” “ fade ” ) .
There is an extraordinary amount of internal repetition .
The first syllable of “ laden ” reappears in “ laid ” and , with a slight change in vowel , in “ lad . ”
The second syllable of “ laden ” reappears in “ golden ” and “ maiden . ”
Lines 3 and 4 repeat “ many a ” exactly .
The phoneme “ r?z ” in “ rose - lipt ” and “ roses ” appears in lines 3 , 7 , and 8 .
“ Lightfoot ” appears in lines 4 and 6 .
Every even - numbered line ends with “ d ” ( the initial consonant of “ death , ” a word that does not appear in the poem ) , preceded by one or another variant of the vowel - sounds that the letter “ a ” can exhibit .
The poem uses two liquid consonants : r 10 times and l 12 times .
Alliteration crosses lines : “ many , ” “ maiden , ” “ many ” ; “ lipt , ” “ lightfoot , ” “ lad , ” “ leaping , ” “ lightfoot , ” “ laid , ” “ lipt , ” “ ( s ) leeping ” ; “ friends , ” “ fields , ” “ fade ” ; “ brooks , ” “ broad , ” “ boys . ”
Another pattern , for which I do not know a technical name , I have called du - bi - du consonants .
It is the pattern illustrated by the consonants in its name , du - bi - du : “ lightfoot lad ” ( l–f–l ) , “ brooks too broad ” ( b–t–b ) , “ lightfoot boys are laid ” ( l–b–l ) , “ fields where roses fade ” ( f–r–f ) .
The pattern of chiasmus is central to this example of the connection I want to make between poetry and applied mathematics .
In poetry , chiasmus refers to the statement of two words or ideas and then their restatement in reverse order .
A subtle example of chiasmus is the appearance of maiden and lad ( female , male in elevated language ) in lines 3 and 4 followed by boys and girls ( male , female in demotic language ) in lines 6 and 7 .
The change in language from elevated to demotic suggests that even the highborn are brought to earth , and the reversal of order suggests that any precedence in life ( “ ladies first , ” maidens before lads ) may be undone in death .
The second stanza gives another example of chiasmus .
Line 5 tells where ( by brooks too broad for leaping ) , and line 6 tells who ( the lightfoot boys ) .
Line 7 tells who ( the rose - lipt girls ) followed by line 8 , which tells where ( in fields where roses fade ) .
Again the pattern conveys a meaning : the brooks on the fifth line and fields on the eighth enclose the boys and girls ( lines 6 and 7 ) as a coffin contains its cadaver .
The patterns of the symbols and the messages of the poem are inextricable .
In mathematics ( pure or applied ) , a strict definition would limit “ chiasmus ” to the exact repetition of two symbols in reverse order .
A more inclusive definition includes any repetition of a sequence of symbols in a permuted order .
Like poetry , applied mathematics combines multiple meanings , economy , pattern , and mystery .
In its scientific or practical applications , applied mathematics points to something external .
It also alludes to prior mathematics .
Its few symbols convey a lot .
Its use of symbols often involves internal repetition , symmetry , and chiasmus .
It is replete with unexpected truths , unexpected applications , and diverse proofs that illuminate different aspects of a single truth .
My example from applied mathematics comes from work I did with two outstanding colleagues , Johannes H. B. Kemperman , retired from Rutgers University , and Gheorghe Zbaganu , University of Bucharest .
In 2000 , Zbaganu published a fact new to mathematics :
If is a positive integer ( a counting number like 1 , 2 , 3 , … ) , and and are any nonnegative real numbers ( any fractional or whole number larger than or equal to zero , such as 17 or 0.333333 … or 3.14159 … ) , then
No understanding of the meanings of this beautiful formula is necessary to appreciate that it is an intricately patterned array of symbols .
Whatever it means , the formula has a left lobe and a right lobe mediated by .
The symbols in the left lobe are exactly the same as the symbols in the right lobe but the letters and appear in different order ; this is chiasmus in the broad sense .
In the right lobe , is an example of chiasmus in the strict sense as the sequence is repeated in reverse order .
That is about as far as one can go without having any idea of the meanings of the symbols .
Understanding the formula ’s meanings only enhances one ’s sense of its beauty , economy , and mystery .
The connective between the two lobes means that the quantity on the left is less than or equal to the quantity on the right .
The expression means sum ( add ) for all pairs , where and are positive whole numbers from 1 to .
Finally , means the minimum ( smaller ) of and , and similarly for .
The words “ If is a positive integer , and and are any nonnegative real numbers , then , ” which precede the formula , declare that the inequality holds for any such numbers .
Therein lies the immense and surprising power of Zbaganu ’s inequality .
A numerical example illustrates its economy of expression .
If and if , then the expression on the left side of the inequality equals , while the expression on the right side equals .
As the formula predicts , .
Zbaganu ’s inequality asserts that , no matter what natural number you may pick , and no matter what nonnegative real numbers and you may pick , the value of the left side will be less than or equal to the value of the right side .
Zbaganu ’s inequality has so­cial or referential meanings be­cause it answers a question Zbaganu was considering in the mathematical theory of information systems :
If one of two messages must be sent over a channel with only two input symbols , A and B , and with output symbols , , is the chance of error in transmission smaller if the first message is sent as AA and the second message as BB , or if the first message is sent as AB and the second message as BA ?
The left lobe of Zbaganu ’s inequality represents the probability of an error in transmission if the first message sent is AA and the second is BB , while the right lobe represents the probability of error in the alternative .
Hence the inequality says that coding the two messages by AA and BB gives a lower risk that the wrong message will be received than coding by AB and BA .
( The tongue in cheek message for teachers might be :
If you ’re trying to teach your students one of two messages , it ’s better to convey the message twice in the same way than to convey it once in each of two different ways .
But do n’t take this interpretation too seriously ; some students have memories , unlike the communication channels in this theory . )
Nothing prevents us from playing formally with Zbaganu ’s inequality as long as we remember that such formal play yields only questions , not answers .
For example , if we exchange multiplication and addition , we get another formula :
Is this formula always true if is a positive integer , and and are any nonnegative real numbers ?
Pushing the same idea further , we produced 64 possible generalizations of Zbaganu ’s inequality by replacing each occurrence of addition or summation , minimum , and multiplication by each of four operations : addition , multiplication , minimum , and maximum , then looking for a direction of the inequality or that would make the statement true whenever is a positive integer and and are any nonnegative real numbers .
Zbaganu ’s inequality is one of these 64 .
We produced another 32 formal generalizations of Zbaganu ’s inequality by swapping in other mathematical functions ( for cognoscenti , the spectral radius of a square nonnegative matrix , and quadratic forms ) .
The mathematical question for us became : are these other 95 inequalities besides Zbaganu ’s inequality always true or true under some interesting conditions ?
Here are a few examples of the resulting generalizations of Zbaganu ’s inequality , which we proved to be true under appropriate conditions :
,
,
,
,
You are supposed to be saying , or at least thinking , ooooooh , aaaaaaaaah , how beautiful these formulas are .
Every mathematician knows , and every student of elementary mathematics has to learn , that swapping the operations of addition , multiplication , minimum , and maximum does not generally produce true formulas .
But after a few years of hard , exciting work , Zbaganu , Kemperman , and I were astonished to find that when , all 96 formulas we had invented by purely formal manipulations are true .
When , 62 of our first 64 generalizations are true but two are false in general .
Some of the inequalities involving the spectral radius and quadratic forms are false in general , some are true .
We were able to distill several of our inequalities into a more abstract so - called matrix - norm inequality that is valid for any one of the four operations of addition , multiplication , maximum , and minimum — the kind of mathematical discovery that brings joy to the heart of applied mathematicians ( or at least to the hearts of the three of us ) .
Our inequalities have meanings both referential and allusive .
I described earlier Zbaganu ’s construction of his inequality in the context of information theory .
Among our other inequalities , several have interpretations in operations research with potential applications for scheduling transportation and manufacturing .
In addition , our inequalities allude by similarity of form to a beautiful inequality by Augustin Louis Cauchy ( 1789 –1857 ) :
If is a positive integer , and and are any nonnegative real numbers , then
Equality holds if and only if for some real constants and with we have for .
In 2004 the mathematician Michael Steele called Cauchy ’s inequality “ one of the most widely used and most important inequalities in all of mathematics . ”
The opening words and symbols are identical to those of Zbaganu ’s original inequality except that Zbaganu ’s restriction to nonnegative numbers is absent from Cauchy ’s inequality .
Here the letters and which appear in the left lobe in the order appear in the right lobe in the order , whereas in Zbaganu ’s inequality they appear in the right lobe in the order .
For readers with the requisite mathematical background , Zbaganu ’s inequality alludes to Cauchy ’s inequality no less clearly than Housman ’s verse alludes to Shakespeare’s .
A deeper and more substantial connection lies beneath the similarity in the pattern of the symbols .
After Zbaganu ’s inequality appeared in 2000 , Ravi Boppana of New York University proved it in a new way .
In 2006 , Titu Andreescu of the University of Texas at Dallas and Gabriel Dospinescu of Lycée Louis - le - Grand , in Paris , found new proofs that strengthen Boppana ’s intermediate result on the path to Zbaganu ’s inequality .
Some of these proofs depend on the Cauchy - Schwarz inequality , a generalization of Cauchy ’s inequality .
So among the lines of logical genealogy that lead to Zbaganu ’s inequality are lines that pass through Cauchy ’s inequality .
In applied mathematics , as in poetry , at the end of the analysis , things not yet understood remain .
Why are so many of our formulas true ?
They were generated by a formal process that any mathematician , pure or applied , regards with total disbelief .
In the first group of 64 putative inequalities , why are the two particular failed inequalities false when ?
Why are the proofs of the true inequalities so extraordinarily diverse ?
Why ca n’t we find a unifying approach that separates the sheep from the goats , the true from the false ?
Perhaps most mysteriously , why do several of our formulas have meanings for potential practical applications ?
The critic and scholar Helen Vendler has shown me a precedent for the mixing of poetry and applied mathematics in Seven Types of Ambiguity , written by William Empson ( 1906 –1984 ) at the age of 22 and published when he was 24 .
At Cambridge , Empson won firsts in mathematics and English .
His book repeatedly cites the commonalities of poetry and math .
For example , Empson quotes from George Herbert ’s book The Temple ( 1633 ) the eight - line poem “ Hope , ” which alternates lines of iambic pentameter and iambic trimeter .
Empson wrote :
As apples do differ from oranges , poetry does differ from applied mathematics , despite their commonalities .
For example , in poetry , but not mathematics , sound and “ mouthfeel ” ( Galway Kinnell ) matter .
In applied mathematics , unlike poetry , calculation and shared scientific concepts and data , rather than intimate experience , lend conviction .
Examples of differences could be multiplied .
They do not undermine the significance of the similarities .
Poetry and applied mathematics , with mysterious success , both use symbols for beautiful , economical pointing and patterning .
Pointing establishes a relation between symbols and a world beyond the domain of symbols .
Patterning establishes a relation between symbols and other symbols in the same domain .
Poetry and applied mathematics fall along a continuum between pointing and patterning .
The pointing of symbols to something else is most important .
Formal prose Numerical data collection
Poetry Engineering
Songs with words , program music Applied mathematics
Abstract music
Pure mathematics
The patterning of symbols themselves is most important .
The same continuum runs in the visual arts from journalistic photography at the extreme of pointing to purely abstract art at the extreme of patterning .
Between those extremes lies most of the world of art , mixing apples and oranges , mixing meanings and patterns , along with poetry and applied mathematics .
The differences between poetry and applied mathematics coexist with shared strategies for symbolizing experiences .
Understanding those commonalities makes poetry a point of entry into understanding the heart of applied mathematics , and makes applied mathematics a point of entry into understanding the heart of poetry .
With this understanding , both poetry and applied mathematics become points of entry into understanding others and ourselves as animals who make and use symbols .
Different kind of flotilla :
About 70 yachts from various countries arrived Friday at the southern Israeli town of Ashkelon as part of a peace sail organized by a Turkish national .
The 2010 Emir sail originated in Istanbul and passed through northern Cyprus , Syria , and Lebanon before heading to Israel .

The sail 's objective is to promote peace and regional cooperation in the field of maritime tourism .
Ashkelon Mayor Benny Vaaknin welcomed the flotilla and said it constituted a response to previous terror sails .
" We are happy to see dozens of yachts arriving from across the world , including from Turkey , " he said .
" The city of Ashkelon welcomes the sailors and hopes that the message of peace in the Middle East will come out of Ashkelon . "
The Emir sail has been held for the past 20 years and has made sure to make a stop in Israel even during sensitive periods .
In light of the recent global condemnation leveled last Israel , the notion of a peace flotilla took on special meaning for participants this year .
The initiative is headed by Hasan Kacmaz , a Turkish national who refers to Ashkelon as his " second home , " saying the city 's municipal leaders are his " best friends . "
Washington ( CNN ) -- Sens. John Kerry and Joe Lieberman announced Friday that they will unveil long - planned climate change legislation Wednesday , but they 'll move forward without support from a key Republican they 've worked with for months .
Sen . Lindsey Graham , R - South Carolina , indicated that he 's not on board with Kerry and Lieberman 's bill .
Graham said he believes that the legislation , which includes an expansion of offshore drilling , wo n't garner enough votes because of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
" When it comes to getting 60 votes for legislation that includes additional oil and gas drilling with revenue sharing , the climb has gotten steeper because of the oil spill , " the GOP senator said in a news release .
" I believe there could be more than 60 votes for this bipartisan concept in the future , " Graham added .
" But there are not nearly 60 votes today and I do not see them materializing until we deal with the uncertainty of the immigration debate and the consequences of the oil spill . "
Sources familiar with the senators ' plans say Kerry , D - Massachusetts , and Lieberman , I - Connecticut , intend to keep proposals to expand oil drilling , but they understand that safety regulations and standards will and should be scrutinized and added to their legislation in the wake of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill .
Kerry , Lieberman and Graham were set to announce what was to be a bipartisan bill April 26 but abruptly canceled their news conference after Graham angrily withdrew because of a dispute with Democratic leaders over immigration reform .
Graham said he was furious that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , had signaled that he wanted to try to take up another controversial and divisive issue -- immigration reform -- before climate change .
" Moving forward on immigration -- in this hurried , panicked manner -- is nothing more than a cynical political ploy , " Graham wrote in a sharply worded letter April 24 .
In a joint statement Friday , Kerry and Lieberman thanked the Republican for his contribution .
" Over the past several months we have worked with Senator Graham and he has made a significant contribution to construct balanced legislation that will make our country energy independent , create jobs and curb pollution , " the statement said .
But they also took a subtle swipe at Graham and his decision to stop work on climate change because of anger over immigration .
" Over the last three weeks , we all understand Lindsey has been busy with the immigration issue and we understand his feelings on that issue , but during this period we 've continued working , moving forward , and talking in great detail with our Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle , and with the environmental and business communities , " they said in their statement .
They also hit back at Graham 's assertion that the oil spill has made it impossible to find 60 votes to overcome a filibuster to pass the bill , which includes a call to expand oil drilling both on - and offshore .
" We 've continued to work with the Senate leadership and the White House , and we believe we 've made new progress on the path to 60 votes , " Kerry and Lieberman said in their statement .
Sen . Bill Nelson , D - Florida , has vowed to filibuster any legislation that includes an expansion of offshore drilling .
And several senior Democratic sources say they agree with Graham 's assessment of the fate of this legislation : that , despite the renewed push , it 's unlikely that climate change legislation will make it to the Senate floor this year .
The House passed its version of the climate change bill last year .

A crushing victory in a game that was extremely tight for the first half hour .
Portugal made four changes from the first game .
Hugo Almeida was in as the lone striker , Simao Sabrosa was on the right wing with Miguel behind him , and Tiago replaced Deco .
North Korea were unchanged from their 2 - 1 defeat to Brazil in the first game .
The most notable thing about the game was that North Korea pushed forward far more than in their first game .
The wing - backs were just that ( rather than full - backs in a five - man defence ) ; they got forward and formed triangles on the flanks with the outside central midfielders and one of the forwards , getting the ball into good positions in the final third .
They also went close with a couple of long - range shots .
A consequence of them playing more attacking as a whole was that their defensive line was much higher than against Brazil , where they denied Robinho and Luis Fabiano space in behind .
Here , they played 10 - 15 yards higher up the pitch , which Portugal initially failed to exploit , with the wet pitch making through balls in behind the defence very difficult .
Portugal also struggled to create goalscoring chances because Tiago and Meireles were playing quite reserved , disciplined roles in front of Pedro Mendes .
They were effectively leaving Portugal ’s three forwards against six defensive North Korean players , with the two Korean central midfielders tracking their opposite numbers .
Just like in the first game against the Ivory Coast , there were no driving runs from midfield , no - one looking to break forward and link up the the lone striker , who struggled to get into the game .
At first , Miguel and Fabio Coentrao were unable to move forward too much because they were concerned about the runs of the Korean strikers , who played closer together than in the first time and looked to move into wide areas when they did n’t have the ball .
When Portugal realised that they needed to show more attacking threat , Pedro Mendes moved into an even deeper position , almost as a centre - half – creating 3 v 2 at the back , and allowing the full - backs to push on forward .
Attacking full - backs and midfield runners
That was the first part of getting Portugal ahead in the game .
Just as Maicon held the key to unlocking the North Korean defence in the first game , ZM favourite Fabio Coentrao was the best player on the pitch , speeding up and down the left flank and drawing the defence out of position .
Miguel did the same on the right – and the presence of attacking full - backs is exactly why the 5 - 3 - 2 system often proves unsuccessful .
The second part of breaking the deadlock was those runs from midfield .
Meireles suddenly decided that he should be playing higher up the pitch , and on his first forward run , he met a superb through - ball from his midfield colleague Tiago and finished beautifully .
This site suggested before the tournament that Deco ’s time is up because he no longer plays between the lines or looks to move into the penalty area , and this game supports that thesis – Meireles was effectively moved forward into something more like the ‘ Deco role ’ – that is , the most attacking of the three midfielders , and whilst he is n’t as naturally talented as Deco , he was far more effective and provided more of a threat .
A run into the penalty area from Meireles also created Portugal ’s second goal – he knocked a simple pass out towards Simao , who nutmegged the goalkeeper to make it 2 - 0 .
Portugal narrow the wingers
Portugal changed their approach well to expose North Korea ’s weaknesses .
Usually , they play the ball to the wide players on the touchline and hope for an individual bit of brilliance , but this did n’t work because Korea were able to double up easily with a wing - back and a centre - back .
Instead , Ronaldo and Simao moved inside and played a more central role , which both drew the central defenders towards them , and narrowed the wing - backs – creating space for Portugal ’s full - backs .
Portugal ’s all - round game was far better than in their first game .
Ricardo Carvalho brought the ball out of defence with more purpose , whilst Almeida ’s movement upfront was better than Liedson ’s in the first game ( although , in fairness , he got more support than Liedson did ) .
Korea seemed demoralised , although they did attempt to get back in the game .
Sadly for them ( and for the tournament as a whole , if you ’re of the belief that teams are playing too defensively ) , the more they pushed forward , the more gaps they left at the back , and the more goals they conceded .
Almost every Portugal player aside from the centre - backs broke through the Korea defensive line at some point to meet a through - ball , and whilst 7 - 0 was harsh on Korea , it was a fairly accurate reflection of how easy it was for Portugal when Korea played a higher line .
In Korea ’s two games , they have shown both the merits of playing very defensively ( against Brazil in the first half ) and the danger of pushing up and leaving space in behind ( against Portugal in the second half ) .
Most worryingly , they were no more dangerous in attacking terms when they played a higher defensive line – perhaps because that also gives them less space to exploit .
Conclusion
Portugal were superb .
When they hit their stride , they play a tremendous brand of football – organised in defence , resourceful with the ball in midfield , and devastatingly effective upfront .
The lack of an out - and - out striker is , as always , a major problem – but if they can get goals from across the team , and especially from midfield runners , that wo n’t be a problem .
Having six players score in one game is absolutely perfect for Queiroz considering Portugal ’s problem with goalscoring , and on this form there is no reason why they ca n’t be a real force for the rest of the tournament .
Sadly , North Korea are already out of the competition .
They have brought an interesting , unusual style of football to the tournament , and have been fascinating from a tactical point of view .
Ultimately , their formation was always going to struggle with attacking full - backs , which is why successful teams playing three - man defences also seek to play three - man attacks as well – in order to pin back the full - backs .
Otherwise , they become exposed on the flanks .

The dogs were found in the back of Pc Johnson 's car A police dog handler whose two animals died from heatstroke in his car has been found guilty of animal cruelty .
Pc Mark Johnson , 39 , left the German Shepherds in temperatures of 29.3C ( 84.7 F ) in June last year when parked at Nottinghamshire Police headquarters .
He told Nottingham magistrates he had been suffering from depression and obsessive compulsive disorder when he forgot to check them for seven hours .
He was given a six - month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £ 2,500 .
After the case , Nottinghamshire Police said there would be internal disciplinary proceedings to consider his future .
District Judge Tim Devas described the incident as " a dreadful error of judgement " and said it had been brought about by an illness that should have been diagnosed and treated properly .
The dogs died in the car last June The RSPCA , which had prosecuted the case , welcomed the verdict and said that those responsible for animals must be held to account for their actions , no matter what their profession .
Simon Parker , from the RSPCA , said : " Two dogs died unnecessarily , a horrific death , and a conviction was wholeheartedly the right decision today , and I 'm thankful for the judge for that .
" Everyone needs to remember how hot cars can get during warm weather .
Cases like this - particularly when it's a professional person - should not happen . "
The organisation said it accepted that Johnson 's care of dogs had previously been exemplary and he had not acted callously .
Heatstroke
He was not banned from looking after animals in the future .
The court heard that dogs Jet , aged seven , and 18 - month - old Jay - Jay , died possibly within 20 minutes from heatstroke which would have brought about multiple organ failure .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Johnson , who has served with the force for nearly 18 years , told the court that his medical condition , along with the stresses of the job , had left him seriously ill .
The court was told on 30 June last year , Johnson drove his black Ford Mondeo estate to Nottinghamshire Police 's HQ in Arnold , just north of Nottingham .
He arrived just before 0700 BST and had planned to transfer the dogs to a police car but it was off the road as the air conditioning system was being fixed .
He found another car but there were no mats in the back and when he went to find some he became distracted by a police briefing .
Afterwards , he told his sergeant he wanted to discuss some medical issues with him later in the day but he needed time to do his paperwork .
At about 1030 BST he planned to let his dogs out of the car , give them water and allow them to stretch their legs .
But he became distracted again by a phone call about a missing person .
At noon , he had a meeting with his sergeant about his problems and it was not until nearly 1430 BST that he finally went to check on his dogs , seven hours later .

The announcement of William Shatner ’s new sitcom $ #*!
My Dad Says is only a day old , and already it is stirring up controversy .
CBS is touting the show as a " family comedy " and putting it on at 8:30 on Thursdays , but a parents group is denouncing CBS for its choice of title , and has announced a campaign to go after affiliates who air the show and advertisers who sponsor the show .
The $ #*! hits the fan
Ever since the it was announced that CBS was considering a sitcom inspired by the popular twitter account @shitmydad says , featuring the profane musings of a curmudgeonly father , there was a question as to what they would call the show .
" Shit " is one of words forbidden from broadcast television by the FCC .
At one point the show was being called " Bleep My Dad Says " , but yesterday CBS officially announced the title would be " $#*! My Dad Says " , with the " $ #*! " part bleeped out in any network promos .
You can see that in action with the behind the scenes preview released yesterday ( below ) .
Even though the word " shit " will never be heard , the Parents Television Council , a watchdog group which professes to be the " nation ’s most influential advocacy organization protecting children against sex , violence , and profanity on television " , issued a denouncement today against CBS stating :
CBS intentionally chose to insert an expletive into the actual name of a show , and , despite its claim that the word will be bleeped , it is just CBS ’ latest demonstration of its contempt for families and the public .
There are an infinite number of alternatives that CBS could have chosen but its desire to shock and offend is crystal clear in this decision
The PTC is also promising to take action if CBS does not change the name of the show , vowing an " unrelenting campaign " against the advertisers and any affiliates that air the show before 10 PM .
CBS contends that the show is suitable for family viewing and responded to PTC in a statement :
The program is inspired by the wildly popular Twitter phenomenon , which now has more than 1.5 million followers and also has spawned a best - selling book of the same name .
It will in no way be indecent and will adhere to all CBS standards .
Parents who choose to do so will find the show can easily be blocked using their V Chip .
It is hard to say at this point if the PTC campaign will have any affect .
Media expert Brad Agate tells THR " Certain marketers wo n’t have a problem with it and some may be a little bit skittish " .
In an interview with Zap2 It yesterday , Shatner discussed how you ca n’t say the real name of the show on TV “ only think it ” .
Watch that below
Star Trek and controversy
The Star Trek franchise is no stranger to controversy and dealing with groups concerned about how the various shows were undermining the morality of children and society .
Some episodes in particular garnered complaints or even some stations holding broadcasts or altering them to make them more acceptable .
Famous examples are the interracial kiss in TOS " Plato ’s Stepchildren " , the graphic violence in TNG ’s " Conspiracy " , the same sex kiss in DS9 ’s " Rejoined " and T’Pol ’s butt in ENT ’s " Harbinger " .
Star Trek has run into it ’s own controversies over the years
Gene Roddenberry often had to deal with issues of keeping his TV shows in line with FCC guidelines .
On a track from his album " Inside Star Trek " Roddenberry spoofs the what it was like dealing with network censors , listen to it below .
POLL : Give a $ #*! about Shat ’s show ?
So what say you ?
Will you be following Shatner to the sitcom frontier ?

Police have arrested more than 30 people in cities across northern Italy
Police in Italy say they have broken up a drug ring that used a convent outside Milan to smuggle cocaine .
They said the convent 's South American caretaker organised religious trips in which smugglers posing as pilgrims hid cocaine in their prayer books .
The nuns were " completely unaware " of what he was up to , police said .
They have arrested 33 suspects and seized 30kg ( 66lb ) of cocaine .
They say the mafia and Colombian cartels were allegedly behind the operation .
Police said the operation , in the northern city of Piacenza , had been three years in the making .
The drugs were taken from the convent to a house near Bergamo , where the cocaine was refined , cut and sent off to major cities for distribution , the police said .
Two suspected Milan - based drug - trafficking kingpins from the Calabrian ' Ndrangheta crime syndicate were among those detained , Italy 's Ansa news agency reported .
The delegates have all gone home to their respective countries , yet the madness in downtown Toronto continues as hundreds of protesters continue to be arrested in the detention center that has been set up for the summit .
After holding a number of protesters and innocent civilians in a human box protected by riot police for four hours , the police have taken a number of them to the detention center , and released the others to leave .
Many people including innocent photographers and members of the media were left stranded in the pouring rain with no food , water , bathrooms , or shelter for hours as they waited for instructions from police .
Many said that they would prefer to be arrested to get to some shelter , but unfortunately they had no choice .
With the events that took place on Saturday , many people felt that the police did not act strongly enough to control the violence .
This left them no option but to act with force on Sunday as the protests continued and people refused to cooperate with requests and demands from the police force .
There are mixed feelings on the actions of the Toronto Police , some say that they have acted too harshly , while others agree that there is no other way to control the violence .
One person tweeted that “ People are not being treated properly by police ” in which somebody else responded , “ These people should not have shattered our windows and violated our city ” .
The delegates have all gone home to their respective countries , yet the madness in downtown Toronto continues as hundreds of protesters continue to be arrested in the detention center that has been set up for the summit .

A further attempt at suppressing the Vitamin D levels of the UK population was recently instigated by one of the country 's largest cancer charities .
The results of a recent Cancer Research epidemiological study , which looked into the rate of specific skin cancer in men , were pounced upon by the organisation who made further blanket recommendations to avoid the sun , contrary to all independent evidence .
The study showed remarkable increases in the rate of malignant melanoma , the most dangerous form of skin cancer , among men .
In men over the age of 65 , the rate of death from this problem has risen in the last 30 years from 4.5 per 100,000 to 15.2 per 100,000 , more than a threefold increase .
This increase in cancer mirrors the increase in sunscreen use and avoiding sun exposure , both of which reduce the vitamin D3 levels in the body .
Vitamin D3 has been repeatedly shown to be a powerful inhibitor of cancerous development , capable of preventing 80 per cent of cancers .
Preventing cancer could prove very costly for some charities , who depend on a sympathetic public sentiment and a profitable cancer industry for survival .
Cancer Research , which achieved an income of 498 million pounds ( around $ 700 m ) last year and has been criticised for providing their executives with limousines , appeared keen to use the study to encourage further vitamin D deficiency .
Caroline Cerny , Cancer Research 's SunSmart manager , said : " These figures show that a worryingly high number of men are dying unnecessarily from malignant melanoma because of the rapidly rising numbers diagnosed with the disease .
" However , what Cancer Research seemed keen to avoid talking about was that the rise in malignant melanoma had occurred at a time that use of sunscreen had also soared .
The UK's Office for National Statistics showed that sunscreen use ( relative to sun exposure ) among men had increased to 37 percent by 1998 , a marked improvement on previous years .
They also failed to discuss exactly why older men , the very group least likely to be regularly exposed to the sun , had suffered a disproportionately high increase in their likelihood of developing the disease .
There was no recognition whatsoever of the recent study from the Environmental Working Group , which showed in no uncertain terms that more than half of commercial sunscreens actually accelerate cancer
In fact , spokespeople seemed far more interested in trotting out the same tired lines about using poisonous sunscreens and avoiding direct sunshine .
Cerny continued : " Too often men leave it up to their partners or mothers to remind them to use sunscreen or cover up with a shirt and hat , and even to visit the doctor about a worrying mole , " While no - one disputes that getting sunburn is harmful and should always be avoided , the hype over avoiding the sun remains both unsupported and a direct contravention of common sense .
As the evidence supporting the anti-carcinogenic effects of vitamin D continues to mount on a monthly basis , starving ourselves of this protective nutrient seems to be the most efficient way of developing cancer .
Maintaining a sensible level of sun exposure ( as humans have done for the last 400,000 years ) appears to be our best bet .

Bangkok , Thailand ( CNN ) --
Many streets in Bangkok were eerily calm Thursday , a day after the city devolved into deadly clashes between protesters and government forces .
Government officials extended a dusk - to - dawn curfew for 24 provinces until Sunday in the hopes that their successful crackdown on protesters would sustain .
" We are confident that in the next few days peace and civility will return to Thailand , " said Panitan Wattanayagorn , a government spokesman .
The spokesman said the government would quickly move to prosecute the Red Shirt protesters that were arrested during the riots .
i Report : Are you there ?
Send your images , video
" We understand their frustration , but the violence that went on last night was beyond frustration .
It was organized crime , " the spokesman said .
On Wednesday the army surged into Lumpini Park , the area where Red Shirt demonstrators had amassed .
i Report : Video sparks discussion
After hours of intense street battles , seven anti-government protest leaders were taken into custody .
Three more turned themselves in Thursday .
Red Shirt leaders called off the protest , but it seemed as though many did not heed the call .
By Friday , however , three more Red Shirt leaders turned themselves in .
As a result of smaller riots that erupted throughout the city , a dozen buildings -- including a bank , a police station , a local television station and Thailand 's biggest shopping mall -- were set ablaze .
i Report : Army running away
In all 34 buildings were torched , the government spokesman said Wednesday .
Timeline of Thailand 's political crisis
At least 44 people have been killed in clashes in the last several weeks , and nearly 400 people were injured , government officials said .
That death toll could rise as people begin to sift through areas of Bangkok that had been badly damaged .
What are the protests about ?
Wat Patumwanaram Temple , a Buddhist temple in Bangkok , had been a haven for thousands of protesters early in the week .
But Thursday there were a few people there , and also six dead bodies could be seen .
Parts of Bangkok seemed like a ghost town Thursday , witnesses said .
Aftermath : ' Not the Thailand we know anymore '
" It 's not that busy or so crowded like the normal Bangkok , " said Rujira Jeawskun , 22 , who works for a travel firm in the city .
" I just feel so sad .
How can people who are asking for democracy burn our country like that ? "
Bangkok residents : ' This is a mini-civil war '
The Red Shirt opposition members support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , who was ousted in a bloodless 2006 military coup .
They had been protesting for weeks , demanding that the current prime minister dissolve parliament and call new elections .
From his self - imposed exile abroad to avoid a trial on corruption charges , Thaksin released a statement Wednesday saying that he was not the leader of the United Front for Democracy , the formal name of the Red Shirt opposition , and that their movement calling for new elections is not on his behalf .
CNN 's Dan Rivers , Sara Sidner and Miranda Leitsinger contributed to this report .
NAIROBI , Kenya —
Kenya ’s shaky democracy is facing a defining struggle as the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court begins an investigation into political violence that is expected to lead him straight to Kenya ’s wealthy and educated ruling elites .
Argentine prosecutor Luis Moreno - Ocampo arrived here last weekend for a five - day visit carrying with him the hopes of Kenyans desperate to see justice for the deaths of more than 1,100 people in violence that followed the last elections in 2007 .
He is not alone in hoping that his investigation and subsequent indictments might end the impunity that has held sway since Kenya 's independence more than half a century ago .
But his will not be an easy job .
“ Let ’s be clear , ” former anti-corruption chief John Githongo told GlobalPost , “ the ICC has met one of the most serious bunches of gangsters on the African continent here in Kenya . ”
For two months after the 2007 polls the country was convulsed by violence and riots , pogroms and forced evictions .
The security forces cracked down with trigger - happy abandon :
More than one - third of those killed were shot by police .
Nobody has yet been convicted in the creaking and corruptible domestic courts : not wielders of machetes , spears and fire , not armed servicemen , not businessmen who funded the gangs and not politicians who incited the violence and gained power because of it .
Since multi-party politics began in Kenya , elections have been ethnically divisive and violent .
Hundreds died in 1992 and again in 1997 before 2007 exploded .
“ Violence has long been a feature of political life but what happened in 2007 went way beyond anything we ’d seen before .
If nothing is done we can predict that next time will make 2007 look like chicken feed , ” warned Anthony Kuria , coordinator of the Movement for Political
Accountability and a member of a government Commission of Inquiry set up to investigate the violence .
That commission , dubbed the Waki Commission after the judge who headed it , produced an exhaustive 556 - page report detailing the violence .
It also drew up a confidential list of alleged perpetrators that was handed to the ICC chief prosecutor last year after Kenya ’s government
failed to deliver on repeated promises to set up its own local tribunal .
The confidential list , as well as the evidence of the Waki Commission and various human rights groups , forms the basis of the ICC investigation .
“ The situation was extremely well - documented so we ’re all making fairly educated guesses as to who they might be pursuing , ” said Muthoni Wanyeki , executive director of the independent Kenya Human Rights Commission .
“ The reason that this investigation is important is that Kenya has a history of knowing exactly who is involved in what , and watching them get off with nothing , ” said Wanyeki .
Among 19 politicians on a list of 219 alleged perpetrators published by the state - funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights ( KNCHR ) are three cabinet ministers .
Among these are higher education minister William Ruto of the Orange Democratic Movement ( ODM ) and finance minister Uhuru Kenyatta of the Party of National Unity ( PNU ) .
Both are accused of funding and planning ethnic violence for political ends .
Moreno - Ocampo has said he will look for senior politicians on both the ODM and PNU side of Kenya ’s dysfunctional coalition government forced together under international pressure to end the post-election violence .
“ For a long time we ’ve not believed that anything can happen to the top flight political personalities , ” said Hassan Omar , vice chairman of KNCHR .
“ So to say we can investigate these top politicians and we can actually see them in the dock has a very important psychological
impact in terms of Kenyans believing that justice can work . ”
Both Ruto and Kenyatta firmly deny the allegations and have taken legal action in Nairobi to have their names removed from the KNCHR list of alleged perpetrators .
“ In Kenya some people who are members of powerful political dynasties are regarded as above the law , they do n’t ever have to be accountable , ” said Mwalimu Mati , a lawyer and director of political watchdog Mars Group Kenya .
The politicians have , time and again , proved themselves to be above Kenyan law but now they face international law .
In late March judges at the The Hague - based ICC granted its chief prosecutor permission to begin his investigation .
“ The judges have decided there will be justice in Kenya , ” Moreno - Ocampo said afterwards .
“ To contribute to the prevention of crimes at the next election [ in 2012 ] we must proceed promptly .
We will . ”
He hopes to complete investigations by November before issuing indictments for between four and six suspects , but he will face challenges .
“ Ocampo has met his match in Kenya against a political class that has been entrenched for almost 50 years and are masters at hoodwinking the international community , ” said Githongo .
Kenya ’s politicians are adept at saying one thing and doing another .
They are , according to Wanyeki , “ masters of motion without movement . ”
Kenya ’s urbane , wealthy and Western - educated politicians are a different kind of opponent than Moreno - Ocampo ’s more usual thugs with guns like Joseph Kony in Uganda , or Mathieu Ngudjolo and Thomas Lubanga in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Western diplomats — enthusiastic about the ICC investigation — fear that the prosecutor will be greeted cordially in public but behind the scenes will face , as one put it , “ the whole gamut of obstruction from procrastination and obfuscation , to buying - off and bumping - off witnesses . ”
But Moreno - Ocampo may also find help in unexpected places .
It was New Year ’s Day 2008 , and local radios broadcast the news that President Mwai Kibaki , an ethnic Kikuyu and leader of the PNU , had been declared the winner of hard - fought elections .
Upon hearing the new , a mob of bow - and arrow - wielding Kalenjin men , supporters of Raila Odinga ’s ODM , surrounded a church in Kiambaa , close to Eldoret town in the north Rift Valley .
They barricaded the wooden doors and threw mattresses doused with petrol against the walls and onto the roof then set it on fire .
Thirty - five Kikuyus died in the blaze , most of them women and children .
Jackson Kibor , a 76 - year old Kalenjin elder and former politician who owns a farm close to Kiambaa where rows of white crosses mark the plot on which the church once stood , is listed as an alleged perpetrator in the KNCHR report and was previously named in a Commission of Inquiry into the earlier violence in 1992 and 1997 .
“ What will happen will happen .
So let it be , ” Kibor told GlobalPost in an interview .
“ If there are witnesses who can positively link me to any act of incitement or violence , I 'm ready and willing to face The Hague .
“ I hear people saying my name is on [ his ] list .
If it is there , I 'll be tried and the judge 's decision is final , ” he said .
“ I welcome Ocampo to my farm .
I will tell him all I know . ”
The reason for this strangely placatory view is simple , according to Ken Wafula , executive director of Eldoret ’s Centre for Human Rights and Democracy .
“ Many Kalenjins here feel they were misused by their own leaders , chiefs feel that they were forced to collect money to finance the post- election violence , ” explained Wafula .
“ Their consciences no longer allow them to keep quiet , they feel they did something wrong
and they want to speak out . ”

SUNDAY AM : Warner Bros is already planning the 3D sequel .
“ The franchise is very much alive , ” an exec told me this morning .
Because this weekend ’s opening for New Line / Warner Bros ’ A Nightmare On Elm Street was $ 32.2 million — or 15.8 million Friday and $ 10.5 million Saturday and Sunday ’s estimate from 3,332 theaters .
( Friday ’s take includes $ 1.6 million from Thursday midnight shows in about 1,000 locations , a new record for a horror flick previously held by the February 2009 rebooted Friday The 13th‘s $ 1 million . )
“ A Nightmare On Elm Street is a dream that wo n’t stop , ” a rival studio exec emailed me .
Puh - leeze , this Michael Bay - produced pic received rotten reviews .
In all , this is the 9th in the infamous franchise — if you count number Freddy vs Jason — with Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy Krueger .
( Robert Englund as the slasher used to scare me so badly I could never even watch the trailers of the old films . )
By contrast , Furry Vengence turned in a nightmare performance as expected of a politically correct kiddie pic about the environment .
Remember when Brendan Fraser had a film career ?
Opening in 2,997 theaters , the pic was co-produced and co-financed by Summit and Participant Media / Imagenation Abu Dhabi .
But the studio claims the $ 35 million budget went lower after rebates , incentives , and strong pre-sales by Summit International .
Even so , this did only $ 1.7 million Friday and $ 2.9 million Saturday for a $ 6.5 M weekend with Sunday ’s estimate .
Here ’s the Top 10 :
1. Nightmare on Elm Street ( NL / WB ) NEW [ 3,332 Runs ]
Friday $ 15 M , Saturday $ 10.5 M , Weekend $ 32.2M
2. How To Train Your Dragon ( DWA / Par ) Week 6 [ 3,426 Runs ]
Friday $ 2.5 M , Saturday $ 4.7 m , Weekend $ 10.8 M , Cume $ 192.3 M
3. Date Night ( Fox ) Week 4 [ 3,093 Runs ]
Friday $ 2.4 M , Saturday $ 3.4 M , Weekend $ 7.6 M , Cume $ 73.6 M
4. The Back - Up Plan ( CBS Films / Sony ) Week 2 [ 3,280 Runs ]
Friday $ 2.4 M , Saturday $ 3.0 M , Weekend $ 7.2M ( - 41 % ) , Cume $ 22.9 M
5. Furry Vengeance ( Summit ) NEW [ 2,997 Runs ]
Friday $ 1.7 M , Saturday $ 2.9 M , Weekend $ 6.5 M
6. The Losers ( Dark Castle / WB ) Week 2 [ 2,936 Runs ]
Friday $ 1.9 M , Saturday $ 2.4 M , Weekend $ 6 M , Cume $ 18.1M
7. Clash Of The Titans ( Warner Bros ) Week 5 [ 2,736 Runs ]
Friday $ 1.6 M , Saturday $ 2.6 M , Weekend $ 5.9 M , Cume $ 154.0 M
8. Kick - Ass ( Lionsgate ) Week 3 [ 2,452 Runs ]
Friday $ 1.3 M , Saturday $ 1.8 M , Weekend $ 4.5 M , Cume $ 42.2M
9. Death At A Funeral ( Screen Gems / Sony ) Week 3 [ 2,271 Runs ]
Friday $ 1.2 M , Saturday $ 1.7 M , Weekend $ 4.0 M , Cume $ 34.8 M
10 . Oceans ( Disney Nature ) Week 2 [ 1,210 Runs ]
Friday $ 830 K , Saturday $ 1M , Weekend $ 2.6M ( - 56 % ) , Cume $ 13.5 M
FRIDAY 2:15 PM : I was just told that the New Line / Warner Bros reimagining of A Nightmare On Elm Street debuted to $ 1.6 million from Thursday midnight shows in about 1,000 theaters .
That ’s way more than the previous record for a horror flick : the February 2009 rebooted Friday The 13th ‘s $ 1 million .
Today , Nightmare opens in 3,332 locations and my sources tell me right now the Friday domestic grosses look like a whopping $ 15 M to $ 17 M .
So that ’s a $ 40 + M opening weekend for sure .
A " mammoth of research " is about to rise behind London 's St Pancras station , a biomedical centre costing £ 600 m and housing about 1,250 " cutting - edge " scientists .
Ask not its value .
Science jeers at the idea .
The UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation has already been dubbed a " cathedral of science " , justified by faith , not reason .
In which context I turn to the Reith lectures .
Each year the dear BBC gestures towards high seriousness by getting a celebrity intellectual to muse in public for four hours .
Ennui is relieved with a chatty preamble from the redoubtable Sue Lawley , followed by safe , hand - picked questions and no nasty supplementaries .
The whole thing has the air of a Soviet academy .
No one does it better than the astronomer and president of the Royal Society , Martin Rees , who concluded the 2010 series this week .
Needless to say , he spoke to the BBC 's current craze – anything to do with science .
The airwaves are crammed with science quizzes , science chatshows , science magazines and science feedback .
News must have science stories , the Today programme science items , all reverential .
No scepticism is admitted to this new orthodoxy – or rather this revival of CP Snow's " two cultures " orthodoxy of the late 1950s .
Rees is shameless .
After a brisk , familiar canter through the wonder of science – internet , genomes , bugs , space travel – his last lecture brought him to the matter in hand .
Science , he said , should " engage broadly with society and public affairs " .
In other words , it should get more money .
There is nowhere better to plead for this than on the BBC .
We are now shaping up for what , under the Osborne cuts , will be the greatest defensive operation in the history of Britain 's professions .
Rees will not allow scientists to miss out .
He is rightly worried over public anxiety at the more disreputable antics of his colleagues .
It was too bad that the Icelandic ash clouds turned out to be not as bad as " the science " had claimed .
It was too bad if science banned beef on the bone ; too bad if science wasted £ 2bn on Tamiflu ; too bad if science wrecked the case for nuclear power by its hypersafe radiation limits , or failed properly to defend GM foods .
These , by implication , were the fault of politicians for taking science too literally .
To Rees , " the advance of science spares us from irrational dread " , and if science replaced irrational dread with an exaggerated fear of risk , that also is just too bad .
Since science supplies its own " organised scepticism " , its claims on the public purse should be asserted as infallible .
Cathedrals are no place for question marks .
The Times ran a supplement before the election suggesting a " pro-science " MP was more important than any party , like " pro-life " candidates in America .
To criticise science teaching is little short of blasphemy .
Above all , science should be seen as above money .
To Rees , a science grant is like an arts grant , a virtue beyond measure .
In his lecture he insulted the financial sector as " not the real world " , as " faffing around with derivatives " and as undeserving of any graduate 's respect .
( Yet within minutes Rees was moaning that in Britain there was not enough " venture capital for startups " . )
The giveaway was a questioner who doubted the value of the Large Hadron Collider , on a par with aircraft carriers and Olympic games for useless extravagance .
Rees stuck to the party line that forbids him to say that £ 7bn and " thousands of scientists " buried under a Swiss mountain might have been better employed on energy research .
Politicians must show a sense of " priorities and perspectives " , he said , but scientists do not do priorities .
They just want money .
Rees is part of the lobby that led to the fiasco of the late 1980s , when colossal resources were devoted by the former Tory education secretary Lord Baker and others to maths and science education .
They said it should form two thirds of the so - called core curriculum .
Grants for science teaching soared .
History and geography were demoted .
University courses were expanded and colleges received twice as much grant for a science place as for an arts one .
By 1993 , when the policy had been in place for a whole secondary school cohort , it had utterly failed .
Demand for science GCSE and A - level had fallen by 10 % .
University science labs lay empty as entry requirements fell to E - grades .
Yet a plummeting market for science graduates left government targets unchanged .
A body called Save British Science castigated the " shocking underpayment " of scientists , even as it demanded that schools turn out ever more of them .
It was a classic policy failure that passes unaudited , by government , by politics or by academia .
The science lobby reacted by turning itself into a religion .
If economics could not justify its priority , then faith should do so .
Men such as Rees and his colleague , Lord May , became archbishops preaching the word , that : " Britain needs more scientists . "
Their canticle was : " More money for research . "
Other vocational subjects such as law , accountancy and finance were deplored , even as the jobs market screamed for them .
Unfashionable science - based occupations such as nursing and pharmacology had to burgle poor countries for staff .
Rees is two - faced about this talent theft .
Facing the accusation that science steals bright graduates from poorer countries , he suggests that they should " fulfil their potential without emigrating " , perhaps by Britain securing them " less dispiriting conditions " back home .
He wants a collider in every kraal .
Yet he promotes just such theft .
He wants more money or Britain 's " success in attracting mobile talent will be at risk " .
Unless we continue to attract and nurture foreigners , we will " not retain international competitiveness " .
Less cash would jeopardise the nation 's status in " the international premier league " .
It would damage Britain 's " standing " , its " leverage " , indeed , the very " sustainability of its society " .
This is big science , like big defence , dressing in the clothes of the League of Empire Loyalists .
When a lobby is in full cry , no quarter is given to reason .
If science is so international , why see it in such chauvinist terms ?
Why not let less - privileged countries share in the global talent ?
Besides , science is all on the internet .
A virtue of back - to - basics in public finance is that it might strip the cliches about " vital for the nation 's interest " from the log-rolling .
Every lobby is going into action to defend its subsidies .
Scargill 's miners were nothing to what we shall see from the scientists , doctors , lawyers , farmers , sportsmen and , above all , generals .
They will turn on government as never before , claiming exemption from cuts in the cause of national pride and prosperity .
When pain is expected of every corner of the public sector , no claim to public money should escape scrutiny .
Those intending to live off the earnings of others should always have to explain why .
I share Rees 's glory in the wonder of science .
I wish the wonder could be taught in schools , which still prefer to be kindergartens for lab technicians .
But science research is one lobby among many .
The BBC should not lavish it with favours against less - fashionable claimants for its platforms .
One thing is for sure , Rees 's subsidies must come from taxes on the professions he most despises – banking and finance .
I bet no one devotes a research grant or a Reith lecture to them .
This summer , how would you like to lean back in your lawn chair and toss back a brew made from what may be the world ’s oldest recipe for beer ?
Called Chateau Jiahu , this blend of rice , honey and fruit was intoxicating Chinese villagers 9,000 years ago — long before grape wine had its start in Mesopotamia .
University of Pennsylvania molecular archaeologist Patrick McGovern first described the beverage in 2005 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences based on chemical traces from pottery in the Neolithic village of Jiahu in Northern China .
Soon after , McGovern called on Sam Calagione at the Dogfish Head Craft Brewery in Milton , Del. , to do the ancient recipe justice .
Later this month , you can give it a try when a new batch hits shelves across the country .
The Beer Babe blog was impressed , writing that it is “ very smooth , ” and “ not overly sweet . ”
But that ’s not the only strange brew Dogfish is shipping out this summer .
Next week , the brewery will be bottling up the first large batch of Sah’tea for the general public — a modern update on a ninth - century Finnish beverage .
In the fall , The New Yorker documented the intricate research and preparation that went into making the beer , which was first offered on tap at the brewery in May .
In short , brewmasters carmelize wort on white hot river rocks , ferment it with German Weizen yeast , then toss on Finnish berries and a blend of spices to jazz up this rye - based beverage .
Reviewers at the BeerAdvocate universally praised Sah'tea , comparing it to a fruity hefeweizen .
One user munched on calamari as he downed a pint and described the combo as “ a near euphoric experience . "
And Dogfish is also bringing back one of their more unusual forays into alcohol - infused time travel .
Called Theobroma , this cocoa - based brew was hatched from a chemical analysis of 3,200 - year - old pottery fragments from the Cradle of Chocolate , the Ulua Valley in Honduras .
Archaeologist John Henderson at Cornell University first described the beverage in 2007 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , pushing the first use of the chocolate plant back by 600 years .
Dogfish first sold Theobroma in May 2008 , and the next batch — made from a blend of cocoa , honey , chilies , and annatto — will be on shelves and in taps in July .
The chocolate beer was apparently too sweet for Evan at The Full Pint , who writes that it contained “ a ton and a half of sugary sweetness ” with “ an insane amount of gooeyness left behind on the roof of your mouth . "

On May 9 , MICT and CRES admitted to blocking at least 50,000 websites and adding 500 more per day .
It appears FACT was blocked from that date .
FACT ’s extensive testing across Thai ISPs has revealed that ISPs are blocking at least a further 15,000 bringing the total to more than 65,000 .
In the second week of May , CRES announced blocking of 770 new websites ; on May 26 , CRES announced blocking of 1,150 more .
If we add these new figures to 46,000 websites , Thailand is blocking at least 113,000 websites !
On June 15 , the Thai cabinet approved the creation of a Bureau of Prevention and Eradication of Computer Crime to “ protect the monarchy ” .
The new office adds to censors at the ICT Ministry , the Royal Thai Police , military agencies CRES and CAPO , an Army ‘ war room ’ and the Culture ministry .
Ca n’t have too many censors !
( We may have missed some … )
On June 17 , Thailand ’s new ICT minister announced a blacklist of 200 persons banned from posting to the Internet .
This restriction was undefined but presumably all sites bearing these names will be blocked .
Although the names of former PM office minister Jakrapob Penkair and Chulalongkorn University professor Giles Ji Ungpakorn , both in exile over flimsy lèse majesté charges , are known to be on the blacklist , the rest of the list is secret .
This means people can’t defend their reputations .
Are you on the list ?
Am I ?
Included in the announcement of the blacklist on June 17 , government is threatening to “ take charge ” of websites it does n’t like !
Thailand is rapidly become an Internet desert approaching leaders ’ paranoia in Burma and North Korea .
IT industry and development will surely be looking for the exits .
Government shuts 43,000 more websites for lèse majesté , plans to block 3,000 more , total up to 113,000 – Manager : June 18 , 2010 – Translated by Frank G. Anderson .
Solving a 400 - piece jigsaw puzzle should be a doddle – but it ’s won a computer a new world record .
The previous record of 320 pieces was established by a Danish team in 2008 – but their computer could only solve puzzles with simple cartoon - style pictures featuring clear shapes and a limited number of colours .
The new software , developed by Taeg Sang Cho and colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , can cope with any image , including photographs of outdoor scenes .
The team diced up 5 - megabyte pictures into 400 squares and fed them into the software .
Just as a human might , the computer analyses the predominant colours to try to work out what kind of image is hidden in the jumble .
It then refers to a database of existing images to roughly arrange the pieces in their likely positions .
For instance , a mix of green , grey and blue pieces might imply a landscape scene with grass at the bottom , buildings in the middle and sky at the top .

Having guessed the rough arrangement for the pieces , the software then examines the pixel colour values along the boundaries of each piece and finds those on other nearby pieces that match the closest .
It then takes a best guess at the likely neighbouring piece .
The strategy is a good one : the computer completed the 400 - piece puzzle in just 3 minutes .
Better faking
Because the software is good at finding image pieces that blend well , Cho hopes it will one day help image - editing packages like Photoshop make manipulated pictures look more realistic .
“ If you move a person from one side of a picture to another , our algorithm could highlight the fact that the image will jar if the pixel values are too different , ” says Cho .
Klaus Hansen at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark , the former world record holder , is happy to lose the title .
“ Our approach was to use cartoons with clear colour and clear structure .
This new probabilistic approach is quite interesting , ” he says .
Unlike Cho ’s work on squares , Hansen ’s team used traditionally shaped jigsaw pieces – but that makes the new algorithm even more impressive , Hansen thinks .
“ Solving puzzles with square pieces is a challenge , and of course not possible for certain puzzles , ” he says .
“ For example , it is impossible to verify that a chessboard cut into 64 black and white squares is reassembled correctly . ”
Reference : Cho ’s team will present their work at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition in San Francisco next month
I audited a number of intensives of confessionals on Tom Cruise from July through November 2001 .
By order of Miscavige many of those sessions were secretly recorded by a well - concealed video camera and voice recorder system built into the VIP auditing room at Celebrity Center International .
I was r-factored that it was for the purpose of having the CS check up on the quality of my delivery .
All I knew at that time was that I forwarded the videos to my CS at Int ( RTC ) .
I was also required by Miscavige to write reports on the content of every session I delivered during that period and send them directly to Miscavige .
I was told by him that he needed to know because recovering Tom to Scientology was the most important mission possible .
I never received a single suggestion from Miscavige during the recovery process .
He quite apparently wanted to keep his distance until the messy divorce was over and there was no chance of Scientology becoming an issue .
The only C/S comments I received during that period , besides “ VWD ” , and during the subsequent 2 1 / 2 months of full time auditing I delivered in 2002 , were out - tech suggestions to re-check things that were confirmed as FLAT by me .
They were forwarded from COB Asst Shelly ( who had virtually no tech training ) ; all of which I refused to carry out in order to protect the pre-OT .
Finally , I unilaterally decided to stop recording sessions in Feb 2002 – despite flak from Shelly for ceasing – on the basis that it was simply unethical to record him for no apparent purpose ( the video was certainly of no importance for auditor correction purposes ) and without his knowledge .
Well , my suspicions about DM ’s real purposes for recording Tom ’s confessions have been confirmed as warranted .
I have recently learned from a very reliable witness that DM regularly held court with others in his personal lounge in the roadside Villas at the Int base , and while sipping scotch whiskey at the end of the night , Miscavige would read Tom ’s overts and withholds from my reports to others , joking and laughing about the content of Tom ’s confessions .
My witness is unimpeachable in my eyes as his account contains too many accurate details from someone who had zero reason ( or ability ) for being anywhere near Tom ’s folders , videos and reports direct to DM .
I also know he was a regular , preferred guest at DM ’s scotch night caps during that period .
Wake up , Tom .
It is not too late .
Though , time is getting very , very short .

The high iron content of whale faeces feeds Antarctic krill in the Southern Ocean and elsewhere ( Image : J Brokowski ) Researcher Nick Gales collects faeces sample from water ( Image : Australian Antarctic Division / Sarah Robinson )

Saving endangered baleen whales could boost the carbon storage capacity of the Southern Ocean , suggests a new study of whale faeces .
Whale faeces once provided huge quantities of iron to a now anaemic Southern Ocean , boosting the growth of carbon - sequestering phytoplankton .
So says Stephen Nicol of the Australian Antarctic Division , based in Kingston , Tasmania , who has found “ huge amounts of iron in whale poo ” .
He believes that before commercial whaling , baleen whale faeces may have accounted for some 12 per cent of the iron on the surface of the Southern Ocean .
Previous studies have shown that iron is crucial to ocean health because plankton need it to grow .
“ If you add soluble iron to the ocean , you get instant phytoplankton growth , ” says Nicol .
The amount of iron in whale faeces means that protecting Antarctic whales could swell populations of phytoplankton , which absorb carbon dioxide .
Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba ) feed on the phytoplankton , concentrating the iron in their tissue .
And in turn , baleen whales eat the krill .
Iron rations
It had already been suggested that whales recycled iron in the ocean by eating it in krill and making it available to phytoplankton in faeces .
But until this study , no one had analysed whale faeces to confirm if it indeed contained significant quantities of iron .
Nicol ’s team analysed 27 samples of faeces from four species of baleen whales .
He found that on average whale faeces had 10 million times as much iron as Antarctic seawater .
The team confirmed the iron came from krill by analysing the iron content in whole krill and sampling genetic material from the whale faeces for krill DNA .
“ We confirmed the vast majority of the iron in the poo came from krill , ” says Nicol .
Big eaters
Using estimates of the whale population before commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean began early last century , Nicol predicts that baleen whales – now endangered – once consumed about 190 million tonnes of krill every year and produced 7600 tonnes of iron - rich faeces .
Larger populations of whales would have produced more of this “ bio- available ” iron , leading to bigger phytoplankton and krill populations in turn , says Nicol .
“ Allowing the great whales to recover will allow the system to slowly reset itself , ” he says .
And this will ultimately increase the amount of CO 2 that the Southern Ocean can sequester .
David Raubenheimer , who researches marine nutritional ecology at Massey University in Auckland , New Zealand , says the findings are convincing and important .
They highlight a specific ecological role for whales in the oceans “ other than their charisma ” , he says .
Peter Gill , a whale ecologist at Deakin University in Warrnambool , Victoria , Australia , calls the research “ exciting stuff ” .
“ So many whales were moved from the ocean before we could understand the ocean ecology , ” says Gill .
“ It ’s exciting when we can reconstruct the past , and all these bits fall into place . ”

August 4th ( a Wednesday ) through the 8th ( a Sunday ) is the new date for our inaugural gosucamp .

All of the above ?
The coaches will work with each person to help them overcome their problems through the course of the morning .

Yep , hence me saying " some of ... " and the house they live in is occupied by 4 competitive SC2 gamers that are on a sponsored team so I will take the liberty to declare that it is indeed a " progamer " house !

Webcamming , recording , taking pictures etc etc.. all those things are fine .
We however do have a no fly zone above the house so personal airplanes or helicopters will be asked to remain at home .
We will be offering livestreams of the tourney and perhaps a lesson or two .

Due to the amount of people who will be online at the house I am not sure it would be feasible to have all of them playing and be able to run a livestream off of the same connection , but we will see .

That 's actually pretty sick , I was thinking about how cool it would be to get a pro house going on for some time in Europe , like a week or something and how beneficial it would be for the players in it .
I do n't know if 3 days will be enough but I wish you good luck with this new adventure , I always love new concepts and ideas and that 's the coolest thing I 've seen in a while .

Appreciate the kind words sir
As to the " 3 days being enough " of course more is better .. but given the reality of life very few people can afford to take 4 + days off from life and travel to a place where you pay to get trained by RTS gamers !
There are some that can obviously , power to them , but this is what we imagine to be the most realistic setup for the time being .
3 days is enough to absolutely sky - rocket an average or lower skilled gamer and it is enough to refine and sharpen as well as boost the above average SC2 gamer .

Californian Joey " Jaws " Chestnut has beaten Chicago 's Pat " Deep Dish " Beroletti at the world pizza - eating contest in Los Angeles .
Mr Chestnut took the title after gulping down 41 slices of pizza in 10 minutes .
He adds the achievement to his hot - dog eating world record .
City officials in Oslo seem intent on making the Norwegian capital the world ’s electric car capital as well .
It now can boast the highest number of recharging stations per capita in the world , and is the home of some major el-car producers .
Last week the city formally opened a large new recharging station , free of charge for el- car owners , right near the popular inner harbour and adjacent to the waterfront Aker Brygge complex .
The station also offers free parking for el-cars , for up to 16 hours .
The spacious recharging and parking facility , mostly empty one day last week , stands in sharp contrast to the limited and expensive parking in the area for conventional vehicles .
It costs NOK 48 ( USD 7.75 ) per hour to park on the street just next to the el-car lot and even more in a nearby garage .
City manager Stian Berger Røsland boasted that the new lot is the largest of its kind in the world , with 50 free parking and recharging stalls .
Oslo also has 179 other recharging stations for el-cars , and aims for 700 within the next two years .
The city also allows el- car users to drive in commuter lanes and exempts them from tolls into the city .
The state exempts them from Norway ’s hefty annual car registration fees .
Meanwhile , long - troubled el- car maker
Think has been advertising heavily in local newspapers for both personnel and for its new Think City model due out later this summer .
Think claims the little cars , which sell for around NOK 250,000 ( USD 40,000 ) , are as secure as a conventional car , fun to drive , emit zero carbon emissions , can run for 160 kilometers before recharging is needed and have a top speed of 110 kph .
Think was founded at Aurskog , northeast of Oslo , in the early 1990s but suffered many years of changing ownership and bankruptcies .
It now claims to have the capital needed to sustain production , and calls itself a “ pioneer ” in the industry .
More than a dozen dealerships from Sandefjord in the south to Tromsø in the north were listed as taking orders for the new Think models .

First base is generally agreed to mean deep kissing , i.e .
French kissing , snogging , necking , making out , playing tonsil hockey , swapping spit , tongue wrestling , contracting oral herpes , etc .
Second base is widely disputed ; the more conservative camp would argue that it 's heavy petting , wild fondling and under - shirt action , while the sluttier among us console themselves with the idea that manual stimulation is still only halfway ' round the field .
Third base brings the mouth into it , and a home run takes things -- seemingly -- to their logical conclusion .
But home base , as any sports fan knows , is n't just where it ends .
It 's also where it starts .
In this installment of The Dave Thorpe Dating Theory , we 'll take a look at the full system of bases , an age - old educational tool that will prepare you for each step of your relationship .
4th base :
Rolling over in bed to answer your cell phone and accidentally elbowing her in the face hard enough to constitute domestic violence , but it does n't wake her up and you 're propped up half - asleep thinking , " my god , I 've killed her . "
5th base :
Pregnancy scare .
You 're thinking " maybe if I get her really drunk , nature will take its course , " but then you worry it 'll backfire and you 'll wind up with an Eraserhead baby .
6th through 14th bases :
Being subjected to an entire Tori Amos CD in the car .
One base awarded for each hour it seems to last .
15th base :
Hugging her from behind in the supermarket and getting that instant of panic that maybe you did n't look carefully enough first and now you 're hugging a total stranger , then being almost a little bit disappointed when it turns out it 's your girlfriend .
16th base :
She openly talks about her period in a non-pregnancy - scare context .
17th base :
Trying to put your pants on in the morning and realizing they 're her pants .
18th base :
Accidentally calling her " sweetie . "
19th base :
One time I was in Safeway and this really square middle - aged couple were standing there surveying all the nuts in the nut aisle , and the lady was like , " how am I supposed to choose between all these nuts ? " and the dude says , in a completely normal and casual tone of voice , " I 've got some nuts for you . "
He did n't even say it quietly .
This actually happened , and that shit is 19th base .
If you see that guy ( you 'll know it 's him ) , high - five him for me .
20th base :
You give her a wicked bladder infection and you 're secretly a little bit proud of yourself .
21st base :
She tries some kind of butt thing on you and you 're like " what on earth ?
No . "
Girls usually know what 's up , but there 's some kind of misguided girl wisdom telling them that dudes like butt stuff .
Where are they getting this info ?
21st and a half base :
Giving yourself a black eye by accidentally opening a door into your face .
This has nothing to do with relationships , but eventually it 's going to happen and it's best to start preparing now .
22nd base :
The first time you secretly do that little quack - quack motion with your hand while she talks at you .
23rd base :
Accidentally calling her " mom . "

The moves make the man , and in the case of South Florida high school basketball star Guerdwich Montimere , the moves discovered the boy was a man .
The 22 - year - old former Fort Lauderdale standout player was arrested Tuesday after police said he posed as a 16 - year - old boy playing on a Texas high school team .
Montimere , a star at Dillard High a few years ago , was discovered by two South Florida coaches playing at Permian High in Odessa , Texas .
Posing as sophomore Jerry Joseph , Montimere was confronted by Boyd Anderson Assistant coach Cedric Smith and South Florida Elite coach Louis Vives at an April tournament in Arkansas .
" We saw him .
We 've known Guerdwich since he was in seventh or eighth grade , " Smith told the Sun - Sentinel last week .
" The mannerisms were him . "
Vives approached Joseph at last month 's tournament , calling him Guerdwich .
" He acknowledged me like he did n't know me , " Vives said .
The coaches alerted school officials at Permian , who set off an investigation by U.S. immigration officials .
Police confronted Montimere at the school Tuesday about his identity .
He was arrested and booked into Ector County jail on a charge of presenting false identification to a peace officer .
Montimere had enrolled at the junior high as a 15 - year - old in February 2009 , and had begun living with Permian 's basketball coach , Danny Wright , telling him he was homeless .
" This affected a lot of people .
The whole school of Permian embraced that kid .
He deceived us and played on everyone 's emotions , " Wright said .
The school may have to forfeit its 2009 season , in which Montimere , as Joseph , won the newcomer of the year award .
As of Tuesday night , Montimere was being held on $ 500 bond .
He faces six months in jail and a $ 2,500 fine .
Montimere , a 6 - foot - five naturalized U.S. citizen , was born in Haiti .
He graduated from Dillard in 2007 .

Splice director Vincenzo Natali has two huge movie adaptations in the pipeline : William Gibson 's Neuromancer , and J.G. Ballard 's High Rise .
In an exclusive interview , Natali explains to us how he updated High Rise , and his hopes for Neuromancer .
Advertisement
While explaining to us the ideas behind Splice 's graphic horror , Natali took some time to update us on how he 's transforming High Rise , Ballard 's story of class warfare in an isolated building the size of a city , into a movie .
And he explained what he hopes audience will experience in his recently announced adaptation of Neuromancer .
I was looking at the concept art poster for High Rise .
I have no idea if this is based on the script you wrote or not , but the new High Rise building looks like it 's not near a city .
Is this film taking place on a stand - alone island ?
Unlike the book , which has the luxury tower positioned right outside of London ?
Advertisement
Yes .
Yes .
Because the book was written a long time ago — it was written 30 years ago , and it 's quite surreal — I felt that if you just translated the book , just transcribed the book into a movie , basically you 'd have The Exterminating Angel all over again .
You 'd have a surrealist film .
There 's nothing wrong with that , but I sort of felt that that took away from some of the poignancy of the story , when it really did n't need to be surreal .
When you really can imagine this — what I call a " social disaster film . "
In my mind , it 's totally plausible that these events could happen .
But they could never happen half a mile from the port of London .
So I kind of made that story the background story to our film .
[ The novel is ] almost like a backstory [ to the movie ] .
And we 'll learn a lot more about Royal , the architect .
And we 're going to learn a little bit about past failed experiments of his .
It all ties into this High Rise , which is very isolated .
It 's on an island somewhere in the Pacific .

So this is like the 2.0 version of High Rise ?
This is High Rise 2.0 .
Since you 're known for psychological horror , do you see your Neuromancer as a psychological horror film ?
Advertisement
Neuromancer ?
No .
No , I do n't think so .
I think there 's a psychological component to it unquestionably , but not a horror film at all .
I think William Gibson 's vision of the future is very rich , because it 's somewhat ambiguous .
It feels dystopian but not completely .
It 's a mixed bag .
And I think that 's where we 're headed .
I think there 's going to be good things and bad things down the road .
The only thing we can be sure of is that it 's going to be different .
That fundamentally , we 're on the cusp of some kind of global seismic shift , on a number of different levels .
And , even though it was published in 1984 , Neuromancer really anticipates these things .
It is , in fact , entirely relevant , maybe more relevant now than it was before .
To me it 's just a pure work of science fiction , probably the most influential science fiction novel in the last 25 , or so , years .
So to even be considered to adapt it , to be allowed to adapt it , is just an incredible honor .
I can't tell you how excited I am .
Advertisement
Are you adapting it right now ?
This is the technological monster that is the internet .
That news was announced prematurely .
I have n't even signed my agreements yet .
I 've spoken with William Gibson , and I think I have his blessing .
He was really nice .
Advertisement
Wait — you think you have his blessing ?
[ Laughs ]
Well I do have his blessing , that was me trying to be modest .
That 's my Canadian side .
No he was very , very enthusiastic .
It was a very exciting moment for me to be able to speak with him .
And to have his blessing .
As soon I finish my Splice tour , I 'm going to start writing .

People who have read the novels know what cyberpunk is , but some folks might hear the description of Neuromancer and think it 's just another Matrix , or [ Gibson 's short story turned movie ] Johnny Mnemonic again .
What will you give them that 's different ?
First of all let me say that it's a good thing for Neuromancer that those films exist .
It 's a good thing that Avatar exists .
For a couple reasons — first and foremost , in 1984 , I do n't even know how people understood Neuromancer when they read it .
It was just so far ahead of the curve , that even as a book , I imagine that it was very difficult for people to wrap their heads around it .
Advertisement
Thanks to The Matrix , which obviously was heavily influenced by Neuromancer , a lot of these ideas are now a part of the popular consciousness .
So when you make the Neuromancer movie , in whenever it 's going to be — 2012 , 2011 — you do n't have to explain a lot .
It 's already understood , and then you can get to the really good stuff .
Which in my mind is about approaching the post - human world .
To me that 's what the movie is about .
Splice is about evolving our bodies .
Neuromancer is about evolving our minds , and how we 're going to merge and interact with machine consciousnesses in the future .
Which I also think is inevitable , and I do n't think The Matrix begins or even attempts to go into that territory .
In fact The Matrix , in some respects is like a Philip K . Dick book , it 's really about what is real .
And Neuromancer flirts with that , but I think it 's more about our evolution .
It 's also tonally much more realistic .
The Matrix which I really liked , is a movie that 's very much based in comic - book reality , and kind of relishes in it .
Whereas my approach to Neuromancer would be to treat it quite realistically .

What are we going to see next out of you ?
I 've read that you 're doing Alan Moore 's Swamp Thing , High Rise and now Neuromancer ?
That [ Swamp Thing ] is another weird internet rumor because I do n't have the rights to Alan Moore 's Swamp
Thing , it 's just something that I would like to do .

I do n't know .
I 'm waiting to find out myself .
All of these projects , and there 's also another project called Tunnels , which is really cool , which is a young readers series .
They are all amazing projects , it 's just not up to me .
I wish it was .
I wish I could tell you .
It 's up to whoever writes the check .
It 's hard , it 's a miracle that Splice is being released on this scale .
I never thought the film would get a major distributor behind it ...
But for anyone who 's worried about High Rise because I might be doing Neuromancer , and vice versa , each film helps the other .
I was working on High Rise during Splice , but Splice happened to go first .
The fact that I made Splice is going to help finance High Rise .
It 's going to make it easier for that movie to get made .
Today ( June 23 , 2010 ) would have been Alan Turing ‘s 98th birthday — if he had not died in 1954 , at the age of 41 .
I never met Alan Turing ; he died five years before I was born .
But somehow I feel I know him well — not least because many of my own intellectual interests have had an almost eerie parallel with his .
And by a strange coincidence , Mathematica ‘s “ birthday ” ( June 23 , 1988 ) is aligned with Turing ’s — so that today is also the celebration of Mathematica ‘s 22nd birthday .
I think I first heard about Alan Turing when I was about eleven years old , right around the time I saw my first computer .
Through a friend of my parents , I had gotten to know a rather eccentric old classics professor , who , knowing my interest in science , mentioned to me this “ bright young chap named Turing ” whom he had known during the Second World War .
One of the classics professor ’s eccentricities was that whenever the word “ ultra ” came up in a Latin text , he would repeat it over and over again , and make comments about remembering it .
At the time , I did n’t think much of it — though I did remember it .
Only years later did I realize that “ Ultra ” was the codename for the British cryptanalysis effort at Bletchley Park during the war .
In a very British way , the classics professor wanted to tell me something about it , without breaking any secrets .
And presumably it was at Bletchley Park that he had met Alan Turing .
A few years later , I heard scattered mentions of Alan Turing in various British academic circles .
I heard that he had done mysterious but important work in breaking German codes during the war .
And I heard it claimed that after the war , he had been killed by British Intelligence .
At the time , at least some of the British wartime cryptography effort was still secret , including Turing ’s role in it .
I wondered why .
So I asked around , and started hearing that perhaps Turing had invented codes that were still being used .
I ’m not sure where I next encountered Alan Turing .
Probably it was when I decided to learn all I could about computer science — and saw all sorts of mentions of “ Turing machines ” .
But I have a distinct memory from around 1979 of going to the library , and finding a little book about Alan Turing written by his mother , Sara Turing .
And gradually I built up quite a picture of Alan Turing and his work .
And over the 30 years that have followed , I have kept on running into Alan Turing , often in unexpected places .
In the early 1980s , for example , I had become very interested in theories of biological growth — only to find ( from Sara Turing ’s book ) that Alan Turing had done all sorts of largely unpublished work on that .
And for example in 1989 , when we were promoting an early version of Mathematica , I decided to make a poster of the Riemann zeta function — only to discover that Alan Turing had at one time held the record for computing zeros of the zeta function .
( Earlier he had also designed a gear - based machine for doing this . )
Recently I even found out that Turing had written about the “ reform of mathematical notation and phraseology ” — a topic of great interest to me in connection with both Mathematica and Wolfram| Alpha .
And at some point I learned that a high school math teacher of mine ( Norman Routledge ) had been a friend of Turing ’s late in his life .
But even though my teacher knew my interest in computers , he never mentioned Turing or his work to me .
And indeed , 35 years ago , Alan Turing and his work were little known , and it is only fairly recently that Turing has become as famous as he is today .
Turing ’s greatest achievement was undoubtedly his construction in 1936 of a universal Turing machine — a theoretical device intended to represent the mechanization of mathematical processes .
And in some sense , Mathematica is precisely a concrete embodiment of the kind of mechanization that Turing was trying to represent .
In 1936 , however , Turing ’s immediate purpose was purely theoretical .
And indeed it was to show not what could be mechanized in mathematics , but what could not .
In 1931 , Gödel ’s theorem had shown that there were limits to what could be proved in mathematics , and Turing wanted to understand the boundaries of what could ever be done by any systematic procedure in mathematics .
Turing was a young mathematician in Cambridge , England , and his work was couched in terms of mathematical problems of his time .
But one of his steps was the theoretical construction of a universal Turing machine capable of being “ programmed ” to emulate any other Turing machine .
In effect , Turing had invented the idea of universal computation — which was later to become the foundation on which all of modern computer technology is built .
At the time , though , Turing ’s work did not make much of a splash , probably largely because the emphasis of Cambridge mathematics was elsewhere .
Just before Turing published his paper , he learned about a similar result by Alonzo Church from Princeton , formulated not in terms of theoretical machines , but in terms of the mathematics - like lambda calculus .
And as a result Turing went to Princeton for a year to study with Church — and while he was there , wrote the most abstruse paper of his life .
The next few years for Turing were dominated by his wartime cryptanalysis work .
I learned a few years ago that during the war Turing visited Claude Shannon at Bell Labs in connection with speech encipherment .
Turing had been working on a kind of statistical approach to cryptanalysis — and I am extremely curious to know whether Turing told Shannon about this , and potentially launched the idea of information theory , which itself was first formulated for secret cryptanalysis purposes .
After the war , Turing got involved with the construction of the first actual computers in England .
To a large extent , these computers had emerged from engineering , not from a fundamental understanding of Turing ’s work on universal computation .
There was , however , a definite , if circuitous , connection .
In 1943 Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in Chicago wrote a theoretical paper about neural networks that used the idea of universal Turing machines to discuss general computation in the brain .
John von Neumann read this paper , and used it in his recommendations about how practical computers should be built and programmed .
( John von Neumann had known about Turing ’s paper in 1936 , but at the time did not recognize its significance , instead describing Turing in a recommendation letter as having done interesting work on the Central Limit Theorem . )
It is remarkable that in just over a decade Alan Turing was transported from writing theoretically about universal computation , to being able to write programs for an actual computer .
I have to say , though , that from today ’s vantage point , his programs look incredibly “ hacky ” — with lots of special features packed in , and encoded as strange strings of letters .
But perhaps to reach the edge of a new technology it ’s inevitable that there has to be hackiness .
And perhaps too it required a certain hackiness to construct the very first universal Turing machine .
The concept was correct , but Turing quickly published an erratum to fix some bugs , and in later years , it ’s become clear that there were more bugs .
But at the time Turing had no intuition about how easily bugs can occur .
Turing also did not know just how general or not his results about universal computation might be .
Perhaps the Turing machine was just one model of a computational process , and other models — or brains — might have quite different capabilities .
But gradually over the course of several decades , it became clear that a wide range of possible models were actually exactly equivalent to the machines Turing had invented .
It ’s strange to realize that Alan Turing never appears to have actually simulated a Turing machine on a computer .
He viewed Turing machines as theoretical devices relevant for proving general principles .
But he does not appear to have thought about them as concrete objects to be explicitly studied .
And indeed , when Turing came to make models of biological growth processes , he immediately started using differential equations — and appears never to have considered the possibility that something like a Turing machine might be relevant to natural processes .
When I became interested in simple computational processes around 1980 , I also did n’t consider Turing machines — and instead started off studying what I later learned were called cellular automata .
And what I discovered was that even cellular automata with incredibly simple rules could produce incredibly complex behavior — which I soon realized could be considered as corresponding to a complex computation .
I probably simulated my first explicit Turing machine only in 1991 .
To me , Turing machines were built a little bit too much like engineering systems — and not like something that would likely correspond to a system in nature .
But I soon found that even simple Turing machines , just like simple cellular automata , could produce immensely complex behavior .
In a sense , Alan Turing could easily have discovered this .
But his intuition — like my original intuition — would have told him that no such phenomenon was possible .
So it would likely only have been luck — and access to easy computation — that would have led him to find the phenomenon .
Had he done so , I am quite sure he would have become curious about just what the threshold for his concept of universality would be , and just how simple a Turing machine would suffice .
In the mid-1990s , I searched the space of simple Turing machines , and found the smallest possible candidate .
And after I put up a $ 25,000 prize , in 2007 Alex Smith showed that indeed this Turing machine is universal .
No doubt Alan Turing would quite quickly have grasped the significance of such results for thinking about both natural processes and mathematics .
But without the empirical discoveries , his thinking did not progress in this direction .
Instead , he began to consider from a more engineering point of view to what extent computers should be able to emulate brains , and he invented ideas like the Turing Test .
Reading through his writings today , it is remarkable how many of his conceptual arguments about artificial intelligence still need to be made — though some , like his discussion of extrasensory perception , have become quaintly dated .
And looking at his famous 1950 article on “ Computing Machinery and Intelligence ” one sees a discussion of programming into a machine the contents of Encyclopaedia Britannica — which he estimates should take 60 workers 50 years .
I wonder what Alan Turing would think of Wolfram| Alpha , which , thanks to progress over the past 60 years , and perhaps some cleverness , has so far taken at least slightly less human effort .
In addition to his intellectual work , Turing has in recent times become something of a folk hero , most notably through the story of his death .
Almost certainly it will never be known for sure whether his death was in fact intentional .
But from what I know and have heard I must say that I rather doubt that it was .
When one first hears that Alan Turing died by eating an apple impregnated with cyanide one assumes it must have been intentional suicide .
But when one later discovers that he was quite a tinkerer , had recently made cyanide for the purpose of electroplating spoons , kept chemicals alongside his food , and was rather a messy individual , the picture becomes a lot less clear .
I often wonder what Alan Turing would have been like to meet .
I do not know of any recording of his voice ( though he did once do a BBC radio broadcast ) .
But I gather that even near the end of his life he giggled a lot , and talked with a kind of stutter that seemed to come from thinking faster than he was talking .
He seemed to have found it easiest to talk to mathematicians .
He thought a little about physics , though does n’t seem to have ever gotten deeply into it .
And he seemed to have maintained a child - like enthusiasm and wonder for many intellectual questions throughout his life .
He was something of a loner , working successively on his own on his various projects .
He was gay , and lived alone .
He was no organizational politician , and towards the end of his life seems to have found himself largely ignored both by people working on computers and by people working on his new interest of biological growth and morphogenesis .
He was in some respects a quintessential British amateur , dipping his intellect into different areas .
He achieved a high level of competence in pure mathematics , and used that as his professional base .
His contributions in traditional mathematics were certainly perfectly respectable , though not spectacular .
But in every area he touched , there was a certain crispness to the ideas he developed — even if their technical implementation was sometimes shrouded in arcane notation and masses of detail .
In some ways he was fortunate to live when he did .
For he was at the right time to be able take the formalism of mathematics as it had been developed , and to combine it with the emerging engineering of his day , to see for the first time the general concept of computation .
It is perhaps a shame that he died 25 years before computer experiments became widely feasible .
I certainly wonder what he would have discovered tinkering with Mathematica .
I do n’t doubt that he would have pushed it to its limits , writing code that would horrify me .
But I fully expect that long before I did , he would have discovered the main elements of NKS , and begun to understand their significance .
He would probably be disappointed that 60 years after he invented the Turing test , there is still no full human - like artificial intelligence .
And perhaps long ago he would have begun to campaign for the creation of something like Wolfram| Alpha , to turn human knowledge into something computers can handle .
If he had lived a few decades longer , he would no doubt have applied himself to a half dozen more areas .
But there is still much to be grateful for in what Alan Turing did achieve in his 41 years , and his modern reputation as the founding father of the concept of computation — and the conceptual basis for much of what I , for example , have done — is well deserved .
Happy posthumous birthday , Alan Turing .
Get ready for your 100th .

Remember the word “ fahrvergnügen ” that German carmaker Volkswagen once used in its advertising ?
Loosely translated , it means “ driving pleasure . ”
Well , seven - time Formula One champion and German driver Michael Schumacher is n’t feeling much fahrvergnügen these days .
When Schumacher announced in December that he would emerge from retirement to race again in Formula
One this year , it set the international racing series on its ear .
Here was the great Schumi , 41 and three years removed from competition , back to give Formula One ’s younger drivers a much tougher time of it .
Plus , he would drive for Mercedes GP , the team formerly called Brawn GP that had won the world championship with Jensen Button in 2009 .
Instead , Schumacher has been mired in mediocrity in his return .
At Sunday ’s Canadian Grand Prix , Schumacher finished 11th , meaning he did n’t score any championship points — the third time that ’s happened in the series ’ first eight races this season .
One reason Schumacher finished out of the points Sunday was because he was passed on the final lap by Vitantonio Liuzzi and Adrian Sutil , who drive for the lackluster Force India team .
Schumacher has rarely has been in a position to win a race .
He ’s finished fourth twice — at Spain and Turkey — but those were his only top - five finishes .
In five of the races , he ’s finished 10th or worse , and Schumacher is now ninth in the championship standings with a meager 34 points , 75 points behind leader Lewis Hamilton of McLaren , who won Sunday ’s race at the Circuit Gilles - Villeneuve track in Montreal .
Schumacher ’s Canadian race was marred by various problems , including contact with other cars — most notably with the Renault of Robert Kubica .
Although he started in 13th , Schumacher was third after 11 laps that included a chaotic start .
But “ then I had a puncture on the front right tire after my first pit stop , after I got together with Kubica , and that obviously decided my race , ” Schumacher said .
“ From there , I was stuck in traffic and there was nothing more to do because today our weapons were not very sharp . ”
The more pressing matter is how sharp Schumacher ’s weapons will be for the rest of the season , and for the next 2 ½ years .
Schumacher signed a three - year contract to drive for Mercedes .
Schumacher ’s problems resurrect the old question of whether it ’s mostly the driver or the machine ( or racing luck ) that ultimately makes the biggest difference in motor sports .
It ’s possible that Schumacher still has the driving skills , but not the cars , to reach the front and stay there .
After all , Red Bull ’s Mark Webber toiled for years with little to show for it .
But once his team developed competitive cars , the Australian won twice in 2009 and twice more this year , with back - to - back wins in Spain and Monaco .
Mercedes racing executive Norbert Haug said that in the Canadian race Sunday , “ without the [ tire ] puncture , Michael could certainly have achieved a respectable result . ”
But Schumacher is about more than respectable results ; he ’s about being arguably the best Formula One driver in history .
Now he ’s at a crossroads .
Schumacher either can add to his legend , if he and Mercedes pick up their game , or he risks becoming one more in a list of remarkable athletes who — unable to leave the sport they once dominated — stayed too long as they made one final attempt to burnish their place in the record books .
Hamlin ’s momentum
The Denny Hamlin express could keep rolling through Sonoma wine country this weekend when the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series holds the Toyota / Save Mart 350 at the Infineon Raceway road course .
Hamlin , who notched his series - high fifth win of the season Sunday at Michigan International Speedway , showed last year that he ’s getting better maneuvering his Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota around the twisty , hilly Infineon circuit .
The Virginian led 33 laps in last year ’s race before finishing fifth behind winner Kasey Kahne .
It was Hamlin ’s first top - five finish in four races at Sonoma .
Kahne , in turn , hopes to defend his victory after finishing second to Hamlin on Sunday .

Recently , I was performing the mundane task of taking out the trash .
I went from room to room , collecting the detritus of the week .
I then spent a few minutes scooping out and changing the cat litter , and , sighing , finally tied up the bag and hauled it out to the bins around the side of the house .
As I lugged the hefty bin out to the curb in the darkness , I did what I do , what I always do , when I go outside : I looked up .
I was greeted instantly with an astonishing sight : the reddish , glowing dot of Mars bumped right up against Regulus , the brightest star in Leo .
The two were paired less than a degree between each other , low over the western horizon .
It was beautiful .
Mars was the slightly brighter of the pair , and even in the mildly light - polluted and sparsely clouded night sky of Boulder I could see the color difference between the planet , some 240 million kilometers away , and the star , 3 million times farther distant yet .
I let my gaze drift a bit over and saw Saturn looming near Leo 's other end .
Venus , I knew , was already behind the mountains , but I could see the Big Dipper standing on its bowl to the northwest .
Following the arc of the dipper 's handle , I was led to mighty Arcturus , an orange giant nearing the end of its life , and a harbinger of things to come for our own star .
Turning , was that Vega I saw dancing in between my neighbor 's tree branches ?
Why yes , yes it was .
Summer 's coming , Vega is telling me .
My trash - hauling chore was forgotten .
I suddenly had a flashback , visceral and total , of being a teenager .
Standing at the end of my family 's driveway , I watched the sky .
Every clear night you 'd find me out there .
I spent hundreds of hours , thousands , either gazing with my eye to the telescope or simply with my chin tipped up , the Universe unfolded above me .
I would always have to pause when a car drove by , and while my absorption with the task did n't allow it to occur to me then , I now wonder how many of those people saw me and thought to themselves that I was wasting my time .
But as I stand outside my house as an adult , gaping up at the sky , I am familiar there .
The stars are my friends ... no , that 's hopelessly anthropomorphic and somewhat twee .
But they are like slipping your feet into well - worn slippers , like the first bite of a recipe you 've perfected by countless trial - and - error meals , like holding a book whose spine has been softened through years of reading and re-reading .
I 'm comfortable with the sky .
I 'm at home there .
When I stand in my yard and look up , my heart sings and my mind reaches out .
My weekly chore was interrupted , delayed , but it did n't matter .
I do n't know what your own passion is .
But I will say this , and you hear me well : no time is wasted spent under the stars .
And no time is wasted spent doing what you love .

I was toying with the idea of changing all Mike Milbury references on this site to " He Who Shall Not Be Named . "
It does n't make a very good acronym ( " HWSNBN ... wha-? " ) and it's hardly the way to be taken seriously when hoping for the occasional real interview from real staff , but on the other hand it 's how most fans and commenters here see the former GM , coach and Draft Day Assassin anyway .
The act of typing " Milbury " seems to be like a lingering canker sore to some , while " MM " always feels like an insult to those tasty bits of sugar - plated quasi-chocolate M&M's .
So what do you say ?
Is He Who Shall Not Be Named an acceptable proxy ?
Ahhh , tell you what :
You call him whatever you feel like calling him .
We 'll all catch your drift .
[ Edit : Many in comments suggest " Voldemort " to my Harry Potter - oblivious self .
Sounds right , no ? ]
In the meantime , it 's getting really close to HWSNBN 's favorite time of year -- the season when he used to crush the most hopes in the shortest amount of time while saying something reassuring like , " We 're rolling the dice here a little bit . "
So let 's take a quick look back at recent Islanders drafts to dial our idealist " RHETT IS GONNA BE A STAR !! " needles back a bit .
It 's too early to evaluate the Garth Snow / Ryan Jankowski draft years -- although as you 'll see in the conclusion , you can count me as " guardedly optimistic , and a great deal more impressed than under the old regime " -- but for a baseline for our hopes and prayers , it helps to look at the baseline :
What came of 1996 - 2005 .
A similar post at Copper & Blue marks 200 career NHL games as the minimum for an NHL career ( 100 GP for goalies ) .
I 'm not totally moved by that -- feels like 250 or 300 is more on the mark -- but in any case I 'm going to mention several above and below those thresholds .
For first - rounders you want more ; for anything beyond the second round you 're expecting a crapshoot .
[ Edit / addendum : Derek Zona , the author of that post at C&B , also has a league - wide view of how teams did , with the Islanders on top in the 1st -- but again , I 'd couch that with the position the Isles were drafting from . ]
Ground Rules
Some caveats and explanatory notes :
I 'm going with 1996 - 2005 here -- technically the years with HWSNBN in the GM seat , though 2006's " 40 Days of Neil Smith " cloud that year a bit .
I wo n't mention anyone without 200 NHL games played unless there are unusual circumstances , though I 'll include overall totals of how many guys hit that mark .
That C&B post mentions league averages of " success " between 1999 - 2005 ( as in , 61 % of all NHL first rounders in those years have hit the 200 GP threshold ) .
You can match those up with the Isles during that period , but I did n't want to limit it to those years , thanks to the GM tenures .
Plus , I 'm wary of a false comfort in numbers :
During that period , naturally the Isles will have more higher first - round picks than most teams , so they should be in the upper-end of the league average -- even without doing anything other than losing often enough to receive lots of top - 10 picks ) .
Post - HWSNBN picks Kyle Okposo and Josh Bailey already have almost 300 NHL GP between them .
But as you 'll see , that 's not rare for top - 10 picks , even under Milbury 's watch .
For every draft pick , there is a question of assessing and projecting talent at the uncertain age of 18 on draft day , and then there 's the separate question of developing that talent .
Draw your own conclusions there , because that 's where we 're really straying into case - by - case circumstances .
Anyway , here we go .
We 'll start with all first - rounders since HWSNBN arrived ( I wo n't list every pick for the other rounds , but the first round is ... kind of a big deal , you know ? )
Islanders First - Round Picks , 1996 - 2005
In addition to those in bold , Bergenheim will easily eclipse the 250 - game plateau .
Nokelainen is a good bet , though the injuries that shortened his time on the Island could conceivably bite him in the end .
In any case , I 'd throw those to in with the others as " real NHL careers . "
So if you include those two , 11 out of 14 first - rounders becoming NHL players is n't bad .
( If you restrict it to 1999 - 2005 and 200 GP the way C&B did , you have 7 of 10 , or 70 % . )
However , when you consider the number of high first - rounders HWSNBN had thanks to routinely finishing in lottery country , as well as how many he traded away ... well , we know that story and do n't need to rehash it here .
But by this measure , every first - round pick Snow ( and the staff who operated Neil Smith 's draft , selecting Okposo ) has had thus far should be a success , including the one they pick this month .
With Okposo , Bailey , Tavares and de Haan , they 're on track and then some .
Fully expecting another this year at # 5 .
Islanders Second - Rounders , 1996 - 2005 : Getting Dicier
The second round is of course a far blurrier game :
You do n't expect to land stars or even have a 50 % hit ratio ; but over time you should expect to have a few gems .
For reference , C&B called 25 % ( 200 GP ) league average between 1999 - 2005 .
Here 's Life Under Milbury , Second - Round version :
Year Round Spot Player GP 1996 2 29 Dan LaCouture 337 1997 2 31 Jeff Zehr 4 1998 2 36 Chris Nielsen 52 2003 2 58 Jeremy Colliton 42 2004 2 47 Blake Comeau 168 2005 2 46 Dustin Kohn 22
Second - round picks , like the NHL 's version of the few decent items at a yard sale , were bartered like gently used power drills during this era .
So the Isles went without any from 1999 - 2002 .
( That hurts a lot less when you have multiple firsts in consecutive years . )
As a result , Milbury has two " hits " out of six second - round shots in this era -- I 'm counting Comeau as a hit , as he 'll surely stick long enough to make 200 and probably 250 games ( hopefully many more , of course ) .
LaCouture is n't exactly a score -- and at # 29 in 1996 , he falls into that " practically a 1st " territory that glass - empty / glass - full pundits use to label all late - or early - in - the - round picks to suit their argument .
While acknowledging defensemen typically take longer to develop , I 'm not figuring Kohn to make that list of 200 or 250 - gamers .
Granted , I 've only seen 22 games of him , so I hope to be proven wrong .
But thus far I can't see it .
Post - Milbury , we still have Jesse Joensuu ( # 60 , 2006 ) with a fighting chance , as well as that fun 2008 trifecta of Corey Trivino ( 36 ) , Aaron Ness ( 40 ) and Travis Hamonic ( 53 ) , whose current potential is in the reverse order of their selection ; Hamonic is quite a ways ahead .
Last season there was Mikko Koskinen in the second round , at # 31 one of those " practically a first " picks who has a solid shot at being a player , such as we can say that before he 's played his first NHL game .
The Rest of the Notables , 1996 - 2005
So those are the first and second - rounders of Milbury 's era .
By volume it looks alright -- but again , this is why I 'm not sold on the " percentage versus league average " method for evaluating the Islanders : I simply can't toot their horn too much for getting an NHL player in the top ten of the draft .
That 's nearly shooting fish in a barrel .
( Query : Has anyone ever actually shot fish in a barrel , or is that just a fun saying ?
And why , exactly , would someone with the means to do so waste their resources in both ammo and aquatic food ?
It 's like saying , " That 's as easy as lighting your house on fire . "
Sure , I bet I could pull it off , but absent a shady insurance investigator I can't fathom why I 'd try . )
Worse , looking at that list of top - ten first - rounders does not warm the heart .
So I was flexible on the 200 - 250 GP threshold with the first two rounds .
I 'll likewise be flexible with the rest , though I 'm also going to leave off every selection who neither made that threshold nor met my ambiguous standards .
Here 's what that leaves ...:
Year Round Spot Player GP 1996 3 56 Zdeno Chara 847 1999 8 228 Radek Martinek 389 1999 4 101 Juraj Kolnik 240 1999 3 78 Mattias Weinhandl 182 2002 3 87 Frans Nielsen 166 2003 6 182 Bruno Gervais 278 2004 7 227 Chris Campoli 320
... And that 's it .
Ten years , 73 picks beyond the second round , seven players ( 9.6 % ) you could say have or are having NHL careers .
Weinhandl 's still doing fine in Europe , so you could theorize that he might have finally stuck in the NHL .
Kolnik stuck long enough to meet the threshold , but in a fairly unremarkable way .
Chara and Martinek represent two smart gambles that paid off handsomely .
Nielsen was a nice bet considering his size and background , and he 's starting to pay off in spades .
Campoli and Gervais were always nice relative to their draft spot , but in the end they are the kind of depth you find in the free agent bin .
If you restrict this post - second - round survey to the 1999 -2005 period as C&B did , you get six out of 49 ( 12 % ) ( or excluding Weinhandl as they would have , five out of 49 , 10 % ) .
By either measure , it exceeds the NHL average from 1999 - 2005 of 8.7 % but not by a significant margin .
Some of the flotsam that was not mentioned : Jiri Dopita ( 1998 5th , # 123 ) , 73 career games ( none with the Isles ) , whom the Islanders traded for a 5th - round choice and who later was swapped back and forth between Philadelphia and Edmonton ( for a 2nd and then for a 3rd , respectively ) .
... Evgeny Korolev , drafted in the 8th round ( 192 ) in 1996 , then again in the 7th round ( 182 ) in 1998 , and logged all of 42 NHL games with the Islanders .
2006 -2009 , post - 2nds
By comparison ( and I hesitate to do this , because we 're always more optimistic about recent picks before they 've had enough time to let us down ) , the picks beyond the second round the last four years still hold promise : Guys like Andrew MacDonald and Rhett Rakhshani ( 2006 ) , Blake Kessel and Mark Katic ( 2007 ) , Kiril Petrov , David Ullstrom , Kevin Poulin and Matt Martin ( 2008 ) and Anders Nilsson , Casey Cizikas , Anton Klemenyev and Anders Lee ( 2009 ) definitely give you the idea that there are gems in that litter .
Of course , I guarantee Milbury and staff once felt the same way about Justin Mapletoft , so ...
Conclusion : HWSNBN Haunts Less and Less over Time
So what can we learn from this ?
As ever , the draft is a crapshoot that gets only crapshootier beyond the first and particularly beyond the second round .
Perhaps the biggest single decision for a franchise is to not blow your top - ten pick -- when you get it -- on the wrong kid .
But beyond that , while Milbury and his staff were no draft gurus , their amateur scouting was n't their worst trait ( and really , every staff has big hits and misses in the amateur lottery ) .
As ever , it 's what Milbury did on draft day -- trades , rash decisions , U - turns -- and after draft day -- trades , rash decisions , U - turns , encouraging his picks with praise such as the " sniffing glue " comment about Brewer -- that really hurt .
Thankfully , as we move further along in time and Snow and Jankowski continue restocking the cupboard , we can start to visualize a time in the future when Milbury 's mulligans just wo n't matter anymore .
This franchise may not know where it 's playing in 2015 .
But if its amateur scouts continue to hit and their selections continue to develop , it will be a team people will want to watch play , come Queens or high water .

The relationship between drinking and sperm quality is not clear
Women who drink during pregnancy may be damaging the future fertility of their sons , research suggests .
In a study of almost 350 young men , sperm levels were a third lower in those whose mothers had drunk more than four drinks a week during pregnancy compared with teetotallers .
The Danish researchers told a fertility conference these men may have a harder time getting their partner pregnant .
UK experts said alcohol may not be the issue , but a marker for other factors .
Current advice is to avoid alcohol during pregnancy , but those who do so are advised to have no more than one or two units of alcohol once or twice a week .
The study included men , now aged between 18 and 21 , whose mothers had taken part in a large study on lifestyle while they were pregnant with them .
Researchers told the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology conference that they split the men into four groups - those whose mothers drank nothing , those who had one to one and a half drinks a week , two to four drinks a week , or more than four drinks a week .
One drink was classed as a beer , small glass of wine or one measure of spirits .
Four drinks in the study is equivalent to around six UK units .
When they looked at sperm counts in the men's semen samples , they found those with the highest alcohol exposure in the womb had average concentrations of 25 million per millilitre compared with 40 million / ml in those whose mothers drank no alcohol .
After adjusting for factors which might influence sperm , such as smoking and medical history , they calculated that average sperm concentration was 32 % lower in the highest alcohol group than the abstinence group .
Fertility effects
The World Health Organization says that a normal range of sperm is 20 to 40 million / ml .
It is known that lower concentrations of sperm - even within the normal range - may mean it takes longer to conceive .
Study leader Dr Cecilia Ramlau - Hansen , from Aarhus University Hospital , said that if the link is proven in further studies , it may explain why semen quality seems to have fallen in recent decades .
" If exposure to alcohol in foetal life causes poor semen quality in adult life , we would expect that populations with many pregnant women drinking , possibly heavily , in pregnancy would have lower fertility in comparison with populations where pregnant women do not drink . "
Dr Allan Pacey , senior lecturer in andrology at the University of Sheffield , said the study was very interesting and supported the theory that male fertility was influenced at an early stage by factors in the womb .
But he pointed out that the low sperm levels seen did not equate to infertility .
" I do n't think we can be certain that alcohol is necessarily the bad thing here - it could be a surrogate marker for something else - but clearly there is some kind of relationship .
" It needs following up but it might help us understand factors which affect testicle development in the womb . "
Well , that was all rather too much : nearly 4,000 words and more footnotes than a Jerry Lee Lewis concert .
So here ’s the executive summary on what we know , what we do n’t know , what we can justifiably assume and what we ca n’t assume about the history of India Pale Ale , and I promise to keep it to under 700 words .
But first , here ’s an extract from a book written in 1882 , called Our own country : descriptive , historical , pictorial :
The India Pale Ale is a device wholly of the present century .
In the year 1822 one Hodgson , a London brewer who had settled at Burton , brewed something like the present bitter ale , which he accomplished in a teapot in his counting house , and called it Bombay beer .
A retired East India captain named Chapman improved on this , and Burton ale soon attained the celebrity that has made the names of Bass and Allsopp household words all over the world .
How many mistakes did you find in that collection of cobblers ’ awls ?
I believe there ’s not a single statement there that could be said to be correct , with , everything , including the teapot and “ Captain Chapman ” , unbelievably mangled .
It ’s a lesson for anyone who believes that if it ’s in an old book , it must be right .
So , to summarise my last post , and my other posts on the subject :
We have evidence that pale ale was being made at least as early as 1675 , brewed under that name by 1705 and that pale ale was being sold in London by 1709 at the latest .
We have evidence that ale and beer were being exported , apparently successfully , to India as early as 1711 .
We know that by the 1760s brewers were being advised that it was “ absolutely necessary ” to add extra hops to beer if it was being sent to warmer climes .
There is no evidence linking this advice , to hop export beer more heavily , to any specific brewer .
We know that pale ale , along with porter , brewer unnamed , was being exported to India from at least 1784 .
We know that pale ale and porter brewed by Hodgson of Bow was being exported to India from at least 1793 .
We DON’T know whether the Hodgsons were putting extra hops into their pale ale sent to India in the 1790s , as brewers were being advised to do in the 1760s .
Somewhere up to “ quite probably ” they were , I ’d say .
But still short of “ definitely ” .
They ought to have known that they should do .
But there ’s no evidence that they did .
We can guess that one of the reasons why Hodgson ’s beers were shipped to India in preference to other brewers ’ beers was not the quality of Hodgson ’s product but because the Bow brewery ’s owners were willing to give the East Indiaman ships ’ captains extended credit on their purchases of beer to be sold to Europeans in Bombay , Calcutta and Madras .
We know that in 1817 one London brewer , WA Brown at the Imperial Brewery , Bromley by Bow , a short distance down the Lea river from Hodgson ’s premises , was brewing “ Pale Ale prepared for the East and West India Climate ” , though we do n’t know how it was “ prepared ” .
We know that a specific hopping rate was being stated for beer for “ India voyages ” by 1821 .
We know that as early as January 1822 , “ Pale Ale brewed expressly for the India market ” and “ suitable for warm climates or home consumption ” was on sale in London ( though the brewer was unnamed ) .
We know that a couple of decades later , at least , in 1843 , “ the Pale Ale prepared for the India market ” was described as “ carefully fermented , so as to be devoid of all sweetness , or , in other words , to be dry ; and it contains double the usual quantity of hops . ”
We have evidence , 30 years after the event , but collected from an important witness , Samuel Allsopp ’s maltster , Job Goodhead , that a Burton brewer was encouraged in 1822 to take on Hodgson in the Indian market .
We know from multiple references that , despite the increased rivalry from Burton brewers , Hodgson ’s beer was hugely popular in the east , being described in 1829 as “ by far the best and most sought after in India ” .
We know that no “ pale ale as prepared for the Indian market ” seems to have actually been called India Pale Ale ( specifically “ East India Pale Ale ” ) until 1835 1829 .
We know that Hodgson ’s , at least , used East Kent hops in its “ Pale India Ale ” , and we are entitled to guess that these were East Kent Goldings .
We also know that Hodgson ’s dry - hopped its pale ale .
We know that the Hodgsons evidently became greedy , and lost the Indian market to others , including Bass and Allsopp from Burton and Ind & Smith from Romford , just east of London ( later Ind Coope ) .
We know that from 1841 onwards East India Pale Ale became increasingly popular in the British market .
We know that in 1869 William Molyneaux claimed that “ The origin of India ale is by common consent accredited to a London brewer named Hodgson …
The brewery where pale ale was first brewed , according to popular opinion , was the Old Bow Brewery . ”
But Molyneaux offered no evidence to back this up , and we know the Bow brewery was n’t the first place to brew pale ale per se .
All we know from the evidence we do have is that Hodgson was one of the brewers exporting pale ale to India , and became the most famous .
We can guess that Hodgson quite likely knew of the opinion expressed in books on brewing written in the 1760s that it was a good idea to highly hop ales for export to warmer climes .
But there is no evidence at all that Hodgson was the one to discover this .
Eventually that general knowledge about the need to hop beers for export to places like India apparently led to brewers to announce for sale something they called “ Pale Ale prepared for the East and West India Climate ” and similar designations , which was eventually shortened or summarised as “ India Pale Ale ” .
The fact that Hodgson called its beer “ East India Pale Ale ” in 1835 means it was probably “ prepared for the East India climate ” and so more highly hopped : whether it was so prepared in 1793 we do n’t know .
And the executive summary summarised ?

OF THE WORLD - The Media" Eustice Mullins has published his research in his book Who Owns the TV Networks showing that the Rothschilds have control of all three U.S. Networks , plus other aspects of the recording and mass media industry .
It can be added that they control Reuters too .
From other sources it appears CNN , which began as an independent challenge to the Jewish Network monopoly , ran into repeated trickery , and ended up part of the system .
Money from B.C.C.I. , ( B.C.C.I. has been one of the New World Orders financial systems for doing its dirty business such as controlling Congressmen , and is involved with INSLA , the Iran - Contra Scandal , Centrust , and other recent scandals ) which has tainted so many aspects of public power in the U.S. has also been behind CNN .

You can see that the ? : ones are slightly better then the fixed up version of your original .
The one that is the best is the one that avoids branching altogether .
That is good from the point of view of fewer instructions ( in most cases ) and better for branch prediction parts of the CPU , since a wrong guess in the branch prediction can cause CPU stalling .
I 'd say the most efficient one is the one from moonshadow overall .
It uses the fewest instructions on average and reduces the chance for pipeline stalls in the CPU .
To be 100 % sure you would need to find out the cost ( in CPU cycles ) for each instruction , which , unfortunately is n't readily available ( you would have to look at the source for hotspot and then the CPU vendors specs for the time taken for each generated instruction ) .

in the longest thread i've ever contributed to rather than sparked off as a flame - war , i describe why i think that leveraging web browser technology is a much better way to create a widget set .
[ ye gods , i think this is the largest thread i've ever seen , but i still feel compelled to wind back to the beginning and spew forth words . ]
On Jun 6 , 2:22 am , ant < shi...@uklinux.net > wrote : >

yep .
that 's why i ported pyjamas , which was a web - only / browser - only UI toolkit , to the desktop .
it 's a _real_ eye - opener to try to use the " failed " ports of pyjamas to both pygtk2 and pyqt4 , which you can still get at http://github.com/lkcl/pyjamas-desktop - see pyjd - pyqt4 and pyjd - pygtk2 these failed ports give you the clearest and bluntest indication of the failings of pyqt4 and pygtk2 .
after using those two " top " mainstream python GUI widget sets , i did n't try any others . >

no you 're right , it 's not .
... but as web browser technology development continues to accelerate , the top mainstream GUI technology ( not just python GUI technology ) is going to look more and more archaic in comparison . >

As small as possible in its default form i invite anyone considering starting a new python GUI project to consider these questions : * how much effort has been and is being spent , right now , on developing and debugging each of the python GUI widget sets , as compared to the efforts on web browser technology ( MSHTML , KHTML ok maybe not kHTML , WebKit , XulRunner ) ?
( put another way : how long have web browsers existed and how much user - market - share do web browsers have , compared to GUI and python GUI widget sets ? ) * are python GUI widget sets easy to compile cross-platform , as compared to web browser technology which is _definitely_ cross-platform ?
* how easy is it to extend the existing python GUI widget sets with " new " or " custom " widgets , as compared to web browser technology where you can manipulate bits of DOM ?
if you 're not sure of how simple / complex each task is , read and compare these :
http://www.learningpython.com/2006/07/25/writing-a-custom-widget- using-pygtk/
http://pyjd.sourceforge.net/controls_tutorial.html
* how easy is it , using the " new " or " custom " widget extension methodology of existing python GUI widget sets , to extend that widget set to " keep up " with modern GUI advancements and user expectations , as compared to enhancing web browser technology ?
actually , this is a deliberately misleading question , but it at least illustrates that it 's damn hard for GUI widget set developers to " keep up " .
in fact , many GUI widget set developers are actually embedding web browser technology as a widget in order to avoid the problem !
( pywebkitgtk , pyqtwebkit etc. ) * better question : how much time and money by large corporations with their associated vested interests is being invested into python GUI widget sets , as compared to how much by those same corporations into the W3C DOM Standards process and the resultant improvements and advances in web browser technology ?
* final question : how easy is it to create python " wrappers " around DOM browser technology , thus leveraging and riding on the back of the _vast_ amounts of effort and money being poured into web browser technology ?
answer for MSHTML ( aka Trident Layout Engine ) : using python - comtypes - 3 weeks .
answer for WebKit : using glib / gobject and pygobject " codegen " to augment pywebkitgtk - 12 weeks answer for XulRunner : using python - hulahop and python - xpcom - 2 weeks .
answer for Opera 's engine : unknown , because the developer has n't responded yet .
( it 's qt-based , so it would be estimated around 12 weeks , if they have n't already done the work ) .
so can you see where this is at ?
and that 's why pyjamas / pyjamas - desktop exists .
a _completely_ non-corporate - funded , _tiny_ team is riding on the back of the vast amounts of money and resources available to google , apple , nokia , microsoft , mozilla foundation and so on , and we 're sitting back and offering it as free software to people to create applications that are as powerful as the underlying web technology on which the pyjamas UI toolkit is based .
and with the addition of WebGL ( 3D SVG ) and HTML5 ( Video etc. ) , web technology is becoming pretty powerful .
so this is why it can be claimed that pyjamas competes with silverlight and with adobe AIR / Flash , and it 's not to do with pyjamas " per se " : pyjamas is just a " leveraging " technology to get at the underlying power of the web engines .
( the claim _does_ however grate against a lot of egos , somewhat understandably , and with a non-existent " marketing dept " there 's not a lot that can be done about that ) .
so let me go over these points again , now wrt pyjs / pyjd " in the frame " so to speak .
> - Pythonic yep it is .
definitely .
part of the reason why pyjamas is 1/10th the size of GWT is thanks to the dynamic nature of python .
another reason is that we simply left out vast tracts of GWT code ( such as thousands of lines of GWT " internationalisation " support ) but that 's another story .
> -
The default GUI ( so it replaces Tkinter ) can't answer that one .
> -
It has the support of the majority of the Python community _definitely_ can't answer that one :) but i'm betting that , without reading them , a good 80 % of the 222 - long discussion so far is in response to this point :) > -
Simple and obvious to use for simple things pyjamas is blindingly so .
helloworld in 5 - 6 lines , just like pygtk .
async event handling and well - defined event - receiving functions .
etc. etc. > - Comprehensive , for complicated things yep .
you only have to look at the GWTCanvas examples or the GChart 2D graph / barchart source code ( 19,000 lines ! ) to see how " simple " DOM manipulation can turn into comprehensive applications .
> - Cross -platform definitely .
cross-platform , cross - widget - set _and_ cross - browser , because , last resort , if users refuse to install pyjamas - desktop , you can always compile the exact same application to javascript and run it in every single major modern web browser .
... can pygtk2 , pyqt4 , TkInter or wxWidgets claim to be cross - browser ?
can you recompile a pygtk2 or pyqt4 application and run it in a web browser , as javascript ( actually , there _is_ a reimplementation of pygtk2 for pyjamas , it was a GSoC 2007 experiment - about 20 - 30 % completed port of pygtk2 widgets , but it proved the point ) > - Looks good ( to be defined ) that 's up to , and entirely under the control of , the developer .
i.e. it 's up to the developer to make use of CSS styles and in some instances bits of HTML to " prettify " the application , and perhaps makes use of some of the more decorative panels ( DecoratorPanel , CaptionPanel ) in combination with some round - curved images and associated CSS stylesheet .
other than that , the application " looks as good as " the underlying web browser engine " default " styles .
which can be pretty boring , but that 's life , and it's why CSS stylesheets exist .
which normal desktop GUI widget sets of course can't make use of .
> -
As small as possible in its default form pyjamas is pretty damn small , and it 's pure python .
there 's no c code involved in the actual pyjamas codebase [ and probably never will be ] .
the main UI library used to be one 4,000 - line file : i got fed up with that and split it into 70 separate modules ( one per widget / class ) and the repetition of the license text increased it to 6,500 lines (! ) .
since that time , about a year ago , the UI code has expanded to about 9,000 lines , with the addition of some GWT - ported widgets , contributed by users as GWT itself has developed .
the pyjd DOM " wrapper " technology ( which is responsible for creating a window and firing up the users ' app under each of the three pyjd ports ) is a total of 4,000 lines , but you do n't need to know anything about that : it 's just a " tool " .
i mention it out of sheer fascination / horror as to how to leash and tame a behemoth ( such as a W3C DOM compliant browser engine ) .
the pyjs compiler used to be 1200 lines , and is now 4,000 - but again , it 's a specialist " tool " that has _nothing_ to do with the UI toolkit itself : you just use it , just as you use " gcc " and do n't include " gcc " itself as part of your application .
so , i hope that i'm steering you away from considering creating yet another python GUI widget set , and i leave you with this irony : the pyjamas desktop ports , thanks to their browser engines , actually use " raw " Win32 GDI in the case of the MSHTML port ; GTK in the case of the xulrunner port ; and GTK again in the case of the pywebkitgtk port .
there _is_ a pywebkitqt4 experimental port as well but the DOM bindings to pywebkitqt4 are virtually non-existent : you have to actually use and execute javascript code - fragments ( from python * shudder * , * quiver * ) and try to prise the resultant bit of DOM out of the JS engine 's cold , dead fingers , and create a proxy class to nurture it back to life in the python world .
but , as far as pyjamas developers are concerned , all that is completely irrelevant : you just " get on with it " .
l. p.s. come along to http://europython.eu 19 -24 july 2010 , birmingham , UK .
The NYT has a pretty good article about the " mystery " of Europe mega toxic loans , which amount to $ 2.6 trillion just to Greece , Spain and Portugal , in that all attempts to find out just who is on the hook for all this debt have apparently yielded no results .
We disagree : this is a topic that has been beaten to death before on ZH , and it is all too well known that France and Germany will go bust overnight if PIIGS debt is allowed to be marked even halfway to market pro forma for governmental bailouts , on the banks ' balance sheets .
Throw in Austria and Italy if the Hungarian crisis ( amusingly , the Hungarian government is now scrambling to undo the harm it caused with its fast and loose words of caution last week , but too late - it has now lost all credibility ) spreads to Eastern Europe , and the mystery is solved .
But at least the NYT has some pretty charts .
As for the NYT 's message , here is the gist :
The problem is , alas , that no one — not investors , not regulators , not even bankers themselves — knows exactly which banks are sitting on the biggest stockpiles of rotting loans within that pile .
And doubt , as it always does during economic crises , has made Europe ’s already vulnerable financial system occasionally appear to seize up .
Early last month , in an indication of just how dangerous the situation had become , European banks — which appear to hold more than half of that $ 2.6 trillion in debt — nearly stopped lending money to one another .
“ The marketplace knows very little about where the real risks are parked , ” says Nicolas Véron , an economist at Bruegel , a research organization in Brussels .
“ That is exactly the problem .
As long as there is no semblance of clarity , trust will not return to the banking system . ”
Limited disclosure and possibly spotty accounting have been long - voiced concerns of analysts who follow European banks .
Though most large publicly listed banks have offered information about their exposure — Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt says it holds 500 million euros in Greek government bonds and no Spanish or Portuguese sovereign debt — there has been little disclosure from the hundreds of smaller mortgage lenders , state - owned banks and thrift institutions that dominate banking in countries like Germany and Spain .
Depfa , a German bank that is now based in Dublin , is one of the few second - tier European banking institutions that have offered detailed disclosures about their financial wherewithal , and its stark troubles may be emblematic of those still hidden on other banks ’ books .
Despite boasting as recently as two years ago of its “ very conservative lending practices , ” Depfa , which caters primarily to governments , has flirted with disaster .
It narrowly avoided collapsing in late 2008 until the German government bailed it out , and today its books are still laden with risk .
DEPFA and its parent , Hypo Real Estate Holding , a property lender outside Munich , have 80.4 billion euros in public - sector debt from Greece , Spain , Portugal , Ireland and Italy .
The amount was first disclosed in March but did not draw much attention outside Germany until last month , when investors decided to finally try to tally how much cross - border lending had gone on in Europe .
There is much more , but it is largely irrelevant .
The IMF on Thursday said it can not possibly bail out all of Europe , absent another infusion of $ 300 + billion , and as the EU itself is insolvent , the debate of a European " game over " is not one of if but when .
Unfortunately , the US is in far worse shape than all of Europe combined , but is much better equipped at dealing with a population so illiterate in financial matters that it can keep pulling the wool over the eyes of the sheeple years after the EMU is finished .
Furthermore , the longer investors stay glued to their television watching the storming of the Athens parliament first , and soon many more , the longer the US debt catastrophe can stay out of sight and out of mind .
Alas , once the European crisis is " dealth with " one way or another , the bored bond vigilantes will inevitably turn their eyes to the US , as Roubini recently predicted .
It is all now just a matter of time , and how fast the kleptocracy can load up their vaults in various non-extradition countries with non-dilutable assets before it is all let loose .
GOP lawmaker : Hezbollah coming across border from Mexico
In a recent debate , Arizona Governor Jan Brewer said that most undocumented immigrants are coming to the US to bring drugs .
NBC ’s David Gregory asked Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) Sunday if he agreed .
“ No , ” McCain said .
“ I think that thereÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a large number , and I think she ’s right in that the drug cartel ’s movement has dramatically increased .
Twenty - three thousand Mexicans have been killed in the last three years in Mexico . ”

In the wake of Arizona ’s controversial law allowing police to stop and demand ID from anyone they suspect is an illegal immigrant , many supporters have been casting the issue as one of national security .
During a debate with political opponent Matt Jette , Gov. Brewer said that the “ majority ” of undocumented immigrants “ are not coming here to work .
They are coming here and theyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re bringing drugs .
And theyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re doing drop houses and theyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re extorting people and theyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re terrorizing the families .
That is the truth , Matt .
That is the truth . ”
Meanwhile , North Carolina Republican House Rep. Sue Myrick sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano declaring that members of the Iranian - backed militant group Hezbollah are crossing the border from Mexico into the United States .
Myrick said Hezbollah may be planning “ Israel - like car bombings of Mexican / USA border personnel or National Guard units , ” TalkingPoints Memo ’s Justin Elliott reports .
While Myrick did not appear to have evidence of this , she attributed her belief to several factors , among them the presence of Farsi - language tattoos on gang members in US prisons , and the fact that the US - Mexican border geographically resembles the area around Israel and the Palestinian territories .

“ Well trained officials are beginning to notice the tattoos of gang members in prisons are being written in Farsi .
We have typically seen tattoos in Arabic , but Farsi implies a Persian influence that can likely be traced back to Iran and its proxy army , Hezbollah , ” Myrick wrote .
Hezbollah is a Lebanese - based organization , and its membership consists mostly of Arabic speakers , not Farsi speakers .
“ Former intelligence officials have pointed to the terrain that makes up our border , especially in the San Diego border sector , as a reason why drug cartels have been partnering with Hezbollah , ” she wrote .
She cited “ intelligence officials ” as saying that “ the drug cartels , in an effort to dig larger and more effective tunnels , are employing the expertise of Hezbollah . ”

Build Liberty From the Ground Up
Think about what you can do in your personal life to expand freedom – then act on this knowledge .
– Individual Liberty –
A free society is founded on individual liberty .
We have complete liberty when each person is free to do whatever he wills , so long as he does not infringe on the equal freedom of another .
The individual ’s freedom should not be interfered with until he interferes with another person ’s freedom .
Liberty is equal : each person has full authority over her own life , and no person has authority over another .
One may influence or persuade others , or agree to have someone take charge of a task .
But there can be no social ranking that claims one person inherently owes obedience to another .
As much as possible , individuals should have equal decision making power in organizations they choose to work in .
All relations , from the most intimate to the most elaborate , must be based on consent .
People must be free to opt out of any social arrangement , and force can only be used against people who forcibly interfere with the liberty of others .
– Personal Liberty –
Creating a free world begins on the most personal level .
If you want to be effective at increasing freedom , your daily activity should be consistent with the principles of individual liberty .
Good people can slip into bad habits .
This does not mean they must be condemned to forever be an enemy of freedom .
But it does mean that self - improvement is necessary .
When you change yourself , you change the part of the world that you have the most influence over .
And your changes will influence those you are in contact with .
Ask :
– How well am I living up to the principles of liberty ?
– Do I insist on relating and organizing on a consensual basis that respects individual dignity and desires ?
– Do I obey others , or do I obey myself ?
– Do I act as if other people should decide the purpose of my life ?
– Do I act like other individuals should live for me , not for themselves ?
– Do I act like my political , social , or economic rank entitles me to be obeyed ?
– Do I hold individuals to different standards because of the categories that other people have thrust upon them – race , gender , sexual preference , immigrant status , etc ?
– What can I do in my current situation to expand freedom ?
Should I put myself in a different situation ?
Attitude is very important in working toward liberty .
Are you oppressed ?
Or are you engaged in conflict with people who wish to oppress you ?
Thinking that you are powerful and free may make it so .
Self - improvement is an everyday process .
But you can only start building a free world when you make a conscious effort to enact principles of individual liberty in your daily life .
– Those Who Obstruct Freedom –
Identifying opponents of freedom helps point the way to effective action .
Individuals who actively work for authority over other individuals are acting against freedom .
Individuals who actively work to eliminate authoritarian controls are friends of freedom or at least allies .
When freedom is obstructed , life is obstructed .
Individuals are denied the ability to pursue their desires and provide for each other , because their time and wealth are used up satisfying those who are privileged by power .
The use of resources and spaces are determined by the goals of the most dominant power structures , not by the needs and desires of individuals who do n’t have connections .
Monopolies created by political power cause inequality , deprivation , poverty , stress , and conformity far beyond what could exist in a free society .
Political authority ultimately creates death and destruction as politicians seek to forcibly take what is n’t theirs in order to expand their power and help their cronies .
The most dangerous enemies of freedom use force , command others to use force , or hold great influence over how force is used , in order to keep power structures intact .
They could be senators , lobbyists , soldiers , government or private police , or common thugs .
Their actions should be recognized as crimes against individuals .
Those who act to strengthen authoritarian power structures are also acting against freedom .
They might be bureaucrats , corporate or union bosses , teachers , or big developers , but they really could be anyone who applauds the expansion of government power or cheers on bullying , exploitation , or other authoritarian behavior .
The key is not what labels a person has , but what they actually do .
Are they as an individual acting towards liberty , or towards tyranny ?
Are they working to control others , or working to eliminate controls ?
The most powerful enemies of freedom could be called “ the ruling class ” or “ the political class . ”
They rule over others , or they prosper through politics , not through production .
The word “ class ” is used to classify individuals according to what they do , not to box individuals into unavoidable categories .
Conspiracies do happen , but this section is not based on conspiracy theory .
It is based on examining human action : people who value controlling others more than they value a free society will act to control others .
They often work together to do so , but they are prone to struggling against each other for dominance .
Governments are not established to provide for the common welfare and common defense .
They are established to help politicians expand their power at the expense of other people .
Governments protect political power , not individuals .
Those who govern try to keep the populace under control by cultivating a commonality of interest between rulers and ruled , by co-opting and monopolizing programs and resources , and by using force against people who step out of line .
Each person who acts against freedom should be approached differently in terms of his individual position .
Perhaps it will only take a little persuasion to turn him into an advocate of freedom .
Certainly , nobody is born with a coherent philosophy of liberty , and without that it is easy to be influenced into acting badly .
But be cautious : they do not consider a free world to be in their interests .
Reach out , but do n’t reach so far that you fall over .
Keep your feet planted in the principles of individual liberty .
In general , it is acceptable to use force against those would - be oppressors who rely on force , and acceptable to use social and economic pressure against those who rely on social and economic pressure .
But it is optimal to keep an eye toward integrating people into a future of liberty .
And maximizing liberty requires more than arranging superior force against any current regime .
It requires overturning bad ideas and building anti-authoritarian power that helps people become ungovernable .
– Network Against Authority –
More people will realize it is in their interests to turn away from authoritarian power structures when they experience a thriving revolutionary society .
Enabling this means building networks that help people live apart from authority and in opposition to authority .
Talk to others about individual liberty , what it means to you and how you can apply it in daily life .
From relationships at work , school , neighborhoods , organizations , or social networks , little revolutions can spring .
Understanding a common interest in liberation can breed solidarity .
When people realize that supporting other revolutionaries means supporting revolution , mutual aid can develop .
In practice this can mean : supporting people arrested or fined , helping with medical bills , providing for mutual security , helping each other maintain housing , sharing skills and tools , making deals with striking workers instead of with their bosses , or finding ways to give discounts to those working toward freedom .
Relationships among revolutionaries should be based on seeking mutual interest , not based on seeking advantage over other individuals .
The idea of “ counter - economics ” centers on analyzing and building an economy that works counter to the established economy of state power and privilege .
“ Engaging in counter - economics ” is one way to think of taking steps to live a freer life now .
It can mean building networks of trade that create revolutionary power .
It can mean creating an alternative currency .
It can mean selling goods that the state prohibits .
It can mean reducing official income and monetary transactions so it is harder for the state to take what you create .
Or it can mean taking your business into the underground economy and avoiding taxes .
Each individual must figure out the best way for herself to advance toward freedom .
It is valuable to build independence from authoritarian power structures .
Basic needs like food , housing , medical care , education , and trade can be taken out of authoritarian control .
Identify as a free individual , not as a label that would - be rulers would like to tag you with .
Maximizing individual freedom must be the primary goal of any political action .
Any form of social organization can become oppressive if the demand for liberty is not strong enough .

– Revolution –
Overturning rulers is often a necessary step in the evolution toward greater liberty .
When liberty prevails , each individual will rule his own life and nobody else ’s .
This is liberty , equality , anarchy , consensual society .
Nobody rules over another .
Understand and implement the principles of liberty .
Work toward freedom in daily life .
Withdraw allegiance and support from authoritarian structures .
Build the new world in the shell of the old .
Build “ counter - power ” – that which helps empower people to resist outside authority and live free .
This could mean a radical union , a trade or gifting network , a group of people holding cops accountable with video cameras , a community militia , or any other consensual organization that makes it easier for individuals to resist people trying to control their lives .
Subvert the messages , organizations , and institutions of would - be oppressors .
Turn authoritarian things into libertarian things .
Engineer mass defections from authoritarian structures .
That which is pulled from authority combines with the free world built from below .
Keep individual freedom , equal liberty , and consensual relations primary goals .
Work against anything that restricts the freedom of any individual who did not interfere with another ’s liberty .
Help individuals liberate themselves so they may find their own way to flourish , find their own relation to the rest of the universe , and create the best world possible by living the best lives possible .
“ If a thousand men were not to pay their tax - bills this year , that would not be a violent and bloody measure , as it would be to pay them , and enable the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood .
This is , in fact , the definition of a peaceable revolution , if any such is possible .
If the tax - gatherer , or any other public officer , asks me , as one has done , “ But what shall I do ? ” my answer is , “ If you really wish to do anything , resign your office . ”
When the subject has refused allegiance , and the officer has resigned his office , then the revolution is accomplished .
But even suppose blood should flow .
Is there not a sort of blood shed when the conscience is wounded ? ” – Henry David Thoreau , “ Civil Disobedience ”
I 've been fairly hard on Columbia , Missouri Police Chief Ken Burton since video emerged of his department 's SWAT raid on a marijuana offender .
But to be fair , though the reforms he proposed missed the most important point — the misapplication of force in using SWAT raids on people suspected of nonviolent crimes — he has at least shown more concern than other police officials in similar situations .
And I suspect even the reforms he did propose were n't popular within his department .
The video below , courtesy of the Marijuana Policy Project blog , shows Burton may be coming around on the foolishness of marijuana prohibition in general .
Money quote :
" I applaud your efforts , " he told a reporter who asked about campaigns to change marijuana laws .
" If we could get out of the business [ of going after marijuana offenders ] , I think there would be a lot of police officers that would be happy to do that . "
Last week , Burton announced that all of his officers involved in the now - infamously YouTubed marijuana raid have been cleared of any wrongdoing .
As I wrote a couple weeks ago , that 's to be expected .
The raid was routine , and consistent with the law , not just in Columbia but in much of the country .
It 's the law that 's the problem .
The MPP blog also points to an interesting quote by D.C. Metro PD Assistant Chief Peter Newsham that 's not quite as explicit , but seems to acknowledge that the only dangerous elements to marijuana are due to it being illegal .
TAMPA , Fla . --
Hall of Famer Steve Yzerman is the Tampa Bay Lightning 's new general manager , taking on the task of rebuilding a franchise that 's fallen on hard times since winning its only Stanley Cup championship six years ago .
The former Detroit Red Wings captain and executive was introduced Tuesday as Brian Lawton 's replacement during a press conference at St. Pete Times Forum .
Lawton and coach Rick Tocchet were fired April 12 .
" This is a long - term project for me .
I believe building a Stanley Cup caliber team takes time and there will be many decisions , some lengthy , that will be made over the course of time , " Yzerman said .
" There is no easy fix .
I do n't sit up here with the notion that there is a magic wand I can wave and make changes and we 're a Stanley Cup contender .
I plan on making the Lightning better for the upcoming season , but the long - term goal is to make this team a perennial contender . "
Since retiring in 2006 , Yzerman has worked as a vice president for the Red Wings , the only team he played for during a 22 - year career in which he scored 692 goals , amassed 1,755 points and was part of three Stanley Cup winners .
The 45 - year - old recently led Canada to men's Olympic hockey gold as Hockey Canada executive director at the Vancouver Games .
Tampa Bay 's new owner , Jeff Vinik , fired Lawton and Tocchet after the struggling franchise missed the playoffs for the third straight season .
The Lightning went 34 -36 - 12 this season and were 53 - 69 - 26 in just under two seasons under Tocchet .
Detroit owners Mike and Marian Ilitch congratulated Yzerman but said his departure was hard on them , the team and the city .
" Steve Yzerman ... has been synonymous with the Red Wings and Hockeytown for as long as most of us can remember , " they said in a statement .
" We drafted him as a young and shy 18 year old -- just a year after we bought the team -- and he has been part of it all : the ups and downs , highs and lows , the [ pStanley ]
Cups , the celebrations , really everything Red Wings over the last 27 years . "
Yzerman was not going to get a chance to be Detroit 's GM soon because two executives above him , Ken Holland and Jim Nill , are expected to sign long - term deals .
" After talking to many people throughout the league , I came to the conclusion that Steve was the person to bring a winning culture back to this team , " Vinik said .
" Steve is in charge of all hockey - related decisions , " the owner added .
" He does answer to me , but I trust his judgment and his insight . "
Many felt Yzerman would be reluctant to leave the only club he had worked for , however he relished a chance to be a GM and had conceded he might have to leave Detroit to get that opportunity .
" I have mixed emotions , both good and sad , " said Red Wings senior vice president Jim Devellano , who drafted Yzerman fourth overall in 1983 and watched him lead the franchise 's turnaround on the ice .
" He 's been such an integral part of the Red Wings for 27 years , first as a player and then as a front - office person , " Devellano added .
" I 'm sad for us , but happy for him to get this wonderful opportunity . "
Pregnant women living close to mobile - phone base stations are at no greater risk of having children who develop cancer , researchers have found .
The first study to examine the effects of the 81,000 phone masts across Britain on mothers - to - be has found no link with early childhood cancers such as leukaemia , which is thought to be triggered in the womb , and brain tumours .
The study , by researchers at Imperial College , London , is the most detailed yet of the claimed link between phone masts and childhood cancer .
Reports of clusters of cancer cases among families living close to the masts led to demands that the masts be moved .
But the numbers involved have been too small , and the risks of a biased selection of cases too high , to draw firm conclusions .
Paul Elliott , professor of epidemiology and public health medicine , said the big advantage of the new study was that it was nationwide and not focused on areas where there was concern about cancer risk .
" We looked at the exposure of the child at the birth address and nine months before , " he said .
" So we were effectively looking at the exposure of the foetus .
Within the limitations of the study , these results are reassuring . "
The increase in mobile phone use – from 9 million handsets in 1997 to 74 million in 2007 – has raised worries about the effects of exposure to low - frequency radiation .
Several studies , including the Interphone study involving more than 10,000 people from 13 countries that was published last month , have found no damaging health effects from mobile phones themselves .
Public anxiety about transmitters has grown despite the level of individual exposure from transmitters being much lower than from mobile phones .
For the study , Professor Elliott and colleagues identified almost 1,400 children aged up to four who were registered with leukaemia or a brain or nervous - system tumour between 1999 and 2001 .
Then the distance of each patient 's birth address from the nearest base station was estimated .
The authors admit the study examined only early childhood cancer and not other potential health effects said to be linked with mobile phones .
However they concluded : " The results of our study should help to place any future reports of cancer clusters near mobile - phone base stations in a wider public - health context . "
John Bithell , of the Childhood Cancer Research Group at the University of Oxford , said doctors should reassure parents not to worry about the masts .
" Moving away from a mast , with all its stresses and costs , cannot be justified on health grounds in the light of the current evidence , " he said .
There was also no evidence that has shown any biological effects of mobile phone radiation that " might lead us to worry about its health effects , " he added .
The radio waves produced by mobile phones are non-ionising , unlike ionising X - rays which are known to cause cancer .
They are also not strong enough to damage DNA molecules .
So there is no known mechanism according to which mobile phone radiation can cause brain tumours .
The study , published in the British Medical Journal , is the latest to exonerate mobile phones , and the masts that transmit their signals , of health damaging effects .
But researchers cannot prove a negative , and say that there is no evidence of a cancer risk .
It remains possible that future studies , conducted over a longer period or in a different way , may reveal a hitherto unsuspected danger .
One limitation is that mobile phones have only been in mass use for about 15 years .
Mobile phones : Myth & reality
* The biggest risk posed by mobile phones is to people driving cars who may be distracted by them , even if they are using the devices in hands - free mode .
* There is no reason to suppose that mobile phones have any adverse effects .
But children are more vulnerable to agents such as cigarette smoke , lead and radiation and the same could concievably be true of mobile phone signals .
* It is impossible to rule out the possibility that cancer caused by exposure to mobile phones could appear in a few years .
Most cancers take longer than 10 years to develop .
* However , there is no evidence to suggest that the use of mobile phones has biological effects on cells .
The radio waves produced by the handsets are non-ionising , unlike ionising X - rays which are known to cause cancer .
* Worries about the effects of mobile phones on the brain and on biological processes , indicated in some earlier research , have been tested and found to be baseless .
Sharks are already scary enough , what with their razory teeth and evolutionarily honed hunting mojo .
But this monster has a retractable jaw .
A retractable effing jaw .
You 're welcome , nightmares .
The only thing keeping the Mitsukurina Owstoni , as it's known in its native Japan , from taking up permanent residence in my fear cabinet is that this incredibly rare — once even thought to be extinct — shark is only 1.3 meters long .

Jack Conway , the Kentucky 's Attorney General and the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate , not only delivers a devastating critique of Rand Paul , but makes the case for his own candidacy , saying that unlike Paul , he 's not interested in being " the darling of the tea party " -- he 's " interested in standing up for the people of Kentucky . "
The interview , which aired Friday afternoon on CNN , is worth every minute :
Conway took issue with Rand Paul 's position on whether racial discrimination should be legal in businesses like public restaurants , calling Paul 's interview on The Rachel Maddow Show twenty of the most painful minutes he'd ever seen on television .
He also rejected Paul 's opposition to the Americans with Disabilities Act , calling it " callous " and questioning why Paul would support discrimination against disabled veterans .
Conway repeatedly hammered Paul for consistently siding with big business against the interests of ordinary people .
Conway singled out Paul 's defense of BP , saying he disagreed with Paul 's assertion that it was " un-American " for President Obama to criticize BP and saying that it was crucial to hold companies like BP accountable when they cause great damage .
If you have any doubt that we can win this campaign , you 've got to watch this video .
Conway was outstanding .
He kicked ass and took no prisoners -- and he did it while inspiring confidence .
After you 're done watching it , please step up and help him out .
If Jack Conway can make his case to the people of Kentucky , he 's gonna ' win this thing .
And we 're not just going to have a Democrat representing Kentucky in the U.S. Senate , we 're going to have a good one .
American convicted of murdering British student Meredith Kercher testified that she had been beaten into admitting she was at crime scene
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Amanda Knox , the American convicted of murdering the British student Meredith Kercher is due to appear in court again tomorrow , accused of slandering the Italian police by testifying that she had been beaten into admitting she was at the crime scene .
The start of her pre-trial hearing is one of several developments due to revive controversy surrounding a case that appeared to have been settled last December when Knox and her Italian former boyfriend , Raffaele Sollecito , were found guilty of the killing .
Knox 's parents , who repeated her claims of police ill - treatment to the media , also face indictment proceedings for the same offence on 6 July .
The 22 - year - old University of Washington student 's appeal is expected to be heard in the autumn , along with that of Sollecito .
In the meantime , judges will be considering a final appeal by the third person convicted of the killing , Ivory Coast - born Rudy Guede .
Kercher , 21 , from Coulsdon in Surrey , was found semi-naked with her throat slashed in a house in the central Italian city of Perugia in November 2007 .
She had been sharing a flat with Knox while she and the American studied at Perugia 's university for foreigners .
Knox , who was jailed for 26 years last December , could see her sentence increased to 32 years if found guilty of the slander charge , which has been laid by the prosecutor who secured her conviction for murder .
Her parents risk the same penalty of a fine and / or a prison sentence of between two and six years .
At her trial , Knox twice gave evidence that she had been coerced during an all - night interrogation after the murder .
At the end of her questioning , she signed a statement saying she had been in the house while Kercher was murdered and had covered her ears to drown out the screams .
She told the court the police had slapped her round the head when she insisted on a version of the facts which did not match theirs .
In Italian , she added : " I 'm sorry .
But it 's true . "
Twice asked by the judge to identify the police officers she claimed had hit her , she was unable to do so .
Police witnesses and interpreters denied her allegations .
Her father , Curt Knox , said in January that the new charges against her constituted " harassment " .
The judge for the pre-trial hearing , Claudia Matteini , also oversaw the investigation of Kercher 's murder .
Defence sources said unsuccessful attempts had been made to get her to stand down .
Under Italian law , both defence and prosecution are allowed up to two attempts to change the outcome of a trial , the first of which can be on the evidence .
In April , both sides filed their appeals , with the prosecution seeking a life sentence for Knox , and lawyers for the American and Sollecito demanding their acquittal .
Knox 's US attorney , Theodore " Ted " Simon , told the ABC television network afterwards that his team would produce a new witness to show Knox was not present when her roommate was murdered .
No forensic evidence linking her to the room in which Kercher was found dead has been discovered .
Nor has any motive been established .
In their written verdict , released in March , the judges said Knox killed Kercher " without planning , without any animosity or grudge against the victim " .

A Deus ex Machina ( pron : / diːəs ɛks mækɪnə / for Britons , / deɪuːs ɛks mɑːkɪnə / for Americans ; / deus eks maːkʰinaː / in the orginal Latin ) is when some new event , character , ability , or object solves a seemingly unsolvable problem in a sudden , unexpected way .
It 's often used as the solution to what is called " writing yourself into a corner , " where the problem is so extreme that nothing in the established setting suggests that there is a logical way for the characters to escape .
If a bomb is about to go off , someone finds a convenient bomb - proof bunker in easy reach .
If a protagonist falls off a cliff , a flying robot will suddenly appear to catch them .
A Million - to - One Chance of something occurring is accomplished by a bystander who did n't know what they were doing .
If The End of the World as We Know It is about to happen and nobody is able to stop it , it will be stopped thanks to some scientist 's otherwise useless invention .

The term is Latin for " god out of the machine " and originates in ancient Greek theater .
note the original classical Greek " theos ek mekhanikos " became " deus ex machina " through Latin translations of Greek literary criticism in the Renaissance .
It referred to scenes in which a crane ( machine ) was used to lower actors or statues playing a god or gods ( deus ) onto the stage to set things right , often near the end of the play .
In its most literal interpretation , this is when a godlike figure or power , with all the convenient power that comes with that , arrives to solve the problem .
A Divine Intervention need not always be a Deus ex Machina or the sole way this trope plays out however .
Note that there are a number of requirements for a sudden plot development to be a Deus ex Machina :

The concept eventually came back into vogue during the early years of the film industry thanks to The Hays Code .
Villains , and anyone else who did n't toe the moral line , were absolutely not allowed to get away with their crimes .
But , more often than not Evil Is Cool .
The solution was to let the bad guy be awesome for the duration of the movie , then drop a bridge on them in the last five minutes .
Remember , even the notorious Deus ex Machina can be pulled off .
Sudden resolutions are perfectly capable of leading to satisfying conclusions - see the entire " Rule Of X " series of tropes : Rule of Cool , Rule of Cute , Rule of Empathy , Rule of Fun , Rule of Funny , Rule of Romantic , Rule of Scary , Rule of Sexy ( for those ever - so - fun Deus Sex Machinas ) , Rule of Symbolism , and especially Rule of Drama .
Apparent Deus ex Machina also happen plenty in real life , given reality is far more complex and random than most fictionalized versions of it .

Myths & Religion
Classical Mythology : Funnily enough , there are many times in Greek Mythology where the gods and goddesses fail to do this all the way through ; they may do something which only partly rectifies the situation or has its own shortcomings to it .
Not all instances from classical mythology are subversions , though .
For example , at one point Hera offers her aid to the Argonauts to get them through .
In fact , the entire name of the trope came from the theatrical device used ( via a cherry - picker like machine ) in ancient Greek plays based on the Greeks ' myths .

While writing the first installment of The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , Douglas Adams found himself faced with a writer 's dilemma :
His characters had just gotten thrown out an airlock , and would pass out and die from lack of oxygen in 30 seconds , and it was so utterly improbable that another spaceship would come around within those 30 seconds to rescue them that to have had that happen would 've been nothing short of this trope .
This gave him the idea for the Infinite Improbability Drive .
The Quintessential Phase , which adapts Mostly Harmless , at its conclusion has the Babel Fish suddenly turn out to have an ability to teleport itself out of danger when facing certain death .
This was done to avert the Kill ' Em All ending of the book , and is naturally subject to liberal Lampshade Hanging when Arthur asks why it 's never come up before .
Roleplay
Tabletop Games
In Dungeons & Dragons , the high - level Cleric spell Miracle allows you to request intervention from your deity .
It costs experience points to use in that fashion , but other than that the only stated downside is that the deity might refuse .
In 5th Edition , Clerics can eventually gain a feature that lets them beseech their deity to offer assistance in their time of need .
The roll for it is very unlikely to succeed , but having a more limited but reusable version of the Wish spell is nothing to scoff at .
Fate of the Norns : Ragnarok allows player characters to ask a deity to help them in battle .
A sacrifice is performed , runes are drawn , and if the aforementioned deity is in a good mood , Deus ex Machina may occur .
However , if your prayer has angered it , the divine intervention will benefit your opponents !
In GURPS , a character can buy an Advantage called Serendipity , which allows one extremely fortunate event per game session to take place at the player 's discretion .
The Gizmos advantage is designed to let players imitate fictional characters like Batman and James Bond , as described above .
The parody RPG Ho L has the " Grace of God " pool , which players can put points in by rolling Critical Hits during the game .
If the character can not get out of a situation and has points in Grace of God , they can say " Praise Jesus " , which allows the DM to use any random , nonsensical , and / or inexplicable means they can think of to solve the character 's dilemma .
In the tongue - in - cheek RPG In Nomine Satanis / Magna Veritas , which is played with rolls of 3d6 , anyone rolling 111 means a direct and usually over - the - top divine intervention happens .
Which can be a very good thing if you 're playing an angel , and a very bad thing if you 're a demon .
And of course , a roll of 666 causes a direct satanic intervention .
Also , any angel can try to summon his archangel , and any demon can try to summon his demon prince .
And yes , it can work ...
If you 're lucky .
Magic :
The Gathering has the " Miracle " mechanic .
Cards with Miracle are all powerful , expensive spells .
However , if they 're the first card their owner draws in a turn , they can be immediately played for their ( deeply discounted )
Miracle cost , making them a sudden solution to many a hopeless scenario .
Lampshaded in Munchkin :
There 's a card called Deus Ex Machinegun that has the gods come down with a machine gun and kill all the monsters , take all the treasure , and make the combat just magically go away .
Shadowrun actually has a rule about this , called Hand Of God .
When a PC ends up in some sort of hopeless situation , the PC 's player can invoke the Hand Of God , having the GM save the PC via some form of Deus ex Machina .
There 's a catch , of course : it has a hefty experience - point cost , and it can only be used once per character .
In Spirit of the Century players may use their characters ' Aspects , a Declaration , or even certain Stunts to make an unlikely coincidence happen .
Players can also have gadgets and artifacts with undefined abilities , so you can decide that they do exactly what you want at the right moment ( of course , once you 've decided it stays that way at least until the end of the adventure )
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay and Dark Heresy have the Fate Points , which will unfailingly pull a character out of certain death and put them in a position where you are safe for the immediate moment .
For small stuff a Fate Point will turn a killing blow to a glancing one , cause the enemies to take you prisoner instead of killing you on the spot , or let you dodge that lethal fall pit , but it becomes one of these when , say , you 've just been killed by being spaced , caught inside a collapsing mine or building , or by having a daemon biting your head off .
This is Modus Operandi for the Legion of the Damned chapter of Space Marines in Warhammer 40,000 .
They appear without warning and aid beleaguered Imperial forces against the enemies of mankind , then disappear as soon as the battle is won just as suddenly as they came .
Notably , this is one that creeps out the Imperials something fierce .
Interestingly , one of the theories behind the Damned Legionnaires ' appearance is that they are extensions of the God -Emperor 's will .
Although he 's more like Deus IN Machina .
You know , the Golden Throne ?
An actual game mechanic in World of Synnibarr ( really ) .
If your character is on the verge of death with no hope of salvation , you actually get a dice roll to see if your patron deity turns up to haul your arse out of the fire .
For some Game Masters , this is going to happen eventually .
Whether it be a Total Party Kill where it should n't be , the players making a decision that turns out to be much worse than they could imagine , or other misadventure , a group of players will find themselves in a situation where the only way out is to basically cheat .
Some GMs will just rewrite the then - latest events , but for GMs who like to maintain the narrative , this may be the only way out .
Theatre
Toys
Happens quite a bit in BIONICLE , but three particular examples stand out :
In the final moments of the Bohrok - Kal arc , Tahu summons the Kanohi Vahi , which gives the Toa Nuva just enough time to defeat the Kal , who were literally only seconds away from victory .
There was no prior indication that Tahu had the Vahi ( though the novelization Makuta 's Revenge fixes this ) .
In the Toa Inika 's battle with Vezon , Jaller pulls out a unique Zamor Sphere that freezes Vezon in stasis when Vezon , who 's in the middle of a rage - induced Villainous Breakdown , attempts to inflict a Fate Worse than Death on Matoro , allowing the Inika to recover the Mask of Life .
Unlike the Vahi example , there was a scene of Axonn giving Jaller the sphere , however its power was never explained , note
The most Axonn says is that it's " for protection " which raises a lot of Fridge Logic .
In the Grand Finale Journey 's End arc , completely out of the blue , the Mask of Life creates a mystical set of Golden Armor for Tahu , which is capable of annihilating every single Rahkshi soldier and gaining all their abilities .
Granted , the Mask Of Life has done and created some pretty crazy things with its power before , but this is said to be a contingency plan of the Great Beings for if The Makuta ever rebelled .
It was never mentioned prior to this , and you 'd think it would 've activated a lot sooner if it supposed to be a fail - safe .
Visual Novels
In Super Danganronpa 2 , the characters are forced to make a Sadistic Choice : either A. " Graduate " , which would replace their memories of being the most dangerous terrorists alive who brought about the end of the world with the memories of the time they spent in the virtual world , reforming them and giving them hope for the future .
This , however , would release a malevolent Artificial Intelligence ( specifically that of their leader during their time as terrorists ) which would infect every person on the planet , essentially turning it into a world of nothing but copies of said leader , plunging the recovering world into a permanent state of blood , horror , and , most especially , despair .
Oh , and it would also trap a couple surviving characters from the first game inside the virtual world .
activate the " Forced Shutdown " , resulting in them losing all of the memories they 've acquired in the virtual world and revert back to being the horrible terrorists ( who are also physically mutilated ) , with a chance of being executed .
However , this would completely destroy said malevolent AI , saving the world .
They choose option B .
The ending of the game reveals that after getting out of the program , the characters decide to stay on the island and try to revive their friends who died inside the virtual world ( of which there is a very , very small chance of pulling off ) , peaceably seeing off said first - game characters who put them in the program in the first place .
Obviously , they did n't simply revert to their old terrorist selves ; either the Forced Shutdown replaced their terrorist memories with their virtual ones , or they now have both sets of memories .
Either way , there was no foreshadowing or explanation given for how or why the program would behave in such a way .

I did n’t know anything about homosexuality until I was in high school in the 1950s .
I knew what it was .
I had heard kids say “ Thursday ’s the day the fairies play , ” but I had no idea what was involved in homosexuality .
It was just something to be made fun of .
Certainly the newspaper had never published a picture like that of Tim Gill and Scott Miller holding hands on its front page .
But I worked after school and my boss was a very hip guy who had been a Woody Herman drummer .
One day just after I had seen a new movie , “ Bend of the River , ” with Rock Hudson , I mentioned that I thought Hudson was good in the movie and my boss said , “ He ’s queer , you know . ”
And he explained it to me .
I was stunned .
But if Bob said it , I knew it must be true .
For the next 33 years whenever his name came up I would mention that I knew Hudson was homosexual , most often to open disbelief .
He was married and played he - man roles .
How much has changed since those days .
Or has it ?
In 1971 I sat on a court - martial board , my first such experience , on the island of Guam .
A young enlisted man , traveling from the States to Vietnam had been in the transient enlisted quarters with an older sergeant , also en route .
The sergeant claimed that the younger man had touched his genitals while he was asleep .
The young man was detained on Guam while the sergeant made a statement and left the island .
The court martial was convened to decide the young man ’s fate .
It was clear to me from the outset that the airman was serious trouble .
Although he denied the charge and we had only the sergeant ’s statement to go on , the board quickly ruled that he should be dishonorably discharged as a homosexual .
I was not convinced and wrote a long and I hoped persuasive dissent I hoped could be used on appeal .
I thought the evidence insufficient in this case , but I also thought that it was strange that private behavior between consenting adults could be grounds for dismissal from the Air Force .
After all , Rock Hudson had just been a military officer in “ Ice Station Zebra . ”
Today we have “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell , ” which was supposed to be an improvement , but in fact if a case such as the one on Guam almost 40 years ago occurred today the outcome will be exactly the same .
And we have people who think that a picture of two happy people holding hands on the front page of the Denver Post enjoying the fruits of their hard work and philanthropy represent the moral decay of our country because they happen to love each other but are n’t heterosexual .
Why is it that we talk about freedom and individual rights but act to restrict freedom and individual rights ?
We say we want government to leave us alone , but we ask for laws to prevent women from control of their bodies .
We say we want government to leave us alone but we ask for laws to punish homosexuals because we think they ’re immoral .
We say we want to protect freedom of speech and the right to protest but we ask for an amendment to the Constitution to prevent burning the flag .
We say we want lower taxes but we complain about streets not being plowed .
We say we want better education but we demonstrate and ask for lower taxes and vouchers to pay for private schooling for our children .
So how far have we come in the past 60 years to loving thy neighbor as thyself ?
Apparently not very far .

Into the jaws of hate : Soldiers ' parade marred by Muslim extremists and far - Right
Screaming hate and brandishing vile placards , Muslim extremists and far - Right groups clashed yesterday in ugly scenes that marred a parade by soldiers .
Around 40 members of a group called Muslims Against the Crusades ( MAC ) arrived with inflammatory banners featuring slogans such as ' Butchers return ' and ' What are you dying for ?
£ 18 k ' .
They were soon confronted by 100 people , some wearing English Defence League T - shirts , who shouted ' scum ' and ' Muslim bombers off our streets ' .
Clashes : Police hold back Muslim protesters as they trade insults with English Defence League members while soldiers take part in a homecoming parade in Barking , Essex
The Muslim protesters shouted ' murderers ' as troops from the Royal Anglian Regiment paraded through Barking
Police , who had received intelligence warning of trouble at the march in Barking , Essex , separated the groups behind barriers on opposite sides of the road .
But violence flared after 200 soldiers from 1st Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment - who lost five men in a recent tour of Afghanistan and had been granted freedom of the borough - marched past thousands of well - wishers .
MAC supporters shouted slogans such as ' murderers , murderers ' and ' British troops go to hell ' , while the mainly white crowd opposite , some of whom are believed to have been BNP supporters , threw frozen pork sausages and chanted ' scum ' and ' Allah , Allah , who the f*** is Allah ? '
The anti-MAC contingent then stormed the barriers and traded punches before around 100 officers , including some on horseback , broke up the mob .
The clashes came little over a year after Muslim extremists screamed ' baby killers ' and ' rapists ' at soldiers from 2nd Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment parading through Luton after a tour of duty in Iraq .
Members of the public who travelled to Barking yesterday to cheer the troops said they were ' disgusted ' by what happened .
Police lead away the protesters from the Muslim Against the Crusade Group as they face jeers from English Defence League members
The homecoming ceremony was delayed by an hour after far right protesters hurled frozen sausages at the Muslim group
Charlene Byrne , 24 , whose boyfriend Lance Corporal Scott Hardy was killed in an explosion near Musa Qala on March 16 , said : ' They should never have been allowed to hijack this .
Not everyone supports what 's happening in Afghanistan - but they should n't take it out on the soldiers . '
Alex Mitchelson , 18 , whose brother has completed two tours of Afghanistan , said : ' He would been disgusted by what happened here today .
I had Muslim protesters racially abusing me as I walked by .'
The leader of Barking and Dagenham Council recently wrote to Home Secretary Theresa May asking her to ban MAC because he feared its extremist propaganda could cause violence .
Two men were arrested after police intervened during the violent clashes
Liam Smith acted after MAC posters about the protest , showing a bomber bursting through a flag of St George , appeared on the town 's war memorial .
Previous leaflets depicted British soldiers beside a bloody puddle in the shape of a skull .
Mr Smith said : ' We do n't want these people with their hate - filled agenda in our borough . '
The MAC members - one of whom allegedly spat at a soldier - left after police gave them safe passage to Barking underground station by forming a human wall .
One of the organisers , Abu Abbas , said : ' The protest is not about the Anglian Regiment but all occupations in Muslim lands .
They have gone over and killed civilians .
We can not accept this .'
High Hopes for Löw & His Young Talent : Germany 2010
German coach Joachim Löw is a tactical innovator who can use several systems to suit different situations .
They are essentially similar systems , just variations on a theme , based around the 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation which he used successfully in Euro 2008 .
The German team is solid , and impressively conceded just 5 goals in qualification for South Africa 2010 , losing no games .
They are high achievers , reaching the Semi-finals of the World Cup in 2006 , and then the Final of the Euro 2008 tournament , where they lost 1 - 0 to an excellent Spain side .
The squad that Löw has named is very young , an average age of 24.96 yrs , but this is in some way representative of the wealth of talented young players in Germany .
There is no doubt that the side will miss the influence of 33 year old Michael Ballack , who would have been captain were it not for a late injury with Chelsea .
A lack of experience is the main problem for the team when playing on a stage as grand as the World Cup , but the young players are very good , Mesut Özil , 20 , Toni Kroos , 20 , and Marko Marin , 21 are all fantastic attacking players .
After beating Bosnia 3 - 1 in their most recent friendly Löw claimed that the side needed just ‘ fine tuning ’ , and such an organised coach is likely to have the players dancing to the right tune when they come up against Group D comprising Australia , Ghana and Serbia .
Pressing with the 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 : A 30 Metre rule
The formation is a flexible 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 , but well drilled , and looks to stifle opposition passing in midfield , using high pressing to squeeze the play .
With the ball the team will try to counter - attack rapidly , and use the channels overload the opposing team .
Germany playing a high line in defence , pressing in a style almost Arrigo Sacchi-esque , as Löw wants no more than 30 metres between the forwards and defence .
When in possession the fullbacks push forward , mainly through Phillip Lahm , who looks to attack at any opportunity .
As with any high line this tactic does leave space to be exploited behind the defence , and pace is not abundant in the German defence .
The high line in defence allows the midfield to cover a relatively smaller area of ground , operating somewhere between a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 and a 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 .
In reality the formation is fluid , but consists of two central players who start slightly deeper , and three advanced midfielders .
This is a very flexible but systematic midfield , which allows organised fluidity , depending on the game plan .
This is how the German pressing game looks on the pitch .
The four banks of players are cleary visible .
The back four bring up the rear , while the holding midfielders are marked blue , the attacking midfield yellow , and the lone forward in pink .
Defence
Michael Neuer of Schalke 04 is to play in goal , he had a good season with the German team who defied excpectations took the title to the last two games of the Bundesliga before finishing second to Bayern .
Neuer ’s teammate Heiko Westermann has been injured , and so it is likely that Arne Friedrich will play central defence , rather than right back , partnering Per Mertesacker .
If not him then Serdar Tasci also plays as centre back , for Stuttgart .
Phillip Lahm , the captain and a fantastic full back , plays as left or right back , and attacks and defends with ease .
Lahm is most likely to play as right back during the tournament , whilst Badstuber may get the nod for the left back slot .
The full backs overloading in the wide areas , can create space for the central players such as Özil , or attack by taking the ball themselves .
Lahm scored a wonderful goal running from deep in the recent friendly against Bosnia , and is the sort of experienced player who can change games .
Here Lahm ( red ) is allowed space to make the forward run as the attacking midfielders ( yellow ) and striker ( pink ) pull the Bosnian players away from him .
Lahm goes onto score a wonderful goal .
The midfield five are expected to play a high pressing game , but also to get forward in attack , the balance of players within the squad makes this possible .
Midfield pressing can be seen below , as four midfielders box in ( thin blue line ) the Bosnian players on the ball , keeping the pressure up , whilst the defence ( red ) can take a man each .
The central midfield pairing will be the young Sami Khedira and experienced Bastian Schweinsteiger .
Ballack ’s late injury with Chelsea has opened the way for Khedira to really make his mark on the tournament .
Attacking Talents
The choices for the advanced positions are impressive ; Mesut Özil , Lukas Podolski , Piotr Trochowski , Toni Kroos and Thomas Müller all as options for this area .
Mesut Özil is arguably the most exciting of these players .
A left footer , he has the ability to shoot or play the crucial ball from forward positions .
Özil is undoubtedly one of the players to watch at this tournament , the young midfielder previously played for Schalke 04 , but now plays for Werder Bremen and has excelled in the Bundesliga .
His main role is to play as the link man , deeper than the striker ; the role of the creator is a perfect fit .
However , the left flank may see some interchange between Özil and Podolski , as they work together or switch positions , Podolski can also play either on the left or as the deep striker .
Indeed , it is here that the formation shows it fluidity .
The tactics allow the team to move to a more orthodox , traditional German 4 - 4 - 2 against weaker teams , or for the midfield to drop back into five when more pressure is required .
The wide men can drift inside , and interchange , with Podolski moving out left , and Özil coming through the centre .
The attacking menace on the left is also balanced when Lahm plays on the right , providing options on both flanks .
Podolski was acknowledged as a major talent after the last World Cup , but has spent several years in the wilderness .
He still possesses menacing pace , running at the defence , or shooting from long range .
Marin provides a useful back - up for Podolski , and expect him to get game time .
Müller or Trochowski can play on the right , and will link up well with Lahm in this position , either dragging the opposition full back around , creating space for Lahm to run into .
The attacking threat of the fullbacks is a crucial part of the German team , and Lahm is the most lethal from this position , so the balance on his flank is important .
The Lone Frontman
Playing a single forward limits the realistic options for Löw in attack .
Stefan Kiessling of Leverkusen is one of the more talented young attackers , but is not suited to hold the line on his own , like Müller he is more likely to be used in the withdrawn role occupied by Podolski or Özil .
As with teams like the Ivory Coast and Drogba the lone striker role requires experience and strength .
In this case Miroslav Klose is favoured for the starting role , but he has struggled with form , and this is the major concern for the German team .
Summary
The German team are one of the most exciting teams at the World Cup in terms of their young talent and array of attacking options .
Although Löw has been accused of defensive tactics the team has the ability to counter - attack quickly in incisive break - aways .
This might just be the beginning of a very successful national side .

Found via A Photo Editor , it ’s been a while since we ’ve featured stop motion on RVA .
Not that we do n’t love stop motion and time lapse , we ’ve just had a hard time finding something up to par recently .
I ’m sure we ’ve passed a ton of great stuff over , but digressing , this caught me eye quickly .
It ’s got tons of rich color and is well shot , although it ’s not as “ fun ” as I ’d expect a carnival piece to be .
Enjoy !

Commercially grown strawberries and tomatoes in California could start getting an unhealthy dose of the highly toxic fumigant methyl iodide , a known carcinogen , neurotoxin , and thyroid disruptor .
Among scientists ’ greatest concerns is the pesticide ’s ability to cause spontaneous abortion late in pregnancy .
So you might be surprised to hear that the California Department of Pesticide Regulation ( DPR ) recently issued a proposed decision to approve methyl iodide for use just months after a state - commissioned study warned that any agricultural use “ would result in exposures to a large number of the public and thus would have a significant adverse impact on the public health ” adding that , “ adequate control of human exposure would be difficult , if not impossible . ”
Strawberries are already near the top of the Environmental Working Group ’s Dirty Dozen ( 13 pesticides were detected on a single sample ) and recently , a high - level Presidential Cancer Panel recommended reducing chemical exposure by choosing fruits and vegetables grown without pesticides or chemical fertilizers ( i.e. , organic ) .
According to Pesticide Action Network North America ( PANNA ) , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) first registered methyl iodide as a pesticide in 2007 , despite a letter of protest [ PDF ] sent by prominent scientists and Nobel laureates to the agency saying that it ’s “ astonishing ” that the EPA is considering “ broadcast releases of one of the more toxic chemicals used in manufacturing into the environment . ”
EPA initially limited its approval , registering methyl iodide for just one year .
Then , during the final months of the Bush Administration , EPA quietly removed the time limits on its decision , effectively giving its manufacturer , Tokyo - based Arysta LifeScience , the largest privately - held pesticide producer on the planet , a green light for entry into the U.S. market .
Two years later , the EPA agreed to reopen its decision on methyl iodide , pending results of a California Scientific Review Committee .
The report , referenced above , was published on DPR ’s Web site in February and shortly thereafter , groups from around the country submitted a petition [ PDF ] to EPA to reopen their decision .
“ We are talking about a pesticide that ’s been linked to cancer and late - term miscarriages and , because it ’s a gas , easily drifts from the fields and into nearby communities , ” said Greg Loarie , an attorney for Earthjustice , which filed the petition .
“ Families who live and work near California ’s tomato , strawberry and other fields will be harmed if the state moves forward with this proposal .
There are safe alternatives to methyl iodide .
There is simply no reason to be subjecting Californians to such serious health risks . ”

Methyl iodide was developed as an alternative to the fumigant methyl bromide , a chemical which also has serious health implications and serious environmental impacts , and which is being phased out under the Montreal Protocol .
According [ PDF ] to PANNA , methyl iodide is by some measures four times as toxic as methyl bromide .
Despite this , the DPR has decided that further restrictions would make the pesticide safe enough for use .
These include requiring site - specific licenses , limiting exposure for workers and people living nearby to one - half and one - fifth , respectively , of the EPA ’s regulatory target levels , increasing buffer zones , and limiting the rate and extent to which the fumigant can be used .
“ The extra , health - protective use restrictions we are proposing … are much stricter than those imposed anywhere else in the United States , ” said DPR director Mary - Ann Warmerdam .
Still , the facts remain that methyl iodide is chemically reactive and highly volatile , making its application , even in the best of circumstances , clearly not in the public interest .
While the California Strawberry Growers Commission has yet to make its position known on the matter , Salinas Valley conventional strawberry growers apparently welcome the approval–strawberries were a $ 600 million , 10,449 - acre crop there in 2008 .
And just in case you thought this might be about whether you can still buy cheap strawberries at Costco , PANNA has put together a superb document , Profiles of Poison [ PDF ] , detailing the personal stories of individuals impacted by pesticides who are saying no to methyl iodide .
From the farmworker rushed to the hospital with severe chemical blistering and in need of respiratory support , to the pregnant mother who lost her baby only two days after being exposed to pesticide dew , these are the stories of people who have lived through the pain and trauma of pesticide poisoning and are speaking out to prevent others from suffering the same fate .
The DPR is accepting public comments on its proposal through June 14 , so unless you ’d like some more toxins with your strawberry smoothie , you might want to urge DPR to immediately withdraw the recommendation to approve its agricultural use .
CREDO has a one - step simple petition you can sign to make your opposition heard as well .
Chemtrails talking point inserted into CSI : NY

Monday , May 24th , 2010
A primetime CBS show that aired last week featured a notable example of so called “ propaganda placement ” , where a talking point is inserted into the plot in order to shape public perception , often at the behest of the government .
CSI NY ’s episode entitled “ Point of View ” featured a character who researches “ conspiracy theories ” , such the deliberate dispersal of potentially dangerous chemtrails into the atmosphere .
First the character , a professor , is labeled ” odd ” , then “ anti-American ” , before finally he is revealed to be a “ domestic terrorist ” hell bent on releasing a biological weapon in New York .
The following is a partial transcript of dialogue from the show :
CSI detective : “ I have a little intel on Professor Scott ; he has a history of espousing various conspiracy theories ; sharing them with his students got him into a little trouble . ”
Professor ’s friend : “ Every university has a least one unconventional professor . ”
Second CSI detective : “ Oh come on Payton , this guys ideas here are totally anti-American .
Look at this ; water fluoridation , tsunami bombs , chemtrails …
First CSI detective : “ What are chemtrails ? ” Third CSI detective : “ Some people believe that vapor exhaust from aircraft are actually dangerous bio-chemicals dispersed into the air . ”
Friend of the professor : “ Which only proves that the professor is a little odd . ”
Watch the video ( the above dialogue begins at around 24:40 )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Call me a rabid conspiracy theorist , but the episode happens to coincide with a State Department guide that dismisses a range of “ conspiracy theories ” , including the use of depleted uranium by U.S. forces in Iraq as existing only “ in the realm of myth ” .
But the government cannot inject plot lines into TV dramas – that ’s simply a baseless conspiracy theory , is n’t it ?
Unfortunately no , it is not .
As we covered in depth last year , in just one publicly announced instance , shows on all the major networks in the U.S. were infested with plot lines and talking points aimed at promoting “ service and volunteerism ” , as well as other topics high on the priorities list of the Obama administration .
One of those shows , according to the Entertainment Industry Foundation , was CSI : NY on CBS .
The week that followed saw many subliminal messages , as well as overt talking points , inserted into shows on all the networks .
Neither was this the first time the corporate networks prostituted their integrity and handed over control of their content to the Obama administration .
Back in June 2009 , ABC News mimicked the likes of Communist China and North Korea by completely turning its news coverage over to the government and excluding any dissenting opinions to promote President Obama ’s health care agenda .
The use of the chemtrails talking point in CSI : NY is interesting given that the dispersal of sulphur containing aerosols into the atmosphere is a practice that has been proven to have been undertaken , and is a regular part of controversial discussions concerning geo-engineering the planet in the face of climate change .
Of course , you ’re not supposed to know that , you ’re just supposed to think it ’s a crazy conspiracy theory espoused by nut case anti-American terrorists who want to kill you with bio weapons .
Could this be a latest example of propaganda placement be a manifestation of Obama ’s information czar Cass Sunstein ’s all out war on “ conspiracy theories ” ?
Or is that just another conspiracy theory too ?

A Russian Soyuz TMA - 18 rocket is seen in preparation for launch at Kazakhstan 's Russian - leased Baikonur cosmodrome on April 2 , to the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
NASA announced Tuesday that it signed a contract with the Russian space agency to shuttle US astronauts to the orbiting International Space Station .
NASA announced Tuesday that it signed a contract with the Russian space agency to shuttle US astronauts to the orbiting International Space Station .
The 335 million dollar contract extension is for the " transportation , rescue and related services " of US crew bound for the ISS in 2013 , NASA said in a statement .
The contract " covers comprehensive Soyuz support , including all necessary training and preparation for launch , crew rescue , and landing of a long - duration mission for six individual station crew members . "
US astronauts bound for the ISS will depart aboard four Soyuz missions in 2013 , and will return to Earth aboard two Soyuz missions scheduled for 2013 and two in 2014 .
The United States is due to retire its aging shuttle fleet this year , and from then on will depend on Russian Soyuz flights to transport its astronauts to the ISS until the Ares 1 rocket and its Orion capsule are operational in 2015 .
President Barack Obama 's administration in February proposed scrapping the costly and over budget Constellation rocket program , designed to send Americans to the moon by 2020 .
The US space shuttle Discovery blasted off Monday toward the ISS , the fourth last mission for the shuttle program before all three remaining US manned orbiters are retired at the end of 2010 , ending 30 years of service .
The first shuttle flew in April 1981 .
The International Space Station , a 100 - billion - dollar project begun in 1998 with the participation of 16 countries , is financed mainly by the United States .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
Sales of new single - family homes plunged 33 % in May to a record - low level after a federal subsidy for home buyers expired , according to data released Wednesday by the Commerce Department .
Sales dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 300,000 , the lowest since records began in 1963 .
April 's sales pace was revised down to 446,000 compared with the 504,000 originally reported .
March 's sales were also revised lower .
The results were much worse than expected , and economists had expected a 20 % decline to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 405,000 .
See complete economic calendar and consensus forecast .
U.S. stock markets dropped quickly on the news .
Gold prices also fell .
See full story on the market reaction .
That sales fell was " not at all surprising , " wrote Dan Greenhaus , chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak & Co . " However , we would be lying if we said the size of the drop was not shocking . "
" By the fall , we expect the very favorable affordability picture to start pulling people back into the market , but the next few months are likely to be very grim , " wrote Ian Shepherdson , chief U.S. domestic economist for High Frequency Economics , who predicted the number precisely .
Sales fell sharply in all four regions , with sales down more than 50 % in the West .
The median sales price in May was $ 200,900 , down 9.6 % from a year earlier and the lowest since December 2003 .
Home builders continued to shed inventories in May , cutting the number of unsold homes by 0.5 % to 213,000 , the lowest level in 39 years .
In the past year , inventories are down 27 % , while sales are down 18 % .
The inventory of unsold homes represented an 8.5 - month supply at the depressed May sales pace , up from 5.8 months in April and the highest in nearly a year .
Home builders are facing stiff competition from a glut of inventory of existing homes , fueled by pent - up demand to move and by high levels of foreclosures and short sales .
In order to qualify for the federal tax credit of up to $ 8,000 , a buyer needed to sign a sales contract on a home by the end of April .
New - home sales are recorded at the time of the contract signing .
The tax credit likely pulled many sales forward into the first four months of the year .
Sales increased a cumulative 29 % between February and April .
But once the credit expired , sales collapsed in May .
The big question for housing , and perhaps for the economy , is whether housing will strengthen significantly from here .
If sales remain weak , home prices could fall further , which would in turn depress consumer spending , increase foreclosures and lead to more losses at banks .
Government statisticians have low confidence in the monthly report , which is subject to large revisions , and large sampling and other statistical errors .
In most months , the government is n't sure whether sales rose or fell .
The standard error in May , for instance , was plus or minus 9.9 % .
Read the full government report .
The government says it can take up to four months to establish a statistically significant trend in sales .
Over the past four months , sales have been on a 371,000 seasonally adjusted annual pace , little changed from the 367,000 pace in the four months leading up to January .
On Tuesday , the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes fell 2 % in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.66 million .
Sales of existing homes are recorded at the time of the closing .
Buyers have until June 30 to close on the sale to qualify for the tax credit .
See full story on existing - home sales .
Housing data in May have been dismal .
Housing starts fell 10 % , building permits fell 5.9 % , mortgage applications dropped , and the home builders ' index fell by five points .
The only bright spot was mortgage rates , which stayed very low .
" A housing market with the ability to stand on its own requires the improvement in the job market to continue and for mortgage rates to stay low , " wrote Jennifer Lee , senior economist for BMO Capital Markets .
The US President and British Prime Minister said that the stricken oil giant should " remain a strong and stable company " after meeting to discuss the environmental disaster on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Toronto .
The discussions come amid growing worries that the company could never recover from the Deepwater Horizon disaster , which has left BP facing unquantifiable costs and damaged its strategic ambitions .
A young child was caught on camera drinking from a beer bottle at a Philadelphia Phillies baseball game Sunday , MyFoxPhilly.com reported .
Video of the unidentified child surfaced on Monday after the Phillies lost to the Padres on Sunday .
In two video shots taken from an official game broadcast , the blonde child is seen with a plastic beer bottle in his right hand , drinking from the bottle .
The child appears to be between three and four years old , and is also wearing a white Phillies home jersey .
Once the clips leaked out on the Internet , it set off another round of Phillies – and Philadelphia – bashing .
“ Phillies fans are an illustrious bunch .
In the past year , they have vomited , prostituted and been Tasered .
Now it appears that childhood drinking can be added to the list , ” said the Huffington Post blog .
“ Drinking beers at 4 - years - old , forced vomiting on people by age 21 .
Who would allow a toddler to drink a beer , at $ 9 a bottle , I ’m keeping that beer to myself , ” said another blogger on Ted Williams Head.com .
The latest incident at the Phillies home ball park comes after two nationally publicized confrontations , where one fan vomited on six people , while another fan had to be Tasered by Philadelphia police on camera .

What makes a father ?
That is the question I asked in a post earlier today , and it is one that Douglas L. , a management consultant in Pennsylvania , has been asking for several months now .
He is a father .
He became one last October when his daughter was born .
The baby ’s mother was a woman with whom he had what he describes as a “ casual ” relationship .
“ We never dated in the traditional sense , ” he explained in an e-mail message .
“ There were no plans for us to be a couple after our child was born .
While I did live with her during the pregnancy , it was mostly to provide her with support and demonstrate that I will be an involved father . ”
That is very much what he wants to be .
But , he says , everything about law and custom discourages that .
Yes , there is likely another side to his story .
But that side , of the woman who decides to have and raise a child on her own is one we often hear .
His , of a man who is trying his best to stay in his daughter ’s life , is one we do n’t hear often enough .
Also true is the fact that uncommitted sex is what created this particular mess in the first place .
I expect that is what many of you will have to say .
But take a step beyond that .
The reality is there is a baby girl out there whose father wants to “ man up ” as he phrases it , and whose mother does not want his presence , for whatever reason .
What is a father , a legal system or a society to do ?
A Father ’s Role
By Douglas L .
As I approach my first Father ’s Day , I am still trying to define my role as a father .
As with parenting , there are no laws , rules or guidelines to help me , as a father , define and act upon my role .
As I have come to learn , the reason for this is ambivalence is because my role is defined by an entity that I can neither control nor influence .
So what is this controlling entity ?
Society ?
No. Religion ?
Nope .
Biology ?
Please .
The answer . . . the mother of my child .
After I learned that I was going to be a father on March 11 , 2009 , I wrote a letter to my unborn child promising him / her that I would be the father that I always dreamed I would .
To be kind , loving , nurturing , teaching , encouraging , so on and so forth .
I embraced my role as “ protector ” of the mother and my unborn child .
I made sure that she ate properly , exercised and did not overexert herself .
I went to all the doctors appointments , read the books on baby development and resigned myself to shopping for baby items .
During the pregnancy , the mother and I agreed that breast milk was the way to go .
I had done enough research to know that it was the best form of food and most importantly , for me at least , it was cheap .
The only other agreements we made were the baby ’s name , that the mom would have a natural childbirth , and that she would bring our child to work with her .
Other than that , we decided to take things as they come .
The last trimester was particularly trying for the mother .
She had difficulty breathing , had a gestational diabetes scare and gained a lot of weight .
I look upon this helplessly knowing that there was little that I could do outside of being as supportive as I could .
On Oct. 19 , 2009 , two days after our baby shower , her mother , who was concerned about her hacking and inability to breathe , brought the mother to the emergency room .
Diagnosis – an enlarged thyroid that had pressed against her windpipe to the point it was the size of cocktail straw .
The windpipe is normally about one - quarter - inch wide .
So we were given a choice of which day we wanted to have thyroid surgery – Wednesday or Thursday .
And one other choice — have a C - section or try to wait .
Our baby was 35 weeks and 6 days old ; we opted for the C-section and surgery for that Thursday .
I am a confident , some would say arrogant , individual .
I had no worries that I could take care of both mother and baby after the two surgeries .
I did that by focusing on the things I could control – making sure our daughter was loved , nurtured and secure , letting the doctors take care of the medicine .
Our daughter , E. was born at 9:22 a.m .
Then , while the thyroid surgery went forward , I followed her bassinet up to the nursery , gave her her first kiss and hug , took her first photos and bottle .
I also received my first shock .
The name on E. ’s cart had the mother ’s last name , not mine .
It was the law , the nurse said , dismissively .
Not a good start to defining the role of a father , I think .
I spent the day in the nursery with E. , until the mother was moved to her recovery room on the surgical recovery floor .
When the nurses gave their okay , I brought E. down to meet her mother .
Knowing that the first meeting between parent and child is special , I stepped back and to let the mother hold and bond with E. I also brought the formula so that mom could feed E .
That was the beginning of the end of my understanding of my role as a father .
The first roadblock was the lactation consultant ; the bottle I had given E. that morning was the last time I would feed my daughter .
Next was the paperwork .
The nurse handed me two forms for my signature , and she handed the mother eight .
Mine were the acknowledgment of paternity form and a document asking about my background – age , educational level , profession , my cultural status ( I do n’t like the term “ race ” ) .
That was it .
The mother ’s paperwork included health care information , legal notice of her rights and responsibilities , assistance to secure child support , the birth - certificate form that did not need my signature .
Including my name on the birth certificate is optional ; it ’s contingent on my signing the acknowledgment of paternity form and waiting 60 days before it would take effect .
Our child was born in Pennsylvania , where a man is called a “ putative father ” until that 60 - day time period elapses .
And that “ acknowledgment of paternity form ” does not really give me any rights , just the responsibility of financial support .
Well , it does say , “ … the father should have all rights and duties regarding the child as if he had been married to the mother at the time of the child ’s birth , ” but in the months afterward I have not found an attorney who can explain to me that that means .
Apparently , a father ’s rights are undefined and can mean whatever you want it to mean for your purposes .
For the rest of the hospital stay , the mother took over parental duties , with the hospital ’s staff ’s encouragement .
My role was bystander , doing what the mother needed me to do .
In the span of two days , I went from providing and caring for my child to being a replaceable helper .
I could do nothing unless supervised by or invited to by the mother .
I could not even take my child for a walk in the hall , which is secured , without the mother ’s approval .
This is not a positive development .
I plowed ahead , setting up the mother ’s house with a nursery .
The mother informed me she was moving to her mother ’s house to recuperate .
Just like that , she can decide where we live without consulting me or having a discussion with me .
My role , pack up the stuff and move it to her mother ’s house .
You can guess the rest .
I tried to assert what I believed my role as a father should be – a primary figure in E. ’s life rather than a secondary figure .
The beginning of the end was on a nice fall day and I wanted to take the baby for a walk .
She had recently been nursed so that was not an issue ; however , the mother felt that she needed to be there with us .
As if I were going to do something inappropriate or could not handle a situation .
So she came along , and eventually elbowed me to take control of the stroller .
What then could I do ?
If I responded physically , off to jail I would go .
If I let her have the stroller without incident , I would cede my rights to make decisions for my daughter .
I reluctantly chose option No. 2 .
Not longer afterward I moved out .
I filed for joint custody , because our child needs both of us equally .
We ca n’t be equal if I have “ wait ” for the mother to “ decide ” when I can see my daughter .
I understood that I was a disadvantage .
Because E. was nursing , equal custody was physically impossible right away .
But in a way that ’s irrelevant because the system is anything but immediate .
I filed for joint custody on Dec. 15 , 2009 , and was given a hearing for May 24 , 2010 .
In that time I saw E. only 16 times for a total of 67 hours .
Now back to my original question , who defines the role of a father ?
Society says that it is the mother .
Her influence begins from the time she announces that she is pregnant .
She determines if the father goes to her prenatal appointments .
She controls whether he is actively involved in talking to , rubbing , and supporting the child while in the womb .
Once the child is born , she is the one who determines the type and amount of activity the father has with the child .
And the law ?
Only one state specifically says that an unmarried mother has sole legal and physical custody of a child ; most other states operate under the same paradigm , but they do n’t state it outright .
Every state is concerned that men pay child support , with no provisions put in place to help us , to allow us , to support our children emotionally or socially .
What should men do in the face of this ambiguity ?
Should we stay or leave ?
I am trying to stay .
The proposal the mother gave to the court mediator says I can spend Tuesdays , Thursdays and every other Saturday with her , from 5 to 7 p.m. , until E. has finished breastfeeding .
It also says that the mother should be present during those hours .
I am going to make a counter proposal .
I ’m not yet sure what it should say .
TIM CAHILL to save Australia ?
If anyone can , '' Timmay ' ' can .
Fit , focused and desperate .
Hurting from having to sit out the redemption game against Ghana and determined to make someone pay in tomorrow 's deciding game against Serbia .
The Socceroos are not a one - man band , but for a match in which they simply must score goals , Cahill is as close as there is to indispensable .
Forced into the role of spectator in Rustenburg , it was n't an experience he particularly enjoyed .
'' I 'm not the best watcher , I could n't sit still , '' he says .
Let 's hope all that pent - up energy manifests itself on the pitch in Nelspruit .
Cahill will either play alongside Josh Kennedy in a 4 - 4 - 2 , or just behind him if Verbeek goes again with a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 .
Either way , he wo n't be wasted in the battering - ram role .
Verbeek has learnt that lesson from Yokohama last year , when Cahill admitted the towelling he copped from the Japanese defenders tested his discipline to the limit .
Code for : '' I wanted to smash them , but I knew I could n't . ''
Tim Cahill trains with the Socceroos .
Credit : Vince Caligiuri
The red card did n't come in Yokohama , but it did come against the Germans in Durban and that 's been punishment enough .
'' It 's about how you react , is n't it ? '' he says .
'' Since the red card I 've done nothing but try and train hard , be around the lads , be there every second of the way .
Now my dream 's still alive because I get a crack at the last game . ''
Last ?
Maybe not .
Much as the odds are stacked against the Socceroos , belief has flooded through the squad after the spirited effort against Ghana .
Enough to believe they can get the win they need and , assuming Germany beat Ghana , reach the minimum benchmark of winning by a two - goal margin in the process .
In that sense , especially with Harry Kewell absent , Cahill 's return could hardly be more timely .
Verbeek likes to point out that Australia 's scoring record in the qualifiers proves his team can score goals .
Truth is , a large percentage of those goals came against one , timid , opponent .

Ming - Chi Kuo has struck again .
The most reliable analyst when it comes to providing information on Apple products has anticipated the batch planned for the beginning of the year .
There is talk of the iPad , a return of AirPower , and AirTags .
The rumor of an iPhone SE 2 launched in March is now firmly in the heads .
Information about a production start has already reached us , and it is now certain that a new iPhone will be official soon .
The only thing missing is the announcement of a keynote to confirm all this .
But this new smartphone is not the only product that the firm of Cupertino could present at the beginning of 2020 .
The specialist Ming - Chi Kuo makes a list of predictions concerning many devices .
New iPad Pro and high - end headphones
Expected in 2019 , the renewal of the iPad Pro should take place at the beginning of this year .
The analyst announces new models equipped with the same photosensors as the iPhone 11 with 3D detection support for augmented reality .
Their presentation should be made in March , probably at the same time as the iPhone SE2 .
After a year marked by new AirPods , the release of AirPods Pro and Powerbeats Pro , the beginning of this year could see the birth of a high - end headset , without necessarily knowing what it means .
The only additional information is that they would be in an over - the - ear shape .
A return of accessories that we thought were missing
The rumor of a location tracker had made a lot of noise last summer .
The integration of the U1 chip in the new iPhone heralded the simultaneous launch of what should be called AirTags .
But as we know , last September ’s keynote did n’t say a word about it , so much so that we thought the project was definitively buried .
Even ( lack of ) a bell for the AirPower .
Apple ’s wireless charging mat , postponed many times and definitively canceled in the middle of last year .
According to Ming - Chi Kuo , it could come back from the dead , in a new version though , which could be smaller and , above all , should avoid overheating – the reason for the abandonment of the project in the first place .
The beginning of 2021 is already here
Ming - Chi Kuo does n’t stop at just predictions for dawn 2020 .
The analyst already talks about the beginning of 2021 and mentions a new iPhone .
That should be only an evolution of the SE 2 , baptized – for the moment – SE 2 Plus .
This successor would adopt a new design with a 5.5 or 6.1 inches LCD panel .
The screen would , therefore , occupy the entire front surface , as it has since the iPhone X .
However , there is no mention of Face ID , and Touch ID would still be used .
Apple would switch here to the fingerprint reader , coupled with the start button .
A solution that has been seen on Sony Xperia that were precursors and that we see coming back recently , especially on the Honor 20 .
Islamabad , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
To the average person , holding a child over the jaws of a hungry crocodile does not seem like a smart idea .
But a small community in southern Pakistan believes it can bring good luck .
Once a year , members of the Sheedi community come dangerously close to giant crocodiles in a festival that leaves both spectators and reptiles with their mouths wide open .
Sheedis believe the crocodiles in the pond in Manghopir -- near Karachi -- are sacred .
Legend has it a saint left his lice there 700 years ago , and they grew into crocodiles that make miracles come true .
" All the wishes and prayers of people who come here are granted by God , " said Ghulam Akbar , the caretaker of the shrine near the pond .
But the crocodiles can't work on empty stomachs ; thousands came to this week 's four - day festival with offerings of goat meat and candy .
Caretakers say no one has ever been hurt at the event , and everyone leaves with new - found joy .
At least one baby boy did n't seem very joyful .
He cried as a man held him over a crocodile 's snapping jaws .
Onlookers snapped cell - phone photos .
Drums thumped .
People danced and cheered .
Like most Sufi Muslims , Sheedis worship to rhythmic beats to achieve a state of trance and become closer to God .
On a crisp , sunny day in mid-April in London , Maya and her publicist , Jennie Boddy , were in a car being driven to the home of a Sri Lankan wedding photographer .
Instead of doing standard publicity photos to promote her still nameless album , Maya had the idea of using a photographer she found in the phone book who worked , as many Sri Lankan photographers do , in an almost Bollywood style , by inserting a simple picture , in this case of Maya , into dozens of fantastic , almost surrealistic tableaus .
A few days ago , Maya hatched this plan , which like most Maya plans was inventive , artistic and , in an unsettling way , combined the high with the low .
“ I ’ve had my eye on some jewelry from Givenchy forever , ” Maya told me , as we inched our way in bumper - to - bumper traffic .
“ It is millions of dollars ’ worth of gold jewelry .
To wear it for these pictures , Givenchy had to send a bodyguard .
I liked the idea of a photographer shooting me in his council flat in all this gold , knowing that the jewelry requires a bodyguard . ”
She paused .
She was wearing opaque brown stockings , very small , tan leather shorts that laced up the front , high - heeled ankle boots and a fluorescent yellow bra that periodically flashed through a loose , open - knit Phat Farm sweater topped by an oversize dark brown jacket .
Maya ’s nearly black hair was pulled into a bun on top of her head , her nails were colored in an elaborate checkerboard pattern and she had applied a dark indigo powder to her eyebrows .
It was an exotic mix : her body was downtown and her face was uptown .
“ All of what I ’m wearing is American , ” Maya said .
“ If I was a terrorist , I would n’t be wearing American clothing . ”
She paused .
This may have been a joke , but Maya rarely laughs .
She speaks carefully , slowly , with a kind of deadpan delivery .
Like a trained politician , she stays on message .
It ’s hard to know if she believes everything she says or if she knows that a loud noise will always attract a crowd .
Maya had flown to London nearly a month before and was living with Ikhyd at her mother ’s apartment an hour outside the city .
Initially , she came to see her mom and work on the album art and the first video , for the song “ Born Free , ” which is , strangely , not the first single .
But she needed to renew her U.S. visa , and until her immigration lawyer could resolve the matter , Maya was stuck in London .
“ I want to be back in New York by May 3 , ” she said , staring out the window .
“ I ’m invited to the Met Ball , and all my girlfriends say : ‘ Oh , the Met Ball !
I want to go to the Met Ball ! ’ ” The annual Met Ball for the Costume Institute is a yearly black - tie gala held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art .
It is co-hosted by Anna Wintour , the editor of Vogue .
“ I ’m going with Alexander Wang ” — the fashion designer — “ and I wanted to wear a dress made out of a torn - up American flag , ” Maya added .
Wang made a hand - crocheted , gold - metallic dress over a black leather bodice instead .
Maya has a complicated relationship with America .
When she was recording “ Kala , ” in 2007 , her second album ( named after her mother ) , her request for an artist ’s visa was initially denied .
( Maya maintains it was because of her song lyrics ; the State Department is not obliged to give applicants a reason for denying them entry . )
She had wanted to make a more classic hip - hop record in Baltimore , where Blaqstarr then lived , or with Timbaland in L.A. but instead , recorded it all over the world .
She traveled to Liberia , India , Angola , Trinidad and Jamaica ( “ where they have the cutest boys ” ) .
“ Kala ” is layered with sounds like tribal beats , dance hall and the lush musical productions of Bollywood .
One track , “ Bird Flu , ” combines 30 of India ’s top drummers in a crazy rush of rhythm .
Maya was finally granted a visa and recorded “ Paper Planes ” in New York , but came back to England so that two sets of twins from Brixton could sing the backing vocals .
She felt this inclusion made a kind of political statement at a time when England was spending millions of pounds on weapons and war .
However incoherent the reason , the chorus of “ Paper Planes ” is contagious .
“ I never thought the song was political , ” Diplo told me .
“ Mostly , Maya was making fun of American rapper culture .
‘ Paper Planes ’ was making fun of being what American kids are into , of being ‘ gangsta . ’ ”
She also recorded a song , “ O Saya , ” with A. R. Rahman , a composer and perhaps the most powerful producer in India , that ended up on the “ Slumdog Millionaire ” soundtrack .
“ O Saya ” was nominated for an Academy Award , and in 2009 , she was to perform on the awards show .
“ It was after Ikhyd was born , ” Maya recalled , “ and they told me they ’d wheel in a bed and let me perform the song in bed . ”
She paused .
She declined their offer when she found out that the televised song would be edited down to a minute .
“ It was too little time . ”

Maya rolled down her window and pointed .
“ That church saved my life , ” she said , as we drove past a church in East London .
“ Christ Church !
That ’s the last time I got to be a high - school dropout : I should have been in school , and a youth worker at the church , who had been in prison , grabbed me and slammed me against the wall one day and said : ‘ What is the matter with you ?
If you stay around here , you ’ll end up living in one of these apartments with six babies before you ’re 20 . ’
I used to be hanging about , getting into trouble .
He changed my life . ”
After leaving Sri Lanka in 1983 , her mother moved Maya and her brother and sister to Phipps Bridge Estate , a housing project , or council flat , in South London .
It was rough .
“ We lived in a notoriously racist area called Mitcham , ” Maya said .
“ It ’s where all the skinheads lived .
I was shot at for being a Tamil in Sri Lanka , and then , everyone was calling me a Paki in London , and I ’m not even Pakistani .
My mom sat me down and said , ‘ When they call you that , tell them to sod off . ’ ”
Lawmakers moulded the new law on legislation against moral or sexual harassment in the workplace , she said .
But the difference is that there are no reliable external witnesses , such as work colleagues , in a domestic dispute – only other family members who can not be relied on to be " objective " .
When you write about games , your calendar will soon begin to look like a maze of embargoes .
When you agree to play a game or see a presentation before a title is released , you are stuck agreeing to the publisher 's schedule , which dictates exactly what you 're allowed to talk about and when you can talk about it .
This is par for the course , and when you see a rush of reviews all at the same time , you 'll know an embargo has lifted .
The problem is not that embargoes make everyone equal — it 's that some websites are more equal than others .
There are , of course , plenty of objections to make about the whole embargo process .
Today we 're going to look at what happens when embargoes are no longer used to keep everyone on equal footing , and are instead leveraged to make sure only the chosen few sites are able to share the hoarded news .
What happens when embargoes are seemingly broken ?
Today 's look at embargoes came from the story we broke about the keytar peripheral and the " Pro " game modes coming to Rock Band 3 .
While the company refuses to use the term " keytar , " the fact that the peripheral came with a handle and could be played standing up was enough for us to use the term , either rightly or wrongly .
The information came from our ever - reliable Mole , who has helped us break many , many stories for us in the past , with an incredible accuracy rate .
What we did n't know when we received the original information was that much of what was given to us was already known by many people who write about games — the new Rock Band content was shown at an E3 preview event we did n't attend , and journalists had signed pieces of paper saying that they would n't discuss what they had seen .
This presents a sticky situation : information which some know is accurate is out there , but if they tip their hand and say that it 's real , they could get slapped down by the publisher and their coverage could be hurt in the future .
For our part , we were threatened with a lack of access in the future if we did n't take the story down .
We left it up .
Some gaming sites wrote it up and made sure to stress that this is a rumor , and others ignored it completely .
Why would an editor who knew the story was accurate decide to sit on the information ?
Rumor posts are common in this business , and our Mole is probably he most reliable in the industry .
An editor from one of the major gaming sites agreed to speak with us about the issue on condition of anonymity , and his worry was that running the story would have broken the terms of his embargo .
His other thought ?
Our story only had a few details , and it was worthwhile to wait until they could run the full story after the embargo dropped .
We had a few juicy scoops about what was coming , sure , but at that point the editor in question had all the details ( under embargo ) , and so decided to wait .
Because USA
Today got a better embargo
As if our scoop did n't give news outlets enough of a headache , those that did n't run our news woke up on Thursday morning to find that USA Today had run a full story about Rock Band 3 , including details about the song lists , videos of the peripherals , and all the other good stuff that the other sites were n't allowed to write about until Friday , when their embargo was up .
They could then write about the details that USA Today talked about , but any of their own thoughts based on the time with the game ?
Their mouths had to stay shut for another 24 hours .
That 's one problem with this sort of embargo : it 's not to make sure that everyone 's story goes up at the same time ; rather , it 's done to ensure that the publisher gets to pick who drops the details first .
Writers waking up to the USA Today news soon realized that their own coverage was going to seem late , and would mostly repeat what USA Today had already said .
USA Today , of course , has been given a huge advantage in terms of timeliness .
We spoke to Chris Grant , the Editor in Chief of Joystiq , and he confirmed it 's a common practice to give some outlets videos , images or even stories ahead of everyone else — he named IGN as an example — but giving someone an exclusive on an event is less common , but more annoying .
" Less common , and less acceptable , is the event exclusive where dozens of outlets attend the same event , often on their own dime , agree upon the same embargo , but one outlet is granted that exclusive , usually in exchange for the promise of special placement , " he told Ars .
In these situations , you simply have to wait your turn until the blessed news outlet 's exclusive period runs out .
" It stings to hold your story , your impressions , and instead link out to another outlet to get the news up .
It reminds me of sitting at the kid 's table , and waiting for Uncle Ignatius ( or whomever ! ) to finish their meal . "
That 's where it gets maddening for outlets who take part in these early preview events : you 're giving up your time , attention , and even travel budget to cover a game , and only later do you find out that one of your competitors is allowed to run the story first and there is nothing to be done about it .
Grant 's preferred tactic is to find out ahead of time if someone has an exclusive , and back off on covering events held by publishers that have burned them in the past .
Another writer told Ars that 's it 's a tricky thing , as many exclusive deals are struck after the event has concluded .
The wasted time may be the worst part
The time it takes to cover these events , not to mention the travel budget some sites pay , and the investment is only worth it if the news is timely .
This year , the shifting embargoes and timed press releases sent out by publishers after preview events are causing frustration and anger at some sites .
In one case , Activision gave writers a lengthy preview of the upcoming DJ Hero 2 ... only to release all the information talked about as a press release before the embargo was up , scooping the very writers invited to come and take a look at the game .
One writer expressed the anger he felt about having his time wasted , and hinted that he 's skeptical of giving Activision any more energy during the show .
The Rock Band 3 story deals with every aspect of embargoes .
One site has information that could endanger the exclusive going to someone else , so they 're threatened in order to have it removed .
Other news outlets ignore a story they know is true because it might break their embargo , only to find out that USA Today has the exclusive , so their own stories are going to feel like yesterday 's news by the time they 're allowed to publish .
In some cases , writers go see a game , only to have the details , images , and gameplay details published by the developer before the embargo drops , destroying the value of the pre-release briefing .
In other situations , a news outlet given a break can have disastrous consequences .
It seems USA Today was given the contents of the Microsoft Project Natal reveal in advance , and when its story ran ahead of time it seemed to be speaking of events in the future in the past tense .
The story was soon pulled , but the damage was done : the name of Kinect and the games coming to the system were all over the Internet before the Cirque du Soleil event had even begun , stealing the majority of Microsoft 's thunder .
Whoops .
Embargoes are meant , in part , to level the playing field , but instead they 're often used to make sure some outlets get to break stories .
Try to fight the system , and you can expect an angry e-mail and perhaps future repercussions in terms of access or game reviews .
Why do some outlets get to run information before anyone else ?
In some cases it 's because they promise good reviews scores , and in others it could be story placement or other goodies were decided between publisher and outlet .
What 's clear is that exclusives carry a high value , and valuable things are never given for free .
Sadly , embargoes will always be used to keep some stories secret , until one outlet is allowed to break the news for everyone .
When it comes to gaming coverage , we 'll accept embargoes in order to get timely information to you .
We will not accept any offers for special treatment in exchange for an advantage , however .
And keep this in mind : when you see someone bringing you a PR - blessed mother - lode of gaming news before everyone else , you'd be quite right to approach it with skepticism .
Who knows what they had to do to get special treatment .
Scareware purveyors ’ top target for today : Twilight fans using Google to search for show times , sound tracks and all things related to latest movie about young vampire lovers .
{ Safety tip :
If you see a suspicious virus scan or alert , the worst thing you can do is click on anything in the alert , even a “ cancel ” button .
That ’s because clicking on anything the bad guys present to you usually advances the scam .
Instead , do a force quit : type “ ctrl - alt - delete ” to navigate to your task manager .
Locate the application running the fake alert and force - quit it by clicking “ end task . ” }
Cyber criminals are using Black Hat SEO techniques to cause tainted web links to turn up high in the rankings of search results related to Twilight ; the bad links trigger malicious programs that launch promos for fake antivirus protection , says PC Tools researcher Rommel Garcia .
HereÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s how the scam works :
A fan uses Google to search for “ Twilight Eclipse Release Date ”
Tainted web links turn up ranked highly among the search results *
The fan clicks on a malicious link
The fan ’s web browser gets redirected to web site controlled by the scammers
A fake Windows security alert pops up indicating serious infections
The fan is duped into clicking “ prevent attack ”
The fan now gets taken down a path to purchase worthless clean up and protection .
Twilight fans should be “ vigilant when visiting sites that appear in internet searches ” even when the search results appear to point to legitimate web sites , says Garcia .
Scareware attacks like this are so slick because the bad guys make a ton of money .
The FTC and FBI busted one gang that made $ 163 million duping one victim at a time to pay $ 30 to $ 70 for worthless cleanup and protection .

A new study says the crumbs from the sandwich you eat at work fall into your keyboard , and that attracts mice when you go home .
As they eat , they poop on your keyboard .
And it gets even worse from there .
Because then there 's mouse turd on your keyboard , it gets on your fingers when you type , and then those same fingers are used to eat another sandwich at which point you have poop in your mouth .
The researchers at London 's Royal Society of Chemists tested keyboards and found food poisoning agents like e. coli , coliforms , and enterobacteria present .
And it 's all because you can't tear yourself away from your computer for 10 minutes to go to the break room and inhale some chips .

Data analysis ignites public row .
Thomas Skutella .
Long - rumbling hostilities between stem - cell researchers in Germany exploded into a blazing public row last week , after Nature published a critical reanalysis of data from a high - profile 2008 article .
The researchers behind the original work1 , led by Thomas Skutella of the University of Tübingen , reported using cells from adult human testes to create pluripotent stem cells with similar properties to embryonic stem cells .
Unlike other adult cells , these reproductive or ' germline ' stem cells can be reprogrammed for pluripotency without the need to introduce additional genes , a step that often relies on a virus .
That could make them safer for future use in medicine .
The paper made headlines because such pluripotent stem cells might be used instead of ethically sensitive human embryonic tissue .
Soon after its publication , however , some stem - cell scientists said that the evidence for pluripotency was unconvincing .
They also complained that Skutella would not distribute cells to other labs for verification , even though Nature requires its authors to share all published research resources .
Hans Schöler , a director at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine in Münster and an author of last week 's critical comment2 , says that he proclaimed Skutella 's achievement as a breakthrough when he first saw the data at a meeting , but became doubtful after seeing the published paper .
" If this paper is wrong , then a lot of scientists are wasting time , energy and money in trying to follow up on it , " he says .
Others fear that the episode is undermining the credibility of the field .
In response , Skutella last week asked the DFG , Germany 's main research - funding agency , to conduct an investigation both of his paper in Nature and of what he claims is a witch - hunt against him .
Schöler , who also works with germline stem cells , says that he would welcome such a move .
Pluripotent cells should form teratomas — encapsulated tumours comprising different cell types — when injected under the skin of mice , and also exhibit a particular profile of gene expression .
" The teratoma pictures in the Nature paper were not terribly convincing but that did n't concern me too much at first , " says Schöler .
" It was the failure to provide cells that started to concern me . "
After more than a year of requests for access , he decided to reanalyse data in the paper in Nature showing which genes in the disputed cells were being expressed .
Together with bioinformaticians , he compared the genes ' expression profile with those of other cells in public databases and found that it overlapped with a type of connective - tissue cell called fibroblasts but not with pluripotent stem cells .
Schöler suggests that fibroblasts may have contaminated Skutella 's samples .
But Skutella and his colleagues deny3 mistaking fibroblasts for pluripotent cells .
Skutella says that comparison of gene - expression data is meaningless " if the cells being compared were not processed identically " .
Takashi Shinohara at Kyoto University in Japan , whose team in 2004 generated the first pluripotent germline stem cells from mice , shares Schöler 's concerns about the expression data .
He says that fibroblasts and pluripotent cells have different gene - expression profiles even if the cells are not processed in similar ways , and adds that it would be helpful to see Skutella 's cells .

In a corrigendum to his original paper in August 2009 , Skutella and his co-authors said that they wanted to share the cells but that the original agreement signed by tissue donors precluded distribution to third parties .
Having gained broader consent from some donors , Skutella now promises to distribute the cells once they have been quality - checked .
But stem - cell researcher Rudolf Jaenisch at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge , Massachusetts , is not impressed : " It 's a big problem not providing the cells for what is nearly two years — whatever the excuses , this is bad . "
Ulrike Beisiegel , ombudsman for the DFG , says her office will decide " soon " whether to take up the investigations .
Papua New Guinea Bans Discussion On Waste Dumping by China
In the South Pacific , the government of Papua New Guinea has issued an extraordinary ban on reporting and discussion of amendments to environmental laws which could allow a Chinese mining company to pump waste out to sea .
Civil rights groups are reported to be outraged .
Papua New Guinea is one of the most diverse countries on Earth , with over 850 indigenous languages and at least as many traditional societies , out of a population of just under 7 million .
It is also one of the most rural , with only 18 % of its people living in urban centers .
The country is one of the world ’s least explored , culturally and geographically , and many undiscovered species of plants and animals are thought to exist in the interior of Papua New Guinea .
One third of the population of this equatorial state live on $ 1.25 per day .
Justice Minister and Attorney - General Ano Pala sent a two - page statement to the impoverished South Pacific country ’s media on Friday , saying he was putting a halt to public debate on the laws .
‘ There shall be no more discussion , comment or reference in the media to the Environment Act amendments , ’ he said in the statement , published in part by The National newspaper .
‘ This mean there will be no talkback radio programmes or interviews , no more advertisements , no more letters to the editor and above all no more protest meetings , no public demonstrations , and no public marches . ’
Mr Pala ’s office refused to comment on the statement , saying only that the minister was unavailable .
Critics argue that the amendments reduce landowners ’ legal rights to oppose projects approved by the government .
The changes to the law are being contested in court by landowners from the Madang coast , who are against a pipeline which will dump millions of tonnes of waste into Basamuk Bay .
Mr Pala warned the public there was to be no discussion of the case , given that a court was determining whether the amendments were constitutional .
In March , the courts ordered a halt to work on the Ramu nickel mine , operated by the Chinese Metallurgical Construction Group ( known as MCC ) , as it prepared to blast away corals to make way for the pipeline .
Papua New Guinea civil society group
Act Now accused the government of acting like ‘ an African dictator ’ over the issue .
‘ This is an utterly outrageous attempt by a draconian government to stifle public debate and deny citizens their constitutional rights , ’ it said in a statement .

The hunt is on to find two camels and a tiger somewhere on the roads of Quebec and Ontario .
The animals went missing east of Montreal after a thief stole a pickup truck outside a motel .
The animals were stowed in an attached trailer .
Quebec police say the animals were being transported from a travelling circus in Nova Scotia to a zoo in Bowmanville , Ont .
Two employees were driving the vehicles , and stopped for the night at the motel , 70 kilometres east of Montreal .
Michael Hackenberger , director of the Bowmanville zoo , said the theft occurred between 6 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. Friday morning .
He described the two camels , named Shawn and Todd , as two " delightful " 5 - year - olds who like people and provide rides for kids .
" They 're real gentlemen , just a pleasure working with them " Heckenberger told CP24 .
Jonas , the tiger , was placed in an internal cage inside the trailer .
While Jonas has a " very nice disposition " and is well - trained , Heckenberger said , " he still is a tiger . "
Municipal and provincial police have set up a command centre and are coordinating the search to find them , he added .
Caretakers say they are worried about the health of the animals , as they could suffer from dehydration and malnutrition if they are not found soon .
Police are searching for a black Ford F550 pickup with an Ontario licence plate of 9091XS .
The trailer is an aluminum EBY brand , and has an Ontario licence plate of E4398Y .
Goodbye , stimulus .
Hello , state budget cuts
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Think states have made deep spending cuts ?
You ai n't seen nothing yet .
States have been struggling with huge budget gaps since 2008 , but this year could be worse as federal stimulus funds wind down .
Until now , stimulus money spared governors and state lawmakers from making some of the most brutal budget cuts .
But with this lifeline running out , officials are looking at making significant cutbacks to public services , particularly schools and health programs .
" The stimulus funds have staved off what could have been even deeper cuts , " said Todd Haggerty , policy associate at the National Conference of State Legislatures .
" You 're seeing states now are coming to that point where they will have to make additional cuts or find new sources of revenue for fiscal 2011 and that will continue in fiscal 2012 . "
Stimulus safety net
As of mid-April , states and localities have received nearly $ 109 billion since the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act was passed in February 2009 , according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office .
The vast majority of that money went to help states maintain their Medicaid services and education funding in the face of steep drops in tax revenues due to the recession .
In all , the stimulus funds helped plug between 30 % and 40 % of the $ 291 billion in budget gaps that states have faced over the past two years , experts said .
But Recovery
Act money will only be sufficient to plug 20 % or less of the coming fiscal year 's shortfalls , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
By fiscal 2012 , most of the money will be gone .
Already , many states will have used up much of their education allotments by the start of fiscal 2011 , which begins on July 1 in 46 states .
And the Medicaid assistance will dry up by the end of the year , unless Congress extends it .
Compounding the problem is that many states have already slashed services and raided their rainy day funds to balance their budgets , as they are required to do .
And a recent analysis by the Rockefeller Institute shows that the all - important personal income tax revenue for April is likely to decline steeply .
All this means that state officials are being forced to make some of the tough decisions they 've been able to put off for the past 18 months .
" States had this one - time money that helped them bridge a difficult period in state finances , " Haggerty said .
" Now they have to face the absence of those funds and a whole new set of difficult issues . "
Cuts on the horizon
Meanwhile , states are looking to Capitol Hill to renew some of the stimulus provisions , particularly the increased federal funding for Medicaid .
Both the Senate and House have passed a six - month , $ 25 billion Medicaid extension , but they have to find a way to pay for it before sending it to President Obama for his signature .
At least 21 states , in fact , have already included the extension in their fiscal 2011 budgets , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
If the measure does n't become law , these states would be in big trouble and would have to make even deeper cuts , said Nick Johnson , director of the center 's state fiscal project .
In Pennsylvania , for instance , that extension translates into $ 850 million .
Without it , the state would have to slash half its funding for domestic violence and rape crisis services and chop 25 % off the budget for child welfare services , Gov. Ed Rendell wrote in a letter last month to his state 's congressional delegation .
In addition , state payments to hospitals , doctors and nursing homes would be reduced .
" If the extension of federal fiscal relief is not enacted , most states will have to lay off thousands of workers and make wrenching cuts to public and private sector services , " he said .
School districts , meanwhile , are also feeling the pain .
Some 275,000 education jobs could be eliminated in the coming school year due to budget cuts , according to a new survey by the American Association of School Administrators .
This would nearly wipe out the estimated 300,000 jobs saved by stimulus funds .
" Faced with continued budgetary constraints , school leaders across the nation are forced to consider an unprecedented level of layoffs that would negatively impact economic recovery and deal a devastating blow to public education , " said Dan Domenech , executive director of the association , which is pushing Congress to give states additional funds for education .
Take New York as an example .
Some 14,800 teachers -- 8,500 of them in New York City -- could lose their jobs if Gov. David Paterson 's proposed $ 1.4 billion cut in state education aid is enacted , according to a survey by the New York State Council of School Superintendents and the New York State School Boards Association .
That represents 10 % of the city 's teachers and 4.1 % of educators elsewhere in the state .
( Some school districts have negotiated concessions from their unions that will save some jobs . )
Another 2,600 non-teaching staff , including student support staff , administrators , and other employees , such as custodians , kitchen workers and bus drivers , would also be laid off .
Stimulus funds had staved off some of these harsh cuts .
But New
York only has $ 700 million left of the $ 2.7 billion it received to prop up education aid , said David Albert , spokesman for the school boards association .
" This is the largest state aid cut we 've seen in the last two decades , " he said .
" If you think this year is bad , next year is going to be worse because stimulus will run out . "
A vuvuzela is a long , plastic horn that soccer fans blow into to produce a loud , irritating buzzing noise ; they have inexplicably become the Internet ’s central obsession in the opening week of the 2010 World Cup .
Auto - Tune is a pioneering pitch correction program by Antares Audio Technology , which you most likely associate with the robotic vocal stylings of T - Pain and other pop music icons .
But you knew all that .
What happens when you Auto - Tune a vuvuzela ?
And while we ’re at it , what happens when you coordinate several Auto - Tuned vuvuzela samples to play a few measures from Europe ’s anthemic 1986 hit , “ The Final Countdown ” ?
In the name of science , Geekosystem investigates :
First , the finished product :
Here are the two component tracks , vuvuzela - 1.mp3 and vuvuzela - 2.mp3 , the nature of which are more fully described below :
vuvuzela-1.mp3
vuvuzela-2.mp3
And here ’s video of the Pro Tools screen of vuvuzela - 1.mp3 , on the off chance that will be useful :
First , the parameters : Everything in these files was generated based solely on two vuvuzela samples .
# 1 is the audio from the “ Wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world ? ” videos [ This was the vuvuzela audio that automatically played when you entered 4 chan ’s /b/ forum this past weekend .
– Ed. ] , and # 2 is a 4 - second recording at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vuvuzela_single_note.ogg
As far as the recording of multiple vuvuzelas , Auto - Tune fails to detect a pitch and can’t apply any correction .
But based on a human ’s analysis , the instruments in the recording are playing “ more or less ” a B♭. Although Auto - Tune ca n’t * detect * the pitch , there ’s nothing stopping us from applying a simple pitch shifter plugin , and manually configuring it to shift the sample a fixed number of pitches away from B♭ .
So for all instances of sample # 1 , that ’s what I did .
It does n’t really sound very musical , although you can sort of almost hear what notes it ’s trying to make .
Auto - Tune handles the single note version ( sample # 2 ) beautifully .
In fact , it sounds less like a vuvuzela and more like something that came out of a MIDI file on my old Sound Blaster 16 .
Because of this , I chose sample # 2 for the melodies .
The song I chose to butcher was Europe ’s anthemic 1986 hit , “ The Final Countdown . ”
Because really , why not ?
( Also , it ’s one of the few popular melodies I knew how to play off the top of my head . )
The melody is an unmodified copy of sample # 2 , edited so the onset of the sample lines up with the beginning of each note .
Auto - Tune was set to target notes based on a MIDI track that I had recorded , with a very fast ( some would say T - Pain - esque ) retune speed .
The result sounds like a synth horn with some missing lower harmonics — but it ’s a whole lot better than the annoying droning sound we started with .
For the harmony , I set up three tracks which each played one note of the underlying chord triads .
Because AutoTune could n’t track the pitch in sample # 1 , I manually pitch - shifted each track at each chord change to play an approximation of the correct note .
It still sounded like a pile of angry bees , but as if said pile of angry bees was attempting to harmonize .
This is vuvuzela - 1.mp3 .
On a whim , I decided to replace all the instances of sample # 1 with sample # 2 , properly Auto - Tuned .
The result was a shrill , uninteresting mix that detracted from the melody and is n’t worth reproducing here .
Before I dismissed the idea , I pitch - shifted the three chord tracks down an octave — which made the result fairly listenable !
This is vuvuzela - 2.mp3 .
When you pitch - shift a vuvuzela down an octave then Auto - Tune it , it sounds kind of like the beginnings of a rock organ ( but without the rotating leslie speaker effect . )
Every time I play the vuvuzela - 2 file , I ca n’t believe it was built entirely from one Wikipedia sample .
It just does n’t sound authentic — like something a Yamaha keyboard churned out .
But it ’s the real deal , I can attest to that .
I combined the two harmony techniques , using both samples # 1 and # 2 , into the finished product .
It sounds more authentic but slightly less musical .
Still interesting .
So , to answer the question that nobody asked …
Can you Auto - Tune a vuvuzela ?
Yes , you can AutoTune exactly * one* vuvuzela and it will sound like a MIDI instrument .
Any more than that , and AutoTune will have more and more difficulty trying to determine the pitch .
Have a tip we should know ?

A prominent Houston attorney with a long record of winning settlements from oil companies says he has new evidence suggesting that the Deepwater Horizon ’s top managers knew of problems with the rig before it exploded last month , causing the worst oil spill in US history .
Tony Buzbee , a lawyer representing 15 rig workers and dozens of shrimpers , seafood restaurants , and dock workers , says he has obtained a three - page signed statement from a crew member on the boat that rescued the burning rig ’s workers .
The sailor , whom Buzbee refuses to name for fear of costing him his job , was on the ship ’s bridge when Deepwater Horizon installation manager Jimmy Harrell , a top employee of rig owner Transocean , was speaking with someone in Houston via satellite phone .
Buzbee told Mother Jones that , according to this witness account , Harrell was screaming , “ Are you fucking happy ?
Are you fucking happy ?
The rig ’s on fire !
I told you this was gonna happen . ”
Whoever was on the other end of the line was apparently trying to calm Harrell down .
“ I am fucking calm , ” he went on , according to Buzbee .
“ You realize the rig is burning ? ”
At that point , the boat ’s captain asked Harrell to leave the bridge .
It was n’t clear whether Harrell had been talking to Transocean , BP , or someone else .
On Friday a spokesman for Transocean said he could n’t confirm or deny whether the conversation took place .
He was unable to make Harrell available for an interview .
During hearings held late last month by the Coast Guard and the Minerals Management Service , Harrell denied any conflicts with his BP or Transocean bosses .
He said that he did not feel pressured to rush the completion of the well , even though the rig had fallen behind schedule .
Yet Buzbee ’s claims add weight to other statements that contradict Harrell ’s version of events .
Testifying before the Coast Guard and MMS panel last month , Douglas Brown , the chief mechanic on the Deepwater Horizon , said that on the morning of the day that the rig exploded Harrell had a “ skirmish ” over drilling procedures during a meeting with BP ’s “ company man , ” well site leader Robert Kaluza .
“ I remember the company man saying this is how it ’s going to be , ” Brown told the panel .
As Harrell was leaving the meeting , according to Brown , “ He pretty much grumbled , ‘ I guess that ’s what we have those pincers for , ' ” referring to the blowout preventer on the sea floor that is supposed to be the last resort to prevent a leak in the event of an emergency .
The blowout preventer failed following the explosion on the rig , causing the massive spill .
( Transocean ’s chief electronics technician , Mike Williams , also recalled the argument but named a different BP “ company man , ” BP ’s top official on the rig , Donald Vidrine ) .
In a statement to the Wall Street Journal , Transocean appeared to back the claims that Harrell had feuded with BP : “ The testimony certainly seems to suggest that [ Harrell ] disagreed with the operator ’s instructions , but what those were and why he disagreed are matters that will ultimately be determined during the course of investigations . ”
Other rig workers have also claimed that they were pressured by BP and their supervisors to cut corners .
Transocean roustabout Truitt Crawford told the Coast Guard that he overheard senior management saying that BP was “ taking shortcuts ” by replacing drilling mud in the well with saltwater , which would have provided less weight to contain the well ’s surging pressure .
Transocean ’s Williams told 60 Minutes that a supervisor had dismissed evidence that the well ’s blowout preventer had been damaged .
And workers with Halliburton , the well ’s cementing contractor , had complained that BP ’s use of cement “ was against our best practices ” and told the oil company that it would likely have “ a SEVERE gas flow problem ” unless the well ’s casings were centered more carefully .
Buzbee told Mother Jones that the sailor ’s version of Harrell ’s phone conversation following the explosion was corroborated by a statement from a second crew member who says he also overheard the call .
Both statements were taken in - person by Buzbee ’s investigator and safety consultant , who has interviewed some 60 people involved in the disaster , and signed by the witnesses , he said .
Buzbee declined to make the full statements available to Mother Jones because , he said , “ it is work product , meaning that it is something that I do not have to produce or disclose in litigation but that can be used at the right time in the litigation . ”
He added that he intends to take a deposition from the crew members at a later time .
Buzbee ’s case against the operators of the Deepwater Horizon is hardly his first foray into suing major oil companies .
After a BP refinery in Texas City exploded in 2005 , killing 15 workers and injuring dozens more , he won $ 100 million in punitive damages from the company .
In the wake of the 2002 shipwreck of the Prestige oil tanker , which devastated the coast of Galicia , he won a $ 70 million settlement from Spain ’s government on behalf of the country ’s Basque region .
And he ’s also nabbed $ 15 million from Transocean and $ 6.2 million from Halliburton for injured offshore oil workers .
Yet Buzbee is convinced that the Gulf oil spill lawsuit will be his biggest ever .
“ It ’s the grandaddy of all cases , ” he said .
“ This is going to define BP and whether BP survives .
This is going to be the biggest case in the history of the United States , no doubt about it . ”
Correction :
An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Buzbee won a $ 70 million settlement from the American Bureau of Shipping for its role in the Prestige oil spill off the coast of Spain .
The settlement came from Spain ’s government .
Ben Klemens has written a book , Math You Can't Use , on copyrights , patents and software , specifically on the problem of subject matter expansion in patent law in the last decade .
Klemens has thought of yet another convincing reason why software patents are counterproductive .
When I heard about the book , I asked him if I could share a chapter with you .
He , and the Brookings Institution , graciously agreed , and they picked Chapter 6 [ PDF ] , " The Decentralized Software Market " , which they have also put up on the Brookings Bookstore site if you prefer a pdf .
I know you guys , though , and I know some of you would rather read it here than click on a link , so here it is .
Keep in mind this is copyrighted material , not under the Creative Commons license .
I did n't know until they sent me the chapter that Groklaw is mentioned in a footnote . : )
I found it interesting , because it raised an issue I had n't thought of before .
Software is n't produced like tractors .
There are only a few tractor companies , relatively speaking , but almost every corporation has programmers inhouse , making software a decentralized market , with a lot of software being written specially for companies who are not in the software business .
How do you keep track of patents in that kind of atmosphere ?
It makes the patent process , which works well for tractors , counterproductive for most software , because it compels businesses to keep up to date on patents regarding their core business , whatever it is , and then on software too , which is being written by everyone out there , raising transaction costs :
If a technology needs a centralized group to help it advance , then it makes sense to design a mechanism to support those few specialized experts who push forward the frontiers .
In such a field , the patent - thicket problem is not a problem because there are only a few actors in the business , so the transaction costs of negotiating exchanges are low .
But this story is entirely removed from the reality of software .
A third of the industry consists of centralized organizations that only write software while the rest is largely a decentralized body of workers supporting themselves and their innovations through immediate , direct application rather than waiting to put out a product in the near future .
As far as Coasian arguments about transaction costs are concerned , this is absolutely the worst case , since buyers and sellers are distributed across the planet .
Because every patent is unique , there is no easy way to create a simple market to make patent trading cheap .
The rule that independent invention is not a defense in infringement claims makes sense in a centralized industry .
Patents are public record , and it is reasonable to assume that every tractor manufacturer is exerting some effort to watch every other such manufacturer .
In the decentralized software industry , this does not make any sense at all : should the sofa company spend time and effort on monitoring Microsoft and Novells patent portfolio ?
Add in the software patent search problems from chapter 5 , and the assumption that everyone has full knowledge of the patent playing field becomes still more tenuous .
In short , patents in a decentralized market are Coases worst nightmare : every player needs to expend vast quantities searching for the owner of every part of every program , meaning transaction costs piled upon transaction costs .
These costs will always exist in every field , but they are magnified in a dense , decentralized network of actors .
There is one segment of the software market that he says does benefit from patents .
Klemens : Patents favor the shrink - wrap market , which is the segment of the market likely to experience a decline .
In this context , software patent laws are among those that economists despise most : namely , laws that artificially prop up an industry in decline ....
From the perspective of society , and even the software industry as a whole , there is no need to protect the shrink - wrap segment of the market , or to change the rules to favor it over the labor - oriented segment .
Yet that is exactly what software patents do , at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars wasted in litigation .
Ben Klemens is a guest scholar at the Center on Social and Economic Dynamics at the Brookings Institution , where he writes programs to perform quantitative analyses and policy - oriented simulations .
He also consults for the World Bank on intellectual property in the developing world and computer - based simulations of immigration policy .
On the same subject of patents and subject matter expansion , PubPat.org has filed an amicus brief [ PDF ] with the Supreme Court in an important case currently pending before the Court , Laboratory Corporation v. Metabolite Labs , that involves the extent to which patents may cover abstract ideas , laws of nature and natural phenomenon .
As the Pubpat press release explains , " Supreme Court precedent states such fundamental truths and abstract thoughts are not patent eligible , but lower courts have ignored that precedent and held that ' anything ' can be patented . "
Here , then , is Chapter 6 .
If you like it and want to read more , you can buy the book at the Brookings Bookstore .
I 've coded it so that you can click on the footnotes and then click to come back to your place in the chapter .
One final word : some of what he writes in this chapter is ironic , not to be taken literally .
I mention that because I write with irony sometimes myself , and I know some people simply do n't get irony and tend to take it literally .
That results in distressed emails , which requires time to explain the joke and ... well , send all such email to him , please , not to me .

Math You Can't Use -
Patents , Copyrights , and Software
~ by Ben Klemens , Guest Scholar , Brookings Institution CHAPTER 6 The Decentralized Software Market
The world of software engineering is in no way restricted to software companies .
Beyond Microsoft or thousands of smaller software vendors , almost every corporation in the world keeps a stable of programmers in the basement to write little scripts that move the companys e-mail and make the add to cart button do what it should .
I am a programmer because I write simulations and statistical analyses .
Even you are a software programmer if you use the Record Macro feature of your spreadsheet or word processor .
The variety in types of software producers engenders two distinct methods of pricing software .
One , shrink - wrap pricing , derives from more ephemeral markets : software is sold by the unit ( packaged in shrink - wrapped boxes , for example ) at a per unit cost .
The other , labor oriented pricing , follows from an hourly wage or an annual salary paid to people in the basement who write code .
To give a music analogy : a band may record an album in the studio and then charge for each copy of the recording , or it can be paid for playing a live gig , and then audience members can bootleg the concert and listen at home for free .
Both are viable means of making recordings for the public and money for the band .
The latest accounting from the Bureau of Economic Analysis divides the software market into three parts : retail , consultants , and in - house , which are evenly split in the U.S. economy .
Of the $ 232.5 billion spent on software in 2002 , 32.6 percent bought prepackaged programs , 36.4 per cent custom - built ones , and 31.0 percent software written in - house .
Since patent law is built around traditional products that are much more homogeneous , it is worth considering what will happen when the law for primarily product - oriented markets ( such as drugs , machinery , and materials ) is applied to a market that is one - third product oriented , one - third service oriented , and one - third a mix of the two .
Comparative Advantage and the Programmers in the Basement A good company , according to the management self - help books , stays focused on its core functions .
If a company is good at making orange juice , it does not digress into selling autos , even if the owner knows an awful lot about cars .
But any business of more than a few people , regardless of its actual purpose , will need word processors , an accounting and inventory system attached to a database , a website , e-mail , and somewhere from one person to an entire department to take care of all that software .
By contrast , no companies have a drug manufacturer in the basement to make sure that the accounting department has all the Prozac it needs to function smoothly , and if the accountants find that off - the - shelf Prozac does not quite work , they cannot hire a chemist to hack , patch , or customize Prozac for the companys specialized needs .
Yet no matter how much work is shifted to Microsoft , SAP , or other contractors , it will always come down to the in - house information technology ( IT ) department to make sure the companys software is installed and working properly .
Although they are often invisible ( until something breaks ) , the people in the basement are an integral part of the software industry .
The Communists Are Coming !
What happens to the software in the basement after it is written ?
Most software is so entirely location and task specific that it is used once and forgotten .
Sometimes , however , it is so useful and new that the programmers in the basement form a company and start selling CDsin fact , this is how a number of shrink - wrapped software products started out : for example , the SABRE flight reservation system ( originally written at American Airlines , now owned by SABRE Holdings ) , the CADAM design program ( originally from Lockheed , now owned by CADAM , Inc. ) , the Eudora e-mail client ( written at and used by the University of Illinois , now owned by Qualcomm ) , or GAMS mathematical modeling software ( written at the World Bank , now owned by GAMS Development ) .
With increasing frequency , software is also being given away to anyone who asks .
Locking down a piece of software to license and sell it is just not worth the effort in the vast majority of cases if a company has a comparative advantage in selling insurance or sofas , what business does it have in software consulting ?
It may have some great programmers in the basement , but hiring a sales team , getting the legal department up to speed on software licensing , and finding new ways to distribute software instead of sofas is a stretch far beyond the companys primary comparative advantage .
If a company is not hoping to make big profits from a piece of software , its best bet is to go to the other extreme and open the code base entirely , allowing for free and open collaboration .
There are programmers in hundreds of basements who need a good database client .
One writes the core of a database client and puts all the code out for inspection .
Then another programmer , ensconced in another basement , finds that the code does what her company needs but has a few bugs , which she fixes .
In another basement , another wage slave finds that the code works well , except it is missing support for BLOBs ( binary large objects ) , so she adds that .
The process continues , as everybody contributes the feature that makes the code perfect in their eyes , until for the time needed to write a few functions everyone has a full - featured and well tested database .
Such collaboration in software dates back to when there were a handful of computers in the United States and a small community of programmers who knew how to work them .
Since then collaboration has become infinitely easier thanks to the Internet .
Although some would claim that the collaborative system is the latest trend , shrink - wrapped software sold at unit cost is the new business model in this field .
It may sound like wishful thinking , but the collaborative method has produced some very heavy - duty software .
As of September 2005 , 69.15 percent of web sites use Apache , a free program developed in about the same manner as just described .
As well as web pages , ones e-mail probably arrives via collaborative software ( either Sendmail or IBM sponsored Postfix ) , and all the computers involved found each other via the Internet addressing program that most servers use , Berkeley Internet Name Daemon ( BIND ) , which is also free software .
Such software goes by a variety of names , including free software , libre software , open source software , or the catch - all FLOSS .
A report assessing the popularity of FLOSS in three European countries has found some variation in its use : only 18 percent of establishments in Sweden use some sort of open - source software ; 31 percent do so in the United Kingdom ; and 44 percent do in Germany .
Sectors also vary greatly in this regard , with public sector organizations using more open source software than those in the private sector .
Thirty - six percent of the companies surveyed agreed with the statement ,  Our software developers are free to work on Open Source projects within their time at work ,  while 46 percent disagreed .
In other words , the plurality of companies insist that their employees work remain the companys property , but a large percentage of for - profit enterprises allow some of their employees work to be given away for free .
Open - source programmers are often characterized as hobbyists who are learning computer science or just having fun with pet projects of no real significance .
Although some of them would certainly meet that description , a reported 29 percent of Europes open - source programmers are paid for developing free software at work , and 24 percent are not paid for doing so but do it on company time anyway .
Add to this the 17 percent of developers who are students , and only a few remain who are developing open - source software in their spare time .
The European Commission study states that  the development of Open Source / Free Software is not at all a matter of leisure work at home .
Ninety - five percent of the sample claim that they use OS / FS at work , school , or university . 
Making Money on Free Software
A number of little companies use free software to make money .
For example , IBM sells mainframes , but if it can throw in free software that makes its mainframes powerful web and e-mail servers , then it can move more metal .
In a similar vein , Sun gives away Java .
Another name on the list of success stories is Red Hat , which provides consulting services for corporations and creates neat packages of free software for consumers .
Hans Reiser , designer of the best UNIX file system ( the reiserfs ) , sells features : he has a to - do list of a dozen features that he wants to implement in his file system , but when the president of MP3.com offered him tens of thousands of dollars to implement a feature necessary for MP3.com business , he quickly obliged .
MP3.com saved millions of dollars by switching to free software using Reisers free file system , and Reiser profited from what he would have done anyway .
Collaborative software is clearly a threat to the shrink - wrapped software market , because , as the saying goes , it has to compete with free .
But for the labor - oriented side of the market , the wealth of ready - to - download software merely creates new opportunities .
Free Software and Optimal Pricing
What does economic theory say about free software written by profit maximizing firms ?
It says that this behavior is efficient .
In a free and open market with many competitors , each unit of a good should be priced at the cost of producing that very unit ( that is , the marginal cost ) .
The first unit of software requires some amount of labor , and that needs to be compensated in full by paying the programmer a salary or wage .
The second unit can be produced at basically no cost , since it only needs to be copied , so a zero price for the second unit and beyond is what the theory predicts and can be shown to be efficient .
Meanwhile , shrink - wrapped software is not priced by marginal cost , but closer to average costspend a million dollars making the first CD , then make ten thousand copies and charge $ 100 for each of them .
Since vendors have a copyright on their work , their software will differ in enough ways from that of their competitors to allow them to charge well above marginal cost for their products .
In practice , of course , products are seldom priced at marginal cost .
Few goods in this world are truly standardized , and even among those that are ( corn of a certain grade , or government bond futures , for example ) , some units still sell at well above marginal cost .
The amazing thing about open - source software , from the perspective of the theoretical economist , is that it actually fits the theory .
Most markets experience problems that theory must ignore or explain away : inventories , shipping costs , transaction costs , massive up - front investments , and the risks those imply .
Given such imperfections , it makes sense to correct them by imposing laws that would otherwise be suboptimal a primary example being patent law , which solves the up - front investment problem .
But collaborative software actually fits the models : transaction costs are nil , investment problems are solved without patents , and one can actually apply the theories that predict optimality without apology .
For open - source software , patents solve an economic problem that had not existed to begin with .
Open Source and Patents
Not only do patents have no value or relevance to open - source software , but they have the potential to be a significant hindrance .
By definition , open - source software lacks a centralized body through which to obtain patents , not to mention lawyers to defend against patent threats ( although both IBM and Sun made limited pledges to support open source authors in some patent - related issues , and even Lloyds of London intends to sell liability insurance for servers running open - source software ) .
Adobe can sue Macromedia and vice versa , and both can afford to hire lawyers to keep them in business , but if anyone were to sue a collaborative project that does not have a patron backing it , the project would have no choice but to shut down .
The collaborative system depends on the source being open to all and making sure that everyone is free to modify the code .
People who intend the code to be collaborative have an ingenious method of making it so : they copyright the code and claim complete control over its use .
Then , in licensing out the code , they explicitly specify that users are free to redistribute or modify the code as they see fit , provided they do not impose their own restrictions .
Although there are dozens of such contracts to choose from , the standard one delineating these rules is the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) , where GNU stands for GNUs Not Unix .
Here is the key message from the GPL :  This program is free software ; you can redistribute it and / or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License . 
How would this work if some portion of the code were patented ?
If the patent - holder charges a licensing fee , the software cannot be costless any more .
If the software can be freely redistributed , the patent - holder must give up his or her right to limit distribution .
Since the software can be reworked into other applications , the patent holder even gives up the right to redistribution in a potentially wide range of applications .
Clearly , any patent - holder who wants to retain any vestige of control would not consent to a patent being used in GPLed code .
The GPL explicitly acknowledges that if a claim is asserted for patented code in a project , the project must shut down as a public endeavor :  If a patent license would not permit royalty - free redistributon of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you , then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program . 
In short , patents and collaborative software cannot coexist , and if the two collide , patents win .
Collaborative software does have one advantage over patents .
If a patent - holder threatens to shut down a collaborative project , the entire project may shift to finding prior art that would invalidate the patent .
With hundreds of people from diverse parts of the computer science world all focusing on searching for prior art , the odds are very high that something will turn up .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has used this strategy to locate prior art about items in its list of the worst software patents .
This approach still relies on a great deal of publicity , so if a specialized project receives a cease - and - desist letter or there is a flood of patent claims throughout the open - source community , the required critical mass of eyeballs required to find good prior art may not be reached .
Every web designer in the world could probably contribute something to a prior art search pertaining to Amazons infamous patent 5,960,411 , on one - click purchasing .
But if the GNU Scientific Library gets a takedown notice for violating one of the fast Fourier transform patents ( see page 63 ) , a far smaller population could come to the GSLs support .
Even if a community of users find prior art immediately , it still needs to be ruled upon by the courts or the U.S. Patent and Trade Office ( USPTO ) , which would take months ( in Internet Time , several centuries ) and may still fail on the details .
Many users would be too risk - averse to wait for the ruling and would stop using the technology until clarity is restored .
Much has been made of security risks to the Internet and the potential havoc a terrorist could cause by a well - placed worm , virus , or technical glitch that might bring down large parts of the network .
But here is the surest and simplest way to shut down the Internet : find a function or data structure in BIND or Apache that is under the scope of a patent , hire a lawyer , and start suing as many people as possible .
For BIND especially , there are few alternatives , and switching is technically difficult and who knows whether the alternatives are patent - free ?
Microsoft has even thrown out a few warnings that such lawsuits are inevitable for users of open source software .
Fortunately , the company provides its own operating system and server software ( IIS on Windows ) , which risk - averse companies can use to replace Apache on Linux , and provides indemnification protection by ( and from ) Microsofts legal department .
Indeed , at least one case ( J2 Global Communications v. Mijanda , Inc. ) has cropped up over alleged patent infringement by open source software used by the defendant .
Even a single function could lead to a patent suit , so lawsuit - averse programmers had best purchase function libraries from vendors instead of writing their own and glue them together using a purchased copy of Microsofts Visual Studio instead of a freely downloaded copy of the GNU Compiler Collection .
Perhaps the best bet is to simply stop writing programs entirely and purchase all software from those centralized vendors who own the patent thickets that can provide indemnification .
At one time , the labor market and the shrink - wrap market were in a balanced relationship : software companies sold their goods to the labor oriented side , which applied them to their projects , and everybody made money .
But now that there is a well - established and tested mechanism to allow the labor - oriented side to incrementally build the operating system and desktop - level software that is the specialty of the shrink - wrap vendor , the goods - oriented side of the couple has been spurned .
It is only natural that the goods - oriented side would use all of the weapons available to ensure that the labor side remains bound to the union .
Decentralization Another way to cast the difference between the goods - oriented and labor - oriented market is to say that the labor - oriented market is massively decentralized .
On one hand , there are only a few tractor companies , which maintain a full - time staff of the best and brightest .
If those central repositories of mechanical knowledge are not well supported , the tractor arts cannot advance .
There may be some inventive tinkerers cobbling together contraptions outside of these companies , but the vast majority of tractor technology is developed and supported by tractor vendors .
On the other hand , every basement of every corporation has its programmers , and they are producing fully operable software .
If I want a program to do any given function , say , convert document formats or implement a database , dozens or even hundreds of viable options are at my disposal , only a fraction of which were written by people at software companies .
The abundance of languages and libraries helps : for any given task , there are so many tools already in existence that a designer can have a basic running program rather quickly .
A wealth of database engines are lying around just for the taking , waiting to be built into larger devices ; the same certainly could not be said of tractor engines .
The structure of software also makes decentralized programming easy .
So long as he does not change the functions interface , a programmer can tweak , debug , and optimize the function implementation all he wants without affecting the other parts of the project that use the function .
This means that after the overall high - level design is done , there is little or no benefit to having all of the programmers in one place .
Of course , the fact that the product can be e-mailed instantaneously at zero cost helps as well .
I stress this decentralization because some pro-patent authors believe patent difficulties can be attributed entirely to the relationship between patents and open - source software .
Since open - source advocates are mere hobbyists on the fringe , they reason , one can safely ignore them and focus policy on the vendors of software .
As already mentioned , open - source software is neither written primarily by hobbyists nor produced on the fringe .
Even so , the central problem is not about open source , but about centralized versus decentralized production .
The best examples of decentralized production are indeed open source the Linux kernel was written by 418 programmers from 35 countries , on every continent but Antarctica but even the companies with a no - open - source policy have programmers in the basement working full time on code and software .
If a technology needs a centralized group to help it advance , then it makes sense to design a mechanism to support those few specialized experts who push forward the frontiers .
In such a field , the patent - thicket problem is not a problem because there are only a few actors in the business , so the transaction costs of negotiating exchanges are low .
But this story is entirely removed from the reality of software .
A third of the industry consists of centralized organizations that only write software while the rest is largely a decentralized body of workers supporting themselves and their innovations through immediate , direct application rather than waiting to put out a product in the near future .
As far as Coasian arguments about transaction costs are concerned , this is absolutely the worst case , since buyers and sellers are distributed across the planet .
Because every patent is unique , there is no easy way to create a simple market to make patent trading cheap .
The rule that independent invention is not a defense in infringement claims makes sense in a centralized industry .
Patents are public record , and it is reasonable to assume that every tractor manufacturer is exerting some effort to watch every other such manufacturer .
In the decentralized software industry , this does not make any sense at all : should the sofa company spend time and effort on monitoring Microsoft and Novells patent portfolio ?
Add in the software patent search problems from chapter 5 , and the assumption that everyone has full knowledge of the patent playing field becomes still more tenuous .
In short , patents in a decentralized market are Coases worst nightmare : every player needs to expend vast quantities searching for the owner of every part of every program , meaning transaction costs piled upon transaction costs .
These costs will always exist in every field , but they are magnified in a dense , decentralized network of actors .
Centralizing the patent search process ( by hiring centralized full - time patent search firms to support the decentralized programmers ) will not help much : searchers will still have to check every computational nut and bolt , and owing to the joys of mathematical abstraction , hundreds of patents like the singular value decomposition patent apply to hundreds of different fields .
Because any Turing machine can be applied to any effectively computable problem , computer science itself is a dense network of concepts , each one a step or two away from virtually every other .
To do a proper search , then , one would have to check almost every prior use of a Turing machine : in all , 170,000 patents and counting .
As an aside , the political landscape of software is a manifestation of the collective action problem : a centralized group that stands to gain significantly from a policy will lobby more vehemently than a decentralized group of many people who all stand to lose from the policy , and so inefficient political decisions are often made to please the most concentrated and vocal interests .
At the height of the European debate , centralized producers with large patent portfolios such as Adobe , Cisco Systems , IBM , and Microsoft spent a great many resources on lobbying the EUs decision makers .
The patent problems discussed in this chapter are not about open source ; they are about decentralization .
Software design was decentralized before open source became mainstream , and at least a third of the market , including a large subportion that does not open its source , remains decentralized .
Patents were not designed to cover goods produced by thousands of companies that do not even work in the industry in question .
There are many reasons to believe that they are not as good a fit for a massively decentralized system as for traditional centralized systems of production .
How Patents Affect the Bifurcated Market Patents primarily benefit the authors of shrink - wrapped software .
Returning to the music metaphor , the band that makes its money playing gigs needs no IP protection .
If fans do not pay at the door , they will not hear the music .
The band that focuses on CD sales depends heavily on IP protection , since copies of its CDs are near - perfect substitutes for the originals .
Similarly , the provider of a software product needs to differentiate his from that of others in order to charge a unit price greater than the near zero unit cost .
Copyright is sufficient for this , but as discussed in chapter 5 , patents as they exist today are so broad that a patent - owner can carve out sole ownership of a much larger part of the market than a copyright owner could .
Meanwhile , a strictly labor - oriented employee is more indifferent to IP protection : if the company does not pay at the door , then the programmer will withhold his or her labor no IP required .
As already mentioned , patents make the most sense and provide the most economic benefit in a system built around a few centralized vendors of goods .
Conversely , they make no sense at all in the context of a decentralized network of laborers especially if everyone has already found incentive to innovate in the need to do his or her own job better .
In real life , of course , the class of programmers does not bifurcate into those who provide only shrink - wrapped software and those who provide only day - to - day labor , but includes people whose work falls all along the range .
In the middle are a variety of consultants , who typically offer both software ( either off the shelf or custom made ) and implementation services .
To the extent that they differentiate themselves through their unique software , patents may help ; to the extent that they differentiate through high - quality labor , patents are irrelevant .
Just as some bar bands prefer to strictly control bootleg recordings and profit from their sale , labor - oriented providers may be able to profit from controlling the software they produce .
In the context here , there is potential for a labor - oriented programmer to turn into a product - oriented programmer .
However , recall the matter of comparative advantage : the sofa company is not oriented toward software sales or software patent licensing , and reorienting the business would be costly .
Meanwhile , vendors of shrink - wrapped software know the software market and need to make little or no extension to the main business to apply for and license software patents .
In short , software patents are designed for and can help shrink - wrap vendors but do nothing for the labor - oriented sector except to the extent that labor - oriented workers are or could become shrinkwrap vendors as well .
The Future of Software Allow me to make my predictions for the future of the software market .
Computer services overall will continue to expand , while the market for shrink - wrapped software will become a smaller part of the equation , and the market for programming labor will expand .
Of course , well - written shrink - wrapped software will always have a place in retail .
Apple has shown that there is much to be said for having a professional design team working on the look and feel of a product , while authors of open - source and task - specific software are famous for poor graphic design .
The open source code base is constantly expanding , but that is no help here : although programs written in the mid-1980s often work perfectly today , goods that have not had a design overhaul since then look terrible to modern eyes .
Retail firms that put their effort into a good user interface will always have a market .
Since consumers care much more about how their software looks and feels than database maintainers do , much of the demand is on the consumer side rather than the enterprise side .
If nothing else , there is the games market : gamers have an insatiable desire for the faster , flashier , and newer items .
However , games have no corporate clientele ( at least not while the boss is watching ) , so they will never garner the hourly wage programmers , and open - source hobbyists have never been able to develop the critical mass of people necessary to put together the art , storyline , game play , and rendering needed to make a top - notch game .
Even so , gaming software is not just small change : sales in 2004 totaled $ 7.3 billion .
There is more money yet in business software that nonprogrammers use ( such as word processors and spreadsheets ) , which falls somewhere between the two extremes of beautiful games and ugly - but - efficient back ends .
On the one hand , efficiency matters , but on the other , office workers are still human beings , and if they are going to spend a third of every twenty - four hours staring at a computer screen , it may as well look nice .
In this range , things could go either way .
To date , shrink - wrapped software has won out , because of aesthetic considerations and a strong focus on ease of initial use .
But it does not have to be this way : the Department of Defense could hire programmers to add eye candy to OpenOffice.org ( a collaboratively written office suite ) , and may still save money over licensing Microsoft Word .
Collaborative software is only getting better .
OpenOffice.org is already more than sufficient for writing letters and balancing a home users checkbook in a spreadsheet , and for all but the most demanding business uses .
Even the French national police force uses this software on its 80,000 PCs .
The code base for OpenOffice.org will not disappear .
If anything , the percentage of people who download free software that meets their needs is likely to expand in comparison with the percentage who spend a few hundred dollars on an office suite that does a little more and comes with animated characters .
People prefer familiar , tested software , which currently means proprietary products , but companies such as Google and municipalities such as the State of Massachusetts are using open - source software , so the getting - acquainted phase has already begun .
I expect that five years from now , collaborative software will be as familiar as the common brand names of today .
This is a looming threat for the shrink - wrap market , but neither a plus nor a minus for the labor market .
On the consumer side , there is only so much that users need a word processor to do .
Unless users can be persuaded to upgrade on a regular basis , software may be a one - time investment .
For example , I have many friends who use Windows 95 .
They admit it with shame , since the name clearly indicates that the software is a decade old .
Yet it still meets their needs and they see no value in the expense of upgrading .
At the same time , things always break , so individuals and companies will need IT professionals on hand long after the software licenses have been paid for .
I still get calls from my friends with Windows 95 , since problems continue to crop up at a regular pace .
By contrast , business computing needs are complex .
Corporations are no longer satisfied with a straightforward personnel database they want one that automatically makes hiring decisions the way the vice president would make them , that integrates seamlessly with the accounting database , and that has an interface on the companys website .
None of these things can be pulled out of a box ; a programmer who knows the company will have to be hired to implement them .
Authors of retail software can be located in Seattle , India , or anywhere in between .
As noted earlier , any competent programmer can implement any sufficiently detailed interface design , although a consultant hired to design the interface for a company is very likely to be on site , getting the lay of the companys virtual land .
With increasing outsourcing and offshoring ( todays software market buzzwords ) , the number of domestic programmers writing shrink - wrapped software will decrease , but there will be less effect on the domestic programmers writing customized software .
For all of these reasons , I foresee slower growth or even some contraction for shrink - wrapped software in the near future , whereas the market for custom programming labor will expand in close proportion to the increasing ubiquity and complexity of computing .
Back to Patents Patents favor the shrink - wrap market , which is the segment of the market likely to experience a decline .
In this context , software patent laws are among those that economists despise most : namely , laws that artificially prop up an industry in decline .
Like a spurned lover , the centralized vendors will fight to keep their portion of the market .
Stronger patent laws to bear down on decentralized labor are a primary weapon in the fight .
If the market does not stay as it is today but shifts further from the per unit model toward the labor model , it is hard to predict whether the total number of programmers will rise or fall .
Certainly , the information technology sector as a whole is not likely to suffer .
On a more abstract level , free software or task - specific software can be expected to add as much or more value than shrink - wrapped software , and authors in the software labor market are likely to match or outdo software vendors when it comes to innovativeness .
From the perspective of society , and even the software industry as a whole , there is no need to protect the shrink - wrap segment of the market , or to change the rules to favor it over the labor - oriented segment .
Yet that is exactly what software patents do , at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars wasted in litigation .

The naming of this type of software hints at some massive infighting among FLOSS advocates , even though they agree on virtually everything else .
In a recent interview (  Thus Spake Stallman ,  Slashdot , May 1 , 2000 [ slashdot.org/interviews/00/05/01/1052216. shtml ] ) , Richard Stallman , founder of the Free Software Foundation , takes pains to point out that I am not affiliated with the Open Source Movement .
I founded the Free Software Movement .
He reserves especial vitriol for the writing of leading open - source advocate Eric S. Raymond , perhaps because Raymond has said of Stallman :  As an evangelist to the mainstream , hes been one fifteen - year long continuous disaster  ( www.catb.org/~esr/ writings/shut-up-and-show-them.html ) .
The naming fight underscores the idea that the software should be free of licensing restrictions ( free as in speech ) rather than simply free of cost ( free as in beer ) .
The term FLOSS is a pleasing compromise because it forms a common , albeit irrelevant , word from all of the options .
Here , I refer to FLOSS as opensource  software because I think it sounds nicer and also use the term collaborative software to refer to the means of producing software in a decentralized manner even when the output is not free or open .

A disclaimer : when I wrote this sentence , I had in mind the maintainers of the GSL .
But the description of how open - source software can benefit all involved earlier in this chapter was so persuasive that I have since initiated an open - source project based on the statistical functions I use in my own work ( see apophenia.info ) .
Therefore , the problem of patent exposure now applies to me directly .

Normally , using a patented device is contributory infringement , which can be prosecuted in a manner similar to direct infringement .
But recall Judge Richs opinion in In re Alappat ( chapter 3 ) : to load a program onto a computer is to build a new machine , meaning that Mijada is directly infringing the patent , even though its employees may not have written a single line of the open - source program that is the core of the infringement claims .
