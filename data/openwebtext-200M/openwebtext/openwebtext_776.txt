WITH GOOVERNMENT BAILOUTS COME GOVERNMENT CONTROL
By Dr. Laurie Roth
February 6 , 2009

Where is the inner sense of restraint and personal accountability with our nation ’s financial institutions ?
President Obama said this week that he had imposed a cap on the senior executive salaries for messed up financial institutions .
Instead of the “ big dog talents ” getting several million a year in salaries and bonuses they are capped now at 500,000 , if they have received a bail out from the Feds .
In reading all about this I was troubled at our Government imposing controls on achievement and business regarding salaries , but I was more troubled and horrified that bank after bank would DARE beg for billions in tax funded bail out money and not pull salaries and bonuses dramatically back in themselves .
Why should we even have to mention this ?
When millions in the country are losing their jobs and / or homes , when many are feeling the singe of the flow of what may be a depression , the last thing we want to hear is bail out after bail out , golden parachutes of 10 , 20 or 30 million dollars reward for their failures , with an emergency speech thrown in .
I hate Government control and am most concerned about starting with common sense sounding controls with top executive salaries ( that makes total sense in a national emergency ) , but what will be the other controls , regulations and demands of business ?
Just recently , Dr. Jerri Corsi reminded us of the glowing thrill of the globalist / global warming crowd looking at all our national suffering and losses as a huge opportunity to insert and manipulate their change and solutions !
Do you get it yet ?
Misery and our losses are the golden parachutes of the far left , environmental psychos and globalist freaks !
They must have the struggle to swoop in while we are not noticing and collecting benefits .
Are we to hear in the month ’s ahead dictates on what cars the manufacturers are required to make regardless of national preference and practical reality ?
I say , yes .
Will we see the nationalization and control of our main banks as Europe has done and is doing ?
I say , yes .
Will we start to hear “ socialist ” speeches about us all cutting back , thus giving more taxes to the Government to solve endless emergencies ?
Salaries might need to be cut everywhere and business achievement and profit swiped bit by bit , of course for the betterment of a troubled society .
Watch it unfold .

Yes , there should be significant salary limitations and spending requirements if a troubled company receives national financial aid , but a way to independent achievement and reward , not prolonged Government control , taxation , litigation and regulation !!!
Ronald Reagan said it best many years ago and was right !
“ Big Government is not the solution .
It is the problem . ”
It ’s amazing what happens when powerful minds get together .
Take this episode of “ Fox and Friends , ” during which conservative luminary Glenn Beck quotes Jack Bauer , an imaginary person from the land of TV make - believe , to prove the righteousness of torture .
Genius .
According to Media Matters , Fox ’s “ 24 , ” the realm of Mr. Bauer , is a go - to resource from which conservative pundits frequently draw all sorts of important facts .
Media Matters :
Data is what drives almost every business today .
The internet has given us the ability to gather and analyze vast amounts of information .
Unfortunately , it has also opened us up to new threats .
Cyber threats are worse than they have ever been .
If you think that trend is going to slow down , think again .
Reports estimate that we will see up to up to $ 6 trillion in damages by 2021 because of cybercrime .
You need to be aware of the cyber security issues in 2020 if you want to keep your business safe .
Below are nine of the biggest threats you need to keep an eye on .
1. Advanced Phishing
It used to be easy to spot a phishing attack .
Hackers did n’t have much information about you .
The best they could hope for was generic emails .
Things have changed now that most people talk about their lives online .
All someone needs to do is look at your public profiles to get all the information they need .
A hacker can begin personalizing their phishing emails once they have this information .
This will make it harder to spot phishing attacks .
2. Internet Of Things
Smart home technology has made home management more accessible than ever .
The problem is that your devices need to be online to make this happen .
Unfortunately , not all smart home companies have the best security in their products .
This means several security risks go with installing them in a home .
There are too many internet - enabled products coming onto the market for security researchers to find problems with .
Expect to see hackers take advantage of this and use your smart home as a way to break into your network .
3. Cryptojacking
The rise in cryptocurrency has gotten many people excited .
A lot of people made a lot of money in a short amount of time .
Everyone is trying to jump on the bandwagon .
Some of those people are n’t doing things the right way .
They are developing malicious browser extensions and software to take advantage of other devices .
These attacks happen when malicious software makes use of your device ’s processing power to mine cryptocurrency .
The hacker ends up making cryptocurrency at the expense of the lifespan of your devices .
4. Third - Party Attacks
The role of information technology has changed a lot over the past several years .
Most businesses do n’t house all of their infrastructure themselves anymore .
They rely on third - party cloud services for tools and storage .
A business will use these services to save time and money .
This also means that companies do n’t have control over the security procedures on the other side .
They have to trust that their partners have put the safeguards in place to protect their data .
Hackers are likely to continue targeting cloud services as a result .
They can target multiple businesses at once , instead of focusing on one at a time .
Companies who work with others will need to work with a firm like Cinch I.T. to make sure things are as secure as they can be .
You do n’t only have hackers to worry about online anymore .
Foreign countries are amping up their online efforts to build cyber divisions .
The next several years will see a rise in state - sponsored cyber attacks .
Governments are at the most risk to these attacks .
They will see public infrastructure and sensitive data be targeted in an attempt to disrupt the country .
Unfortunately , the private sector is also at risk .
Expect espionage to be a growing concern as governments attempt to steal the intellectual property of tech businesses .
6. Artificial Intelligence
There has been a lot of advancement made in AI during the past few years .
It ’s becoming a vital part of many of the products people use every day .
However , consumers are n’t the only people benefiting from these advancements .
There are new AI tools that are giving hackers new capabilities during attacks .
Instead of figuring out everything themselves , hackers can use AI to look for vulnerabilities without any oversight .
All they need to do is boot up their tool and let it run .
7. Deepfakes
Deepfakes were harmless when they first started .
It is a technology that you can use to create content that appears real automatically .
It did n’t take long for someone to take this technology and begin abusing it .
Deepfakes have become a serious problem with fake news .
People create false stories that spread misinformation that helps their own agenda .
It ’s being used to manipulate people and governments .
Things are going to get worse in 2020 and beyond .
Hackers will begin to create fake identities and use them to commit fraud and gain access to things they should n’t have access to .
8. Insider Threats
As security has gotten better , hackers have needed to look for more straightforward ways to compromise businesses .
This has caused them to start using the employees of companies as an access point .
Insider threats are expected to become more commonplace in the future .
These threats can happen on purpose or by accident .
An accident happens when an employee exposes something they should n’t .
They can leave an access point open to a database , or leave a note with their password lying around .
Intentional threats are caused by employees looking for monetary gain .
They will receive bribes from hackers or take your business information and sell it to the highest bidder .
9. Ransomware
Ransomware started simple enough .
You download a malicious file , and that file encrypts all your data with a password .
You have to send a payment to the hacker to get the password for your data .
Today , ransomware creators are getting more creative .
They are now taking your information and threatening to release if you do n’t send payment .
This method gives criminals two ways to collect money from your business instead of one .
Do n’t Underestimate Cyber Security Issues In 2020
Businesses can’t afford to ignore cyber security issues in the future .
Cyberattacks are getting more sophisticated every year , so make sure you understand the risks to your business .
The more you prepare now , the safer you ’ll be in the long run .
Once you secure your network against attack , you can start adding more technology to help your business grow .

Entry into the Land of the Free is still free The Foreign Office is warning that thousands of tourists could be turned away at US airports and ports , as a new online entry system comes into effect .
From 12 January , visitors from countries which do not need visas will need to fill in an electronic form at least 72 hours before they travel .
Those who have not registered risk being detained and sent back home .
The Foreign Office fears some people do not know about it and critics say it might put people off visiting the US .
The new online registration scheme replaces the green I - 94 forms that people on short term visits to the US had to fill in on the flight and hand to customs on arrival .
Security approval America welcomes nearly 60 million tourists a year and about 50 million of those travel without the formality of a visa .
Britain is one of the countries that signed up to the visa waiver programme , but from Monday , new rules apply .
Electronic applications - known as Esta ( Electronic System for Travel Authorisation ) - have to be approved by the US Department of Homeland Security .
The Foreign Office is concerned that people who may not have heard of Esta and booked their trip before enforcement of the new rule may be caught out
FO spokesperson
Once an application is approved , it will be valid for all visits to the US for a two - year period .
The US Embassy in London said so far 99.6 % of the applications have been approved - most within four seconds .
Michael Restovich , from the US Department of Homeland Security , said : " We want to keep the bad people out .
We do n't want to restrict commerce , we do n't want to restrict tourism .
" We want to make sure the people getting on that aircraft or that sea vessel are clear to come to the United States and are risk - free . "
The Foreign Office said it was " particularly concerned that people who may not have heard of Esta and booked their trip before enforcement of the new rule may be caught out " .
Andrew Spice , of Post Office Travel Services , said : " Problems may also occur if UK tourists travel to the US via another country - like Canada or the Caribbean Islands - and do n't realise they will need the Esta to gain entry . "
British business leaders say they have been reassured over the measures Neal Weston from the British Air Transport Association , which represents UK - registered airlines , such as British Airways and Virgin Atlantic , said its members who fly to the US were fully prepared for the new system .
No charge Abta - the Travel Association - believes it will help speed up the immigration process .
Frances
Tuke , from Abta , said it had been reminding members about the Esta deadline for several months .
" We would advise people thinking about going to the US to fill in Esta before booking or as soon as they book because if it is rejected , it can take up to six weeks to get an appointment at the US embassy for a visa , " she said .
She recalled British singer Yusuf Islam , formerly known as Cat Stevens , who was sent back to London from the US after his name was found on a " watchlist " in 2004 , and said the new system should help prevent such incidents .
With an extra layer of very intrusive bureaucracy , I think a lot of people will be deterred , if not simply confused
Travel expert Simon Calder Esta is free but she warned that searches for Esta online brought up numerous websites offering to process the application in return for personal details and a fee .
Critics say it will be an inconvenience for business travellers and could prove a disincentive to people who like to travel spontaneously and book last - minute weekend breaks to US cities .
Simon Calder , travel editor of the Independent , said : " There are many , many draws the United States has but with an extra layer of very intrusive bureaucracy , I think a lot of people will be deterred , if not simply confused . "

The years of " irrational exuberance " that have characterized the current economic cycle have culminated in a profound crisis in both the banking system and financial markets , a crisis that threatens to trigger an acute , global economic recession .
A central feature of the recent period of artificial expansion was a gradual corruption , on the American continent as well as in Europe , of the traditional principles of accounting as practiced globally for centuries .
To be specific , acceptance of the International Accounting Standards ( IAS ) and their incorporation into law in different countries ( in Spain via the new General Accounting Plan , in effect as of January 1 , 2008 ) have meant the abandonment of the traditional principle of prudence and its replacement by the principle of fair value in the assessment of the value of balance - sheet assets , particularly financial assets .
In this abandonment of the traditional principle of prudence , a highly influential role has been played by stock brokers , analysts , investment banks ( fortunately now on their way to extinction ) , and in general all parties interested in " inflating " book values in order to bring them closer to supposedly more " objective " stock - market values , which in the past rose continually in an economic process of financial euphoria .
In fact , during the years of the " speculative bubble , " this process was characterized by a feedback loop : rising stock - market values were immediately entered into the books , and then such accounting entries were sought as justification for further artificial increases in the prices of assets listed on the stock market .
In this wild race to abandon traditional accounting principles and replace them with others more " in line with the times , " it became common to evaluate companies based on unorthodox suppositions and purely subjective criteria that in the new standards replace the only truly objective criterion ( that of historical cost ) .
Now , the collapse of financial markets and economic agents ' widespread loss of faith in banks and their accounting practices have revealed the serious error involved in yielding to the IAS and their abandonment of traditional accounting principles based on prudence , the error of indulging in the vices of " creative , " fair - value accounting .
It is in this context that we must view the recent measures taken in the United States and the European Union to " soften " the impact of fair - value accounting for financial institutions .
This is a step in the right direction , but it falls short and is taken for the wrong reasons .
Indeed , those in charge at financial institutions are attempting to " shut the barn door when the horse is bolting " ; that is , when the dramatic fall in the value of " toxic " or " illiquid " assets has endangered the solvency of their institutions .
However , these people were delighted with the new IAS during the preceding years of " irrational exuberance , " in which increasing and excessive values in the stock and financial markets graced their balance sheets with staggering figures corresponding to their own profits and net worth , figures that in turn encouraged them to run risks with practically no thought of danger .
Hence , we see that the new standards act in a procyclic manner by heightening volatility and erroneously biasing business management : in times of prosperity , they create a false " wealth effect " that prompts people to take disproportionate risks ; when , from one day to the next , the errors committed come to light , the loss in the value of assets immediately decapitalizes companies , which are obliged to sell assets and attempt to recapitalize at the worst moment , i.e. , when assets are worth the least and financial markets dry up .
Clearly , accounting principles that , like those of the IAS , have proven so disturbing must be abandoned as soon as possible , and all of the accounting reforms recently enacted ( specifically the Spanish one , which came into effect January 1 ) must be reversed .
This is so not only because these reforms mean a dead end in a period of financial crisis and recession , but especially because it is vital that , in periods of prosperity , we stick to the principle of prudence in valuation — a principle that has shaped all accounting systems from the time of Luca Pacioli at the beginning of the 15th century to the adoption of the false idol of the IAS .
In short , the greatest error of the accounting reform recently introduced worldwide is that it scraps centuries of accounting experience and business management when it replaces the prudence principle , as the highest ranking among all traditional accounting principles , with the " fair - value " principle , which is simply the introduction of the volatile market value for an entire set of assets , particularly financial assets .
This Copernican turn is extremely harmful and threatens the very foundations of the market economy for several reasons .
First , to violate the traditional principle of prudence and require that accounting entries reflect market values is to provoke , depending upon the conditions of the economic cycle , an inflation of book values with surpluses that have not materialized and which , in many cases , may never materialize .
The artificial " wealth effect " this can produce , especially during the boom phase of each economic cycle , leads to the allocation of paper ( or merely temporary ) profits , the acceptance of disproportionate risks , and , in short , the commission of systematic entrepreneurial errors and the consumption of the nation 's capital to the detriment of its healthy productive structure and its capacity for long - term growth .
Second , we must emphasize that the purpose of accounting is not to reflect supposed " real " values ( which in any case are subjective and which are determined and vary daily in the corresponding markets ) under the pretext of attaining a ( poorly understood ) " accounting transparency . "
Instead , the purpose of accounting is to permit the prudent management of each company and to prevent capital consumption , by applying strict standards of accounting conservatism ( based on the prudence principle and the recording of either historical cost or market value , whichever is less ) , standards that ensure at all times that distributable profits come from a safe surplus that can be distributed without in any way endangering the future viability and capitalization of the company .
Third , we must bear in mind that market value is not an objective value : in the market , there are no equilibrium prices that a third party can objectively determine .
Quite the opposite is true ; market values arise from subjective assessments and fluctuate sharply , and hence their use in accounting eliminates much of the clarity , certainty , and information balance sheets contained in the past .
Today , balance sheets have become largely unintelligible and useless to economic agents .
Furthermore , the volatility inherent in market values , particularly over the economic cycle , robs accounting based on the " new principles " of much of its potential as a guide for action for company managers and leads them to systematically commit major errors in management .
Moreover , if this state of affairs is serious for a financial institution , it is much more so for any of the small and medium - sized enterprises , which make up 90 percent of the industrial base .
Fourth , we must remember that the abolished accounting standards already stipulated that in the additional notes of the annual report , stockholders be informed as of a certain date of the market value of the largest assets ; but this in no way affected the stability nor the traditional principles of prudence demanded by any accounting assessment of the different entries in the balance sheet .
Furthermore , the accounting standards abolished were prudent and anticyclic , and they allowed for provisions to cover all sorts of contingencies , provisions sadly missing now .
Conclusion
Just as " war is too important to be left to the generals , " accounting is too vital for the economy and everyone 's finances to have been left to the experts , whether they be visionary professors , auditors eager to strengthen their position , analysts , ( ex - ) investment bankers , or any of the manifold international committees .
All have been as arrogant in the defense of their false science as they have been ignorant of their role as mere sorcerer 's apprentices playing with a fire that has been on the verge of provoking the most severe financial crisis to ravage the world since 1929 .
After all the victories we ’ve seen in the realm of marijuana law reform and the recent election , it is now time to act !
According to the NORML blog , “ The election of Barack Obama , coupled with Democrat control of both the House and the Senate , presents a unique and critical opportunity for federal marijuana law reform . ”
A vast majority of you voted to change the laws regarding marijuana arrests ; now is the time to make sure your vote does n’t go unnoticed .
Obama ’s transition team has established a website recently with an agenda of things to be addressed once Obama is in office .
Looking at the current list , I was upset to see that Marijuana Law Reform is not even mentioned .
Thankfully , the website has a page asking for OUR ideas to help solve challenges facing our country .
That means it ’s up to us to get Marijuana Law Reform on the list !
All you have to do is go to the page linked above to contact Obama and his transition team , and demand change of the current marijuana policy .
Thanks to the wonderful people at NORML , you can even include the three suggestions below :
1. President Obama must uphold his campaign promise to cease the federal arrest and prosecution of ( state ) law - abiding medical cannabis patients and dispensaries by appointing leaders at the US Drug Enforcement Administration , the US Department of Justice , and the US Attorney General ’s office who will respect the will of the voters in the thirteen states that have legalized the physician - supervised use of medicinal marijuana .
2 . President Obama should use the power of the bully pulpit to reframe the drug policy debate from one of criminal policy to one of public health .
Obama can stimulate this change by appointing directors to the Office of National Drug Control Policy who possess professional backgrounds in public health , addiction , and treatment rather than in law enforcement .
3 . President Obama should follow up on statements he made earlier in his career in favor of the decriminalization of marijuana by adults by calling for the creation of a bi-partisan Presidential Commission to review the budgetary , social , and health costs associated with federal marijuana prohibition , and to make progressive recommendations for future policy changes .
As if this has n’t been said enough – This is the time for change !
I cannot urge you enough to write this letter to the President Elect and get Marijuana Law Reform on the agenda .
You already showed that it ’s what you want by voting for it in the election – Now is time to make your voice heard and tell them why and how !

Royal Bank of Scotland has suffered the biggest loss in British corporate history – more than £ 24bn – and admitted today the taxpayer could end up owning 95 % of the bank if its losses continue to mount .
The troubled bank needs to sell up to £ 19.5 bn new B shares to the taxpayer in order to insure £ 300 bn of its most troublesome assets .
As a result , the taxpayer 's voting rights over the bank would increase to 75 % from almost 70 % now .
But Stephen Hester , the new chief executive , said the government 's " economic interest " could rise to 95 % " depending on how things work out " .
On a conference call with reporters this morning , Hester said he " wanted to be honest and clear " on the government 's stake because " we live in an uncertain world " .
But the voting influence of the taxpayer would be restricted to 75 % , he said .
The scale of the losses suffered by the bank exacerbated the row about a pension worth nearly £ 700,000 a year being drawn by former chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin , who is 50 and left last month after almost a decade at the helm .
Chancellor Alistair Darling said this morning that the government had asked Goodwin to waive the pension , which threatens to undermine government claims that it would not reward failure .
Hester said today the payments were part of the contractual entitlement to Goodwin and were agreed by the government at the time of the initial October bail - out .
The figures from RBS showed a statutory loss of £ 40bn , which falls to £ 24.1 bn if technical issues relating to the bank 's acquisition of ABN Amro are ignored .
It largely comprises £ 7.8bn of trading losses and £ 16.8 bn of writedowns caused by paying too much for acquisitions , notably ABN .
The City had been braced for £ 20bn of writedowns so the overall loss is slightly lower than expected .
But Derek Simpson , joint leader of Unite , said : " These historic and humiliating losses bring into sharp focus just how recklessly RBS 's former management team have behaved .
" The whole country is paying the price through job cuts and repossessions on a massive scale .
It is time to take control and fully nationalise this bank .
" You cannot have a state bail - out on one hand while allowing the spectre of thousands of job losses to loom over staff on the other , " he said .
Hester today set out the detail of the radical restructuring he intends to undertake to try to set RBS back on a course to recovery .
He outlined seven goals , which involve the bank shrinking by 20 % , and did not dispute speculation that up to 20,000 jobs from a 177,000 workforce could be axed .
The goals were to :
• Shift £ 240 bn of assets to a non -core division for disposal / run down over three to five years ;
• Deliver substantive change in all core division businesses ;
• Centre on the UK with smaller , more focused global operations ;
• Radically restructure global banking and markets operations , taking out 45 % of capital employed ;
• Cut more than £ 2.5 bn from the group 's cost base ;
• Have access to the government asset protection scheme ;
• Push forward major changes to management , processes and culture .
Hester said : " Our aspiration is that RBS should again become one of the world 's premier financial institutions , anchored in the UK but serving individual and institutional customers here and globally , and doing it well . "
The bank 's offices in 36 of the 54 countries in which it operates around the world will be cut back or sold .
But major " global hubs " will remain .
New chairman Sir Philip Hampton made a fresh apology to shareholders .
Last year their shares were trading at 400p .
In early trading today they were 28.1p .
Hampton said : " An inevitable but regrettable consequence of the successive capital - raising exercises has been the dilution of the interests of existing shareholders .
My predecessor , Sir Tom McKillop , apologised to shareholders for the impact on them of the erosion of their investments , a sentiment I echo .
Those of us now charged with leading the group are committed to implementing measures which will allow us to restore the group to standalone financial health in the interests of all shareholders . "
The bank also took a £ 7bn charge to cover impairment of loans that have turned sour .
Executives had spent much of the night locked in talks about the Asset Protection Scheme to insure £ 300 bn of its most troublesome assets .
In turn the bank will issue £ 13bn of the new class of B shares and a further £ 6.5 bn at a later date to pay for the scheme , which forces the taxpayer to take on additional risk .
In return , RBS will lend an extra £ 25 bn this year and a further £ 25 bn next year to try to kick start the economy .
The fee will be spread over seven years in the bank 's accounts .
Bank of England governor Mervyn King told MPs today that it was " impossible to tell " how much capital the banking sector actually needs .
" In large part it will reflect developments in the world and our own economy that are impossible to predict with any precision , " King told the Treasury select committee .
Hester confirmed Nathan Bostock had been hired from Abbey National to run the assets which will be disposed of or shut down .
Gordon Pell , a long - standing board member , is also delaying his retirement and being appointed deputy chief executive .
According to 2008 data from the Nielsen Company , the Xbox 360 , PS3 , and Wii are not the most used console in terms of usage minutes .
Sony ’s PS2 actually leads the way and commands 31.7 % of total minutes spent .
Strangely , only about 38 % sessions are spent on next - gen systems .
Two other relatively old systems – the Xbox and PS3 – are hanging in as well .
The GameCube stands at the end of the pack with 4.6 % of usage minutes , but the original Xbox stands at 9.7 % which is a bit more than the PS3 .
The complete standings are as follows : PlayStation 2 ( 31.7 % ) , Xbox 360 ( 17.2 % ) , Wii ( 13.4 % ) , Xbox ( 9.7 % ) , PlayStation 3 ( 7.3 % ) , GameCube ( 4.6 % ) , Other ( 16.2 % ) .
Some of this data might be related to the number of consoles sold .
The PS2 commands the majority yet is n’t really considered a next - gen system .
One possible case could relate to the install base behind the console .
The same goes for Wii – There ’s a good chance that most casual gamers own the Wii , so they ’re probably not going to sink their teeth into a huge adventure like Zelda or Super Mario Galaxy .
Of course , none of these assumptions / guesses have been proven to be correct .

Few days ago I ’ve posted a question on Stack Overflow and it went ballistic .
Few thousands views and two dozen answers later I ’ve got my answer : Smalltalk is still in heavy use today , primarily by professionals in various businesses .
Ranging from transport logistic ( OOCL ’s IRIS - 2 ) and financial services ( JPMorgan ’s Kapital ) to web professionals using either Aida / Web or Seaside web frameworks for developing complex web applications .
While some answers exposed difficulties when using Smalltalk , most of them were void after some explanations .
Smalltalk was presented as right choice for demanding and complex environments where high flexibility , robustness and speed of development are main requirements .
I encourage you to read all answers and consider Smalltalk as a possible solution for your next projects .
Thanks to all who answered my question .

Last week , the North American anime distributor Funimation completed a company - wide restructuring that led to staff reductions .
The magazine Video Business reports that in total , about 20 Funimation employees were laid off , along with about 30 people who worked directly for Funimation 's parent company , Navarre Corporation .
Navarre 's general counsel , Ryan Urness , confirmed these figures with the magazine .
Some of Navarre 's affected departments reportedly included the financial , information technology , and operations departments ; this cut represented about 7 % to 8 % of the corporation 's workforce .
Funimation Senior Public Relations Manager Jackie Smith confirmed with ANN that about 20 layoffs occurred within the company , which had about 140 employees beforehand .
Smith also stressed that " the production department was not affected and fans should not be concerned about current or future productions of their favorite series . "
Children 's lives are being impoverished by the government 's insistence that schools focus on literacy and numeracy at the expense of creative teaching , the biggest review of the primary school curriculum in 40 years finds today .
Labour has failed to tackle decades of over - prescription in the curriculum and added to it with its own strategies in literacy and numeracy , which take up nearly half the school week , the Cambridge University review of the primary curriculum found .
Children are leaving school lacking knowledge about the arts and humanities having spent too many years " tied to a desk " learning times tables , the head of the review , Robin Alexander , said .
" Our argument is that their education , and to some degree their lives , are impoverished if they have received an education that is so fundamentally deficient , " he said .
The report says schools should be freed of Sats and league tables to allow them to make more decisions about what and how they teach .
The compulsory daily act of worship should be reviewed and a curriculum that values knowledge and understanding as well as basic skills should be brought in , it says .
Independent of the government and funded through charitable donations , the review is based on three years of academic research , 29 research papers and dozens of public meetings around the country .
It marks 40 years since the last wholesale review of primary education and presents a blueprint for a curriculum that would give teachers control of 30 % of their time to teach what they want .
Teaching unions , headteachers and major educational bodies all backed the plans , setting the government on a collision course with schools if it fails to consider the proposals .
The review finds :
• Children are losing out on a broad , balanced and rich curriculum with art , music , drama , history and geography the biggest casualties .
• The curriculum , and crucially English and maths , have been " politicised " .
• The focus on literacy and numeracy in the run-up to national tests has " squeezed out " other areas of learning .
• The Department for Children , Schools and Families and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority , which sets the curriculum , have been excessively prescriptive , " micro- managing " schools .
The review accuses the government of attempting to control what happens in every classroom in England , leading to an excessive focus on literacy and numeracy in an " overt politicisation " of children 's lives .
Despite this too many children still leave primary school having failed to master the 3Rs .
Sats have also narrowed the scope of what is taught in schools , it claims , concluding : " The problem of the curriculum is inseparable from the problem of assessment and testing . "
Christine Blower , acting general secretary of the National Union of Teachers , said the proposals " have depth , credibility and , above all , respond to the realities of the primary classroom " .
Mary Bousted , general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers , said : " Rather than continue to tinker around the edges of primary education we would like the government to heed the proposals and reopen the debate about the purposes of primary education . "
The DCSF said the report would be considered by Sir Jim Rose , who has been commissioned to review the curriculum concentrating on " workable recommendations for change ... in order to give teachers more freedom and flexibility " .
" Ed Balls [ schools secretary ] has made it clear that he wants it to be the most fundamental review of the primary curriculum for a decade , " the DCSF added .
" Sir Jim will publish his findings later this year . "
At the end of a production run of cars , there are inevitably bits and pieces left behind which are n't assembled and have to be taken off the production line in the boxes they came in .
When production on the Jaguar E - Type ended at Browns Lane in 1974 , just such a thing happened , and a Jag fanatic picked up those truckloads of leftovers and kept them — for 31 years .
When he got tired of being their steward he sold them to an enterprising fellow who thought of another Jag fanatic who might be able to make something of these parts .
Turns out the kit was complete enough to finish one final 1974 Jaguar E - Type V12 .

With truckloads of parts and a buyer in mind , then - owner Mike Wilkinson went to go see Ray Parrott , enthusiast and restorer extraordinaire .
Together they took an exhaustive inventory of the parts included in the leftovers and discovered that about 95 % of the components needed to actually build an original car were there .
Ray of course could not pass .
Parrott set to work assembling the car in his Essex home , using his detailed knowledge of the car and his fully assembled Series 3 for reference along with shop and original assembly manuals .
The idea of actually putting brand new , still in the packaging parts of a thirty year old car together for the first time is astonishing .
Things like the mild - steel exhaust system were still perfect , the dashboard came pre-assembled just as it would have in the factory , even the Dunlop tires were original and in perfect , new condition .
Bolt holes matched exactly , there was no grime to clean out , no rust to remove , nothing to strip and paint and prime .
More or less , a car guys wet dream .
Ray meticulously undertook the work over the course of eight months and when he fired it up and took it for a first drive , it was as if it were rolling off the assembly line for the first time — because it was .

The car has been tested by the Ministry of Transportation and is awaiting its VIN and chassis numbers along with legal registration , which he has been assured will be awarded .
So from a pile of parts forgotten and stored Ray Parrot is now the proud owner of E - type number 72,530 .

Petric 's lawyers argued he was not guilty of murder on insanity grounds
A US teenager killed his mother and wounded his father in revenge after they took away his violent computer game , a judge has ruled .
The defence team for Daniel Petric , 17 , had argued his addiction to the Halo 3 game , in which players shoot invading aliens , had made him insane .
But the judge rejected this , saying he had planned revenge for weeks .
Petric , of Ohio , was tried as an adult and faces a maximum possible penalty of life in prison without parole .
On the night of the shooting in October 2007 , Petric used his father 's key to open a lockbox and remove a 9 mm handgun and the game , the court heard .
His father Mark , who was shot in the head and survived , testified that his son came into the room and asked : " Would you guys close your eyes ?
I have a surprise for you . "
He said he expected a pleasant surprise .
Then his head went numb from the gunshot .
The Associated Press news agency reports that Microsoft , which owns the intellectual property for the game , declined to comment beyond a statement saying : " We are aware of the situation and it is a tragic case . "

6:45 AM —
As the sun rises and the protesters wake from their uncomfortable sleep , there is an air of excitement about and anticipation of the coming day .
I overheard one woman say , “ I ’m more scared about missing class then getting arrested ! ”
The leading organizers have been prepping for upcoming negotiations and figuring out what exactly they want to say to the administration .
The admins will be meeting at 8 AM to discuss their options .
Stay tuned to this post all day for a liveblog with your bleary - eyed , fake - journalist broski .
6:52 — So much for the dining hall employees not crossing “ picket lines . ”
I just spoke to a chef who told me he ’s going to go ahead and prep for the day unless his boss calls him to tell him not to .
So Kimmel Marketplace still could be open .
TBNYU people are worried they might try to open the gates , breaching their barricade .
Full coverage after the jump .
7:01 — WSN has some nice historical context for this protest here .
7:11 — The coffee is brewing .
Everyone is crowded around .
Someone just said , “ Can this coffee come out of this thing any slower ? ”
7:17 — Organizers plan on contacting the union around nine to keep Kimmel workers from coming to work and disrupting the sit-in .
( They want them to be paid , though . )
Needing coffee really bad .
7:22 — Some faces among the crowd .
I asked them all , “ What do you hope will be accomplished today ? ”
Peter Wirzbicki — NYU Grad Student —
“ It ’s part of a fight to make NYU more democratic in two ways : making the institution more reponsive to the people who are part of it , pay for it and making it more affordable so it ’s a feasible option for lots of different types of people . ”
Eleanor Kahn — Gallatin ’09 — “ All of the demands , of course .
I know that they will .
And students everywhere feel inspired to hold people accountable for what they do . ”
Maria Lewis — CAS ’ 11 — “ Budget disclosure , endowment disclosure … ”
She rattled off all of the demands faster than I could write them all down again , then continued , “ Above all , well , maybe not above all , that we can be a catalyst for student power across the state and across the world . ”
7:35 — The negotiating team :
7:54 — Some Office of Student Affairs people just rolled in and they were talking about photos on NYU Local .
Now I know all you NYU admins are reading this .
If you have anything you want passed through to the people working here , drop a comment or send me an email at charlie@wnyu.org .
Do n’t be shy , JSex .
Bob Butler , executive director of OSA , chatting with the occupants .
From mid-barricade :
8:00 — I ’m kinda hoping a SWAT team busts in .
That ’d be crazy .
8:04 — New video stream up here .
It ’s recording right next to me .
If you want me to shout you out , drop a comment .
8:08 — The Aramark dining hall workers are here , but are n’t planning on working , according to TBNYU folks .
They are waiting for confirmation from their union ( Local 1102 ) before they go home and get their hazard pay .
8:10 — Reports are coming in that the third floor is totally shut off .
Apparently the elevators can’t stop here and there is no stair access .
8:23 — It ’s a beautiful day for an occupation .
8:26 — There will indeed be a rally at 12 PM today , in front of Kimmel Center .
There will be a press conference at that time as well .
Kimmel officially opens in 4 minutes .
8:37 — TBNYU is hoping to have Kimmel 3rd floor balcony access for their press conference at noon , as I touched on last night .
Uncertainty abounds .
8:58 — The initial meeting between administrators is currently taking place on the 6th floor of Kimmel , an admin told me .
They will send Bob Butler down after that meeting to update TBNYUers .
9:04 — At this point , there is no slow down in the kitchen — it looks ( for now ) that the dining hall is set to open on schedule .
TBNYU is calling the union right now to try to stop the opening .
9:08 –2 more students trickled out to class or work .
There are only around 50 people in the room at this point , if that .
It ’ll be interesting to see if the dwindling ranks have an effect on negotiations .
9:20 — Cleaning time .
9:30 — By my count , there are 47 people here , including me and the NY Times reporter .
As you can tell by my posts , not much is happening right now .
It ’s a waiting game .
9:37 — Some men in coats came and asked , “ How many of you are vegan ? ”
When pressed for answers on why they asked that question , they hedged and said Bob Butler would come let us know soon .
They denied being members of the sixth floor administrative meeting .
Perhaps more delicious vegan chocolate chip cookies are coming our way ?
9:42 — Sounds like Kimmel will open for lunch .
There may be a limited menu , though .
Also , one of the men in coats was Owen Moore , Aramark ’s director of dining services here at NYU .
So the chance of food delivery is increased .
9:47 — @ Alex G : Um , what ?
We broke this story well before WSN and have discussed every major development from the beginning .
If you prefer slower updates with boring writing , I guess my “ paper - thin live - blogging trash ” would n’t be interesting to you .
9:58 — Protesters start taking more precautions .
First , cover up security cameras .
10:08 — @ Eric : I think they ’re trying to make it harder for the SWAT team .
10:11 — The smokers are going crazy .
They have n’t been able to smoke since around 9 last night .
One guy just said to me , coffee in hand , “ When I get a cigarette in me , I ’m gonna pass out from ecstasy . ”
10:29 — Negotiations beginning now .
10:35 — I have been informed by the girl who dislikes me ( “ fucked up ” comment last night ) that I am not allowed to listen to the negotiations because I am here as press and not as an activist .
I did catch the first part — no concessions to open the balcony for smokers / press conference .
Not a good start …
10:43 — Sounds like this is more technical stuff — not broad demand negotiations .
Aramark ( NYU ’s dining service contractor ) is willing to supply food , but a TBNYU protester just told me that some people are n’t OK with that because “ Aramark uses prison labor . ”
So they are trying to find a way to have friends be allowed entrance to deliver food .
Here are the only photos I managed to snap before I was sent away :
10:59 — @ Eric : Yes , Bob Butler is here .
The preliminary negotiation is continuing , and there is a meeting starting now ( figuring out the upcoming plans ) .
11:03 — Access denied .
11:06 — Just got a text : “ Ps fuck this bobst shit !
I do n’t want randoms creeping on me in the stacks ! ”
11:08 — Very serious , quiet meeting .
I ca n’t hear anything from where I ’m sitting .
From the video feed chat : “ the only incentive is that they want to look mildly decent to the media , which is why they are n’t pepper spraying kids ”
11:14 — Via Gothamist comment section : “ send in the Crips , Bloods , and Latin Kings to broker peace ” LOL
11:28 — Still waiting for word from meeting .
I ’m guessing not much is happening .
Rally still planned for noon / 12:15 .
My 6 x zoom makes me feel closer to the action :
11:41 — From the comments : “ one of the terms of NYU ’s purchase of the tamiment collection was that the community was allowed access .
so if you enter the library , go to the window on the left and ask for a pass to go up to tamiment , they ’ll give you a sticker and you can go anywhere in the library . ”
Can anyone confirm this ?
11:54 — Confirmed .
Also , I just got shredded again by another TBNYUer that I had n’t met yet .
She warned me of posting anything from their “ highly sensitive ” meeting .
Of course , I was in the corner and could n’t hear , so why ream me out ?
She apologized after I explained my position .
Here ’s what I know : “ There will be a meeting outside ” Kimmel at 12:15 .
No confirmation of where that meeting will be held .
I ’ve been cut off from a lot of info .
Will bring you as much as I can .
12:00 PM — Something ’s brewing .
Also , everyone seems really bothered by the Bobst demand .
Here are my thoughts : first , it seems unnecessary to open Bobst to the public when New York has the best public libraries in the country .
It ’s not like you ’re missing out when you go to them .
And if you need particular info for research , I ’m sure Bobst allows you in .
That said , I sense that this demand is one of the most likely to be met by the administration ( along with granting Kimmel room rental priority to students ) .
We may well see Bobst opened up a lot more .
Thoughts ?
12:08 — Via Gawker comments : “ I will support their cause if they can get me into the magical NYU Chik - fil - A ”
Brief “ Democracy Now ! ” coverage .
12:15 — Students have begun to congregate in front of Kimmel in preparation for upcoming press conference .
12:27 — The delay of the press conference seems to be caused by a desire to wait for more students to gather out front .
12:45 — Straight up ridick .
There is a girl topless outside standing by the barricade .
Lots of people .
No press conference yet .
12:54 — A TON of students just bum rushed the door and busted into the room .
Lots more people here now .
Video to follow .
12:57 — Exuberant mood here now .
About 25 people got in past guards .
1:26 — Got put on the chopping block in a meeting , but TBNYU decided to keep me around .
Might have something to do with the fact that everyone ’s reading this coverage .
Talking with Press Person Emily Stainkamp right now about food delivery , press conference , and broader goals .
1:30 — Follow us on Twitter .
1:42 — Press conference is no more ?
Apparently it was just a rally .
It ’s still happening — here ’s an interview taking place on the street .
And negotiations are taking place at the door .
Bob seems pissed that new students busted in — he wants any non-NYU students out of the building .
Things are escalating .
1:48 — Video of break in :
1:50 — BREAKING : TBNYU breaks open door to balcony .
Rallying supporters now .
2:05 — So before all hell broke loose , I sat down with Emily Stainkamp ( CAS ’ 11 ) to talk about how food was going to get in here .
She told me that NYU made a “ bizarre ” and “ paternalistic ” move by “ [ offering ] to bring [ them ] food . ”
TBNYU said that the food would have to be vegan and NYU agreed .
But then TBNYU decided that it could n’t accept food from Aramark because the “ outsource to prison labor . ”
Stainkamp said , “ Why ca n’t our friends just bring us food ?
… Our food , our space . ”
NYU said “ they would talk to their people . ”
So there is currently no food , and with the added development of people breaking into the occupied area and breaking through the balcony door ( dead bolt ! ) , it seems unlikely that there will be any .
Hoo -wah .
2:21 — Press conference and rally scheduled for 5 PM in front of Kimmel again .
2:22 — Just ate my first food of the day ( part of the little bit remaining in here ) .
Vegan chocolate chip cupcake .
I can tell it does n’t have eggs .
But it ’s food .
Yum .
2:25 — This is no surprise , but suspension / expulsion have now been threatened .
As far as I know , pepper spray and SWAT assault are still possibilities .
2:28 — TBNYU hate blog spawned .
Also , I just heard the extremely impatient pizza lady from Kimmel bitching about having to work at Weinstein some today .
Kimmel >>
Weinstein .
2:49 — It ’s calmed down a bit .
More photos to come .
The protesters were just dancing again , to Lauryn Hill .
Say what you want about the dancing , but do n’t you dare hate on Lauryn .
She jamz .
2:52 — BREAKING : Between 20 and 40 guards just entered Kimmel .
Fear is setting in .
2:55 — Gmail chat with a friend giving advice to TBNYU : “ … Kidnap J - Sex , hold him for ransom ….. 1 million hugs and the budget ” LOL
3:00 — Deep thought :
There have been no serious negotiations yet .
I ’m guessing there are n’t ever going to be ?
3:04 — Enjoying this coverage ?
Please digg it .
3:15 — Here ’s what TBNYU and the protesters have requested : a student rep for direct negotiations ( and no go - between ) , permission for a group to travel to tonight student Senate Council meeting , permission for delegation of student Senators to come to Kimmel for talks , permission for food ( vegan ) to be brought by friends , permission to enter the balcony .
Here ’s what NYU granted : Nothing .
Zero zilch zip nada .
They ’ve also closed the 3rd floor “ officially ” and are only granting access to students with class in the building or students attending a specific event .
They also said that Kimmel closes at 1 AM and that TBNYU has no authorization to be here after 1 .
And they stressed that any breaches of conduct ( like breaking the door and entering the balcony ) WILL have consequences .
Oh , and remember the non-violence / no property destruction statement ?
Revised .
Only non-violence applies .
Property destruction is now OK .
Oh , hey , they broke onto the balcony .
Hmm …
3:21 — People are back on the balcony cheering and waving .
3:26 — Bob just offered TBNYU protesters a meeting for five students with Linda Mills , the senior Vice Provost , and Lynne Brown , senior Vice President of University relations .
The offered the meeting at 5 , but the condition was that all of the protesters had to leave by 4 .
Unsurprisingly , TBNYU declined the offer .
TBNYU offered to meet at 5 , as scheduled , but refused to vacate .
The university declined the offer .
The plan is to push forward with the press conference / rally at 5 .
Here ’s TBNYU ’s take on the standoff .
3:50 — Citrus flavored powerbars are NASSSTY .
This girl was intrigued by my crouching at the window :
4:01 — In case you did n’t believe me about the topless girl , let there be PROOF !
4:02 — I just overheard someone say , “ Nah , we ’re not getting expelled .
I have no plan B . We ’re not getting expelled . ” o.O
4:22 — Student Senators on the scene — TBNYU negotiators just left the occupied area to sit down with the Senators and negotiate ( ? ) / talk .
Negotiators leaving the occupied zone .
4:32 — Protesters attempt to get food :
Yes , that is a bucket on a rope hanging over the 3rd floor balcony .
No , they have n’t acquired any foodstuffs .
4:38 — Just saw these dudes across from my blogging spot in Kimmel :
Anti-riot cops ?
SWAT SWAT SWAT SWAT SWAT ??
They definitely have abnormally large helmets .
4:49 — Press conference coming up in 10 minutes .
People are already flocking to Kimmel .
4:58 — Chant begins : “ Disclose it / Get off it / Put students over profit ”
5:02 — Conference underway .
“ We will not stand for these scare tactics ! ” ( referring to threats of expulsion ) .
“ We demand the administration negotiate with us now ! ”
Lots of people :
There are even more now .
5:09 — Protesters just asked for support from crowd all night , particularly at 1 AM at which time they are supposedly illegally here .
@ Kat : Ohhhh .
It was way more fun thinking they were riot cops .
Pony cops , huh ?
I guess that ’s kinda funny on its own .
5:13 — More indignant anger .
“ Show me what democracy looks like .
THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE . ”
Do n’t you just want a pitchfork and an inextinguishable torch ?
5:22 — Still happening …
5:26 — @ Brett : No !
Without interwebs , I am nothing .
Rally is over .
Deep thought :
Now what ?
5:30 — I ’ve been pretty lax on anonymous commenting today , but I ’m getting posts from Anon ( anon@anon.com ) .
Fail .
You gotta at least show me you ’re trying .
5:31 — “ I have absolutely nothing new to report from the Senate meeting . ” — TBNYUer
Intrapost poll —
Should I stay or should I go ?
You want to see this through to the end ?
Discuss .
5:42 — Resounding calls for me to stay .
I ’m not worried about getting in trouble — the administration knows who I am and knows I am a journalist .
@ John : Yea , the press conference / rally is over .
5:44 — Thanks for the support , everyone !
I ’ll be here for now .
Currently I ’m being kept out of their disciplinary meeting .
More pics coming soon .
5:49 — Dining hall staff just said they have mashed potatoes and chicken .
I ca n’t really explain to you how phenomenal that sounds right now .
I might pass out from ecstasy .
( LOL @ smokers )
However , I ’m willing to bet that TBNYUers wo n’t accept the food .
I , however , will accept the food .
Maybe I can get the whole pans of food to myself .
5:55 — New signs up in the occupied zone :
6:08 — No. Way .
TBNYU just voted to accept the food .
OMG so hyped .
Tables are being removed from the back of the barricade to serve up the delicious comida .
Look at those potatoes .
Not Vegan = MORE FOR ME .
6:11 — Gawker drops bombs .
6:19 — Overheard : “ My Mom called me a terrorist once . ” “ Your mom ? ” “ Yeah . ”
Unadulterated beauty :
Looks like a god damn advertisement .
Deep thought :
What if it ’s poisoned ?
6:27 — The only thing that would improve this meal is a Diet Coke .
6:31 — @ Chris Schenk : Ipecac ?!
Come on , that ’s not a nice thing to wish on anyone .
6:40 — @ Chris : Yea , bathroom privileges since the start .
Also , @ Johnathan :
Any citation for that statement ?
That would be big news .
6:45 — Terrific meal .
Just stellar .
Everyone is on their cell phone hiding from me .
I ’m going on a fact - finding mission .
6:57 — @ Madeline : I was thinking the same thing .
At the appropriate moment I ’ll start a 3rd post .
7:20 — New thread .
Go here .

If we know our readers , then we 're guessing fashion dominates your every thought .
But how far would you go to be wearing the absolute latest and hottest looks ?
Would you wear something knowing it could , at some point , kill your ass ?
6 The Crinoline
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
The crinoline is a hoop skirt that women in the 19th century wore under their actual skirts .
It was made from horsehair and thread or steel , and the whole purpose of the huge apparatus was to make the skirt look more ... skirt - like .
Also , since you were basically wearing a cage around your legs , you could probably use the crinoline to trap small animals and kick them to death .
How It Could Kill You :
The steel crinoline was actually so deadly it 's amazing this thing was ever worn at all .
Because of its design , it was quite susceptible to gusts of wind .
There are tales of women on piers that were swept up and carried out to sea , where they promptly drowned due to having a fucking steel cage tied to their waists .
It was also a bad idea to hang around cliffs or tall buildings in this sort of contraption .

The skirts would get entangled in the spokes of carriages , presumably dragging the women screaming down the street .
Then there was the less obvious dangers , such as knocking over candles .
Do n't laugh ; the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow 's second wife went up in flames this way , and she was n't the only one .
Wait , it gets worse .
In 1863 in Santiago , Chile , between 2000 and 3000 people died in a church fire .
When a gas lamp lit the veils on the walls , people tried to run outside , but the width of the women 's skirts blocked the door , and crinolines with women inside piled up in front of the exit , making an escape impossible even for the people who'd been smart enough not to wear hoop skirts .

What the Fuck Were They Thinking ?
The crinoline , in making someone 's ass look big , would also make their waist look smaller , and so women did n't have to wear a corset .
Why would they take such extravagant measures to avoid that ?
Well ...
Described by Brazilian poet Olavo Bilac as “ the last flower of Latium , wild and beautiful ” , the Portuguese language is about to change .
As of 1st January 2009 , the reform of its spelling begins to be implemented in Brazil over a four year adaptation period until the new rules are completely enforced .
The same rules will eventually be implemented in Portugal , where the changes will be phased during the next six years , and also in the other 6 countries where Portuguese is an official language : Angola , Cape Verde , East Timor , Guinea - Bissau , Mozambique , São Tomé and Príncipe .
The latest Portuguese orthographic agreement was signed in 1990 by seven out of eight Portuguese speaking countries .
It intends to unify the two current orthographic standards and was meant to go into effect after all signatory countries had ratified it .
However , by the end of the decade only Brazil , Cape Verde , and Portugal had done so , although in Portugal the change was passed into law only in May 2008 .
Brazil , which has nearly 80 % of the Portuguese speakers in the world , is the first to implement it .
The spelling changes will affect about 1.6 % of the words in the European norm ( also adopted in Africa ) and 0.5 % in the Brazilian spelling .
Across the Lusophone world , many linguists , philologists , politicians , journalists , writers , translators – and of course bloggers – do not quite understand the need for , or agree with , the international treaty meant to improve the language 's international status through a single official orthography .
The debate is a heated one , but most bloggers seem to be on the same side .
“ A sign in both Chinese and Portuguese in Macau , China .
Actually , “ 主教座堂辦公室 ” ( in Chinese ) or “ Cartório Da Sé ” ( in Portuguese ) means “ The Office of the Cathedral . ” By Wikimedia .
Starting with Portugal two petitions ( 1 and 2 ) collecting thousands of signatures calling for the suspension of the implementation are being evaluated by the National Assembly .
There , the reform is perceived as a “ abraziliament ” of the language with no real advantage for the other countries .
It is also claimed that the new spelling rules disagree with the way the Portuguese people pronounce words .
A Portuguese citizen who has grown up in Macau , Ricardo José [ pt ] has taken an extreme decision :
Um país não é um hino ou um desenho numa bandeira .
Um país é a sua língua e é a sua cultura .
E se um conjunto de políticos se arroga o direito de interferir na língua que é minha , contra aquilo que caracteriza a cultura dos cidadãos dum país , servindo interesses que não os dos portugueses , então repudio - os , porque já não são mais políticos de Portugal .
A partir de hoje e para sempre , se este acordo não tiver retrocesso , o meu voto será sempre público e será sempre o mesmo : votarei em branco .
A country is not an anthem or a flag design .
A country is its language and culture .
And if a group of politicians claims the right to interfere in a language that is mine , against what characterizes the culture of the citizens of a country , serving the interests of other [ people ] than the Portuguese , then I reject them , because they are no longer politicians of Portugal .
From now on , if this agreement has no retreat , my vote will always be public and will always be the same : I 'll cast a blank vote .
In fact , for what has become known as Brazilian Portuguese , changes will be kept to a minimum , and some bloggers have adopted them already [ pt ] .
However , the majority of people are not happy with the reform either .
A doctor of the Portuguese language , Marcelo Leite [ pt ] , for one , seems to agree with the views of the blogger above , adding that the reform was an agreement which has much more to do with political and economic interests than language issues .
Na verdade , fizemos a comunidade lusófona engolir a maioria das regras para se unificar em nome de uma unidade lingüística que , assim como o Godot , de Becket , fica sob uma árvore esperando .
Podemos até escrever do mesmo jeito , mas o que nos faz tão distantes , tão distintos não está na grafia das palavras , mas em uma herança cultural que , fora a língua , nos separa por mais de um oceano .
E acho que essa diferença é que é o legal da coisa .
In fact , we have made the lusophone community swallow most of the rules to unite in the name of a linguistic unity that , like Becket 's Godot , have been waiting under a tree .
We can write in the same way , but what makes us so far apart , so different , is not so much in the spelling of words , but in a cultural heritage that , language apart , separates us far more than an ocean .
And I think that this difference is the cool thing .
Eugênio Costa Almeida [ pt ] , from Angola , agrees with the Brazilian blogger that a game of power is at play and wonders how this reform can be implemented in language prolific Africa :
Como será que a CPLP vai descalçar esta bota , bem apertada , quando há países que ainda nem ratificaram a nova ortografia , como Angola e Moçambique , sendo que o primeiro , ao contrário de Moçambique e Guiné - Bissau , já tem quase mais falantes em português que nas próprias línguas nacionais .
How will the CPLP [ Community of Portuguese Language Countries ] take off these very tight boots , when there are countries that have not yet ratified the new spelling , such as Angola and Mozambique , considering that the first , unlike Mozambique and Guinea - Bissau , has almost more Portuguese speakers than of their national languages .
Talking about Mozambique , Nyikiwa [ pt ] thought that the country should stop models that much of the time are not in line with their reality :
A questão do acordo ortográfico , quanto a mim mostra claramente que a população não é consultada , nem ouvida .
A população apenas serve para votar .
Na verdade quem ratifica os documentos quer a nível nacional , quer a nível internacional são os dirigentes , que ignoram o facto de haver diversas culturas e diversos comportamentos no seio de um povo que aparentemente é homogéneo , quiça entre povos de diferentes culturas e comportamentos ?
Julgo que está na hora de antes de se avançar para esse tipo de acordos , se ausculte o povo e se faça ouvir suas ideias .
The spelling reform issue , I think , clearly shows that the population is neither consulted nor heard .
The population is only good to vote .
In fact , those who ratify documents , either at national level or international level , are leaders who ignore the fact that there are different cultures and different attitudes within a nation that is seemingly homogeneous , what about between peoples of different cultures and behaviors ?
I think it is time for , before moving on to such agreements , the people to be heard and that their ideas are voiced .
“ – Here 's to the spelling reform !
– Poor thing , he is dyslexic and is ever so happy with the multiple spelling words .
He says that he will never make a mistake again . ”
A cartoon against the agreement by Foram - se os Anéis .
Virgílio Brandão [ pt ] , from Cape Verde , is not too happy either – the blogger also says that apart from Portugal and Brazil , the other Portuguese speaking countries had no say in the process – as if “ these other speakers did not exist ” :
Não existem senhores nem donos da língua ; nem é preciso , em boa verdade , um acordo ortográfico como o que se tenta impor às comunidades falantes do português .
Até porque , até me demonstrarem o contrário , a diversidade é um bem estimável .
É por essa razão – para não estarmos presos a um desejado e sub- reptício império da língua – que a língua cabo- verdiana deve ser implementada como língua de trabalho ao nível internacional .
Se somos independentes , que o sejamos em tudo , caramba !
Quem não tem coragem de fazer o que é preciso , que dê lugar a quem tenha .
É , para os cabo- verdianos , uma questão bem mais importante do que aparentemente possa parecer .
There are n't misters or masters of the language ; nor is it needed , truth be told , a spelling agreement like the one trying to be imposed on Portuguese speaking communities .
Because , until I am shown the contrary , the diversity is highly desirable .
It is for that reason – for us not to be tied to a desired and surreptitious empire of the language – that the Cape Verdean language should be implemented as the working language at international level .
If we are independent , we should be so in everything , dammit !
He who does not have the courage to do what is needed , should give way to those who have it .
It is , for the Cape Verdean people , an issue far more important than it may seem .
Portuguese is a Romance language originating in what is now Galicia and northern Portugal .
During the Portuguese colonial empire , the language spanned around the world : from Brazil to Goa to Macau , in China , where it still is one of the official languages .
Nowadays , Portuguese ranks 6th in a list of languages according to number of native speakers , which makes it one of the world 's major languages , with an estimated 240 million speakers in virtually every continent .
It is spoken by about 187 million people in South America , 17 million in Africa , 12 million in Europe , 2 million in North America , and 0.61 million in Asia .

A UFO Explanation
As I 've said before , UFO 's are real !
Yes , there are Unidentified Flying Objects .
They may be extraterrestrial , but before we draw that conclusion , maybe we should look at some terrestrial explanations ?
Consider this link .
19 articles refer to the UFO in the video at the right .
What could it be ?
News articles appeared in India , Croatia , the UK , the US , and many other places .
Seems like a big deal !
Could this be the smoking gun that UFO buffs have sought for years ?
Do we finally have proof positive that we 're being visited by otherworldly creatures ?
Consider this bit from the Telegraph UK article :
... the unidentified black metal object stands out clearly against the blue sky , where it can be seen darting up and down for more than 10 minutes .
So they know its 1 ) black , 2 ) metal and , 3 ) darting .
Let 's take these one by one .
1 ) Black .
Well , it appears to be black , but from a video clip backlit by the sun , it could be any number of colors .
A minor point , to be sure .
2) Metal .
So , how do they know it 's metal ?
Was it attracted to magnets ?
Did someone hit it with a photospectrometer ?
I can't see any way to determine the objects composition from this video .
3 ) Darting .
Someone could have possibly described this behavior , but from the video they linked to , it 's impossible to tell if the object is moving or if the camera is moving .
The zoom is set to such an extreme level , the slightest shaking of the camera would make the object seem to move quickly .
Now consider this next video .
Think that might explain it ?
I think it might .
I often ask ghost hunters how they know they 're seeing ghosts and not aliens .
I 've heard things like " it feels like a ghost " and " someone died here , so ghosts make more sense " and even " it does n't look like an alien . "
But honestly , we do n't know what these things are , or what they look like .
If something strange is happening in your basement , and you can't explain it , I posit that aliens are as likely an explanation as ghosts or gnomes , trolls , unicorns , or even snuffleupagus .
We love to have answers , and when answers are n't readily available , we tend to make them up .
Undefined terms like " alien " and " ghost " are convenient scapegoats for explaining strange things .
And yet assigning such labels should give us no comfort ; the add no information , no predictablilty , and no course of action .
As an alternative , I suggest people learn to be comfortable with the phrase " I do n't know . "
In fact , I think I might make some T - shirts that say that , just to get people aware of the idea .
Brandon Darby , co-founder of Common Grounds , has publicly admitted to working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and being responsible for the arrest of two activists from Austin , Texas .
On Monday he wrote an open letter in explanation of his actions , though the letter does not disclose many details .
In the letter , Darby defends his choice to work for the FBI , admitting that he was not approached by them , but that he actually took the initiative himself when he began disagreeing with his affinity group ’s tactics and increased militancy .
He wrote that the government is not out to silence dissent or take down activists , but that they merely intend to stop crimes from taking place .
[ social_buttons ]
It is not clear exactly how long he has worked for the FBI for or how many people he gave information on , but it appears that he has been an informant for about two to three years .
His information led the to the arrests of David McKay and Bradley Crowder , who are charged with making Molotov cocktails which they allegedly intended to use at the Republican National Convention protests in St.
Paul this past summer .
Activists say that Darby actively encouraged and provoked the two men , who he had n’t even met yet , to take illegal action .
It is also being speculated that his information may have had something to do with the arrests of eight activists who were rounded up before the week of RNC protests could even begin .
The activists , known as the “ RNC 8 ” , are being charged with four felony counts each .
Many of his peers defended him before he was officially outed , saying that Darby would never spy on his fellow activists and that doing so would be completely against his ideology .
Darby disagreed , saying in his letter ( which he ironically signed “ In Solidarity ” ) that his ideology supports his choice , a choice he “ strongly defends . ”
I feel the need to editorialize and say that I find the idea of a fellow activist volunteering himself to the FBI to be quite scary .
Becoming an informant is always abhorrent , but even more so when it is done gladly .
This man says he did not spy on his friends to cut a deal or to make money — he did it because he honestly thought it was the right thing to do .
This may make him slightly less despicable than those who break their ethics for money , but it has frightening implications for radical organizers .
If activists cannot trust one another with tactics and secrets , who can be trusted ?
I am strictly opposed to violence , but I believe very seriously in solidarity .
If I disagree with someone in my affinity group , I use the framework that radicals have created to let that person know how I feel .
I expect the same in return , and it literally hurts my stomach to know that people who do work as good as Darby did would turn to the federal government , who is not exactly known for its adherence to pacifism , in order to resolve tactical disputes .

Why do men love breasts ?
In BLONDES I describe the most interesting and promising theories — from the Freudian ( breasts remind men of Mom ) to the evolutionary ( breasts resemble buttocks and prehuman ancestors mounted from behind ) , and the reproductive ( breasts are an indicator of age and big breasts are a marker of high estrogen levels ) .
These are some of the most likely reasons why breasts are beloved even in cultures that do n’t eroticize them any more than the face .
A new spin on the male fascination with breasts came up this week in John Tierney ’s interview with neuroscientist Larry Young on love blockers .
According to Young , “ more frequent sex and more attention to breasts could help build long - term bonds through a ‘ cocktail of ancient neuropeptides , ’ like the oxytocin released during foreplay or orgasm . ”
The same oxytocin circuit , he notes , is activated when a woman nurses her infant .
The article does n’t connect all the dots , but the suggestion is as follows :
The hormone oxytocin is released when breastfeeding , making the mother feel good and helping her bond with baby .
Sucking and caressing a woman ’s breasts during foreplay may also trigger oxytocin release .
When oxytocin hits the brain , women become more trusting and attached .
Men evolved to pay attention to breasts as a means of attracting and retaining lovers .
The “ boobs help bonding ” theory may not be the strongest explanation of why men love breasts , but it ’s worth introducing to the debate .
That said , I strongly suspect that there are many women out there for whom a lover ’s suckling does nothing — and there are many breast - ogling guys who know nothing of foreplay .
Back in the 1980 ’s , when I was a student , I was also an avid shortwave listener ( SWL ) .
This was in the days before the web , satellite TV or 24 - hour international cable news coverage .
I had an upper floor room in Cabot Hall , and each night I would surreptitiously dangle out the window a 40 - foot wire antenna attached to a small weight .
At first I listened only to the big broadcasters like the BBC Word Service , Deutsche Welle , Radio Moscow , and then moved on to smaller ones : Tirana , Malta , South Africa , etc .
It was a great way to get a global perspective beyond the 2 - minutes allocated to international news on a typical US - based evening news program .
Eventually I started writing the broadcasters and received many QSL cards .
Some of my letters were read on the air .
I ’m sure I ended up on some FBI watch list for those letters to Radio Prague and Radio Havana .
My subscription to Soviet Life magazine , and a Cambridge address probably did n’t help either .
But you do n’t go far as a SWL before you notice that there are a lot of strange things going on in the aether .
Some were easily explained — the Soviet Union jamming broadcasts of Voice of America or Cuba jamming broadcasts of Radio Martí .
And then there were the commercial voice broadcasts , ship - to - shore , international aviation , time signals , etc .
Then the various data services , radio teletype , weather fax , etc .
And then there were the mysterious coded transmissions , which we rumored to be SAC tranmissions , “ Sky King , Sky King , Do not answer ” , followed by various authentication codes , which were either recall or go ahead codes for nuclear attack .
It was an eerie feeling , in the hotter days of the Cold War , to lay awake at night , listening to the radio and wondering whether the sun would rise in the morning .
Now I just wonder if my 401 ( k ) will still be there .
Stranger yet were the cryptic transmissions of the “ numbers stations “ , which would transmit on a semi- regular schedule and merely read off a large list of numbers for 10 minutes .
For months I transcribed one particular woman ’s transmissions , trying to find out the pattern .
I did some computer analysis , but the numbers were random in frequency , with no discernible patterns .
Presumably they were encoded against a one - time pad .
And then there were the “ pirate ” radio stations like “ The Voice of the Purple Pumpkin ” .
Although most people knew about the BBC World Service , I do n’t think many appreciated that a large portion of the shortwave universe was strange , that the fringe was everywhere .
I ’m starting to have a similar view of the web .
Their are major content providers , minor content providers , even individual content providers like me .
And then their is the weirdness , the strange corners of the web , the space between the channels , where you are not even sure you are listening to signal or noise .
Here are a few random examples of web sites with no discernible purpose .
They appear to be garbled republications of new stories .
Let ’s start with the “ Wet Paint Body Notes ” blog , newly created , with only three posts .
One is called “ Microsoft Gets Foot in Mass .
Office Door “ .
It starts :
In what could be a coup inwardly favour of Microsoft ( Nasdaq : MSFT ) and a biff to the friendly wellspring league , the stipulate of Massachusetts personal added Microsoft ’s Office Open XML norm to its document of give your declaration standards it will allow for elected representatives exploit .
This is a strange kind of English .
It almost seems like a poor translation , or even a poor machine translation , of a document written in another language .
But if you poke around a little , you find the this blog post is an unattributed garbled derivation of a 2007 article in Linux Insider .
Not only was the original article in English , the reposted version truncates the article , posting only the first few paragraphs .
So what ’s up with that ?
There are no banner ads or other obvious sources of revenue on the garbled version of the article .
It is not a link farm .
In fact it has no outgoing links .
So why did someone bother ?
Another example .
The blog “ 75Software - News48 ” has an new article “ Microsoft shows support for ODF “ , posted just two weeks ago , with the intro :
Amid organization hassle surrounded by wish of interoperability , Microsoft ( Nasdaq : MSFT ) protected Thursday announced the discovery of the Open XML Translator Project .
The overhang will fry in the air permitted software to allow Word , Excel and PowerPoint to knob documents in contrary technology format .
Again , this reads like it is a poor translation from another language .
But look further and you can find that the original article is actually in English , from a 2006 TechNewsWorld article .
Again , no obvious intent here .
It is n’t a link farm , and there is no evident source of revenue .
It is n’t informative and it certainly is n’t timely .
So why did they do it ?
One more example this time a LiveJournal blog called “ All Microsoft ” , again newly created , with a post called “ Ecma Approves MS Office Format , IBM Dissents “ .
It opens :
Microsoft ’s ( Nasdaq : MSFT )
Open XML bureau software format , broad of via the tech giant to chase near the Open Document Format ( ODF ) , cleared a standards hurdle this week , successful approbation from the Ecma global standards article .
Same modus operandi here .
Original source , unattributed , is from a 2006 Linux Insider article .
I have dozens of examples of this kind of thing , all within the last couple of months , mainly articles about Microsoft and ODF .
Something new is afoot .
But what ?
Anyone have any idea of what this is and who benefits from it ?
If this just a contest between Blogger and LiveJournal to see who can claim the most hosted blogs ?
Or is it some SEO ploy ?
It has me stumped .
American teenagers are increasingly facing prosecution as sex offenders as a result of the rapidly spreading practice of sending explicit photos of themselves by mobile phone — a trend known as " sexting " .
In the latest case , three teenage girls in Greensburg , Pennsylvania , who sent nude self portraits , and the three male classmates who received the images , have all been served with child pornography charges .
The girls have been charged with manufacturing and disseminating child pornography while the boys are accused of possessing it .
In Wisconsin , a 17 - year - old was charged with child pornography after posting naked pictures of his girlfriend , who is a year younger , on the internet .
In Rochester , New York , a boy aged 16 faces seven years in jail for circulating an image of a girlfriend to friends .
" Sexting " is fast becoming a moral and legal headache for school heads and police throughout America .
The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy last month published a study suggesting one in five teens had sent or posted images of themselves in various stages of undress .
Jim Brown , an official at Glen Este high school in the Ohio town of Cincinnati , told the Cincinnati Enquirer : " If I were to go through the cell phones in this building right now , of 1,500 students I would venture to say that half to two - thirds have indecent photos , either of themselves or somebody else in school . "
Prosecutors are facing increasing dilemmas because case law has not kept up with the impact of digital media on teenage behaviour .
Young adults can face lengthy sentences resulting from relationships with younger teenagers , with penalties varying state by state .
Federal law also requires hefty punishment for teenaged relationships that span the legal start of adulthood at 17 .
An 18 - year - old in their last year of high school who dates a 14 - year - old in the first year faces up to 30 years in jail for a first offence .
Why is the BBC obsessed with making working - class people seem racist ?
Watching BBC news bulletins yesterday , it was very easy to believe claims that the current spate of wildcat strikes is inherently motivated by xenophobia .
Constant emphasis was placed on objections to " foreign workers " per se , rather than fear of workers ' wages being undercut , which would seem to be the real issue .
The 10 o'clock bulletin gave us a good example .
A voiceover by the BBC 's political editor , Nick Robinson , ( about 12 mins in ) told us : " Beneath the anger , ministers fear , lies straightforward xenophobia . "
Cut to woolly - hatted worker telling BBC reporter : " These Portugese and Eyeties – we can't work alongside of them . "
There we are : northern white bloke refusing to work with foreigners .
Case closed .
Except , watch Paul Mason 's report on Newsnight , featuring the same interview ( about 4:30 in ) :
These Portugese and eyeties – we can't work alongside of them : we 're segregated from them .
They 're coming in in full companies .
Even taking into account the dodginess of the use of " Eyetie " to refer to an Italian person , one has to admit that it would be very difficult to portray the second , full quote as racist or xenophobic .
It 's a statement addressing basic workplace issues – British workers literally cannot work alongside foreign workers , as they are separated .
There really is no excuse for editing and presenting a quote in such a misrepresentative manner , unless one is setting out to prove something – namely , that working - class people are racists .
The BBC does have form on this , unfortunately : last year 's
White season was almost exclusively concerned with portraying white working - class people as paranoid and racist .
This despite the fact – and this really needs to be repeated until it 's firmly implanted in every bien pensant liberal 's head – that white working - class people are the most likely to have friends of other races and religions , and are most likely to marry and have children with people of other races and religions .
Not the behaviour of a resentful army of racists .
The apex of the White season 's utter weirdness was a Newsnight interview with the BNP 's Nick Griffin , author of Who Are The Mindbenders , a 1997 pamphlet detailing how " the Jews " control the BBC and other media .
Griffin was interviewed on his own , and then we were taken in to a panel discussion featuring , among others , Bob Crow and Nick Ferrari ( both of whom had obviously refused to share a platform with Griffin , hence the solo interview ) .
Hardly natural bedfellows , Crow and Ferrari took turns lambasting the BBC for its portrayal of working - class people .
It was an encouraging sight .
But even after this spectacular dressing down , the practice persists .
Why ?
Is it because of a skewed identity politics at play in BBC newsrooms and commissioning meetings ?
Or is it because the BBC , like much of the media , is increasingly dominated by middle - class scions who do n't actually know many working - class people , and thus breezily project any prejudice or other trait they wish on to them ?
Either way , it 's a sordid state of affairs , and – as shown by the devious editing of last night 's 10 o'clock news , a dangerous one , too .
Should I use a Rules Engine ?
A rules engine is all about providing an alternative computational model .
Instead of the usual imperative model , which consists of commands in sequence with conditionals and loops , a rules engine is based on a Production Rule System .
This is a set of production rules , each of which has a condition and an action - simplistically you can think of it as a bunch of if - then statements .
The subtlety is that rules can be written in any order , the engine decides when to evaluate them using whatever order makes sense for it .
A good way of thinking of it is that the system runs through all the rules , picks the ones for which the condition is true , and then evaluates the corresponding actions .
The nice thing about this is that many problems naturally fit this model :
if car.owner.hasCellPhone then premium += 100 ; if car.model.theftRating > 4 then premium += 200 ; if car.owner.livesInDodgyArea && car.model.theftRating > 2 then premium += 300 ;
A rules engine is a tool that makes it easier to program using this computational model .
It may be a complete development environment , or a framework that can work with a traditional platform .
Most of what I 've seen in recent years are tools that are designed to fit in with an existing platform .
At one time there was the notion of building an entire system using a tool like this , but now people ( wisely ) tend to use rule engines just for the sections of a system .
The production rule computational model is best suited for only a subset of computational problems , so rules engines are better embedded into larger systems .
You can build a simple rules engine yourself .
All you need is to create a bunch of objects with conditions and actions , store them in a collection , and run through them to evaluate the conditions and execute the actions .
But mostly when people refer to " rules engine " they mean a product built specifically to help you build and run a rules engine .
Techniques to specify rules can vary from an API for people to describe rules as Java objects , a DSL to express rules , or a GUI that allows people enter rules .
More efficient execution engines help to quickly evaluate conditions on hundreds of rules using specialized algorithms ( such as the Rete algorithm ) .
An important property of rule engines is chaining - where the action part of one rule changes the state of the system in such a way that it alters the value of the condition part of other rules .
Chaining sounds appealing , since it supports more complex behaviors , but can easily end up being very hard to reason about and debug .
I 've run into a few cases where people have made use of rules engine products , and each time things do n't seem to have worked out well ( disclaimer : I 'm not a statistically valid sample ) .
Often the central pitch for a rules engine is that it will allow the business people to specify the rules themselves , so they can build the rules without involving programmers .
As so often , this can sound plausible but rarely works out in practice .
Even so , there 's still value in a BusinessReadableDSL , and indeed this is an area where I do see value in this computational model .
But here too lie dragons .
The biggest one is that while it can make sense to cast your eyes down a list of rules and see that each one makes sense , the interaction of rules can often be quite complex - particularly with chaining .
So I often hear that it was easy to set up a rules system , but very hard to maintain it because nobody can understand this implicit program flow .
This is the dark side of leaving the imperative computational model .
For all the faults of imperative code , it 's relatively easy to understand how it works .
With a production rule system , it seems easy to get to a point where a simple change in one place causes lots unintended consequences , which rarely work out well .
I have n't spent enough time with these systems to get a sense of what heuristics we should follow to keep this implicit behavior under control .
It does seem that it 's important to limit the number of rules , indeed any system with enough rules to need sophisticated algorithms to get good performance probably has too many rules to be understood .
Be very careful how you use chaining , often its best to organize your rules to limit or even eliminate chaining
As in many places , testing is often undervalued here , but implicit behavior makes testing more important - and it needs to be done with production data .
While building a rules system , I 'd look to do things that would cause EarlyPain with modifications of the rule base .
All of these lead me to think that there 's a lot to be said for avoiding rules engine products .
The basic idea of production rules is very simple .
In order to keep the implicit behavior under control you also need to limit the number of rules by keeping the rules within a narrow context .
This would argue for a more domain specific approach to rules , where a team builds a limited rules engine that 's only designed to work within that narrow context .
Certainly if you 're thinking of using a rules engine I 'd suggest prototyping with both a product and a hand - rolled domain specific approach so you can get a good feel for how they would compare .
For more information on building your own simple rules engine , including a couple of toy examples , see the Production Rules System chapter of my DSL book .
A long - known but little - tested means of permanently storing carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) underground , mineral carbonation , is now the subject of study in Iceland and Oman .
The good news is that mineral carbonation promises to lock away CO2 – a powerful greenhouse gas – in a much more stable form than simply pumping it into an underground geologic formation .
The bad news : Sequestering CO2 in this way is resource - intensive .
Scientists the world over are exploring ways to capture carbon dioxide and pump it deep underground as a compressed gas .
But what ’s to keep the buoyant gas from working its way up through fractured rock and reentering the atmosphere ?
Ensuring that such a leak never occurs could require monitoring the injection site for a very long period of time – from hundreds to tens of thousands of years .
“ How long can you afford , or how long can you plan on a government being in place to be able to watch over something ? ” says Travis McLing , a technical lead researcher and geochemist at the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls .
“ Name a government that ’s been stable or intact for even 1,000 years .
Long - term stewardship is a real issue . ”
One potential way to prevent CO2 from leaking out after injection is to quickly turn the gas into minerals that also occur naturally , such as calcium carbonate , which is the main component in limestone .
Many questions remain about the mineralization process , from how quickly it would occur to the cost of required resources and infrastructure , but a handful of scientists are bent on unearthing the answers .
Next month in Reykjavík , Iceland , a pilot project will , for the first time , inject carbon dioxide - saturated water into a formation of basalt rock more than 1,300 feet below ground .
The project includes Icelandic , French , and American scientists in partnership with Reykjavík Energy , a geothermal energy company .
They hope to learn how quickly the carbon dioxide and water mixture reacts with the basalt rock to form calcium carbonate .
Under laboratory conditions , mineralization began within four to six weeks and had occurred extensively within months .
In most sequestration projects , compressed carbon dioxide is injected into a geologic formation already filled with water .
In order for mineralization to start , the gas must first dissolve into the water .
Scientists do n’t know how long that natural process will take , but it is considered the limiting factor , according to Dr. McLing , and the CO2 could leak out during that time .
Scientists at Reykjavík want to bypass the slow process of CO2 absorption into water and the risks it poses by mixing the gas with water before injecting it underground .
“ How fast you can convert CO2 into a mineral – that is critical , ” says Juerg Matter , a geochemist at Columbia Uni­ver­sity ’s Lahmont - Doherty Earth Obser­vatory in New York .
“ We have to expedite it because of the global - warming issue . ”
Dr. Matter is involved in another similar study of peridotite , an igneous rock , where it occurs in a large formation in the Middle Eastern country of Oman .
Like basalt , peridotite chemically reacts with carbon dioxide - saturated water to quickly form minerals , some of which contain carbon .
Matter and his colleague , geologist Peter Kelemen , estimate that with accelerated mineralization , the 16,000 cubic - mile formation could absorb some 4 billion tons of CO2 a year , about 12 percent of the world ’s annual CO2 emissions – if it could be collected and transported there .
The scientists are in early discussions with a large oil company in Oman about field tests .
They also have a pending patent on part of the injection process they are developing .
Professor Kelemen says any proceeds would be the property of Columbia University .
Peridotite occurs in sizable and accessible quantities on every continent except Antarctica , according to Kelemen .
Basalt is one of the Earth ’s most common rock formations , making up 10 percent of the continental crusts .
Basalt is also found on the seafloor surrounding most continents , as well as inland .
There is storage space in geologic formations worldwide for at least 2 trillion tons of carbon dioxide , according to the United Nations ’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
The human population produces roughly 30 billion tons of CO2 annually .
As Kelemen says , “ There is a huge amount of rock , compared with CO2 , in the atmosphere . ”
But even if suitable geologic formations abound , the question remains : Does CO2 mineralization make economic and practical sense ?
Capturing carbon dioxide and injecting the dry gas into the ground takes large amounts of energy and money – as much as $ 110 per ton of CO2 to capture and transport , according to a recent paper by Carnegie Mellon University environmental engineer Edward Rubin .
But to start the mineralization quickly by dissolving CO2 into water before injection would also require a lot of water .
“ When you talk about sequestration at scale for commercial operations , ” says Peter McGrail , an environmental engineer with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory , “ you end up having to deal with extraordinarily large volumes of water . ”
To dissolve a ton of CO2 requires about 27 tons of water , as well as significant pressure and heat .
Another potential problem occurs after injection , as carbonate minerals precipitate from the water solution into the porous rock .
The minerals might plug up areas into which the water solution is migrating .
If this happens , new wells and pipelines would be required to continue the sequestration project .
“ This is really the core problem with this idea , ” says Dr. McGrail .
“ It may be possible [ to surmount it ] , but whether it ’s cost - effective to do so and whether the risk associated with having to drill many more wells early in a project [ is ] hard to say . ”
The process of injecting CO2 underground – whether combined with water or just as a gas – uses relatively little energy .
It is carbon capture , compression , and transport that demand significant amounts of power .
According to researcher McLing , conservative estimates find that with most of our existing coal - fired power plants , at least 25 percent of the electricity produced would go toward capture and compression technology .
So for every three electricity plants built with carbon capture capabilities , a fourth would be needed just to power the process .
“ I ’m pretty strongly pro-CO2 capture and sequestration , ” says McLing .
“ But ... is it the right thing in terms of resource conservation ?
To get rid of the carbon dioxide , we have to burn an additional 20 to 40 percent more coal or natural gas or petroleum .
What was formerly a 200 - year supply of a resource may now only be a 100 - year supply of a resource .
“ Those are things we have to balance , ” McLing concludes .
“ Are conservation and sequestration compatible ? ”

A high street bank goes into a detailed credit check that be extremely lengthy in terms of time and process and not ideal for a £ 50 loan for example .

The term Gothic almost instantly brings on images of darkness and things that go bump in the night .
At times , the term brings to mind architecture that was prevalent in the high and late middle ages of European history , which was both beautiful and scary to look at .
Gothic photography is a very elusive term .
Drenched in modern and pop culture , Gothic photography is continually redefining itself .
Yet at their core , Gothic photos are instantly recognizable .
A dark image of an abandoned church or cemetery can instantly be labelled as ‘ goth . ’
The essence of Gothic photography is mood .
The specifics of subject matter and technique varies widely , but the atmosphere remains constant — dark , gloomy , and a little eery .
Take a look at any Gothic photo and you will be left with a feeling of uneasiness .
Despite that uneasy feeling , Gothic photography wants to show and see the beauty that is hidden in the dark , tragic , and even morbid aspects of life .
As such , Gothic photography brings emotional reactions to the forefront of the person viewing the piece of art .
Gothic photographs make use of the blacks , greys , and whites to create their scenes , while other colors are optional or used to accent the overall image .
This breathes life into the subject matter .
In this gallery , we ’ve gathered the best examples of Gothic photography .
Each of these stunning examples does a great job of conveying deep and emotional messages .
Use these images to spark some emotions for your next photoshoot .
[ digg- reddit-me ] QUESTIONER : … [ W ] hy not just legalize drugs ?
Former Drug Czar , General BARRY MCCAFFREY ( retired ) : … [ S ] ince I ’m not in public life , [ I can say ] I actually do n’t care .
I care about 6th graders through 12th graders .
If you ’re 40 years old , and you ’re living in Oregon , and you have 12 giant pot plants in the back of your log cabin , knock yourself out .
Discussing Mexico and US drug policy at the Council on Foreign Relations on February 23 , 2009 .
General McCaffrey as drug czar vehemently opposed medical marijuana ; he accelerated the militarization of the Drug War in Columbia and Mexico ; and during his time as drug czar , arrests for marijuana possession soared above those for harder drugs ( See graph on page 3 of pdf ) .
After years of failure to dent domestic demand for drugs , this chief drug warrior now admits he does n’t care if drugs are legalized and that he sees nothing wrong with growing your own marijuana .
It is incredible that someone could pursue the policies he did – and now state that he either did n’t or does n’t strongly believe drugs should be illegal .
Two weeks ago , another group of former drug warriors produced a report describing the failure of America ’s prohibitionist policy in Latin America and in the United States :
Prohibitionist policies based on the eradication of production and on the disruption of drug flows as well as on the criminalization of consumption have not yielded the expected results .
We are farther than ever from the announced goal of eradicating drugs …
Current drug repression policies are firmly rooted in prejudices , fears and ideological visions …
[ T ] he available empirical evidence shows that the harm caused by [ marijuana ] is similar to the harm caused by alcohol or tobacco .
More importantly , most of the damage associated with cannabis use – from the indiscriminate arrest and incarceration of consumers to the violence and corruption that affect all of society – is the result of the current prohibitionist policies .
From Drugs and Democracy , a report by César Gaviria ( former president of Columbia ) , Ernesto Zedillo ( former president of Mexico ) , Fernando Henrique Cardoso ( former president of Brazil ) and numerous other prominent Latin American figures released February 11 , 2009 .
As former Governor William
Weld recently explained :
There ’s no one so brave and wise as the politician who ’s not running for office and who ’s not going to be .
It is notable that so many of our prominent politicians reveal after they leave office that they do n’t really agree with the premise of the War on Drugs – a war which is consuming billions of dollars , waging war on our citizenry , jailing a higher percentage of our citizens than any other nation , destabilizing our neighbors , competing with and undermining anti-terrorism measures , and making America less safe .
Instead , the best our current leaders offer is to soften the roughest edges of the Drug War on American citizens .
Obama has taken a number of sensible positions on Drug War issues – but he has not publicly acknowledged what most informed observers can see – that the War on Drugs has failed , is wasting money , and making us less safe .
It is inconceivable that a reflective , informed policy - maker such as Obama does not realize this as well .
Franklin Delano Roosevelt used to tell all of the favor - seekers who came to impress upon him the importance of certain issues :
I agree with you .
I want to do it .
Now make me do it .
In other words , we must put pressure on Obama if the hopes of reform advocates and Obama administration insiders are to be realized .

Wave Energy to Bring Power and Jobs to San Francisco
February 27th , 2009 by Gavin Newsom
Editors Note : This is a guest post by San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom .
See his last post for us on EV charging stations on Gas 2.0 .
Today , San Francisco took a meaningful step toward turning the promise of renewable ocean energy into reality .
We submitted a preliminary permit application to the federal government to develop a wave power project off our coast that we believe can generate between 10 to 30 megawatts of energy , with potential of up to 100 megawatts .
When this project is fully operational , upwards of 100 jobs could be created in San Francisco .
Ocean power is a true “ game changer ” in the area of renewable energy .
When wave and tidal power technologies reach commercial scale , they are expected to be able to provide thousands of megawatts of power to our coastal communities , dramatically green our energy portfolios and create thousands of new American jobs .
In San Francisco , we ’ve been doing our part to spur these technologies by aggressively advancing tidal and wave power pilot projects .
We are 100 % committed to this challenge .
Wave power is not a new concept .
In 1887 , San Francisco Mayor Adolph Sutro recognized the power of San Francisco ’s waves and built a wave catch - basin to harness the ocean ’s power .
Over the next century wave power development took a backseat to our dependence on oil , with oil platforms built along our coasts to feed our oil addiction .
However more recently , an explosion of research and development of wave power technologies has occurred .
The first commercial units are scheduled to go online in Portugal this year ( 2 MW from three 750 KW Pelamis units ) .
In the U.S. there are a number of studies , but no commercial operations ; San Francisco is hoping to change that .
The proposal submitted by the City to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) , grows out of a recent wave power study the City completed , with generous support from the Sidney Frank Foundation and others .
The study confirms that wave power is a promising resource off Ocean Beach in San Francisco .
Our project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of generating electric power from waves about eight miles off the west coast of San Francisco .
The next step in our project will be to select technologies and undertake environmental studies to ensure minimal impact on marine animals , fishing , shipping and recreational uses .
[ cnet id=32524 ]
There are over 50 different types of wave devices currently under development , ranging from “ pitching ” devices ( Pelamis ) , “ overtopping ” devices ( Wave Dragon ) , oscillating water columns ( OceanLinx ) and “ heaving ” devices ( Aquabuoy ) .
Some of these devices are based on “ biomimicry ” principles , which imitate natural designs and processes ( bioWave , WaveRoller ) .
Others can even provide both wave power and desalination ( CETO ) .
Wave technology is still new , but the possibilities of clean , green energy produced by the ocean is very real , if we invest in the technology .
We will look at all of these and others technologies to find what will work best for us in San Francisco ’s waters .
As our leaders in Washington examine ways to ramp up the amount of renewable energy produced in the US over the next three years , in San Francisco we hope to demonstrate that the ocean has the potential to provide power for millions of Americans .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
I want to say first that I 'm going to see a financial advisor asap .
What I 'm looking for is any information someone who has been in this situation before can give me .
When I was a teenager , my mom took out credit cards in my name because she had too much credit to get them in her name .
She paid these credit cards for nearly a decade .
It was with my knowledge , but I was a teenager so there was n't a lot I could do either way , and even if there was something I could have done I 'm sure you can understand why I did n't feel that I was in a position to say no .
I figured she was paying for them , so it was n't a huge deal .
For the while that she could pay for them , I had good credit so I figured it must be okay .
Plus there were pressing medical issues in the family that complicated things financially , which is why my mom had too much credit in the first place ; it was the only way we could get by .
When I got a bit older ( I 'm in my mid-20s ) I did n't know what to do about the credit in my name because by then , it had snowballed to the point where all she could do was live off credit cards .
I did n't want to put her in a position where she could no longer get by , and she was still paying for the cards , so ...
You can see where this is going .
Recently her paycheck got cut in half .
Suddenly all the things she could once pay for , she cannot anymore .
She can barely afford much more than her house payment -- which nearly became undoable -- and utilities , so she is going to have to file bankruptcy .
That 's fine , but it only applies to the debt in her name , not mine .
She is co-signer on almost all of my credit accounts , but from what I understand bankruptcy will not wipe that out -- it will just mean that I alone am responsible for the money .
She will not have enough money to pay for the accounts in my name , either .
I would just file bankruptcy myself , except my husband is starting a job next month that will disqualify us from doing so , since he will make too much money to file .
Needless to say , I 'm quite upset that I 'm going to have to pay back $ 35,000 that I did not charge up , especially when I could n't have done anything when she took the cards out in my name .
However , I am unwilling to get her in legal trouble over it because I do n't think ruining our relationship is worth it , and I do n't feel right doing it because it 's not like she spent the money on frivolous things .
From what I understand , anyway , all I could do is take her to court over the amount of the money , and she does n't have the money to give me .
Is there anything else I can do ?
Despite our not qualifying for bankruptcy , paying back that much money is going to be a serious financial problem for us .
I 'm not looking for a lecture about how I should get my mom in trouble , or how I should have done something to take the credit away from her sooner .
Getting her in trouble is not an option for me , and I can't change the past .
I 'm not going to let her use my credit anymore , and she wo n't need to anyway since she 'll at least have enough for living expenses .
What I am looking for is either a " you should look into this option " or a " no , a similar thing happened to me and there 's nothing you can do . "
My mother took out credit cards in my name .
She is now filing bankruptcy , and she is not able to continue paying the debt that 's in my name .
My husband 's upcoming job will preclude us from filing bankruptcy for the debt in my name .
Is there any way I can avoid paying $ 35 k of debt she charged up in my name without suing her or otherwise getting her into serious legal trouble ?
Do n’t mess with Robert W. Hirsh .
The 43 - year - old lawyer sued the single mother he hired to stain the woodwork in his Hancock Park Tudor - style home , claiming she left some streaks on the wood .
He sued his stockbroker for not getting him into Microsoft stock .
After returning from a 1996 trip to Boston , Hirsh sued Pier 4 restaurateur Anthony Athanas , claiming the then - 85 - year - old man had assaulted him and his family after they complained about poor service .
Advertisement
Hirsh has also sued his own clients , including the one who claimed that Hirsh ’s representation had cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars .
Hirsh demanded about $ 47,000 in fees , and when an arbitration panel ordered Hirsh to pay the client $ 25,000 instead , Hirsh filed a malpractice suit against his own lawyers who had represented him before the arbitration panel .
Hirsh even sued the synagogue where he was married , claiming that the religious elders had botched the catering of his wedding by , among other things , serving his guests cold vegetables and not giving his family all the leftovers .
“ Either he has the worst luck in the world , or he likes to sue , ” said Laurie Levenson , who teaches professional responsibility at Loyola University Law School .
“ I ’m not going to sit back and take a loss and do nothing , ” said Hirsh , explaining his litigation philosophy .
“ I ’m not going to be a patsy .
I ’m going to sue . ”
Advertisement
And sue he has .
According to court records ,
Hirsh has been a party in at least 82 cases since 1982 , a staggering number , even in litigation - laden Los Angeles .
Hirsh ’s adversaries say Hirsh uses his legal license as a cudgel .
They call him the quintessential professional litigant , who files lawsuits and extracts settlement dollars from defendants ranging from mom-and - pop firms to multibillion - dollar corporations .
Some of these adversaries are now asking a judge to brand Hirsh a vexatious litigant , a label akin to a scarlet letter .
If their wish is granted , Hirsh will join 434 other people barred by the Judicial Council of California from filing any more lawsuits without court approval or without posting bond .
The council began compiling the list 10 years ago to blacklist the small number of people who waste taxpayers ’ money by overburdening the court system with frivolous , duplicative and intentionally tormenting lawsuits .
Hirsh says all his lawsuits are meritorious .
He points to favorable cash settlements reaped during the last two decades as evidence .
Advertisement
But Hirsh ’s adversaries say his litigation record is an example of how someone can exploit the legal system to wear down opponents and have them pay settlements simply to make the lawsuits go away .
Some of his adversaries say he has emptied bank accounts , ruined finances , and left a trail of people disillusioned with the judicial system .
Lawyers who have opposed Hirsh in court say he exploits a legal system in which compliant insurers and other defendants prefer to settle cases for less than the cost of litigation .
People like Hirsh , they say , clog court calendars and contribute to the public outrage against lawyers and the judicial system .
Hirsh insists that the number of his cases merely shows that he utilizes the court system as it is intended .
The Judicial Council could n’t say who holds the record as California ’s most prolific filer of lawsuits , but that distinction probably goes to Liang - Houh Shieh , a Yale Law School graduate who filed dozens of lawsuits against hundreds of defendants , most of them former law partners or employers .
Shieh , 52 , was disbarred three years ago for waging what one judge called “ a campaign of litigation terror . ”

Hirsh ’s critics say the Beverly Hills lawyer employs similar tactics .
Hirsh , according to the motion that seeks to declare him a vexatious litigant , has made a living suing “ his clients , his brokers , the restaurants he frequents , the hotel he frequents , the airlines he flies , the many contractors who performed work on his home ( including those whom he has not paid ) , the city of Los Angeles , his insurance companies , attorneys , his synagogue , wedding caterer and wedding hall , his former employers , his wife ’s former employers , his mother - in - law ’s neighbors , his wife ’s valet parking attendant , his computer salesman , his car companies , the former owner of his home , his floor man , his marble layer and even attempted to sue the Rabbinical Council of California . ”
Hirsh says his adversaries have misstated the number of lawsuits in which he has been a party .
He acknowledges that he has been personally involved in “ many ” lawsuits but would n’t specify .
“ Do I have a lot of lawsuits ?
Yes , I do , ” Hirsh said .
“ I have nothing to be ashamed of .
I ’m proud to be educated enough to be able to use the legal system to prosecute my valuable legal rights . ”
Advertisement
Hirsh ’s education has come in handy , especially in dealing with the various contractors who worked to renovate his Hancock Park home .
Hirsh paid $ 950,000 in 1997 for the seven - bedroom , five - bath house and expected to pour in the same amount to repair it .
But the red - brick house has become a magnet for lawsuits .
Citing a variety of claims ranging from fraud to breach of contract , Hirsh has filed separate suits against his landscaper , his wood stainer , his marble layer , the supplier of the wood floors , the home inspector and the former owner of the home .
In addition , Hirsh is contesting a separate action by an electrician who placed a lien on the property , claiming he was not paid for work performed .
Was it simply a stroke of bad luck that many of the contractors Hirsh hired breached their contracts ?
Advertisement
“ I would say so , ” Hirsh said .
“ I was just unlucky . ”
The contractors and their attorneys do n’t think so .
They say that Hirsh ’s suits against them are an effort on the lawyer ’s part to avoid paying his bills .
Jeffrey Meltzer , who owns a local floor supplies business , says his suit against Hirsh is an example of how the lawyer uses the legal system to get his adversaries to capitulate .
Meltzer , whose Universal Hardwood supplied the oak flooring for Hirsh ’s house , sued Hirsh in small claims court for a mere $ 150 , claiming Hirsh would n’t pay his final bill .
Advertisement
Meltzer won the suit , but Hirsh got the judgment set aside when he filed his own suit , for $ 75,000 , claiming that Meltzer had supplied substandard material .
After several months of litigation , Meltzer ’s insurance paid Hirsh $ 9,000 to settle the case .
Meltzer said he vigorously fought the settlement , but caved in when his insurer told him that he would be on the hook for any damage judgment if the case went to trial .
“ I could n’t understand how I was the victim in this case and he walked away with the money , ” Meltzer said .
“ The whole thing is still nerve - racking . ”
Like Meltzer , other people who have filed lawsuits against Hirsh have found themselves staring down the barrel of a Hirsh countersuit .
Advertisement
And Hirsh usually wins , he says .
Hirsh said he received a cash settlement in his countersuit against Melissa Murphy , the wood stainer , and many others .
The motion seeking to declare Hirsh a vexatious litigant has placed the spotlight on a man who describes himself as a “ self - made success . ”
Hirsh , who grew up in Queens , N.Y. , graduated magna cum laude from State University of New York at Albany and went on to study law at Boston University .
Advertisement
A former professor described Hirsh as a “ nice person who seemed sincere . ”
Several former classmates , who requested anonymity , fearing that they might be sued , remembered Hirsh as a class pariah who reveled in being a contrarian .
“ He was feisty and always ready to challenge the professors , ” said one New York attorney .
“ He was brazen . . . that his goal was to get a law degree to make money . ”
“ No one wanted to hang out with him , ” said a female former classmate .
“ You felt badly about hating him so much . ”
After law school , Hirsh moved to Southern California .
His resume includes employment at major Los Angeles and New York law firms .
His client list includes financial institutions , real estate developers and entertainment personalities , according to Hirsh , who also describes himself as an expert in real estate , bankruptcy and banking .
Advertisement
Hirsh ’s aggressive tactics have caused his own run-ins with the law .
In August 1998 , a Los Angeles judge removed Hirsh from representing a defendant in a construction - related lawsuit , ruling that he had improperly contacted an opposing expert consultant without the approval of the other parties ’ lawyers .
“ You are not a very credible person , ” said Judge Edward M. Ross .
A year earlier , a U.S. bankruptcy appellate panel upheld a bankruptcy ’s judge ’s finding that Hirsh had acted unprofessionally and hostile when he repeatedly instructed a client not to answer questions at a deposition .
The panel , which upheld $ 3,967.41 in sanctions against Hirsh , found that “ Hirsh ’s conduct fell far below the acceptable conduct for an officer of the court . ”
Advertisement
Hirsh may profess to be an expert in banking , but he claims to know little about investing .
And this lack of financial knowledge also has spawned lawsuits .
In August 1997 , Hirsh sued Massachusetts Life Insurance Co. , claiming that two years earlier the insurer ’s agents had advised him to buy a life insurance policy , even though he wanted to purchase Microsoft stock .
That advice , Hirsh said in court papers , prevented him from taking advantage of the largest bull market in American stock history , during which Microsoft ’s stock soared .
The lawsuit against Massachusetts Life was eventually settled .
Hirsh would n’t say how much money he received , but one source said the insurer forked over about $ 100,000 .

In 1999 , Hirsh filed a similar suit against Merrill Lynch .
Hirsh said he had contacted a Merrill Lynch broker -- three months after suing Massachusetts Life - - to invest $ 68,000 in Microsoft stock .
Instead , the broker advised Hirsh to invest the same money in a bond fund .
On July 19 , 1999 , the bond fund was worth $ 67,400 .
If Hirsh had bought Microsoft stock , his investment would have been worth approximately $ 204,000 , he said .
If Hirsh knew back in 1997 that Microsoft was a lucrative investment , why did n’t he simply buy Microsoft stock ?
Hirsh says he was simply following expert advice .
“ I ’m not a sophisticated investor , ” he said .

Merrill Lynch describes
Hirsh ’s lawsuit as frivolous .
“ This is a lawsuit that should never have been brought , ” said Bill Halldin , a spokesman for the brokerage .
“ It ’s completely without merit .
He was fully aware of the nature of the investment . ”
The suit against Merrill Lynch is pending .
Several of Hirsh ’s clients who have been sued by him say in court records and in complaints to the State Bar of California that the lawyer overbilled them .
When they took him to court , or vice versa , Hirsh repeatedly threatened to use the legal process to run them out of money , they said .
“ We are ruined , ” said Tiberiu Petho , a former client who was sued by Hirsh , in a complaint to the state bar .

State bar investigators say the complaints against Hirsh do not warrant their attention .
Responding to one complaint , a senior state bar official wrote that the “ state bar has had to set priorities with regard to the matters it will investigate and prosecute . ”
Hirsh calls the complaints against him “ gross character assassination . ”
But Gregory Pyfrom , an attorney for one of the contractors seeking to declare Hirsh a vexatious litigant , says he simply wants to stop Hirsh from collecting “ settlements by being a pain . ”

To declare Hirsh a vexatious litigant , Pyfrom and his colleagues must show that Hirsh has lost at least five cases in which he represented himself during the last seven years .
Pyfrom says he is confident he will prevail , listing at least 10 cases that went against Hirsh .
Hirsh denies losing 10 cases , says he always hires a lawyer to represent him , and says he will defeat the motion to declare him vexatious .
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert L. Hess could decide Hirsh ’s fate as early as Monday .
Meltzer , the wood supplier , says he is keeping his fingers crossed .

“ I want someone to stop Hirsh , ” Meltzer said , “ because as long as he has a law license , he has teeth . ”

Times researcher John Tyrrell provided research for this story .
Carlsson and Aigner joined their forces again and proudly present the third model that emerged from their collaboration .
The Carlsson Aigner CK55 Rascape is based on the Mercedes GL 500 and it ’s an exclusive limited edition of 20 cars which will be revealed at the upcoming Geneva Motor Show .
The car has a striking two tone paintwork and several coats of smooth , wine - red mettalic paint have been applied on the car ’s body kit .
Carlsson and Aigner designed a special body kit that has wider wheel arches which are visually linked by new side skirts .
The front wings of this GL500 have illuminated Aiger logos and the door rubbing strips are color coded in black .
The car ’s front side looks more aggressive with a new bonnet carrying larger power domes .
Under the hood the car has a large front grille and sub grilles with chromed wire mesh .
The front bumper has additional driving fog lights and LED daytime lights into the lower edge of the deeper front apron extention .
The rear part of the car has cut-outs for the four chromed exit pipes of the new exhaust system .
The new side skirts were designed reduce aerodynamic drag and lift and they also give the car a muscle look .
All body kit elements were made from PU - RIM , a flexible material used by OE manufacturers .
The Carlsson Aigner CK55 RS Mercedes GL500 is equipped with a V8 engine that has 388 HP and 530 Nm of torque in standard form but after Carlsson tweaked this engine using metal catalytic converters , gas - flowed cylinder heads , high lift camshafts and a remapped engine cooling unit this stock engine reached 456HP and a maximum torque of 640 Nm .
After these modifications the CK55RS Rascasse is the most powerful GL in the world and could accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 5.9 seconds .

JUDGE HANDS DOWN TWO MORE HOLY SMOKE SENTENCES
MARIJUANA : Alan Middlemiss and Kelsey Stratas sentenced to one year in prison ; legal team has already started appeal .
The appeal process has begun for the two of the remaining four members of the Holy Smoke Culture Shop convicted of marijuana - related offences .
On January 2 in Nelson Courthouse Holy Smoke co-owner Alan Middlemiss received the same sentence that co-owner Paul DeFelice did in November : one year in jail .
Both men were found guilty of trafficking marijuana from the Holy Smoke Culture Shop on Hendryx Street , Sales associate Kelsey Stratas was also sentenced Friday on the same charge and received eight months in jail .
Both Middlemiss and Stratas had prior records of marijuana - related offences .
The lawyer for the four men convicted at the shop , Don Skogstad , said Middlemiss and Stratas should be released next week from jail in preparation for the appeal .
" The appeal will likely begin in April in Vancouver , " he said on Sunday .
Middlemiss and Stratas were initially scheduled to be sentenced before Christmas .
Skogstad had requested to have the sentencing held over to January 2 to keep the two men from doing excess time in prison before they 're released to await an appeal .
Skogstad said Middlemiss and Stratas have already spent about a week in jail in Nelson .
Middlemiss , DeFelice and Stratas , along with Akka Annis , were each charged with two counts of trafficking cannabis after the Nelson Police Department raided the store on July 15 , 2006 and said they found a pound and a half of marijuana and between $ 8,000 and $ 9,000 in cash .
When they went to court in April of last year the four men did not deny the charges , but admitted to selling marijuana from the shop as a way to provide a safe , quality product to adults , and to provide easy access to those who use marijuana for medical purposes .
In an effort to show just cause for the marijuana sale , Skogstad brought in witnesses such as recovering drug addicts who stated that marijuana helped them get off hard drugs , people with chronic illnesses who bought pot from the shop to help them deal with their diseases , and ( an ) expert witness who testified about the effects of marijuana on the human body .
They also argued that they initially started selling marijuana out of the store in an effort to stop the drug dealing activities taking place in the community park next to the business .
DeFelice and Annis have already served some of their sentences and have been released pending an appeal .
Annis , a first time offender , received 40 days served on weekends in the local lockup , while DeFelice was sentenced to a year in a federal prison for his offence - a prior marijuana conviction being an aggravating circumstance .

Gazprom , the state - owned Russian gas group , today cut off all supplies to Europe travelling through Ukrainian pipelines , intensifying the political and economic crisis that has arisen out of a payments dispute between the two countries .
Amid evidence that people in eastern Europe are being deprived of heating as the Arctic cold snap continues , Russia and Ukraine continued to blame each other for the deadlock .
Gazprom accused Ukraine of shutting down the fourth and last open pipeline crossing the country while officials at Naftogaz , Ukraine 's state energy firm , simply said : " Words fail us . "
The complete shutdown comes ahead of top - level talks in Moscow tomorrow between Gazprom and Naftogaz executives to resolve a pricing dispute that has arisen in each of the last four years .
Ukraine , semi - bankrupt and being bailed out by the IMF and EU , is being offered natural gas at higher prices , but substantially below those charged on European markets .
The dispute , viewed by the EU as a purely commercial one until recently , threatens a fresh breakdown in relations between Brussels and Moscow , with European Commission officials warning that Russia 's reputation as a reliable partner is once again at stake .
But analysts point out that , since the last serious crisis broke out in 2006 , Europe has done very little to avert shortages .
Instead of creating an integrated market , drawing on alternative energy supplies , countries have simply drawn up individual contracts with Gazprom , increasing dependence on Russia .
Russia supplies a quarter of Europe 's gas and 80 % of this transits through Ukraine .
As shortages hit western Europe and intensify in the south and east , EU governments will meet on Friday to consider sharing supplies held in storage .
MGMT won best new band at Wednesday 's NME Awards
US indie duo MGMT have demanded compensation from the French President for using one of their hits as a campaign soundtrack without permission .
MGMT claim Nicolas Sarkozy 's UMP party used the track Kids at its national congress and in two online videos .
UMP has admitted using it , but said it was a mistake and has offered a symbolic gesture of one euro ( £ 0.89 ) .
But MGMT 's French lawyer Isabelle Wekstein rejected the offer , telling AFP the offer was " insulting " .
" This offer is disrespectful of the rights of artists and authors .
It is insulting , " she said .
" We are dealing with acts of counterfeiting , an infringement of intellectual property . "
Ms Wekstein said the party paid a standard 53 euro fee ( £ 47 ) to the French music licensing body .
However , she claimed the amount was not enough to cover subsequent uses of the rock track , particularly on the web .
The row comes a week before the French parliament starts examining a new law championed by Sarkozy 's party , pushing for tougher penalties for online piracy and file - sharing on the internet .

Candidate Barack Obama promised to lift Bush Administration restrictions on embryonic stem cell research .
Two days after he became President Obama , the government gave its approval for the first - ever human trials using therapies derived from this controversial area of science .
Geron , a Menlo Park , Calif . - based biotechnology firm , was given the go - ahead by the Food and Drug Administration Thursday .
While officials at both the company and the agency are calling the timing of the announcement coincidental , the news reignites the debate between those who see the promise of miracle - like cures in human stem cells and opponents who say the harvesting of cells from embryos is akin to murder .
Geron will choose 10 patients who have suffered spinal cord injuries resulting in paralysis .
The patients will be given the treatments between 7 to 14 days after being injured , and will be studied for up to a year .
If the patients remain safe , then Geron will ask for permission to expand the study and increase the dosage .
" This marks the beginning of what is potentially a new chapter in medical therapeutics , one that reaches beyond pills to a new level of healing : the restoration of organ and tissue function achieved by the injection of healthy replacement cells , " Geron president and CEO Dr. Thomas Okarma said .
A Shift in Research Priorities
" It 's a bold step , and the hard part of this is going to be managing expectations , " Chuck Murry , Ph.D. , codirector of the University of Washington 's Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine , told TechNewsWorld .
" People have very high hopes for stem cells to do something remarkable .
We have to keep in mind -- the wonder with working with embryonic stem cells is that they can turn into anything , and the hardest thing with working with stem cells is that they can turn into anything . "
Making sure the embryonic cells turn into targeted , healthy spinal cord cells and do n't become disorganized rogue cells will be the focus of the trials .
" Based on what we know , there 's very good reason to think this can be done safely , " Murry said .
Murry knows some of Geron 's researchers and has asked them about the timing of the approval .
Last spring Geron submitted a 21,000 - page application for testing , " which may be the largest in the history of the FDA , " he said .
" It seems more than coincidental , but they assured me it was just coincidence .
This [ approval ] was going to come either way , it just happened to be this week . "
The arrival of the Obama administration is rekindling enthusiasm among researchers , who have seen countries like Israel , Italy , South Korea and the UK take the lead over the U.S. in embryonic stem cell science since August 2001 , when then - President George W. Bush allowed limited testing of existing cell lines while placing restrictions on further research .
The research community is aware that the political and ethical landscape remains filled with potential obstacles -- Congress must still weigh in -- and a new hurdle has arisen since 2001 : a weak economy and its impact on federal funding , Murry said .
" We do n't have our heads in the sand , " Murry said .
" Everybody thinks we 're going to get expanded permission , but will there be resources to do so ?
In order to make up for lost time , will resources be made available ? "
The Difference Between Ethics and Safety
The Bush administration 's policies may have resulted in federal researchers leaving the field for private or overseas work , while states like California , New York and Massachusetts kept up the scientific pace , said Summer Johnson , executive managing editor of the American Journal of Bioethics .
" What we 've seen now announced is that stem cells are still moving forward and the private sector is doing well , " she told TechNewsWorld .
" I think even with the polices and the brain drain that we saw over the last eight years , companies like Geron were still able to have some progress . "
Johnson reminds those who are excited about Obama 's campaign promises that he recently said he may leave it to Congress to lift the previous administration 's restrictions .
And there is also the question of whether or not the research community has thought through the bioethics issues involved , now that stem cell research is back on the agenda .
" Safety is not the same thing as bioethics , " she said .
" There 's simply more to it .
It 's making sure that we 're picking the right diseases for studying stem cell clinical trials , the right patient population , making sure once we 've picked the right patients that we 're telling them all the information they need to know .
Once we 've enrolled people , are we gathering data appropriately , and if there are adverse events , are we disclosing that information ?
" If we 've learned anything from gene therapy experimentation and other things we 've done in human research , it 's that a momentary pause sometimes makes the difference between research going well and research going not so well . "
That takes the point back to managing expectations .
The patients selected for Geron 's trials will have suffered the worst kinds of spinal cord transection injuries , Murry said .
" These are the most difficult patients to help .
Usually in animal models where these cells have been shown to be effective , the injuries were not the severest , not through - and - through transections .
You always start where you do the least harm , but sometimes you also end up starting where you do the least good .
It would n't surprise me if the initial study would show modest benefits . "
Were Bill O'Reilly any kind of actual journalist who held himself to some standard of accountability , he'd be abjectly apologizing to former Rep.
Gary Condit right now , and properly demonstrating some circumspection in drawing broad political conclusions from a single tragic but otherwise fairly simple criminal case .
But no .
He is Bill O'Reilly , after all .
Remember that O'Reilly was one of the leaders in the torch - bearing Get Condit mob :
He wrote columns all but accusing Condit of culpability in Levy 's murder .
On his Fox News show , he featured obsessively regular updates on the Levy case , including segments suggesting Condit was about to be arrested by the FBI .
Now that Condit has been officially exonerated , though , no apology or even acknowledgment of wrongdoing is forthcoming , of course .
Not from many others who behaved similarly , and certainly not from Bill O'Reilly .
Instead , O'Reilly is using the Levy case , as he did on his Fox show last night , to play one of his favorite rhetorical games : linking immigration to crime by pointing out that it was in fact an illegal immigrant who 's been charged in Levy 's death .
You may remember that a few weeks ago The New York Times editorial page implied that I am a racist for reporting the truth about illegal alien crimes .
This is another example of blatant press dishonesty in America .
The media 's cover - up of alien crime is massive .
A new study coming to light through the federal 287 - G program says that in the Phoenix area , 22 percent of all felonies are committed by illegal aliens .
In the Chicago area , 19 percent of all prison inmates are illegal .
In Collier County , Florida , more than 20 percent of all arrests are for crimes allegedly committed by illegals , and on and on .
In fact , according to federal data , about a half million serious crimes have been committed by illegal aliens over the past 10 years .
Both political parties are at fault , as is the pro-amnesty media .
Republicans wanted business to have cheap labor .
Democrats sought the votes that come with migrant residency .
And the far - left press believes the USA is oppressive and cruel if it does not grant citizenship to poor migrants .
Add all that up and you have a perfect storm of immigration chaos .
And thousands of Americans have been badly hurt by it , not to mention thousands of illegal aliens themselves , who have been brutalized and exploited .
Well , we certainly remember O'Reilly 's big squall when the NYT called him out .
And yet here he is , indulging in precisely the same grotesque , eliminationist scapegoating of illegal immigrants they called him out for .
He obviously does n't get what the problem is .
The problem is this :
There is no evidence to indicate that undocumented immigrants are more likely to commit crimes than American citizens ; indeed , the evidence strongly suggests that immigrants in general are less likely to commit crimes .
For instance , a 2005 study conducted by researchers from Harvard University and the University of Michigan revealed both that immigrants committed fewer crimes than native - born citizens , and that a greater proportion of immigrants in a neighborhood was associated with lower rates of crime .
Another study analyzing census data found that among men aged 18 - 39 ( who make up the bulk of those committing crimes ) , the incarceration rate was five times higher for the native - born than for the foreign - born .
This held true within ethnic and national - origin groups , meaning , for instance , that native - born Latinos were more likely to be incarcerated than foreign - born Latinos .
A recent study by the Public Policy Institute of California found that in that state , which contains more immigrants than any other , the foreign - born are incarcerated at a rate half as high as their presence in the population , and only one - tenth as high among men age 18 - 40 , who make up the bulk of prisoners .
Robert J. Sampson , chairman of the sociology department at Harvard University , said that data show that undocumented immigrants are in fact " disproportionately less likely to be involved in many acts of deviance , crime , drunk driving , any number of things that sort of imperil our well - being . "
There have , of course , been individual crimes committed by undocumented immigrants , some of which are quite serious .
But in order to justify a particular focus in news programs and the claims of a " crime wave " -- not just a few reports , but the enormous number of stories and discussions we document below -- crimes committed by undocumented immigrants would have to be disproportionate to their numbers .
Immigration opponents might argue that any crime committed by an immigrant increases the total amount of crime in the country , but the risk of crime is increased only if the immigrants commit more crimes per person than the native - born , since immigration also increases the population and therefore diffuses the crime risk to any particular person .
Oh , and that 287 - G problem that O'Reilly mentions briefly in this screed ?
The study he references actually draws quite a different conclusion than what O'Reilly wants us to conclude from the factoid strands he 's drawn from it :
A federal law granting local police and sheriffs the power to act as immigration officials when faced with dangerous criminals or terrorists has instead created a climate of racial profiling and community insecurity , according to researchers at the UNC School of Law Immigration and Human Rights Clinic .
According to the report , one of the unexpected and problematic outcomes of the law is reluctance among immigrants to contact police if they are victims or witnesses of crimes because of the risk of being jailed or deported themselves .
Additionally , there are growing concerns that law enforcement officers are targeting Hispanic - appearing individuals for minor traffic offenses .
...
" Students studied the contracts between local law enforcement agencies and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) that grant immigration authority to local law enforcement and found that the agencies we most closely reviewed have failed to comply with these contracts .
We found serious erosion of community trust , as well as legal concerns , " says Weissman , who adds that the program may be costly for local law enforcement .
" There are a number of law enforcement associations who think the program distracts from their core mission . " ...
Because immigration law is complicated and constantly changing , Weissman notes that many local law enforcement officials may not have the most current information about an individual 's true immigration status .
What happens to individuals once they are arrested under this program is the subject of another project for Weissman and her team .
" The stories we hear are heartbreaking .
The implementation of this program does not seem to comport with our time - honored values of due process of law " says Weissman , who believes concerned citizens should become involved with the decisions their local government makes about participating in these and similar programs .
" People have to ask themselves what kind of community they want to live in . "
O'Reilly 's dishonesty is really becoming a monument to behold .
The revelation , in yesterday 's Washington Post , that the Bush administration " issued a pair of secret memos to the CIA in 2003 and 2004 that explicitly endorsed the agency 's use of interrogation techniques such as waterboarding against al - Qaida suspects " will increase calls for the administration to be held to account for its actions .
It is unlikely , though , that this revelation will lead to significant activity , beyond adding more voices to grassroots impeachment campaigns in the United States – although it may lead to a strengthening of plans in various European countries to indict senior officials for war crimes .
As law professor Scott Horton explained in June , the best that opponents of the regime can hope for is that the " Bush administration officials who pushed torture will need to be careful about their travel plans . "
The problem for all parties concerned is that the administration itself still refuses to concede that it has engaged in torture , and is being allowed to get away with it in the two places where opposition could really count : the Senate and the House of Representatives .
Rather than pursuing senior officials , house Democrat leader Nancy Pelosi declared that impeachment was " off the table " after the Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives two years ago .
A month earlier , politicians had endorsed the executive 's attempts to shield itself and its employees from any liability for their actions by passing the Military Commissions
Act , parts of which were clearly intended to exempt US officials from being prosecuted for war crimes .
Freed from direct challenges , the administration has , instead , attempted to stifle all mention of torture in its dealings with prisoners seized in the " war on terror " .
A case in point is the British resident Binyam Mohamed .
According to his lawyers at the legal action charity Reprieve , Mr Mohamed , who was seized in Pakistan in April 2002 , was sent to Morocco by the CIA ( before the agency brought torture " in-house " ) , where proxy torturers extracted a number of false confessions from him .
As a result , he was accused of plotting to detonate a radioactive " dirty bomb " in a US city , and was put forward for trial by military commission at Guantánamo .
However , just last week , when a judge in Washington , DC finally had the opportunity to review his case , the US justice department chose to drop the charges relating to the " bomb plot " rather than pursue them , presumably because senior officials were aware that the entire trail of decision - making as to why Mr Mohamed was rendered to Morocco led to the highest levels of government , and to the kinds of discussions between the CIA and senior officials – including Vice President Dick Cheney and defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld – that were discussed in yesterday 's article in the Washington Post .
Even so , Mr Mohamed may still face the same charges in a trial by military commission , because the defence department , safe from judicial scrutiny , still believes that it can pursue prosecutions in a system that is so rigged that , when one of the prosecutors , Lt Col Darrel Vandeveld , resigned two weeks ago , he expressed his profound doubts that the system was " capable of delivering justice " .
The fact that some of these cases – like that of Mr Mohamed – involve the alleged use of extraordinary rendition and torture by or on behalf of the CIA only serves to confirm that even confirmed critics and opponents of the administration 's detention and interrogation policies in the " war on terror " are a long way from holding senior officials to account .
Perhaps the greatest shame , however , is that out on the campaign trail , where these issues ought to count for something , they are not being mentioned at all .
This library really is a national treasure .
( I know , I used to be a board member . )
It 's the country 's first continuously - operated public lending library ( as opposed to a paid subscription library ) , operating since 1743 .
It just has the misfortune to be in a historic but poor , mostly minority community that has to scrape together every dime .
Thanks , Bush - O - Nomics !
The library 's first book purchase ( shown here ) was from Benjamin Franklin 's London bookseller .
( Franklin helped John Bartram , the nation 's first botanist , to set up the library .
Bartram worshipped at the Darby Quaker meeting , whose graveyard still surrounds the present library building . )
If you 'd like to help , send checks to :
The Darby Free Library
1001 Main Street
P.O. Box 164
Darby , PA 19023
AS THE NUTTER administration prepares to ask a court for approval to shutter 11 Philadelphia libraries as part of a cost - cutting plan , a national treasure just outside the city limits is on the verge of collapse .
Delaware County 's Darby Free Library , which was founded in 1743 and is believed to be the oldest continuously operating public library in America , will be forced to close its doors at year 's end if somebody does n't write a fat check , the Daily News has learned .
" We 're on the chopping block , " said Susan Borders , director of the library at 10th and Main streets , near the Southwest Philly border .
" We thought we may have had four years left , but after going over our finances , we only have this year . "
Founded by 29 Quaker townsmen , the library received its first shipment of 45 volumes from London in November 1743 , with the assistance of botanist John Bartram .
" It 's older than our country , " said Raymond Trent , a longtime bibliographic assistant at the University of Pennsylvania Law School who has donated books , DVDs and other reference materials to Darby 's library .
" I appreciate the phone call , but to receive news like this is devastating , " Trent told a reporter yesterday .
He was preparing to donate another shipment of books , including Michelle Obama 's biography .
" Since I grew up in Darby , it was my way of giving back to the community , " Trent said .
" This comes as really bad news to my ears , because I have poured my heart and soul into trying to make Darby library one of the best libraries around . "
Michael Race , spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Education , which funds local libraries , said that the Darby Free Library is the state 's longest - operating public library .
He said that his department is unaware of any library in the United States that predates it .
" It would be a tragedy if they have to close it , " said Lindy Wardell , president of the Darby Borough Historical and Preservation Society .
Some books from its original collection - including John Milton 's Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained and Sir Walter Raleigh 's The History of the World - are still displayed in the two - story brick building , built by Charles Bonsall in 1872 at a cost of $ 8,895.54 .
Others are at the Library Company of Philadelphia , founded by Benjamin Franklin in 1731 as a subscription library .
While the historical significance of Darby 's library - located in a rough - and - tumble town that was once a stop on the Underground Railroad - cannot be overstated , there is also a practical reason to keep it open , supporters say .
It provides high - speed Internet access to the borough of 10,000 residents , some of whom can't afford a computer , and a safe haven for schoolchildren to do research and homework , said Jan Haigis , who sits on the Darby Library Company board .
" It keeps them off occasionally mean streets , " Haigis said .
Joe the Plumber hates spreading around the wealth and says that is stealing ; but as Colmes points out he was on Welfare .
Joe the Plumber ’s argument is that he paid into it .
What Joe the Plumber is not looking up or is ignoring ; the fact that social security and welfare are both government programs designed to protect citizens from the economic risks and insecurities of life .
The very idea that he is condemning , he has taken advantage of .

What I Learned from Spore : Die Spode , DIE !
An incredibly fun game that had an inevitable amount of hype accumulating before its release , Spore also received controversy for both it ’s portrayal of evolution and of intelligent design .
Of course , the first three seconds I started the game , I kinda ’ realize that single cell organisms by definition can’t have eyes , so I just enjoyed the ride without too much thought into it .
I played a passive peace loving race called the Kibsy , basically giant mutant snails with wings that would sooner burst into song and dance than burst enemy ’s faces open .
That was until the Space Stage when all Hell broke loose .
So … what happened ?
Well , it started with these guys :
Well , that ’s okay .
Your race believes in an omnipotent invisible being named Spode , mine believes in an invisible magical girl with a tail that eats people , fair enough … then came these guys :
Well , I suppose the money is going to go to feed the homeless and support women ’s shelters , so I do n’t particularly mind pitching in , especially if intergalactic peace is an added bonus … but could n’t you just ask for a donation instead ?
I thought for sure that was all of them , I mean , how many of these kinds of races could be in a single galaxy anyway ?
Then I met three more Zealot races , all right next to each other , including this one :
That ’s when I snapped .
Two Words :
PLANET BUSTER
This is what a planet looks like when lightly exposed to my unquenchable vendetta to wipe out every single fanatically challenged race that mentions the name Spode in every third sentence .
That was it , no more unbeliever tax , no more arrogant know it all greetings , no more belittling and capitalizing of words that did n’t need capitalization .
I ended up wiping out so many of them that I had to come up with new and original ways to start offing them even more , like this :
By the normal design of the game , the Grox are suppose to be the supreme evil in the game , but honestly , I found their emotional bluntness and on the fly stutter edits to be quite charming .
They ’re just like a teenage girl who was dumped on Prom Night who goes home to eat ice cream non -stop all alone for an hour because there is no reason left to lose weight for — well , that and the whole evil gigantic empire thing .
Compared to the Zealots , they ’re actually quite nice , pure evil , but still nice .
That was n’t the end of my Spode hate though .
I used a Monolith to raise a new race into space , and out of all the different types of race personalities , like Scientist , Warrior , Trader , and Bard , can you guess which one they turned out to be ?
Yup , the Spode worshiping bastard variety , and the first thing they did was praise Spode .
I terraformed your planet and uplifted you from feces chucking savages all the way to space age , and you thank SPODE of all things ?
That ’s when it hit me .
Maybe the player of the game is Spode ?
I mean , deity names get mistranslated all the time and it would make for an awesome plot twist … but then I read the Spore Wiki article … and went right back to more killing .
In conclusion , I did n’t learn much about evolution by playing Spore … although that was probably because I was too busy killing all the religious fanatics in my path to notice .

It ’s easy to take for granted a lot of the words that have entered our high - tech lexicon .
Many of the words – from Amazon to the Web – have real - world meanings that , oftentimes , are very far removed from “ our ” meanings .
Here are a few stories from readers that serve as a fun reminder to all this .
Crunchies ( from Romjin )
Recently , one of our customers called in with some problems he was having with his computer .
" I 'm having a lot of problems with my crunchies , " he explained .
" I 'm sorry , " Romjin responded , " I do n't know what you mean ? "
" Uhh , " the customer paused , " you know , I was on the Internet this morning , and it kept telling me about my crunchies . "
" Crunchies ? ? " , I asked , completely perplexed , " is this a game you have installed ? "
" I do n't know , " he said , " it just keep saying something about my crunchies . "
After some thought about Internet and websites warnings , it dawned on me .
" Do you mean Cookies ? "
" Yeah , " he responded , " that 's what it was saying ! "
Virtual Return ( from Dmitriy )
A few years back , I worked as a software developer for a company that resold prepaid airtime cards to retail outlets .
We did n't actually buy physical cards from the provider , only Card Numbers and PINs ; it was our job to print the barcodes on the physical cards , and ship those to the retailers .
One time , our system rejected an order of " cards " from a airtime provider we 'll call " Sherizon " .
The number of cards , airtime amount , etc. did n't match the order that we had placed .
Obviously , Sherizon 's sales rep sent us another reseller 's order .
When this happened with other providers , standard operating procedure was for the provider to deactive the PINs and send us a new list .
Sherion 's process , however , was slightly different .
This is the email I received back from their sales rep .
Hello Dmitriy ,
Thank you for catching this error !
Please send me back the batch ePIN file * right away * , and we 'll get a new one out to you right away .
Thank You , Sarah M---
Somewhat confused , Dmitriy replied back .
Sarah : I 'm sorry , can you confirm ... you sent us a CSV file .
Do you want me to email that back ?
Sarah responded :
Yes ; please send back the CSV file that was attached to the original email instead of running it through your system .
Obviously , those were intended for another reseller , and we would n't want you accidently selling their cards .
Though I was tempted to explain the fundamentals of email and file copying , I decided not to argue .
When I replied back with the incorrect CSV file , she was very appreciative that I " returned " the file to her .
The Busy Host ( from Blake H. )
Years ago , I worked for a company that sold and supported a restaurant Point of Sale ( POS ) system named after a furry creature that eats and hides nuts .
We had lots of large accounts across the world .
The system was sort of a client - server setup , with a Host Computer in the back office that drove dumb terminals on the restaurant floor .
Whenever there was a problem or lost connection , the terminals would usually flash " Host busy , Manager check Host " .
Most problems could be cured with a reboot of the host computer .
One day I got a call from a manager of an Applebee's .
He says that they can't ring up any orders and that the screens all say " Host busy , manager check Host " .
I asked him if he 's checked the host .
He says " Yep , I 've already done that .
She 's really busy , seating people as fast as she can ! "
I put him on hold while I regained my composure .
Recycled ( from Eric D )
Back in the Win 95 days , I helped a client clean up his computer , which seemed to be bogged down with too many installed programs , bad drivers , and all the other fun Windows 95 issues .
When I was done , the first thing he asked was “ what happened to all of my files ! ? ! ”
“ Which files , ” I asked , having only cleared his temp and similar folders .
“ The ones … ” he said frantically , “ they were all in the bin ! ”
I raised my left eyebrow , “ the bin ? ”
“ Yeah , the one for recycling , ” he explained .
“ Why were storing files you needed in the recycle bin ! ? ” I questioned .
“ Umm , ” he said confidently , “ so I do n’t have to type up new bid estimate every time I bid a job ! ”
After a bit more back and forth , I realized that he would type up an estimate ( completely with the same header , footer , terms , etc ) , print it , and then move the file to the recycle bin .
When it came time to bid a new job , he ’d rifle though all the old bids to see if he could “ recycle ” one to save himself a lot of typing .
I Love You ( from Todd )
Back when I was running the mail system for a large ( 15,000 user ) organization , we were hit by the ILOVEYOU virus .
When it first happened , we quickly modified sendmail .cf to not deliver any emails with " ILOVEYOU " in the subject or body , in order to stop the propogation .
Those emails were dumped to a temp directory .
We then started looking through some of the emails .
I distinctly recall one of them :
" Steve , why have n't you contacted me ?
Things were going so well .
I love you , but this email is your last chance .
If you do n't respond , I 'll assume that you do n't want to be together anymore .
Love , Kathy "
I guess I must have mixed up the pattern match in sendmail .cf .
I hope Kathy gave Steve another chance .
The welfare mama is back .
Pay back the $ 450 million in bonuses paid out to 400 people and then talk .
The first subject to be discussed should then be capping payouts as Senator McCaskill has proposed .

If the tables were turned , you know this is what AIG and Wall Street would do .
They ’ve kicked sand in the face of Americans too many times to play along with their games so now is the time for some tough love , provided AIG wants to stay in business .
American International Group the insurer rescued from collapse by the government in September , is in discussions with Washington about a federal backstop for some of its assets , The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday .
AIG is also considering selling units through public offerings , the newspaper reported , citing an interview with AIG Vice Chairman Paula Reynolds .
“ We ’re looking at a broader array of recapitalization options , ” Reynolds said .
“ We both realize that the environment ’s changing and we have to adjust to that environment , ” she said , referring to the federal government .
Backstopping the insurer ’s assets would be similar to guarantees the government provided for assets belonging to Citigroup and Bank of America , the Journal reported .
" CWA : 6,000 Men and a Scenic Boulevard "
The American way of life depends , in part , on a specific illusion .
It 's a lie that we tell ourselves , and tell our children .
What we just did last Tuesday , an orderly , peaceful , even civil transition of power from one generation to the next , from one ethnic group to another , from one political party to another political party with a different political agenda ?
We lie to ourselves , and lie even harder to our children , that that is something we can count on , something we have always been able to count on , that any alternative is so unthinkable and unnatural for Americans that we need have no fear whatsoever of any alternative .
Historians know that that 's a lie .
Even if one accepts the incredible claim that every US President who has ever been assassinated was killed by a deranged lone gunman , acting out of personal motives , with no political motive , and with no encouragement or assistance by anyone else , the fact remains : historians know that it can get so bad in the United States , economically , that the American people will withdraw their consent to be governed .
We call one particular financial industry collapse that rippled outward around the globe ( among other things , ultimately bringing the Nazis to power in Germany ) not just any recession or depression , but the Great Depression , because the number of people needing work in the US rose to about 3.5 million , or about 20 % of all working - age heads of households .
In the hardest - hit parts of the country , it reached 50 % .
And it 's not a coincidence that the next several years saw three credible attempts to topple the United States government : a half - million man general strike called by Soviet - influenced CIO labor unions aimed at sparking a general uprising and Communist revolution that could n't quite hold out long enough to get their revolution before it collapsed , Huey Long 's astronomically - growing Poor People 's
Army that aimed at overthrowing the Constitution which was only thwarted via its leader 's assassination , and an attempt by the 1930s equivalent of the Democratic Leadership Council , then called the American Liberty League , to use corporate money to bribe US military generals into placing them in power via coup d'etat .
No , we know as a matter of objective fact : somewhere in the near vicinity of 20 % prolonged unemployment , the USA starts running a serious risk of anarchy followed by totalitarianism .
We also know that by the same measure of unemployment that was in use at the time , as of this month the US unemployment rate is somewhere in the near vicinity of 15 % .
And rising .
Fast .
As in perhaps as much as 1 % per month .
No , really , trust me on this : everybody in both political parties now understands what everybody in both political parties understood as of 1933 , when centrist ( and wealthy ) Democratic former New York governor Frank Roosevelt was sworn in as President : they were doomed if they did n't find some way to lower unemployment .
And trust me on this , both Republicans and Democrats in our own time understand that the clock is ticking on this now , too .
What remains is the question : how do we do that ?
Nor are today 's Republican and Democratic leaders the first politicians to be faced with this question , it is the exact same question that was asked in 1933 .
And the political elites and the professional economists of our time agree 100 % with the political elites and the professional economists of 1933 .
Our ruling class , just like the ruling class of 1933 , believes that government by definition screws up everything it touches .
That all government intervention in the economy is inherently bad , that the best it can possibly be is a short - term necessary evil .
That the reason that big corporations are big is that they are lead by people who know how to make the best use of money and how to get the best work out of employees .
Therefore the political elites and professional economists of our time 100 % agree with Frank Roosevelt of early 1933 and with the American Liberty League of the 1930s that what we need is something like the Public Works Administration .
What we need , they are 100 % sure , is a public - private partnership : government identifies legitimate government needs that are n't currently being met , and bids that work out to private contractors , and audits those programs and those contractors to make sure that not one thin dime of taxpayer money is wasted on any project that 's unnecessary or on any expense that can't be justified .
And in a sign of bipartisanship , Franklin Roosevelt appointed left - wing Republican Harold Ickes to do just that .
As Timothy Noah pointed out yesterday in a lovely pair of articles on Slate.com , " Wrong Harry : Four million jobs in two years ?
FDR did it in two months " ( with Charles Peters ) and an almost immediate follow - up piece when a news item proved his point for him even better , " CBO , Meet CWA : More evidence that Obama 's stimulus falls short , " FDR , congressional Republicans lead by Harold Ickes , and right - wing Democrats lead by Al Smithin exactly the same way that Barack Obama , congressional Republicans , and the Democratic Leadership Council are wrong right now .
The Public Works Administration did its job .
It did it under budget .
It wasted not a single dollar .
It attracted not a single critic .
In 1933 , it turned out that there just plain were n't that many legitimate government jobs that were n't being funded already .
As Ickes took his sweet time coming up with more , lest he be criticized for wasting taxpayer money , he found out that there also were n't a whole lot of companies out there begging for the chance to bid on PWA contracts .
They were n't crazy about the contract stipulations , and they were n't all that interested in retooling and reorganizing their entire corporate structures to service contracts there were guaranteed to end as soon as the Great Depression ended .
As an anti-poverty , anti-violent - revolution government program , the Public Works Administration was an unvarnished , absolute , indefensible disaster .
Period .
End of story .
Nobody even tries to defend it any more ; its supporters just pretend it never happened , so they can recommend the same thing the next time without anybody knowing it 's been tried before , because by their politics , it 's the right thing to do whether it works or not .
And along about the time that Roosevelt was about to lose his temper over this , the First Lady talked him into talking to a very successful social worker named Harry Hopkins , who only wanted a few minutes of the President 's time so he could ask one question .
He showed the President figures ( that he later showed Congress ) showing that there were about 3.5 million Americans in 1933 who were heads of households between the ages of 18 and 64 that no employer was going to hire , no way , no how , not for any amount of money , and he asked : " Can you give one legal reason why we can't just hire those people ourselves ? "
The thing is , he got that estimate of 3.5 million people by going through the state - by - state lists of people who werepeople who were already receiving some kind of charitable or government cash hand - out because they were n't working .
And what Hopkins realized was that not only did the American people deeply resent those people for taking money and doing nothing all day , the recipients were n't any happier about it , either : So FDR shoe - horned a program through Congress , first as pilot program called the Civil Works Administration , to raise about $ 1200 ( 1933 US dollars ) per year per unemployed head of household : $ 1000 per worker per year for wages , $ 24 per worker per year for administrative costs , the rest for hand tools and raw materials for whatever projects he could make up .
To get CWA funding , a job had to be something that no corporation was interested in providing , and that no government agency was interested in funding , and it had to be as labor - intensive as possible ( see photograph above right ) .
Conservatives in both parties
And still do .
And campaigned hard against it in the 1934 congressional primaries .
Al Smith 's right - wing Democrats convinced FDR that if he kept the CWA , it would cost him his majority in Congress , so he shut it down after only four months .
In that four months , CWA workers had already built 1,000 rural airports , built 40,000 school buildings , built or resurfaced a quarter - million miles of roads , and laid twelve million miles of sanitary sewer lines , some of the first sewer lines laid in most counties .
Right - wing Democrats and anti-tax pro-corporate Republicans screamed bloody murder about all the money that the CWA was " wasting , " but ( and this is a point I 'll come back to again ) 75 years later , those " worthless " " make - work " projects are turning out to be some of the most valuable stuff the government had done in its first 150 years of existence .
So contrary to what the right - wing Democrats in Congress were telling FDR he " needed " to do to " save " the 1934 congressional elections , terminating the CWA turned out to be thepopular thing he did as President , and as soon as the elections were over , on voter mandate , FDR brought it right back again , rammed it through Congress again as the Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) .
Only this time it had full funding , and a Congressional and Presidential mandate to try to hireof the roughly 3.5 million unemployed , non-disabled , work - aged heads of household in America .
And in almost no time at all , they came as close as makes no difference , getting to 3.3 million , on one simple philosophy : you tell us whatever it is you " do , " and we 'll find you a job doing it .
Those jobs paid very nearly jack squat ; nearly all WPA workers ended up living with their whole families in roughly 8 " x 10 " or so rooms in improvised " boarding houses , " spare rooms leased out by people who were house - rich but cash poor , trying to save their homes , tenants with no control over the menu of the meal plan it came with and shared use of a single bathroom ( or maybe just an outhouse and an outdoor water pump ) with 3 to 8 other families .
Nobody lived well on the WPA , but nobody starved either .
On the other hand , nobody worked terribly hard , either , and I know this one from a very personal source : my paternal grandfather was a WPA veteran .
Grampa Hicks was himself a right - wing anti-tax anti-communist Democrat of the American Liberty League school , and he hated the WPA with a fiery passion for the entire rest of his life .
It was from him I first heard the joke : " How many people does it take to do one WPA job ?
Three .
One on his way to the bathroom , one on his way back from the bathroom , and one leaning on the shovel pretending to work . "
But here 's the funny thing .
You know what Grampa Hicks was before the Great Depression ?
A mostly - unemployed unskilled laborer on the rare occasions he had a job , a street brawler and small - time crook , a chronic alcoholic and wife - beater who spent most of the 1920s in jail .
So when he showed up in one of Harry Hopkins ' branch offices and they asked him , " What do you do ? " all he could answer was , " Nothing . "
So they stuck him on one of the WPA 's archetypal projects : a National Guard armory .
Under the thin pretense of " military preparedness , " Harry Hopkins made up this total BS scenario whereby some day , in some foreign invasion of the US , we might end up having to retreat all the way back to any random tiny little town in America , so every tiny little road - crossing town and every suburb and every city neighborhood in America should have a solidly built , concrete - block or raw stone building that the state militia can store their weapons in until that day , and can use as a fort when we get nearly conquered .
Nobody was fooled .
Everybody knew it was a lie : it was building buildings just for the sake of building pointless buildings .
Furthermore , the whole " fort " thing was just an excuse to make the job take longer , to build out of improbably heavy materials and as slowly and carefully as possible , so those mostly unskilled laborers did n't run out of something to do before Hopkins and his few staff could come up with something else to do .
Grampa
Hicks went to his grave still mocking the work he 'd done .
But you know what ?
There 's a funny thing about that , something I 'm pretty sure Grampa Hicks never thought about .
First of all , if it were n't for the WPA , we Hickses would Grampa Hicks was desperate to get out from behind that wheel barrow and that shovel , but was too drunk to do plumbing .
So he took to hanging around when the electricians were running wire , and managed to get himself a totally useless job as a sort of human Vice - Grip .
" Here , " says the skilled electrician who was himself out of work , yelling over to my grandpa because the WPA would n't spring for proper tools , " you there -- hold these two wires together while I tape them together . "
By following that guy around and watching over that guy 's shoulder , Grampa Hicks taught himself basic electrical wiring .
And when the WPA was over , he was able to lie with a straight face to employers that he was a skilled electrician , and that got him his first real job , one his son learned from him , and that I learned from my dad that paid my way through college : electrical sign erector , IBEW local 1 .
But never mind how much difference those " pointless " National Guard armories made to my family , there 's something even bigger that Grampa Hicks did n't know .
I saw an article a while back ( citation lost , sorry ) by an architecture student who'd gotten curious about what ever happened to all those National Guard armories , so he got some grant money and went on a national tour .
And what he found was that in almost every single rural town in America and even in most suburbs , those " ridiculously over - built " armories were the first truly solid building ever built there .
And because they were " ridiculously over - built , " they 're still in use .
A few are grocery stores or other businesses .
Some are schools or community centers .
Most are police stations or city halls .
Almost all of them double as emergency shelters for the town during natural disasters .
So the student did some math to figure out , using standard construction techniques and assuming standard maintenance costs , and assuming that we would have built something to do those jobs some time between then and now , what it would have cost some of those counties to have done without those buildings .
And compared that to what it cost them and their descendants in federal tax money to support the WPA and to pay off its debts .
You can take almost any WPA project from the 1930s that was widely mocked as a pointless waste of money ; nearly all of them paid every penny back in long - term savings to the taxpayers , in taxes paid by people who learned their trade on those projects who would have otherwise stayed on the dole , or both .
In the 1936 elections , Roosevelt 's political enemies handed out campaign buttons mocking the stupidest - sounding idea the WPA ever had .
See , in even the smallest towns , the WPA built the first sewage treatment plants those counties ever saw , and laid sewer pipe for them .
But lots of Americans still lived in areas too rural for even that .
So the WPA paid teams of laborers to ride from farm to farm , shack to shack , shanty to shanty all over America looking for private outhouses that were rickety , or worse were too close to water supplies or food preparation .
Those teams were given a standardized design with a water - tight roof , solid construction that would require almost no maintenance for decades , and most importantly : clean concrete floors and toilet hole lids that could close nearly air - tight , plus ventilation stacks that were designed to be insect resistant , in order to reduce both ground - water contamination by and insect - born transmission of fecal bacteria .
Many areas turned the WPA down , especially suburbs around cities , and people all over America relentlessly mocked the WPA workers who thought that the US had " nothing better to do " than to waste $ 17 per rural house building massively over - engineered fancy outhouses .
But you know what ?
Over the course of the 1930s and 1940s , almost every area that turned the WPA down on the outhouse project and other sanitation projects suffered major cholera outbreaks .
Areas where the WPA built sewage treatment and sanitary outhouses escaped , and probably millions of dollars in hospital costs and lost wages .
Some people were really determined to not even do anything as useful as pretend to dig ditches .
So they claimed , when the WPA asked them " what do you do ? " to be writers or actors or artists .
Some of them were even sincere , and had actually studied those subjects in high school ; others just made it up .
When asked about it , Harry Hopkins famously shrugged and said , " Why not ?
Those people have to eat , too . "
So the government made up make - work programs for them , too , all of which were relentlessly mocked all through the 1930s .
You 're an actor ?
Here .
You 've got no budget for props , sets , costumes , or stage rights for plays .
We 'll let you use an empty storefront and call it a " theater , " especially if you 'll bring in some WPA laborers to build a stage and some seats for you .
No , wait , you can have some costumes , but not many ; we have some households headed by widows who could stand to do some sewing for you at WPA wages .
And you can have any public domain script you want .
Now , put on plays .
We do n't care what plays , or how many you do , but you will come in 20 to 30 hours a week and work on them , and put them on when you 're done ... including you , Mr. Orson Welles .
Whose acting , then directing , careers are still bringing in taxpayer dollars every year ; all by himself he 's probably paid back the entire cost of the WPA 's program for actors .
You say you 're a journalist or a historian or a writer ?
Hmm .
Tell you what .
During westward expansion , an awful lot of tiny little towns got founded , and the people who founded those towns are getting old ; go ask them who founded the town , and why , and what it was like , and write it up as a history of the county .
Take all the time you want .
Nuts , we 're out of tiny little towns , and still have writers left over .
Think of something .
I know , go interview former slaves ; we 'll give them some time off from their WPA jobs so you can write down what they say their lives were like .
What , we 're still overstocked on people who say they 're writers ?
Fine , here , we 'll hand 'em to the state tourism boards ; we 'll send teams of 'em to just walk around every state in the Union , get drunk in the local bars , describe the local sights , and make tourist guides .
And , oh , by the way , who knew ?
That 'll turn out to include an entire generation of America 's most famous writers , including America 's third and fifth ever Nobel prizes for literature .
Just the taxes on the movie rights to John Steinbeck 's novels have probably paid for that entire program all by itself , and are still paying taxes .
Not to mention that we still have all of those books , and most of their notes towards the unfinished books , and guess what ?
Generations of grad students in history aregrateful to the WPA ; they wishgeneration of Americans had been as well documented .
not a single WPA " make - work " project so pointless and stupid that we did n't get our money 's worth out of it , especially if you count all the on - the - job job skills training it gave the 8 or 9 million people who went through the program .
And that 's even if you do n't factor in the analysis of very serious historians who question whether or not American " G.I.s " would have fought so hard or so well to save the world from 1941 to 1945 if they had been as resentful , and as starving , as they were in 1930 .
But no , the blunt fact of history is that if the truth were ever told about the WPA , if the truth had n't been being smothered in lies by the same political factions that opposed it at the time all the way up to this very day , everybody would know what the WPA proved as inescapable facts .
No dollar of government spending is wasted , if it does a job that nobody else was going to doit builds something that Almost nobody is so greedy and lazy that they actually would prefer to be paid to stay home and watch TV or get drunk or stoned all day ; there are untold tens of millions of us now that no employer would touch for any of a long list of bad reasons who would rather be working .
And no matter how lazy you think they are , boredom is a powerful motivator , and so is a desire not to let down your team , and so is a desire not to look bad in front of others : bring 'em to work , leave 'em alone , and nearly all of them actually will work , will actually build things that are built well , built for the ages , built to last .
Paradoxically , the really wasted money is the money that gets spent on government overseers determined to make sure that none of the workers waste any money : point people at jobs , give 'em simple hand tools , and tell them to take their time and build something solid and it's almost impossible for us to not get that money back in long - term savings .
Nor is this even all that " liberal " an idea .
Ronald freaking Reagan himself briefly campaigned on it , calling it " Workfare : " if you can't find a job , we 'll make you one , whether you like it or not .
But he did n't even get sworn in before the same pro-corporate Republicans and right - wing Democrats convinced him to drop it , to instead concentrate on cutting taxes for corporations as his only unemployment - fighting measure .
No , there is now , just as there was in Franklin Roosevelt 's time , a bipartisan consensus of the elites in this country that the way to put Americans back to work is that taxes must be cut on investors and corporations .
We are , apparently , supposed to ignore the last thirty years of history , which teaches us that every tax cut we pass and every subsidy we grant to big corporations will be used to hire robots or to move jobs overseas .
No , this time we 're supposed to believe it will be different and this time they really will use that money to make more jobs .
Trust them on this , they say .
And just as in Roosevelt 's day , the exact same political coalition of big- corporation Republicans and big-corporation Democrats insist that if that wo n't do the job fast enough , then what we need are even more public - private partnerships .
And ironically , even Barack Obama , who very nearly lost his political career early on because he was caught on the fringes of Tony Rezko 's financially corrupt public - private partnership , one that Barack Obama had gotten for him , somehow has n't learned that it 's public - private partnerships and tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy , not government make - work programs or benefits for the unemployed , that are the real welfare cheats .
Being a Harvard graduate who grew up under the steady drumbeat of pro-corporate propaganda about how evil the WPA was , he 's still talking up the need for more public - private partnerships like Harold Ickes ' old Public Works Administration .
So I figure the odds at roughly 4 to 1 that he 's going to screw up the unemployment situation in America , at the very least doing nothing to help it , and quite possibly making it worse by funding the elimination of yet more American jobs , because that 's exactly what the new President and his cabinet officers are talking about doing , lately .
Sadly , these are even better odds than we would have had under either Clinton or McCain , neither of whom would have even considered anythingpublic - private partnerships .
Obama will , I think , at least think about it .
But I do n't think he 'll do anything but try to set up another PWA .
Which is a damned shame .
Because what we really need is another WPA .
Mind the crevasse :
The amazing 3D pavement art that has pedestrians on edge
After a sudden shift in the Earth 's crust , the ground has cracked open .
What was terra firma is now a gaping crevasse .
And into it - his arms raised in terror - plunges a hapless pedestrian on a shard of rock .
The Crevasse : The giant fissure , in Dun Laoghaire , Ireland , spans over 250 square metres and appears to show an Ice Age fault .
The image only makes sense from one point of perspective
In another apocalyptic scenario , a family desperately struggle to cross what remains of a street .
They hold hands while balancing on islands of tarmac .
Below them a rushing urban river laps against rocks that glow with volcanic intensity .
But , of course , neither of these scenes is what they appear .
They are giant optical illusions conceived by German artist Edgar Mueller .
This giant fissure was created in the German town of Geldern to celebrate the 30th anniversary of a street art competition .
It took a team of artists working 12 hours a day , five days to complete
He spent five days , working 12 hours a day , to create the 250 square metre image of the crevasse , which , viewed from the correct angle , appears to be 3D .
He then persuaded passers - by to complete the illusion by pretending the gaping hole was real .
' I wanted to play with positives and negatives to encourage people to think twice about everything they see , ' he said .
' It was a very scary scene , but when people saw it they had great fun playing on it and pretending to fall into the earth .
' I like to think that later , when they returned home , they might reflect more on what a frightening scenario it was and say , " Wow , that was actually pretty scary " . '
Hard work :
Together with up to five assistants , Mueller painted all day long from sunrise to sunset .
The picture appeared on the East Pier in Dun Laoghaire , Ireland , as part of the town 's Festival of World Cultures
Mueller , 40 , used acrylic wall paint to create the scene .
He trained a camera lens on his work surface to help him fully visualise the idea before painting in the incredible detail to give an impression of depth on the flat surface .
He added : ' The conditions were difficult because if it started raining before a section had dried it could all wash it all away .
' I was very lucky that I managed to get each part done before the heavens opened . '

The artist used the same technique to create the street - turned - river scene in the western German city of Geldern .
Mueller , who has previously painted a giant waterfall in Canada , said he was inspired by the British ' Pavement Picasso ' Julian Beever , whose dramatic but more gentle 3D street images have featured in the Daily Mail
Another amazing 3D street painting ' Turning Riverstreet into a river ' , completed in the colourfully named town of Moosejaw , Canada
It commemorated the 30th anniversary of an international competition of street painters , which takes place in the city every summer .
Mueller , who has previously painted a giant waterfall in Canada , said he was inspired by the British ' Pavement Picasso ' Julian Beever , whose dramatic but more gentle 3D street images have featured in the Daily Mail .
They include a swimming pool chalked on the street so realistically that shoppers swerved to avoid it .
Comet Lulin wo n't be smashing into Earth , but it 's going to swing by so closely in late February that you 'll be able to see it with binoculars - and maybe even your naked eyes .

This gorgeous photo of Lulin , discovered a little over a year ago , was taken last week at New Mexico 's Caldera Rim Observatory by James Maxwell .
Stars around the comet look a bit streaky because of the long exposure required to make the greenish comet pop like that - you can even see its tail and anti-tail ( in front ) .

Photovoltaic Cells Get Up To 10 Percent Efficiency - Which Is A Start
An unfortunate downside to the energy debate is that , when politics get involved , science goes out the window .
The same activist groups that insisted ethanol would be the savior of the environment for 20 years ( and were horribly wrong ) now insist solar energy is the perfect solution .
It is n't , but it is getting better .
Researchers in China and Switzerland are reporting the highest efficiency ever for a promising new genre of solar cells , called dye - sensitized solar cells , which some think offer the best hope for making the sun a mainstay source of energy in the future .
The photovoltaic cells , also called Gräztel cells after Michael Gräztel , inventor of the first dye - sensitized solar cell , could expand the use of solar energy for homes , businesses , and other practical applications , the scientists say .
Their study is scheduled for the November 13 issue of Physical Chemistry C.
Gräztel cells are less expensive than standard silicon - based solar cells and can be made into flexible sheets or coatings but have had serious drawbacks .
They have not been efficient enough at converting light into electricity .
And their performance dropped after relatively short exposures to sunlight .
In the new study , researchers including Gräztel describe lab tests of solar cells made with a new type of ruthenium - based dye that helps boost the light - harvesting ability .
The new cells showed efficiencies as high as 10 percent , a record for this type of solar cell .
The new cells also showed greater stability at high temperatures than previous formulas , retaining more than 90 percent of their initial output after 1,000 hours in full sunlight .
It may take 15 years for solar energy to be viable but it will be worth it , so there 's no need to rush .
As we learned from ethanol , the one thing worse than doing nothing is implementing the wrong solution and being stuck with it .

WASHINGTON — A reflective President Bush today acknowledged a number of blunders that have marred his White House years , but he told a small group of Texas reporters that " I have a great sense of accomplishment and am going home with my head held high . "
Bush mused fondly about his future life in Dallas , saying he looked forward to walking down supermarket aisles , sitting in a rocking chair with old friends and staying out of the public spotlight .
" I am looking forward to going back to Texas , " the former Texas governor said .
" I am going to a place where I have a lot of friends , people who will be my friends regardless of politics , " he said .
Before leaving office , the president said he is likely to deliver a farewell address to the nation that would include thanks , praise and lessons learned .
Bush says he will miss the creature comforts of the presidency -- the luxury of Air Force One , the convenience of having a helicopter outside your back door and the " fantastic " service at the White House .
" I do n't know what it 's going to be like to wake up on the 21st of January , " he admitted .
Bush said he plans to divide his time between his Crawford ranch and a spacious rambler in North Dallas .
" Laura bought a house , " he joked .
" I have n't seen it yet .
They say it 's a beauty . "
The soon - to - be - ex - president said he 's looking to " find enough to keep this Type A personality from getting restless . "
Bush said he will write a book with the help of a ghost writer , " give some speeches " and " spend some time on the SMU campus , " where his presidential library and freedom institute will be built .
He said he told President - elect Barack Obama earlier this week that he'd be " more than willing " to listen if the new commander - in - chief had " some tasks he may want me to take on . "
For the time being , those activities will not include partisan politics .
Bush pledged to stay out of the looming 2010 Republican gubernatorial primary between Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison .
Bush says , he looks forward to vanishing from the daily headlines .
" The ex-president needs to get off the stage , " he insisted .
" You 've had your time in the klieg light ...
The less I 'm on TV , the better . "
In the 55 - minute interview , Bush pointed to accomplishments including a series of tax cuts , two energy bills , the No Child Left Behind education legislation , expansion of Medicare to include a prescription drug benefit , new free trade pacts .
He said he is " pleased with the progress we have made in dismantling al Qaida . "
But , he acknowledged , " it 's been hard to keep the American people convinced that there is still a threat . "
Among his failures were comprehensive immigration reform and an overhaul of Social Security .
He admitted to several war - related mistakes , including the infamous " Mission Accomplished " banner .
" My language at times has been a little rough and over the top , " he said .
" But the thing about the presidency is you do n't have any do - overs . "
Among his political setbacks , Bush particularly regrets the failure of immigration legislation , which was killed by the Senate in 2007 .
" I'm very disappointed that it did n't pass , " he said .
" I 'm very worried about the message that said , ' Republicans are anti-immigrant . ' "
Bush said he favored a comprehensive immigration plan " not for political standing or for Latinos , but because it was best for the country . "
He said he should have pushed his immigration proposal right after the 2004 election , while he had some political capital , rather than waiting until after the partisan brawl over Social Security .
He also said he " did n't realize how significant the financial meltdown would be " until a " startling moment " last year when his Treasury Secretary told him that the country could face a crisis " greater than the Great Depression " if he did n't act immediately .
He noted that he had told an audience in Houston last year that " Wall Street got drunk and we got a hangover . "
Bush said he " fully understands why people in Texas are saying " that he abandoned conservative free - enterprise principles .
But he strongly defends the $ 700 billion financial industry aid package he sought in September .
" The answer is : if we did n't ( act ) , you 're going to suffer more ... I have moved and moved very aggressively .
We have abandoned free - market priniciples , and did what we had to do to prevent the financial industry from melting down . "
The outgoing president had a bit of advice to congressional Republicans : lay off the new occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
" I think they will be making a mistake if they attack President - elect Obama and call him names , " Bush said .
Indeed , the harsh tone of Washington is something the Texan will not miss .
" I did not really anticipate the harshness of the rhetoric here , " he said .
" It was so different than Texas .
In Texas , we treat each other with respect . "

In his latest installation , “ Seizure ” , British artist Roger Hiorns has turned the idea of sculpture inside out .
Rather than present a sculpture inside an architectural space , he ’s turned every surface of the architectural space into sculpture .
Mixing installation art and chemistry , he ’s taken an entire abandoned apartment near London ’s Elephant & Castle and transformed it into a gemstone .
Covering the inside with blue copper sulphate crystals , he ’s created an other - worldly , mineralized , glinting mirror of an everyday apartment .
Jewels literally glowing from the ceiling and lining the floors …
The scale and production of “ Seizure ” is ambitious .
After reinforcing the walls and ceiling and covering them in plastic sheeting , 80,000 litres of a copper sulphate solution was poured in from a hole in the ceiling .
After a few weeks the temperature of the solution fell and the crystals began to grow .
The remaining liquid was pumped back out and sent for special chemical recycling .
Describing his experience , Guardian art critic Adrian Searle said :
“ Silvery shards of cold light spangle and wink and beckon .
Every surface is furred and infested ; big blue crystals dangle like cubist bats from the light fittings .
Little wonder the flat has been abandoned : you ’d move out , too , if the crystals moved in . ”
If you ’re in London , “ Seizure ” is open to the public until November 3 , at Artangel at Harper Road .
Check out some pictures from people lucky enough to be able to see “ Seizure ” up close , plus some very cool pics of the creation process , at Iconeye .

Editor ’s note : A sign of things to come ?
In years past the Secret Service and local law enforcement were responsible for protecting the president during the inauguration , now that duty has apparently shifted to the military and Northcom .
It would seem Northcom is not enough , however — General Gene Renuart says an “ integrated air defense system ” including Canadians will “ be up and robust and available . ”
Since when have Canadians been tasked with protecting the president during his swearing in ?
Canada and the U.S. signed an agreement that paved the way for the militaries from either nation to send troops across each other ’s borders during an emergency .
I guess we are to consider the inauguration of Obama an emergency ?
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The US military plans to mobilize thousands of troops to protect Washington against potential terrorist attack during the inauguration of president - elect Barack Obama , a senior US military commander said Wednesday .
They will fly combat air patrols and man air defenses , organize large scale medical support , and help local law enforcement provide security in the capital , said General Gene Renuart , head of the US Northern Command .
“ ( It ’s ) not because we see a specific threat , but because for an event this visible , this important and this historic , we ought to be prepared to respond if something does happen , ” he told reporters .
Renuart said some 7,500 active duty troops and 4,000 national guard troops will take part in the operations in support of the inauguration of the 44th US president on January 20 .
Overall responsibility for security during the inauguration falls to the Secret Service .
But Renuart ’s command , which is co-located with NORAD , is responsible for preparing for any contingency .

I ’ve recently been getting really into table tennis , a sport I ’ve played for most of my life , but never seriously .
My father taught me when I was just tall enough to reach the table , and I was hooked ever since .
As I began to study table tennis ( or more casually , ping pong ) in depth , I realized it ’s one of the best sports for hackers .
Here ’s why .
1 . Table tennis is easy to install in any office
Just order a table , some balls , and few paddles and you ’re in business .
No complicated setup is necessary .
2 . Table tennis exercises the brain
A simple game of table tennis works wonders for the reflexes and brain .
The ball moves fast , and studies have shown that the game keeps your brain sharp .
It ’s also especially refreshing to play a fast reaction after a complex coding session , and can get your mind to drift off of a problem long enough to work out the solution .
3 . Table tennis is strategy
Table tennis is one of the few sports that has a wide variety of play styles .
Just like programmers have various languages to choose from , there is a multitude of table tennis playing styles .
And , just like programming languages , these styles are continuously evolving .
Throughout the decades , many styles of play have had their moment in the limelight .
It ’s really up to you how you ’d like to play .
Maybe you ’re an aggressive player that uses the handshake grip .
Or , maybe you ’re an attacker that uses the Japanese penhold grip , utilizing extremely fast footwork .
Or , maybe you ’re a defensive lobber ( a rare type , but perhaps you program in Haskell ?
Do n’t think lobbing works ?
Witness the power of the lob below . )
There really is an essence of “ hacking ” in table tennis as well .
Each style has particular strengths and weaknesses .
Much of the challenge is to discover your opponents ’ weaknesses and change the way you play to exploit them .
4 . Table tennis does n’t require you to be in super tip - top shape , but it ’ll get you in shape
Table tennis is an easy sport to pick up ( but as the cliche goes : very difficult to master ) .
Most importantly , for casual games , you do n’t need to be super athletic to play .
This encourages everybody in the office to get involved , no matter how fit your are .
On the flip side , the game does offer the rare chance for many hackers to exercise during the day .
A game is ideal for any hacker who has been sitting in a chair for the past 4 hours .
Get up and move around .
A healthy hacker is a productive hacker .
5 . Table tennis is social
A game of table tennis encourages conversations , especially if you play doubles .
It ’s a good way to get the team together and participate in something fun and interactive after a day of staring at a lifeless screen .
6 . It ’s just damn fun .
Go out there and get a table , review the rules , and start playing .
Trust me , it ’ll boost productivity .
Yanks for Stalin
Interview Transcript Stephen Kotkin ( cont ) Q. You might talk about Ford in that model .
I think they probably were involved in finally getting Henry Ford .
I guess originally they could not convince him to actually invest and build a factory in Russia , so , you might tell the Henry Ford story and how that factory was built .
A. Henry Ford is a god to the Soviets , because he is something that they want to be , an authoritative authoritarian advanced Capitalist with modern technology who knows how factories work , especially factories with heavy industry which produce strategic goods .
The Soviets both make fun of Henry Ford as the quienisential Capitalist and they envy him for something he has that they want very badly .
Ford , himself , has very little sympathy for the Communist cause , although I think he does recognize the Authoritarism as potentially useful .
What the Soviets are able to do is to convince Ford that since he can't build anything at home in the United States , there are opportunities for him in the Soviet Union .
The primary goal , originally , is for automobiles , vehicles .
This , then , moves into tanks and the possibility of using the automobile factories to produce tanks and other military equipment .
Ford is not necessarily interested in building up the Soviet military , but he is interested in selling his technology and his factories and he enjoys the platform and the notoriety that comes from being a major player between the two countries .
The word ' Fordism ' becomes a slogan inside the Soviet Union and in a way , it defines the whole epic .
' Fordism ' means , large factories producing , perhaps , low quality , but big quantities of goods which can be used to further industrialize .
So , the goods become inputs for other industrial goods as well as finished products in some cases .
So everything that we recognize as part of modern life , not only automobiles , but refrigerators , street lamps , staircases made out of steel , large buildings made out of glass and steel , all of these indispensable material basis for modern life is what Ford represents to the Soviet Union .
Moreover , he represents it in a factory setting whereby there is a hierarchy and control over the work force and costs can be controlled as well perhaps , but , certainly output can be expanded and the more output the better of these goods .
So , Ford takes like wildfire to the Soviet Union and it is mutual .
He himself sees the Soviet Union as a place he can bring his own philosophy and he thinks they accept this philosophy , whereas , they are using him for their own purpose .
Looking back on the epic , Ford remains in the Soviet mind later on after the war and even today in post - Soviet Russia mind as the symbol of the era because of his assembly lines , because of his factories , because of his heiarchy and because of his modern industrialism , which is across countries and has little to do , in many ways with the political system , whether Democratic or Authoritarian .
Q. Talk about , we see them unloading Ford tractors before they built the factory , the plants , you might talk about , I guess he was exporting tractors there , or automobiles , probably not , you might talk about that .
A . The Soviets would try to identify the technology which they thought they acquired by sending people abroad to look at it , by leafing through magazines of the period .
The more famous it was , the more likely it was the Soviets would discover .
At first , they would try to purchase it , then they would try to acquire it some other way , the capability of producing it on their own .
Ford was a famous , international personage .
Anything associated with Ford caught the Soviet eye .
They were very happy to buy his tractors .
They were even happier to acquire the capability of producing his tractors , especially since those assembly lines could be converted to make takes with a little bit of extra technology .
As with Ford , so were the other Capitalist firms .
Perhaps you buy their product , then you try to interest them in selling the capability to produce their product and as we said earlier , this was attractive to the Capitalists because no one else at the time , during the Great Depression , was very much interested in their product .
Q. They tried to get him to invest money originally and he would not do it .
You might talk about that nuance to the story for us .
A . The Soviets were very confused about what type of model was appropriate in their collaboration with the Capitalists .
They did not have private property , they perhaps could .
The Soviets were not sure how to attract the Capitalists .
The Soviet Union was non-Capitalists , meaning it did not allow private property .
So , on what terms were the Capitalists to be invited in ?
There was a model of concession , whereby , you would sell , release , for a certain amount of time , the rights to operate whatever it was was built , but , ownership would remain in Soviet control .
How much concession ?
51 % ? 75 %?25 %?
Moreover , what if the Capitalist decided that concession was not enough ?
They wanted ownership , meaning a long term stake and control .
The negotiations are rather comical .
The Soviets are not sure what it is they want , on what terms they are going to be able to attract the Capitalists and the Capitalists themselves , including Henry Ford , have certain goals that they are pursueing .
In the end there are tremendous shifts , difference of opinion , contracts that are proposed and then are taken away , these terms are no good , those terms are no good , but the bottom line is the Soviets refuse to grant ownership to the Capitalists .
They retain ownership , therefore they want to purchase only the technology and the know how for installation .

Play a little game of soccer while you wait for your Play & Freeze Ice Cream Maker to finish chilling your creamy delight .
Just add ice , rock salt , ice cream mix ( cream vanilla , sugar , and your favorite flavors ) , and some shakes , kicks , or rolls .
Takes about 10 minutes for this people - made ice cream to be ready to eat .
We all walk a fair distance every day .
According to health experts , we ’re supposed to log 10,000 steps on a daily basis to maintain optimum health .
Well , whether we ’re as diligent as that , or just barely making it to 2,000 , we may soon be able to harvest our walking energy .
The Biomechanical Energy Harvester developed by kinesiologist Max Donelan at Simon Fraser University aims to capture the energy of walking using a 3.5 - lb. device strapped to the walker ’s knee .
Said to not hamper the walker ’s natural stride , this little device should be able to power between two and five cell phones , laptops , iPods , and more .
Sony ’s got a bevy of hand - cranked devices in the works .
Options ( from left to right ) include the Pull N’ Play stereo headphones , the Push Power Play photo and video viewer , the Crank N’ Capture video camera , the Spin N’ Snap digital camera , and the Juice Box solar battery .
Have you misplaced your cell phone charger ?
Looking for a second device to power your mobile phone on the go ?
The SideWinder is a great solution , especially since it ’s lightweight ( 2.5 ounces ) and comes in a small package .
With just 2 minutes of cranking , you ’ll get 6 minutes of talk time .
Comes with cable and adaptors for Nokia , Audiovox , Kyocera , Motorola , Sony / Ericsson , and Samsung .
If you ’re a fidgeter , this is the perfect gadget for you .
Simply roll the RollOn along any surface and you ’ll charge it up .
Inspired by bicycles , this device functions like any other mp3 player , but it gives you battery - free listening enjoyment .
Having a reliable flashlight in your home , car emergency kit , or while you ’re camping is a necessity , but when it goes unused for months on end , you risk finding the batteries dead and useless .
Not with a hand - cranked or solar - powered flashlight .
Using either the power or the sun or human - powered cranking , you ’ll have a bright light in any situation .
Could you pack more functionality into a single device ?
The handy wind - up radio meets flashlight meets portable charger is another great option for emergencies at home or while out and about , especially if you ’re looking for a clean - powered solution to your survival needs .
This unit has an AM / FM radio , an LED light system with emergency flash , a siren , cell phone charger , and can even give you National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) weather reports .
With a 1:40 - 60 crank - time to light - time ratio ( in minutes ) , you do n’t have to labor long to brighten your work desk or favorite reading corner .
Using an LED bulb powered by a magnet and copper power design , the old - style Krank LED Fixture combines old - world with conscious illumination .
Launched by the MIT Lab in 2005 , the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) program has delivered over 500,000 $ 100 laptops to over 20 developing countries around the world .
They require very little power , and can be charged with solar collectors , hand cranks , and even yo - yos .
While they ’re not for sale in the traditional sense , every year or so they have a gift - one - get - one campaign that allows you to make a donation to send one laptop overseas and keep one for yourself .
While not exactly a gadget , we could n’t resist leaving you with this “ power by the people ” inspiration .
The Revolution Door by Fluxxlab has taken the idea of human - energized technology and applied it to the revolving door .
By harnessing human energy for use in lighting and other electrically - powered devices , this door will even communicate with each person as they pass through the door to let them know their contribution to the energy cycle .
Also in the works :
The Powerslide which turns ordinary actions like opening a sliding closet door or window into power - generating ones .
People - propelled vehicles and other oddities
Even if you do n’t live far from the grocery store , carting heavy tins and boxes home after a long day of work can be a trial for even the fittest humans .
So why not lay your hands on a grocery - getter on wheels ?
The Cart Bike gives you a bit of exercise as you go to and fro between home and food mart with carrying capacity well beyond the traditional bike basket .
Who knows whether you ’d be permitted to bring the contraption into the actual store , but even if you have to lock it up outside , it ’d seriously cut your food procurement emissions .
If you ’re going to be in Toronto in the near future , consider hiring an EcoCab for any shorthaul trips around the downtown core .
These pedal - powered taxis offer travelers emissions - free and free - of - charge transportation ( they ’re funded entirely by corporate sponsors ) .
With a “ Pedal Yourself Healthy ” motto , Velomobile aims to spread the word about pedal vehicles and regular exercise for everyday transportation .
Their fully - enclosed tadpole vehicles function like a recumbent tricycle , but with added features like protection from the elements and an “ accessory cockpit ” for under $ 4,000 ( $ 6,625 fully assembled ) .

Need something that will transport your whole family fuel - free ?
Then check out the HumanCar .
Using “ body steering , ” four people rowing the car will get the vehicle going about as fast as a conventional bicycle .
Meant as a neghborhood vehicle ( meets state requirements for safety on short , neighborhood trips ) , this vehicle even has electric assist motors and regenerative braking for hillier locales .
The grim news on the state front keeps piling up .
I am confident that every state is in fiscal trouble so expect to see headlines like these for quite some time to come : California May Pay With IOUs for Second Time Since Depression .
California , the world ’s eighth largest economy , may pay vendors with IOUs for only the second time since the Great Depression , State Finance Director Mike Genest said .
In a letter to legislative leaders Dec. 2 , Genest said the state “ will begin delaying payments or paying in registered warrants in March ” unless an $ 11.2 billion deficit is closed or reduced .
California , which approved its budget less than three months ago , may run out of cash by March , state officials say .
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger warned that he may issue the warrants , which are a promise to pay with interest , to suppliers and contractors as the seizure in credit markets may make it too costly to borrow .
“ It ’s getting worse very quickly , ” Schwarzenegger , a 61 - year - old Republican , told reporters Dec. 1 after declaring a fiscal emergency and ordering the Legislature into a special session to find ways to close the deficit .
“ It ’s like an avalanche in that it gains momentum .
And that ’s what we ’re in right now , so it ’s a real crisis . ”
The warrants would be given to landscapers , carpet cleaners , construction firms , food services companies and other state vendors .
They would pay an interest rate of as much as 5 percent , based on state law .
California last issued the IOUs in 1992 when lawmakers and then - Governor Pete Wilson deadlocked on a budget for 61 days past the start of the fiscal year .
California ’s two year budget shortfall is about $ 28 billion , accounting for one - third of the deficits faced by U.S. states , according to figures from the National Conference of State Legislatures in Denver .
Pain And Sacrifice In Minnesota

Warning that Minnesotans are facing a time of " pain and sacrifice , " officials Thursday said they would slash state spending and rethink the role of government in the aftermath of a towering deficit that tops $ 5.2 billion over the next two and a half years .
Government will have to change " in a historic way , " he said .
As part of that , he said , " there 's no question that there will be spending cuts in programs that have existed for a while . "
For starters , Pawlenty said he is ordering state agencies to cut 10 percent of discretionary spending .
Only public safety , corrections , the military and veterans affairs will be spared .
Leaders of the DFL - controlled House and Senate said they will take a knife to the state budget and the pain could be substantial .

There is a great deal of consternation regarding the amount of debt this country is about to incur over the next several years , and rightfully so .
However , as you can see , debt to GDP has been far higher in the past .
Current Events – Foreclosure Rates Continue To Rise
Everyone needs a place to call home but that is becoming more of a problem as foreclosures continue to skyrocket with no immediate relief in sight .
According to CCNMoney.com , “ U.S. foreclosure filings spiked by more than 81 % in 2008 … and they ’re up 225 % compared with 2006 . ”
In spite of the efforts of the foreclosure prevention programs put on by government and the banking industry , defaults continued to climb right through to the end of December 2008 .
In addition to soaring foreclosure rates , housing prices continue their downward spiral .
Declining prices mean that many homeowners owe more on their homes than the homes are worth on paper .
This inequity increases the likelihood that these homeowners will default on their loan .
As you can see , foreclosures and falling home prices go hand in hand .
As a matter of fact , foreclosed homes tend to sell at a steep discount compared to the rest of the market .
This means that when foreclosed homes make up a large percentage of all home sales , they can exaggerate the intensity of price declines .
Therefore , an influx of more bank - owned homes in an already slow housing market will continue to push the prices down even further and increase the possibility of more foreclosures .
S&Ps chief economist , David Wyss , expects home prices to continue to go down , finally bottoming out in early 2010 at roughly 33 % below their 2006 peak .
This could mean that more than 860,000 families will lose their homes to foreclosure in the upcoming year .
This is tragic news for homeowners that are barely making ends meet and a possible premonition of things to come for those who have already missed one mortgage payment .
There are no quick fixes to this huge economic issue but if you are a homeowner who is having financial difficulties you should contact your mortgage holder now and try to work out a realistic plan for you .
There may be the potential to re-mortgage your home at a lower rate or the possibility to skip one monthly payment per year .
The key is to contact your financial institution before there are no other alternatives to foreclosure .

Like a lot of you , I grew up on Sesame Street and the Muppets .
But did you ever stop to wonder where they came from ?
Some of the characters we know and love were recycled from other TV shows and commercials Jim Henson worked on , while others were invented by using whatever materials were around .
Be prepared for a little nostalgia , and I hope I did n't leave out your favorite " “ not all of the characters have interesting background stories ( sorry , Big Bird ) .
1. Cookie Monster

Jim Henson drew some monsters eating various snacks for a General Foods commercial in 1966 .
The commercial was never used , but Henson recycled one of the monsters ( the " Wheel - Stealer " ) for an IBM training video in 1967 and again for a Fritos commercial in 1969 .
By this time , he started working on Sesame Street and decided this monster would have a home there .
2. Elmo
Getty Images
The way it 's described by a Sesame Street writer , apparently this extra red puppet was just lying around .
People would try to do something with him , but nothing really panned out .
In 1984 , puppeteer Kevin Clash picked up the red puppet and started doing the voice and the personality and it clicked " “ thus , Elmo was born .
3. Telly Monster
Telly Monster was originally the Television Monster when he debuted in 1979 .
He was obsessed with TV and his eves would whirl around as if hypnotized whenever he was in front of a set .
After a while , producers started worrying about his influence on youngsters , so they changed him to make him the chronic worrier he is now .
4. Count von Count
Count von Count made his first appearance in 1972 and was made out of an Anything Muppet pattern " “ a blank Muppet head that could have features added to it to make various characters .
He used to be more sinister " “ he was able to hypnotize and stun people and he laughed in typical scary - villain - type fashion after completing a count of something and thunder and lightning would occur .
He was quickly made more appealing to little kids , though .
He is apparently quite the ladies ' man " “ he has been linked to Countess von Backward , who loves to count backward ; Countess Dahling von Dahling and Lady Two .
5. Kermit
Getty Images
Kermit was " born " in 1955 and first showed up on " Sam and Friends , " a five - minute puppet show by Jim Henson .
The first Kermit was made out of Henson 's mom 's coat and some ping pong balls .
At the time , he was more lizard - like than frog - like .
By the time he showed up on Sesame Streetin 1969 , though , he had made the transition to frog .
There are rumors that he got the name Kermit from a childhood friend of Henson 's or a puppeteer from the early days of the Muppets , but Henson always refuted both of those rumors .
6. Real Swedish Chef
Lars " Kuprik " BÃ¤ckman claims he was the inspiration for the Swedish Chef .
He was on Good Morning America , he says , and caught Jim Henson 's eye .
Henson supposedly bought the rights to the Good Morning America recording and created the Swedish Chef ( who DOES have a real name , but it 's not understandable ) .
One of the Muppet writers , Jerry Juhl , says that in all of the years of working with Jim Henson on the Swedish Chef , he never heard that the character was based on a real person .
7. Animal
Everyone 's favorite member of Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem may have been inspired by Keith Moon of The Who .
This is speculation , but people who support this theory will point out that Jim Henson named one of the Fraggle Rock characters " Wembley , " which is the town Moon was born in .
8. Miss Piggy

Miss Piggy is apparently from Iowa .
Makes sense .
Anyway , she started as a minor character on The Muppet Show , but anyone who knows Miss Piggy can see that she would n't settle for anything " minor . "
Her first TV appearance was actually on an Herb Alpert special .
It was n't until 1976 , when The Muppet Show premiered , that she became the glamorous blonde with a penchant for frog that we know and love today .
Frank
Oz once said that Miss Piggy grew up in Iowa ; her dad died when she was young and her mother was mean .
She had to enter beauty contests to make money .
9. Rowlf the Dog

Rowlf , surprise , surprise , was first made in 1962 for a series of Purina Dog Chow commercials .
He went on to claim fame as Jimmy Dean 's sidekick on The Jimmy Dean Show and was on every single episode from 1963 to 1966 .
Jimmy Dean said Rowlf got about 2,000 letters from fans every week .
He was considered for Sesame Street but ended up becoming a regular on The Muppet Show in 1976 .
10 . Oscar the Grouch
Oscar is performed by the same guy who does Big Bird , Carroll Spinney .
Spinney said he based Oscar 's cranky voice on a particular NYC cab driver he once had the pleasure of riding with .
He was originally an alarming shade of orange .
In Pakistan , his name is Akhtar and he lives in an oil barrel .
In Turkey , he is Kirpik and lives in a basket .
And in Israel , it 's not Oscar at all , it 's his cousin , Moishe Oofnik , who lives in an old car .
11 . Gonzo .
What exactly is Gonzo ?
Nobody knows .
Even Jim Henson had no particular species in mind .
Over the course of The Muppet Show , Muppet Babies and various Muppet movies , Gonzo has been referred to as a " Whatever " , a " Weirdo " and an alien .
Whatever he is , he first appeared on the scene in 1970's The Great Santa Claus Switch .
His name was Snarl the Cigar Box Frackle .
In 1974 , he showed up on a T.V. special for Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass .
He became Gonzo the Great by the first season of The Muppet Show and developed his thing for Camilla the Chicken almost accidentally : during one episode where chickens were auditioning for the show , puppeteer Dave Goelz ad - libbed , " Do n't call us , we 'll call you " ¦ nice legs , though ! "
It was decided then and there that Gonzo would have a bizarre romantic interest in chickens .
12 . Statler and Waldorf
I could n't find much on their particular inspiration , but I can tell you that they 've been around since the 1975 Muppet Show pilot .
They are named after popular New York City hotels ( the Statler Hotel was renamed the Hotel Pennsylvania in 1992 . )
Guess what Waldorf 's wife name is ?
Yep " ¦
Astoria ( she looks startlingly like Statler . )
FYI , Waldorf is the one with the mustache and white hair .
Statler has the grey hair .
Apparently Waldorf has had a pacemaker for more than 30 years .
13 . Beaker
I always thought of Beaker and his buddy Bunsen Honeydew as characters that came along later in the Muppet timeline , but they have been around since the The Muppet Show .
Although Beaker usually says things along the lines of , " Mee - mee - mee - mee ! " , he has had a few actual lines : " Sadly temporary , " " Bye - Bye " and " Make - up ready ! "
Despite being word - challenged , he manages to do a pretty convincing Little Richard impression and , surprisingly , had mad beatbox skills .
Beaker is one of the only Muppets that was never recycled from some other purpose " “ he was created solely for The Muppet Show .
14 . Fozzie Bear
Getty Images
Poor Fozzie .
He 's the perpetual target of Statler and Waldorf because of his horrible jokes and puns .
It actually created a bit of a problem during the first season of The Muppet Show , because when Fozzie got heckled , he got very upset and sometimes cried .
Viewers did n't feel sympathy ; they felt embarrassed .
The problem was solved by making Fozzie an optimist so that even when he got heckled he was good - natured about it .
It 's often thought that he was named after Frank Oz , who was his puppeteer , but Frank said it 's just a variant of " fuzzy bear . "
Yet another story says he was named for his builder , Faz Fazakas .
Wocka wocka !!
15 . Bert and Ernie
They are the Muppet version of Felix and Oscar ( the Odd Couple , for you young 'uns ) .
Lots of people think Bert and Ernie were named for some minor characters in It 's A Wonderful Life , but according to the Henson company , that 's just a rumor .
Jim Henson always maintained that it was just a coincidence " “ the names just went well together and seemed to fit the characters .
Jerry Juhl , one of the head writers , corroborated this and said that Jim Henson had no memory for details like that and would have never remembered the name of the cop and the taxi cab driver in the old Jimmy Stewart movie .
Other rumors to clear up : Bert and Ernie are n't gay and neither one of them are dead .
Now that we 've got that straightened out , here are a few more tidbits : the original Ernie used to have a gravelly voice similar to Rowlf the Dog's .
Frank Oz was Bert 's puppeteer and hated him at the beginning .
He thought Bert was ridiculously boring , but then realized that he could have a lot of fun with being boring .
Jim Henson once said , " I remember trying Bert and Frank tried Ernie for a while .
I can't imagine doing Bert now , because Bert has become so much of a part of Frank . "
16 . Grover
Getty Images
Everyone 's favorite " cute , furry little monster " made his TV debut on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1967 .
At the time , he was known as " Gleep " and was a monster in Santa 's Workshop .
He then appeared on the first season of Sesame Street , but sported green fur and a reddish - orange nose .
He did n't have a name then , but by the second season he transformed into the Grover we know today , more or less " “ electric blue fur and a pink nose .
The original green Grover was reincarnated as Grover 's Mommy for a few episodes .
In Latin America and Puerto Rico Grover is known as Archibaldo , in Spain he is Coco , in Portugal he is Gualter and in Norway he is Gunnar .
17 . Sweetums
Sweetums is one of a handful of full - body Muppets .
He showed up in 1971 on the TV special The Frog Prince .
This is where he got his name " “ when Sir Robin the Brave is about to defeat the ogre , a witch shows up and changes him into a frog ( who later becomes Robin , Kermit 's nephew ) .
Apparently smitten with the ogre , the witch tells her darling " Sweetums " that he can have the frog for breakfast .
Bigger fame awaited Sweetums , though " “ in 1975 , he appeared on Cher 's variety show to do a duet with her to " That Old Black Magic " .
He officially joined The Muppet Show cast in 1976 .
18 . Rizzo the Rat
The name might sound familiar to you , especially if you 've seen Midnight Cowboy , he is named for Dustin Hoffman 's character , Ratso Rizzo .
He was created after puppeteer Steve Whitmire was inspired by rat puppets made from bottles .
He first showed up on The Muppet Show as one of a group of rats following Christopher Reeve around " “ he 's easy to spot because he hams it up more than any of the other rats .
He occasionally performs with Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem .
19 . Pepe the King Prawn
Pepe 's full name is Pepino Rodrigo Serrano Gonzales .
I heart Pepe .
He was a chef in Madrid before going Hollywood on Muppets Tonight in 1996 .
He was paired with Seymour the Elephant ( Pepe was originally going to be a mouse ) on the show , but Seymour never developed quite the same following and was only in two episodes .
He rarely gets names right " “ some of his mispronunciations include " muffins " instead of Muppets , " Kermin " instead of Kermit and " Scooper " instead of Scooter .
He 's quite full of himself " “ in addition to thinking that he 's quite the ladies ' man , he also fully expects to win several Oscars .
20 . Herry Monster
Herry Monster from Sesame Street was the Big Bad Wolf in his original incarnation , which you can kind of tell by looking at his fur .
It 's pretty wolf - like ( if wolves were blue , I mean ) .
He became a Sesame monster in 1970 to replace the Beautiful Day Monster , who looked kind of like Sam the Eagle and existed to cause destruction wherever he went , thus ruining the beautiful day people had been having before he showed up .
Herry used to have a furry nose but got upgraded to his non-furry , purple nose in 1971 .

Byron L. Dorgan , Democrat of North Dakota , served in the House from 1981 to 1992 and in the Senate from 1992 to 2011 .
He is a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center .
WASHINGTON — WHEN I retired in 2011 after serving 30 years in Congress , there was one set of issues I knew I could not leave behind .
I donated $ 1 million of unused campaign funds to create the Center for Native American Youth at the Aspen Institute , because our country has left a trail of broken promises to American Indians .
As chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs , I once toured a school near an Indian reservation where I encountered a teacher who told me that when she asked a young Indian student what she wanted for Christmas , she said she wanted the electricity turned on in her house so she could study at night .
That type of story is all too familiar .
I believe that American Indian children are the country ’s most at - risk population .
Too many live in third - world conditions .
A few weeks ago , I traveled to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota .
It ’s hard just to get there .

The sequel to 2004's Red Dead Revolver , Rockstar 's take on spaghetti westerns , is coming to the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 this fall , Rockstar Games announced this morning .

Red Dead Redemption is the story of former outlaw John Marston and will take place at the turn of the 20th century when the " lawless and chaotic badlands began to give way to the expanding reach of government and the spread of the Industrial Age . "
" Along the way , players will experience the heat of gunfights and battles , meet a host of unique characters , struggle against the harshness of one of the world 's last remaining wildernesses , and ultimately pick their own precarious path through an epic story about the death of the Wild West and the gunslingers that inhabited it . "

" The team at San Diego have massively exceeded our expectations with the sheer depth of experiences in Red Dead Redemption , " said Sam Houser , Founder of Rockstar Games .
" The seamless combination of breathtaking beauty and intense action , all woven together with strong plotlines in a massive vibrant , rural environment is mind - blowing .
We think this game helps to push the limits of what an open - world gaming experience can be . "
The game will use Rockstar 's proprietary RAGE game engine , which was used in Table Tennis , Grand Theft Auto IV and Midnight Club : Los Angles .
The game will feature an open - world environment which will include frontier towns , wildlife - packed prairies and mountain passes .
I loved Red Dead Revolver , despite the average reviews and 1.5 million copies sold , and it 's great to see that the sequel is finally moving forward .
Now about that Gun sequel .

Miep Gies risked her life looking after the Franks but said : " I stand at the end of a long line of brave Dutch people who did much more than I did to save lives during the dark terrible years of the occupation of the Netherlands by the Germans .
For them , the events of those terrible years remain alive like something that happened yesterday .
For me , I think of what happened to the Franks every day . "
If you 've been following the world of videogames for any length of time , you 'll doubtless have come into contact with the huge amounts of negative press that videogames get .
Thanks to media sources like FOX News and The Daily Mail and individual moral crusaders such as Jack Thompson or Leland Yee , games have shouldered the blame for much of the violence and chaos that is prevelant in society .
Of course , it 's easy to slap videogames with a bad reputation in isolated and sensationalized incidents , but when we really put interactive software into perspective , how does it rank up against other causes of violence such as alcohol , football and even shopping ?
What we 've done here is by no means scientific , but we feel it serves a solid counter argument that if we should ban videogames for their potential to cause harm , there are all manner of other facets of society , some of them important and seemingly benign , that must be outlawed long before gaming comes under fire .
What we have done is compiled a death toll for videogames , looking at all the cases involved gaming and mortality over the years .
We believe that , even if we stack the deck against videogames by drawing unfair comparisons with other examples , that games will come out as untainted saints in contrast .
Now , most of you know that already without the proof .
Still , it 's always nice to be right .
The Videogame Death Toll :
From compiling all the instances of reported mortality that has been publicly connected in some way , shape or form to videogames , we have been able to " attribute " a death toll of no more than 26 to gaming .
In order to be sporting , we have even included instances of murder where videogames were ruled out by police as a contributing cause , such as the murder of Stephen Pakeerah in 2004 and the retracted insanity plea of Dustin Lynch in February 2003 .
Here 's a list of cases of death where videogames were said to be involved :
To stack the deck against videogames even more , we included deaths involving games that were not instances of murder , but remain unproven , notably the passing of two individual Chinese gamers who seemingly died after huge gaming binges .
Just for completion 's sake , we even threw in the famous Everquest suicide case of 2001 .
The only case we have omitted from the videogame kill count is the Virginia Tech shooting of 2007 .
The videogame connection was an invention of the press and those who already bore grudges against interactive software .
We know why Seung - Hui Cho did the things he did , and we know that videogames were not part of the case .
While we included other cases where the police effectively ruled out videogames , we are not going to include a case where the game connection was simply dreamed up to score points off the tragedy .
26 deaths , and if you 're a completist , 2 wounded .
Let 's compare that kill count to other things that we can ban instead of videogames .
Soccer :
Soccer , or football as it is known in England , is the United Kingdom 's most treasured sport , and commands a loyalty among its fans that could rival any religion .
" Eat football , sleep football , live football , " is a saying that I grew up having hammered into my head as a British child .
In England , football is God .
It is a wrathful God .
Football is responsible for much gang violence in the UK , and there are individual cases of stabbings and beatings throughout the history of worldwide football hooliganism .
Remember , I said we'd be stacking the deck here , so let 's give soccer an unfair advantage .
Let 's take all football - related deaths from JUST England , and then only include the most famous cases .
What 's the death toll ?
137 .
That is just using the four most famous cases , and just looking at England .
Let 's compare that to the videogame death toll which is collected from cases around the world .
137 versus 26 .
It 's not hard to see what should be banned if human safety really is the concern of the moral majority .
We can even trump the videogame death toll in just one match .
Two of the most famous cases , in fact , easily beat out videogames .
First of all , we have the Heysel Stadium Disaster , where fans of the British Liverpool team crushed 39 Italian Juventes fans to death with a wall .
Even more shocking is the Hillsborough Disaster of 1989 , where a staggering 96 football fans were killed in a human crush .
Just two cases alone " prove " that football is deadlier than videogames .
The numbers are there .
Religion :
Football is like a religion , but nothing beats the real deal .
We all know that religion is one of the leading causes of death and destruction in human history .
From the medieval Crusades to modern day terrorism , the name of God has been soaked in more than enough blood .
Again , we 're giving videogames a tough time , and it would be far too easy to pile on the Holy Wars and give gaming a free pass .
Less " easy " examples of religious death involve " Visionary " serial killers .
These are men and women who " hear " the voice of God , or other religious figures , and are compelled to kill by the belief that they 're doing The Lord 's work .
Harvey Carignan is a fine example , a man who claimed God told him to hit women until they were dead .
While a death toll formed simply of people who killed because they thought Jesus told them to would be lovely , such figures appear difficult to take a stab at ( pardon the expression ) , even with extensive research .
Instead , I 'm going to bring up a name that should be familiar to many of you -- Jim Jones .
James Warren " Jim " Jones was the founder of The People 's Temple , a religious group that in 1978 became responsible for the greatest loss of American civilian life in a non-natural event until the September 11 terrorist attacks ( a case which can only be linked to religion ) .
The short story is that 909 individuals took part in a mass suicide , spurred on by Jones , after joining his cult and being convinced to drink cyanide - laced Flavor Aid .
909 individuals killed in the name of religious belief .
That 's just one cult as well .
That 's just the minimum figure , with many other cases of mass suicide out here .
Again , in the entire history of videogames , we have only 26 deaths that could be attributed .
When it comes to religion , we start at 909 and work our way up .
We 're not saying that these cults are strictly in line with the majority of religions , but then , nobody ever says that those who kill in the name of GTA IV are strictly in line with the majority of gamers , either .
However , people want to ban games despite the fact that the deaths are tenuously related .
Cults , also , are a tenuous byproduct of religious belief .
We could happily ban religion instead of videogames and make cults much harder to flourish .
Alcohol :
While the field of videogame violence research has thrown up nothing but conflicting results and differing opinions , we seem to have piles of evidence when it comes to the dangers of drink .
Of course , The Daily Mail has never run a frontpage article demanding an alcohol ban .
Not like it did for videogames .
Let 's return to the United Kingdom for this one .
As usual , we do n't wish to give games an easy ride , so we 'll compare every single death that can be related to a game with just one country in just one year .
Surely the videogames , with decades and decades of deaths , will overshadow the booze , right ?
A number of charities have been criticizing alcohol - related death lately , claiming that the amount of cases has risen to unacceptable levels .
Using figures attained from 2007 , these charities have been able to tell us that 13.3 alcohol - related deaths were had per 100,000 people .
The population of Britain in 2007 stood at 60,769,000 people .
If we all get out our calculators , we should be able to get a nice round figure , from that one year alone .
8082 !
Actually , the correct figure is 8082.82 , but let 's not make things look even worse for the booze .
Again , over the span of several decades , videogames could only be marginally held accountable for 26 deaths .
If you want to do a direct comparison , videogames were implicated in only 3 deaths during 2007 .
8082 versus 3 . Hardly grounds for newspapers to cry " BAN THIS SICK FILTH " over games , when you truly put it into perspective .
Sugar :
America loves its sugar .
Your British immigrant writer actually can't eat common household bread in this country because Americans stuff too much sugar into it .
People like sugar -- it makes things taste sweet , and sweet things are good things .
Nobody would ever want to ban it .
However , sugar causes more deaths per year than videogames could ever dream of .
One of the most common causes of death in America is diabetes , and according to the American Diabetes Association , the disease claimed 224,092 lives in 2002 alone .
You eat too much sugar , you get diabetes .
You play too many videogames , you do not get diabetes .
Hispanics working in Texas :
Did you know that Texas is a nation leader when it comes to the death of Hispanics ?
That 's right , according to a 2005 report , Texas had the highest Hispanic workplace death rate of any other state , a shocking 163 dead of 491 worker deaths .
Since 163 is a much higher number than 26 , we obviously need to ban Hispanic people from working in Texas .
It will save lives , so we must do this thing !
491 worker deaths in total is pretty high .
Maybe we should ban everyone in the state of Texas from working .
Mass unemployment could have saved those lives !
Hell , if we want to save the whole of America , we could point out that this 2005 report noted 5,559 American workplace deaths nationwide .
Let 's give nobody a job and save the world !
Well , I suppose that 's actually happening at the moment , so it seems America 's on the right track .
This is good .
Jobs should be banned instead of videogames , because lives will be saved .
That 's how it works , right ?
End notes :
Now , we are obviously not going to seriously advocate the banning of these provided items .
This is not an article intended to demonize religion , soccer , drink or anything else .
However , hopefully this illustrates just how myopic and single - minded the anti-videogame crusade is .
Compared to the millions and millions of deaths we have a year , a mere 26 in all of history is n't even pocket change .
It 's not even a drop in the ocean .
Even if we believed that videogames alone caused these 26 deaths , and we do n't , there is not enough evidence to show that they prove a danger to society in the slightest .
26 deaths compared to the hundreds caused by football riots , or the thousands that have died from diabetes , is nothing .
Barely microscopic .
A joke .
If you crusade against videogames , you are quite clearly doing nothing for society .
You will not save it , you will not be a hero .
You will have about as much impact on the world as 26 deaths have in the grand scheme of things .
Next time someone tells you that videogames are the cause of violence and destruction , whether they say it from behind a lecturn , over a beer , while eating candy or employing a Hispanic , just tell them .
It could be worse .
We could be watching a football match .
U.S. home prices continued to fall in November , with the Los Angeles area posting among the sharpest declines , according to a prominent index released Tuesday .
The Standard & Poor ’s / Case - Shiller index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas was down 18 % in November from the same month a year earlier .
Home prices in Los Angeles and Orange counties were down 27 % compared with November 2007 .
Every one of the 20 regions reported a price decline .
Phoenix ’s drop of 33 % was the steepest , followed by Las Vegas , which posted a 32 % decline from a year earlier .
Close behind in their November price drops were San Francisco ( 31 % ) , Miami ( 29 % ) and San Diego ( 26 % ) .

The smallest year - over - year declines were in Dallas ( 3 % ) and Denver ( 4 % ) .
The Case - Shiller index compares the latest sales of detached houses with previous sales , and accounts for factors such as remodeling that might affect a house ’s sale price over time .
From those data , an index score is created to show price changes .
An index score of 100 reflects January 2000 prices .
The November index score for Los Angeles was 175.85 .
In the Los Angeles area , the index showed a greater price decline among lower - priced homes .
The index divides homes into three price tiers .
Prices of homes in the least - expensive tier declined 46 % in November compared with a year earlier .
The November annual decline for mid-priced homes was 37 % , while the highest - priced tier fell 26 % .

The California Assn. of Realtors also reported home - price figures Tuesday .
The real estate industry group said the median sales price of a resold single - family home in California fell 42 % in December compared with the same month last year .
The December median sales price of $ 281,100 was down from $ 480,820 in December 2007 .
Those low prices attracted bargain hunters , who drove December sales up 85 % from a year earlier .
According to the Realtors group , the 10 cities in California with the highest median detached - home prices last month were Danville , $ 1,029,000 ; Santa Barbara , $ 952,500 ; Santa Monica , $ 825,000 ; San Ramon , $ 711,500 ; Redondo Beach , $ 682,500 ; San Clemente , $ 675,000 ; San Francisco , $ 625,500 ; Arcadia , $ 625,000 ; San Mateo , $ 618,500 ; and Carlsbad , $ 615,000 .

What is Haskell good for ?

In economic downturns , most economic activity arguably has a positive externality ; when A buys services from B , not only do A and B benefit but the downturn is reduced a bit as well .
( In an upturn , extra activity arguably exasperates the boom - bust cycle . )
This fact can justify subsidizing economic activity a bit more ( or taxing it a bit less ) during a downturn .
But it turns out this is n't the main rationale for " economic stimuli " now being debated ; those plans are largely based on the idea that people can be fooled because they are biased .
Tyler Cowen :
Let 's say government can spend $ 100 billion today or spend the present expected value of $ 100 billion , stretched out over time so it is a commitment in perpetuity .
Both spending programs are financed by bonds . …
The Keynesian boost to aggregate demand arises because people consider the resulting bonds to be " net wealth " even when they are not .
…
People are tricked by the government 's fiscal policy , but of course the extent , timing , and nature of the trickery is hard to predict .
Is it easier to trick people " a lot all at once " or " a little bit by bit over time " ?
It depends .
If you try to trick them slowly over time , temporal learning and adaptive expectations may work against the policymaker .
But if you try to trick people a lot all at once , the trick may rise over their threshold of attention , perhaps because of media coverage .
Wise taxpayers who get stimuli tax rebate checks should mostly save them , realizing that future taxes must rise to pay for those checks .
For similar reasons , wise taxpayers should also spend less upon hearing about government spending increases .
So with wise taxpayers it is not obvious that tax rebates or government spending increases would help much with the downturn .
The consensus among macro-economists seems to be that people can in fact be fooled by such stimuli , but as Tyler indicates , it is not clear which policies most fool us .
In particular , the more public attention we give to the stimuli , the less they might work .
We might make people realize that they need to compensate via saving , and the more we scare folks into thinking we need huge stimuli , the more we might scare them away from normal economic activity levels .
So should we stop explaining macro-economics during this crisis , and stop saying how desperately we need stimuli ?
After all , similar rationales were offered against allowing financial market short - sales .

Cheney :
If president does it during wartime , it 's legal Andrew McLemore
Published : Sunday December 21 , 2008

This VP mocks successor , does n't regret ' F*ck yourself ' remark Dick Cheney is leaving office without remorse and taking some potshots at his successor on the way out the door .
Cheney mocked Joe Biden during a Fox News interview for misstating the section of the constitution that defines executive branch power , and he was dismissive of criticism that his amassing the power of the vice presidency was a trend that needed to be reversed .
" If he wants to diminish the office of the vice president , that 's obviously his call , " Cheney shrugged .
" President - elect Obama will decide what he wants in a vice president and apparently , from the way they 're talking about it , he does not expect him to have as consequential a role as I have had during my time . "
Biden bit back , however , in a dueling Sunday morning interview that aired on ABC's " This Week " in which he said he stood by his statements .
" His notion of a unitary executive , meaning that , in time of war , essentially all power , you know , goes to the executive , I think is dead wrong .
I think it was mistaken .
I think it caused this administration , in adopting that notion , to overstep its constitutional bounds , but , at a minimum , to weaken our standing in the world and weaken our security .
I stand by that -- that judgment , " Biden said .
Cheney also seemed nonplussed at the idea that it was inappropriate for him to tell a senator to " Fuck yourself " on the floor of the Senate .
WALLACE : Did you really tell Senator Leahy , bleep yourself ?
CHENEY : I did .
WALLACE : Any qualms or second thoughts or embarrassment ?
CHENEY : No , I thought he merited it at the time .
And we 've since , I think , patched over that wound and we 're civil to one another now .
Earlier : Cheney not sure if bin Laden is alive ; says problems with auto industry fall to Obama .
All of President Bush 's actions during his years as a wartime leader were done with full legal authority , Vice President Dick Cheney said on Fox News Sunday .
Asked by Chris Wallace if it 's legal when the president makes a decision to help the country when it 's fighting a war , Cheney said , " As a general proposition , I 'd say yes . "
" You need to be more specific than that , but clearly when you take the oath to support , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States from all enemies foreign and domestic , there 's no question about what your responsibilities are in that regard , " Cheney said .
The Vice President acknowledged that there are arguments about how Bush exercised his powers , but remained adamant that his administration stayed loyal to the Constitution .
Cheney explained that the president 's 24/7 access to nuclear codes in the event of an nuclear attack against the United States exemplifies the " nature of the world we live in . "
" He could launch the kind of devastating attack the world has never seen , " Cheney said .
" He does n't have to check with anybody , he does n't have to call Congress , he does n't have to check with the courts , he has that authority . "
Defending policies on detainees , terrorist surveillance and intelligence gathering as justified in a time of war , Cheney said " It 's unfortunate , but I think we 're perfectly appropriate to take the steps we have . "
Cheney also said he did not know if Al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was still alive .
" I do n't know and I 'm guessing he is , " Cheney said .
" We 've had certain pieces of evidence become available from time to time , there 'll be a photograph released or something that allows the intelligence community to judge that he is still alive . "
Asked by Wallace to address the current crisis in the American auto industry , Cheney demurred , saying the responsibility of finding a solution lies with President - elect Barack Obama and his administration .
Cheney says it 's a difficult problem and that President George W. Bush has done his best to manage it .
It was just on Friday when Bush ordered an emergency bailout of the industry by offering $ 17.4 billion in loans .
The aid comes with tough concessions from the carmakers and their workers .

Lee Sustar reports from Chicago on an occupation by workers who want what 's theirs from management and the Bank of America .
WORKERS OCCUPYING the Republic Windows & Doors factory slated for closure are vowing to remain in the Chicago plant until they win the $ 1.5 million in severance and vacation pay owed them by management .
In a tactic rarely used in the U.S. since the labor struggles of the 1930s , the workers , members of United Electrical , Radio and Machine Workers of America ( UE ) Local 1110 , refused to leave the plant on December 5 , its last scheduled day of operation .
" We decided to do it because this is money that belongs to us , " said Maria Roman , who 's worked at the plant for eight years .
" These are our rights . "
Word of the occupation spread quickly both among labor and immigrant rights activists -- the overwhelming majority of the workers are Latinos .
Seven local TV news stations showed up to do interviews and live reports , and a steady stream of activists arrived to bring donations of food and money and to plan solidarity actions .
Management claims that it can't continue operations because its main creditor , Bank of America ( BoA ) , refuses to make any more loans to the company .
After workers picketed BoA headquarters December 3 , bank officials agreed to sit down with Republic management and UE to discuss the matter at a December 5 meeting arranged by U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez ( D - Ill ) , said UE organizer Leah Fried .
BoA had said that it could n't discuss the matter with the union directly without written approval from Republic 's management .
But Republic representatives failed to show up at the meeting , and plant managers prepared to close the doors for good -- violating the federal WARN
Act that requires 60 days notice of a plant closure .
The workers decided this could n't go unchallenged .
" The company and Bank of America are throwing the ball to one another , and we 're in the middle , " said Vicente Rangel , a shop steward and former vice president of Local 1110 .
Many workers had suspected the company was planning to go out of business -- and perhaps restart operations elsewhere .
Several said managers had removed both production and office equipment in recent days .
Furthermore , while inventory records indicated there were plenty of parts in the plant , workers on the production line found shortages .
And the order books , while certainly down from the peak years of the housing boom , did n't square with management 's claims of a total collapse .
" Where did all those windows go ? " one worker asked .
Workers were especially outraged that Bank of America , which recently received a bailout in taxpayer money , wo n't provide credit to Republic .
" They get $ 25 billion from the government , and wo n't loan a few million to this company so workers can keep their jobs ? " said Ricardo Caceres , who has worked at the plant for six years .
THE MEMBERS of Local 1110 have a history of struggle .
In 2004 , they decertified the Central States Joint Board - - a union notorious for corruption and sweetheart contracts with management -- and brought in UE , a far more democratic organization .
In May of this year , Local 1110 mobilized for a contract by organizing a " practice " picket , and 70 workers used their lunch break to confront the boss with a petition listing their demands .
The workers were able to turn back company 's effort to win major concessions and won solid pay increases .
Now , management is trying to get revenge by pocketing money that belongs to the workers .
UE officials and workers acknowledge that it will be difficult to stop the plant from closing .
But they 're determined to get the money owed to them -- and they believe that by fighting , they can set an example for other workers facing layoffs and plant closures as the recession deepens .
Negotiations are set for Monday , December 8 .
Whatever happens , however , the workers have already sent a message to employers that if they violate workers rights and the law , they can expect a fight .
" This is a message to the workers of America , " said Vicente Rangel , the shop steward .
" If we stand together , we will prevail until justice is done , and we get what we 're due . "

Our guest blogger Lune ( who in one of his past lives worked on the Hill ) was just in India and gives us his take on the Satyam Computers case , which has gotten scant coverage in the US .
The Indian government ’s reaction to its biggest corporate scandal ever makes for a useful object lesson .
From Lune :
We Americans have typically prided ourselves on having the most reliable , transparent , and well regulated financial markets in the world .
That reputation has taken quite a beating in the past couple of years , arguably starting with Enron and accelerating in the past year ; so much so that we have begun looking at such countries as Sweden , Japan , and the UK for possible examples of how to deal with our current financial troubles .
Perhaps another good example might be India .
While much of the world ’s attention has been consumed by the drama in the US and Europe , India has been rocked with what is being called the biggest corporate fraud in its history , something akin to America ’s Enron and Lehman .
Satyam Computers , one of the largest IT firms in India , has been embroiled in an accounting scandal .
To summarize briefly , this autumn , Satyam ’s founder and ( now former ) chairman , B. Ramalinga Raju , proposed to Satyam ’s board that the company buy two unrelated firms substantially owned and run by his family members .
In December , the board agreed and announced its decision , only to be greeted by a massive investor revolt over this non-arms - length deal .
Within a few days , the deal was scuttled .
Soon afterward , several board members resigned , and the company became the focus of closer scrutiny by investors and the press .
On Jan. 7th , Ramalinga Raju resigned as chairman of Satyam and admitted that the company inflated its earnings for the past several years and engaged in accounting fraud to the tune of ~ Rs. 7,000 crore ( Rs. 70 bil or $ 1.4 bil ) .
A more detailed account and timeline can be found here .
While the details of exactly what happened will take some time to figure out , the government ’s response has been swift :
From the WSJ : Within a week of Ramalinga ’s resignation , he , his brother , and Satyam ’s CFO have been arrested and are currently in jail awaiting trial on criminal charges of conspiracy , cheating and falsification of records .
The entire board of the company has been dismissed by the government , and a new board has been constituted with members nominated by the central government including one former member of SEBI , the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( India ’s version of the SEC ) .
This new board will hire a new CEO , and other key executives , with the stated goals being “ to restore the company ’s credibility , customer confidence and employees ’ morale and to safeguard the interest of investors and other stakeholders . ”
From the Business Standard and The Hindu : SEBI has announced that it will conduct a “ peer review ” of the financial statements of every company in the Nifty and Sensex indices ( indices consisting of the 80 largest and most actively traded Indian companies , akin to the US DJIA or S&P 500 ) for both the 3rd quarter and for the past year .
A peer review is to consist of an analysis of the statements along with the working papers used by the company ’s auditor to certify the statements .
This peer review will be done by an auditor unrelated to the company ’s current accounting firm , selected from a panel of independent auditors to be named by the government .
From The Economic Times :
In addition , SEBI is developing criteria for additional companies to be peer reviewed , targeting companies with the highest likelihood of having engaged in similar fraudulent practices .
For example , it is looking at including companies with multiple subsidiaries or companies whose shares have risen abnormally just before the announcement of results .
Certainly , we will need to see whether all these initial efforts are followed through , and India ’s extensive government corruption is well documented , so this may all still come to nothing .
That said , the Indian government ’s rapid and comprehensive response , including the arrest and criminal charges for the perpetrators of the fraud , the sacking and reconstitution of the company ’s board with truly independent and activist members ( despite Satyam being a fully private company ) , and the investigation of the largest companies and those that might be most suspicious in the eyes of investors will do a great deal to restore the Indian people ’s confidence in their private markets .
Furthermore , it stands in stark contrast to the kid gloves with which we have treated our own fraudsters
Why is Dick Fuld still roaming the streets after making false statements about Lehman ’s health right up until its implosion ?
How about Angelo Mozilo ?
And why have n’t the incompetent boards of such companies as Citi been dismissed ?
And would things have been better if after the implosion of Bear Sterns , the SEC ordered a “ peer review ” of all major investment and commercial banks so that it could deal with problems before they blew up into Lehman and Citi sized disasters ?
While skeptics often dismiss “ socialist ” countries like India for confiscatory taxation and state - sponsored market manipulation , it is ironic to note that India at least , appears to be taking comprehensive steps to ensure the integrity of its free markets while not ( yet ) spending a dime of public money bailing out its bad apples .
The U.S. , in contrast appears to be doing the exact opposite …
It was eight turbulent years : 9/11 , two wars , Hurricane Katrina and the worst recession since the 1930s .
But President George Bush 's verdict at his final press conference yesterday was : " We had fun . "
He and his team had many joyous days in office , he said .
" And people , they say , I just do n't believe it to be the case .
Well , it is the case .
" In the darkest moments of Iraq and every day when I was reading the reports about soldiers losing their lives , no question there was a lot of emotion , but there were times where we could be lighthearted and support each other . "
His final appearance before the White House press corps could not even muster a full house .
The door into the White House briefing room - which will be bulging next week for the first briefing under Barack Obama 's administration - opened to reveal a sombre - looking president who quickly switched on a smile for the cameras .
Bush , who is said to privately detest journalists , was ill - at - ease throughout , and at times emotional , introspective and melancholic .
He made a few jokes , often at his own expense , but he also revealed how much he has been hurt by the criticism that he was the worst president in recent US history .
He admitted to some disappointments , but was generally unapologetic .
Most of the 48 minutes of what Bush described as the " ultimate exit interview " was spent trying to persuade his audience , both in the room and the public watching on television , that he did not deserve to be labelled the worst president in recent US history .
He thanked reporters , many of whom had followed him since he was on the campaign trail in 2000 , even though sometimes he had not liked what they had written .
Reviving one of his famous verbal stumbles , he said : " Sometimes you misunderestimated me . "
He admitted there had been disappointments , and singled out Abu Ghraib , Iraq 's non-existent weapons of mass destruction and his " mission accomplished " claim , only a month after the Iraq invasion .
" I do n't know if you want to call those mistakes , but things did not go according to plan , " he said .
Although he said he did not believe in self - pity , he returned again and again to those who had opposed and ridiculed him : the journalists and political elite and the needless name - calling culture in Washington .
He twice mentioned the antagonism from Europe , in particular the lack of support over the Iraq war from France and Germany , though he did not name those countries .
Showing an unexpected level of bitterness , he warned Obama to expect people he regarded as friends to turn against him .
He expressed hope that history would prove kinder to him than his contemporaries had .
Listing what he regarded as achievements of his administration , he put at the top the " surge " policy in Iraq , sending 30,000 extra US troops , which he claimed has helped to bring relative stability to Baghdad and most of the country .
He defended himself over the prison camp on Guantánamo , the recession and the slow response of the federal government after Hurricane Katrina .
In one of many prickly moments during the press conference , he said of Katrina : " Do n't tell me the federal response was slow when there was 30,000 people pulled off roofs right after the storm passed . "
Demonstrating just how much the hostility from Europe had irritated him , he screwed up his face when asked about it .
" I strongly disagree with the assessment that our moral standing has been damaged , " he said , while acknowledging that it might be the case among elites in Europe .
People he had met in Africa , India and China did not share that judgment , Bush claimed .
He could easily have won popularity in Europe , he said , but had instead opted to do what he thought was right .
" In certain quarters of Europe , you can be popular by blaming every Middle Eastern problem on Israel .
Or you can be popular by joining the International Criminal Court .
I guess I could have been popular by accepting Kyoto , " he said .
He claimed the press had often misunderstood - or underestimated - what was happening inside the Oval Office , and that the portrayal of him as lonely and isolated was wrong .
" And we had fun , " he said , even in the darkest days of Iraq .
Asked how he would spend his retirement , the president said that the day after his successor 's inauguration he would get up and make a cup of coffee for his wife Laura at their ranch in Crawford , Texas .
He admitted he would find it difficult to retire : " I 'm a Type A personality , you know , I just can't envision myself , you know - the big straw hat and the Hawaiian shirt - sitting on some beach . "
That brought laughter .
In almost a whisper , he joked : " Particularly since I quit drinking . "
He insisted he was not going to be one of those former presidents who would comment and carp from the background .
" When I get out of here , I 'm getting off the stage . "
Referring to the bright lights used by camera crews , he added : " I 've had my time in the Klieg lights . "
ThURSDAY AM UPDATE : Both Viacom and Time Warner Cable took their revenue battle to the brink .
Less than an hour before TWC ’s 13.3 million subscribers were going to lose 19 Viacom channels at 12:01 AM today , the two Big Media companies came to an agreement .
Here was their joint statement :
TIME WARNER CABLE , VIACOM REACH AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE
Networks Will Continue to Be Available On All Time Warner Cable Systems New York , NY – Jan. 1 , 2009 — Time Warner Cable ( NYSE : TWC ) and Viacom ( NYSE : VIA and VIA.B ) jointly announced this morning that they have reached an agreement in principle to renew carriage for Viacom ’s MTV Networks .
The companies expect to finalize the details of the agreement over the next several days .
Glenn Britt , President and CEO of Time Warner Cable said , “ We are pleased that our customers will continue to be able to watch the programming they enjoy on MTV Networks .
We are sorry they had to endure a day of public disagreement as we worked through this negotiation . ”
Philippe Dauman , President and CEO of Viacom said , “ We ’ve been partners with Time Warner Cable for a long time , and we ’re happy to be renewing that partnership for the benefit of their customers and our loyal viewers .
It ’s gratifying that we could reach an agreement that benefits not only our audiences but that is also in the best interest of both of our companies . ”
WEDNESDAY NOON : Viacom has rejected Time Warner Cable ’s request for a 15 - to 30 - day extension on the 12:01 AM January 1st deadline when the cable programmer pulls its 19 channels off the 2nd largest cable system operator .
I ’m told Viacom and TWC had no contact throughout yesterday until news of the Big Media battle broke .
Suddenly , at 8 PM , TWC came to Viacom with an increase offer and the extension request .
But Viacom rejected both out of hand .
“ It was bogus .
The low - ball offer was clearly an excuse to ask for an extension and then use that in their press acrtivity today , ” a Viacom source claimed to me .
“ After we ’ve been trying to meet with them for several weeks , we wo n’t consider an extension unless they ’re prepared to really negotiate and come across with a reasonable offer . ”
Insiders say Viacom President / CEO
Philippe Dauman stayed in his office most of today waiting to hear from his TWC counterpart Glenn Britt , but the situation remains stalled .
This is turning out to be Big Media brinkmanship at its most brutal with 13.3 million cable subscribers caught in the middle .
WEDNESDAY 11:30 AM : Viacom has now answered the bashing by TWC’s Britt :
Time Warner Cable ’s continued rhetoric and posturing is disappointing and unproductive .
We have made it clear that we welcome a credible and meaningful discussion that respects our viewers and the value our programming brings to Time Warner Cable .
We remain ready and willing to engage .
It ’s time for serious talk – before the viewers become the victims .
WEDNESDAY 10 AM : Now it ’s all about the PR war between these two Big Media giants .
To counter Viacom ’s 12 - hour media blitz blasting his company , Glenn Britt , President / CEO of Time Warner Cable just issued this statement about Viacom ’s “ threats ” to pull MTV Networks from TWC customers :
Christmas is over , but Viacom is still playing Scrooge , threatening to pull its MTV Networks off of Time Warner Cable at midnight tonight unless we ask our customers to pay exorbitant price increases .
Viacom claims their demands equate to “ pennies , ” but that is misleading and insulting to our customers , from whom Viacom is trying to extort another $ 39 million annually – on top of the hundreds of millions of dollars our customers already pay to Viacom each year .
That does n’t sound like pennies to us .
Demanding that our customers pay so much more for these few networks would be unreasonable in any economy , but it is particularly outrageous given the current economic conditions .
We sympathize with the fact that Viacom ’s advertising business is suffering and that their networks ’ ratings have largely been declining .
However , we ca n’t abide their attempt to make up their lost revenue on the backs of Time Warner Cable customers .
We ’ve negotiated in good faith and made several concessions to help reach a fair and reasonable deal .
We ’ve asked for an extension of the current contract while we continue to negotiate .
But Viacom does n’t appear to be interested in what ’s fair and reasonable for American consumers – they ’re only interested in propping up their sagging bottom line , and they are poised to pull their networks from Time Warner Cable customers tonight .
Huge price increases like what Viacom is demanding threaten the ultimate value of cable TV .
Time Warner Cable is a retail distributor of products we purchase wholesale .
Wholesale programming costs are rising dramatically every year , and , like all multichannel distributors , we have to pass on at least a portion of the increases to our customers .
Viacom ’s MTV
Networks are just a few of the hundreds of channels we carry .
If every channel demanded huge , double - digit increases like what Viacom is trying to force our customers to pay , it would be impossible to keep the price of cable reasonable for our customers .
Time Warner Cable has reached hundreds of distribution agreements with other networks .
In fact , we currently have deals with every other cable programmer .
The negotiations are n’t always easy , but we work hard to reach agreements that are fair to our customers and to both businesses .
We hope Viacom wo n’t pull the MTV Networks from Time Warner Cable customers , and we ’ll negotiate up to the last possible minute and beyond .
But ultimately , it is Viacom ’s decision .
We implore them to join with us to reach a fair resolution or grant an extension , and we hope they wo n’t carry through with their threat to take their networks away from our customers tonight .
WEDNESDAY 7 AM : It appears Time Warner Cable customer service was unprepared for the onslaught of complaints from subscribers flooding into call centers .
Anecdotal evidence suggests that many reps were unaware of the dispute with Viacom , which began running news crawls below its programming that 19 channels would go dark on the cable system operation at 12:01 AM on January 1st .
Viacom also placed full - page advertisements in some major market newspapers today featuring protests by its media characters , including Dora the Explorer who is shown crying because she is being taken away from her fans , or SpongeBob freaking out .
Viacom is even telling viewers they can get Dora or SpongeBob back by signing onto Time Warner Cable ’s competitors DirecTV or Verizon .
Meanwhile , Time Warner Cable is prepared to refund customers for the lost programming if a deal ca n’t be reached by New Year ’s , though the amount has n’t been determined yet .

TUESDAY : What an awful way to ring in 2009 .
It turns out that Viacom claims it has been trying to negotiate a “ fair ” renewal of its prized cable channels for months and months , but reputedly Time Warner Cable has been unresponsive and “ unreasonable ” so talks have stalled .
The nation ’s 2nd largest cable system operator , in turn , claims Viacom is asking for “ exorbitant ” increases in carriage fees which would have to be passed along to the customer .
So now this fight between the two Big Media giants will hurt cable viewers .
At 12:01 AM on January 1st , just after the ball drops in Time Square , Time Warner Cable ’s 13.3 million subscribers will lose 19 Viacom channels — Comedy Central ; CMT : Pure Country ; Logo ; Palladia ; MTV ; MTV 2 ; MTV Hits ; MTV Jams ; MTV Tr3s ; Nickelodeon ; Noggin ; Nick 2 ; Nicktoons ; Spike ; The N ; TV Land ; Vh1 ; Vh1 Classic ; Vh1 Soul .
The howling starts here , especially by parents home for the holidays with children who wo n’t have access to their favorite shows like SpongeBob Squarepants and Dora The Explorer , and tweens / teens wanting to see new episodes of those new unreality Reality TV series The City and Bromance , and twentysomethings and older who get their news from The Daily Show With Jon Stewart or The Colbert Report .
This affects all U.S. Time Warner cable subscribers including those in New York and Los Angeles .
Alex Dudley , a vice president at Time Warner Cable , the nation ’s second - largest cable operator , is telling reporters that the dispute with Viacom “ is that they have asked for an exorbitant increase in their carriage fees and their network ratings are sagging . ”
However , Nickelodeon is 2008 ’s No. 1 basic cable network , drawing the largest audience in its history .
MTV , on the other hand , has seen ratings slide .
Time Warner Cable claims it ’s “ trying to hold the line on fees for our customer ” — but it ’s really worried that if Viacom gets its raises , then every cable programmer will want them .
TWC claims Viacom has asked for fee increases of between 22 % and 36 % per channel , but Sumner Redstone ’s company maintains the increases would cost less than $.25 a month for the package of channels per subscriber who spend a fifth of total TV time watching Viacom shows but its fees make up less than 2.5 % of the Time Warner cable bill .
( Sports channels are paid the biggest cable premium ) .
But Time Warner Cable also is complaining that Viacom ’s popular shows are rerun on Web sites where Viacom collects advertising revenue that it does not share with Time Warner .
On the other hand , Viacom has staked much of its revenue - growth prospects on squeezing higher carriage rates out of its cable and satellite affiliates despite an ad slowdown and weaker ratings .
Such negotiation battles between cable networks and cable system operators have happened before and lasted merely hours .
In 2004 , for example , Viacom ’s cable channels disappeared from EchoStar ’s Dish Network for two days while both sides fought over the terms of a new contract .
And Time Warner blocked ABC from its cable systems in New York during a breakdown in contract negotiations with parent company Disney .
So this one will either end fast or go on forever .
It probably will depend on how many subscribers start flooding Time Warner Cable with obscene calls or , worse , switch to satellite .
Viacom has already started a hardball campaign to “ Call Time Warner Cable and say ‘ NO ’ ” starring The Hills and South Park .
This is Viacom ’s just issued statement :
Peanut allergy can be a life - long allergy affecting about 2 percent of the population .
Peanut allergy is the most common cause of death due to foods , according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America .
Anyone who packs Junior 's lunch has by now heard that peanuts are often a no - no .
In fact in many schools , peanut butter and nuts of all kind are all prohibited .
Even home - baked goods are banned for fear they might contain traces of nuts .
The hysteria itself is nuts , and in fact the bans may worsen the very problem they aim to address , Nicolas Christakis from Harvard Medical School argues today in BMJ Online , published by the British Medical Journal .
" Measures to control nuts are instead making things worse in a cycle of over - reaction and increasing sensitization , " Christakis writes .
He calls the prohibitions part of a " mass psychogenic illness " ( what used to be epidemic hysteria ) " involving otherwise healthy people in a cascade of anxiety . "
Growing problem
Among children and teenagers , food or digestive allergies increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007 , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in October .
Roughly 4 percent of the U.S. population now suffers some food allergy .
Most outgrow these by adulthood .
Nobody knows why the number is growing , but some researchers speculate that as other threats to the human immune system are removed from the playing field by antibacterial soap and other modern techniques , the immune system needs something to do , so it attacks the offbeat proteins in peanuts and other foods that many people are known to be sensitive to .
In a nutshell , as explained in an article in The New York Times this week , the latent potential for a particular allergen becomes manifest , the thinking goes .
Other studies have generated mounting evidence that this is true for other types of allergies .
Avoiding germs can prevent the spread of disease , but too much cleanliness seems to breed more allergies .
" We ’ve developed a cleanlier lifestyle , and our bodies no longer need to fight germs as much as they did in the past , " Marc McMorris , a pediatric allergist at the University of Michigan Health System , said last year .
" As a result , the immune system has shifted away from fighting infection to developing more allergic tendencies . "
School charade
Meanwhile , the efforts to make schools nut - free and therefore safe is a charade , Christakis says .
For starters , he calls it a gross over - reaction to the magnitude of the threat .
About 3.3 million Americans are allergic to nuts , according to the CDC .
More are allergic to other foods , from milk to wheat ; about 6.9 million are allergic to seafood .
Serious allergic reactions to foods — all foods — cause roughly 2,000 hospitalizations a year and about 150 deaths among children and adults combined .
Christakis compares this to automobiles , which kill some 45,000 a year , and sports , which send about 10,000 children to hospitals each year with traumatic brain injury .
Nobody is clamoring to ban cars or sports , he points out .
Also , " there is no scientific evidence that the particular restrictions being imposed are effective or that they warrant the costs incurred , " Christakis points out .
Making matters worse
There is evidence , however , that avoiding nuts makes children ultimately more likely to be allergic to them .
A study of 10,000 children in the UK , reported earlier this year in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology , found that early exposure to peanuts reduces the risk of peanut allergies .
" The wholesale avoidance of nuts contributes to the problem by resulting in children who , lacking exposure to nuts , are actually sensitized to them , " Christakis said .
He acknowledges that nut allergies can be serious , and that " reasonable accommodation " should be made for those few children known to have serious allergies .
However , " well intentioned efforts to reduce exposure to nuts actually fan the flames , since they signal to parents that nuts are a clear and present danger , " he writes .
" This encourages more parents to worry , which fuels the epidemic .
It also encourages more parents to have their children tested , thus detecting mild and meaningless ' allergies ' to nuts .
And this encourages still more avoidance of nuts , leading to still more sensitization . "

Editor 's Note : Jack Cafferty is the author of a new book , " Now or Never : Getting Down to the Business of Saving Our American Dream , " to be published in March .
He provides commentary on CNN's " The Situation Room " daily from 4 to 7 p.m .

Jack Cafferty says the House violated a pledge to make stimulus bill public 48 hours before vote .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
What a joke .
Your Congress has voted to spend almost $ 790 billion of your money on a stimulus package that not a single member of either chamber has read .
The 1,073 - page document was n't posted on the government 's Web site until after 10 p.m. the day before the vote to pass it was taken .
I do n't care if you 're Evelyn Wood , you can't read almost 1,100 pages of the lawyer talk that makes up all legislation in eight or 10 hours .
The criminal part of this boondoggle is divided into two parts .
The first is the Democrats promised to post the bill a full 48 hours before the vote was taken to allow members of the public to see what they were getting for their money .
Both parties voted unanimously to do this ... and they lied .
It did n't happen .
Why am I not surprised ?
Congress lying to the American people has become part of their job description .
They can't be trusted on anything anymore .
I 'm sure part of the reason there was no time for the public to read the bill was the 11th - hour internecine warfare between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
When Reid first announced the compromise had been reached , Nancy Pelosi was nowhere to be seen .
And it would take an act of God for this egotistical , arrogant woman to miss a photo op where she could take credit for anything .
But she was n't there .
She summoned Reid to her office , where unnamed sources said she blew her top over some provision for schools that she was n't happy with .
Pelosi 's snit delayed everything .
It 's really too bad President Obama could n't figure out a way to jettison these two who are poster children for everything that is wrong in Washington .
The Associated Press called the birth of the stimulus bill " sausage making " in the best tradition of Washington politics as usual .
The second part of the crime is the contents of the bill itself .
Far from being only about jobs , infrastructure and tax cuts as promised , the stimulus bill stimulates a bunch of other stuff as well .
Eight billion dollars for high - speed rail lines , including a proposed line between Las Vegas and Los Angeles .
This little bit of second story work was n't even in the House version of the bill .
iReport.com :
So many things to do , what would you fix first ?
It started in the Senate as a $ 2 billion project , and came out of the conference committee costing a whopping $ 8 billion .
Gee , now who would that benefit ?
Oh yeah , the Senate majority leader is from Nevada .
Filipino veterans , most of whom do n't live in the U.S. , will get $ 200 million in compensation for World War II injuries .
And : $ 2 billion in grants and loans for battery companies , $ 100 million for small shipyards and a rollback of the alternative minimum tax at a cost of some $ 70 billion .
The AMT provision is much - needed legislation , but it does n't belong in the stimulus bill .
It forced other things out so Congress could keep to its self - imposed $ 800 billion cap .
And when it comes to the tax cuts contained in the stimulus bill , experts have determined they will amount to about $ 13 per week after taxes for the average American .
I 'm not sure how much stimulation $ 13 a week buys .
It depends on the neighborhood .
The biggest problem of all is the stimulus bill may not be nearly enough .
And if the president has to come back asking for more , the next time might not be so easy .
So far , we have an anemic stimulus bill and some sort of vague proposal from the secretary of the Treasury to deal with the banking crisis -- a proposal that landed with a thud last week -- as the two first steps toward solving a financial crisis that is threatening to take down the country .
Obama better step up his game , or it 's going to be a short four years in office .

Top 10 Worst Timing Ever
We all wish we could have done something differently at some point in our lives .
Perhaps you invested in stocks at the height of the internet bubble , or maybe you purchased a used car only to have it break down on you the next day .
Well , do n't feel so down because your bad timing is probably nothing compared to the examples we 're about to show you .
Some of these bad - timing decisions have cost their owners billions of dollars .
Some have cost them their reputation .
We encourage you to add to the list in the comments section below .
# 10 . Inktomi Headquarters
At the height of the dot - com boom , Inktomi decided it needed fancy new headquarters so they had Legacy Partners construct a $ 200 million office building in Foster City , CA .
Problem was , by the time it was finished , the dot - com boom had fizzled and Inktomi could n't afford to move in .
The building sat totally vacant for months and Inktomi had to pay a $ 50 million termination fee to get out of the agreement .
They actually got lucky since they could have been legally forced to purchase the building .
# 9 . Excite Purchase of Blue Mountain Arts
Back in October of 1999 , [ email protected ] paid $ 780 million for one of the ugliest web sites in history - Blue Mountain Arts .
They issued approximately 11 million shares worth $ 430 million and paid the remaining $ 350 million in cash .
They purchased the site not because it made lots of money , but because it received lots of traffic .
The internet bubble burst just 2 months later .
It 's one thing if they had issued just stock , but they gave up $ 350 million of much needed cash .
On September 13 , 2001 , [ email protected ] sold Blue Mountain Arts to American Greetings for less than 5 % of what it had paid less than two years earlier .
# 8 . Smart Money Magazine October Issue
On the cover of their October 2008 issue , Smart Money Magazine declared :
DOUBLE YOUR NEST EGG : Now is the Time to Jump Into Cheap Stocks , Funds and Real Estate
Only problem :
The issue came out September 16 , 2008 , the day the stock market started its worst drop since the Great Depression .
The Dow Jones , which was 11,500 when the issue came out , has since dropped to as low as 8,200 ( nearly a 30 % drop ) .
# 7 . Westfield Mall in London
Just as the worst global meltdown since the great depression is starting , the Westfield 's $ 2 billion mall opened its doors in London .
This is the largest mall Europe has ever seen and is considered to be the worst timing in the history of shopping .
# 6 . Flood 30 Minutes After Moving In
This past summer , a young couple moved into their $ 300,000 two - bedroom house in Kingsteignton , England , excited about owning their first home .
30 minutes after moving in , a freak flood destroyed their house and all their belongings .
" I looked out the window and I saw these giant puddles starting to merge and drift towards our gate .
Within minutes we had six inches of water through the house .
Everything was ruined and there was nothing we could do to stop it .
We had sat down for half an hour to enjoy our new place .
That 's all we ever got and then we had to move out straight away . "
# 5 . Republicans Issue Heartless Press Release
In what has to be one of the worst - timed press releases in political history , the Republican National Committe issued a statement on November 3rd complaining about Obama visiting his sick grandmother in Hawaii .
At issue was whether the trip should have been paid for with campaign funds .
The bad timing :
The press release was issued at 1:30 PM .
That same afternoon , Obama and his sister released a statement announcing their granmother had just passed away .
# 4 . AIG Luxury Retreat Following Bailout
Less than one week after the US government committed $ 85 billion to bail out AIG , company executives headed for a week - long retreat at a luxury resort and spa where rooms cost over $ 1,000 a night .
The company paid more than $ 440,000 for the retreat which included over $ 20,000 for massage and spa treatments .
To make things worse , AIG later asked the government for another $ 40 billion in loans while secretly gathering at another luxury resort in Phoenix .
AIG made significant efforts to disguise the conference , even making sure there were no AIG logos or signs anywhere on the property .
Consequently , a key Democratic lawmaker called last week for the resignation of AIG's CEO .
# 3 . Travis Barker " Play with Fire " Drumsticks
In an effort to promote the release of the latest Guitar Hero video game , Activision sent out drum sticks to fans sponsored by Travis Barker .
Unfotunately , the motto " Play with Fire " was n't exactly the most appropriate considering Barker had just survived a fiery plane crash in which 2 people were killed .
# 2. BlackStone 's Loses Billions on Hilton
The BlackStone Group , once regarded as the leading private equity fund , acquired Hilton Hotels for $ 26 Billion in cash last summer .
This was the biggest equity investment ever made by the 23 year old firm and it turned out to be one of the worst timing in business history .
The hotel market took a terrible nosedive after the acquisition and analysts believe much , if not all , of the equity BlackStone invested has been wiped out .
# 1. Silverstein Purchase of 99 Year Lease on WTC
On July 24 , 2001 , Silverstein Properties purchased a 99 year lease on the World Trade Center for $ 3.2 billion .
The entire complex including the Twin Towers was destroyed less than 2 months later in the worst terrorist attack in US history .

For a while it seemed that the Obama Administration really did n’t mean last week ’s suggestion that it would take conduct of the 2010 Census out of the Commerce Department and have the Census Bureau report directly to the West Wing .
Perhaps , one was about to concede , the White House merely aims to create the kind of independent agency — with all the protections for integrity that implies — envisaged in a bill being promoted by a number of leaders in the statistical community and introduced by Rep. Carolyn Maloney ( D - NY ) .
Under that bill the statistical office at OMB would oversee the agency .
Of course , also under that bill , the independent Census Bureau would not even become a reality until 2012 — two years after the coming Decennial Census .
Unfortunately , it is now clear that a new agency is not what the White House officials have in mind and that , indeed , having the Census Director report to someone on the president ’s West Wing staff is exactly what that they have in mind .
( Note what the White House press secretary says .
For some reason , only Fox News seems to have picked it up )
If so , the Obama Administration is threatening a reckless politicization of the Census Bureau and that , in turn , threatens to pull into unnecessary dispute the fundamental data that sustain almost the entire statistical system of the United States .
It has the image of a Chicago - style partisan power play .
Minority members of Congress have expressed concern that Sen. Judd Gregg ( Republican , New Hampshire ) , incoming Commerce Secretary , has been hostile to the Census Bureau and has been skeptical of its processes in recent years .
They note that he has not supported budget increases for the Bureau .
More importantly , they worry that if the Bureau reports through the regular Commerce Department chain of command to Gregg the Census effort might not do enough to count minority citizens .
( That supposedly is because Gregg is a Republican . )
Therefore , they suggest that the Bureau should report to the White House senior staff .
Let ’s see : Obama ’s pick for Commerce Secretary apparently cannot be trusted , but the Democratic politicos in the West Wing can be ?
Mentioned only by inference in discussions so far is the plain hope that a Census Bureau under the thumb of White House staffers might be prevailed upon to adopt a policy to “ adjust ” the Census numbers in 20101 , using sampling and computer modeling — with all the profound implications that would have for political reapportionment and redistricting that will follow the Census count .
Adjustment is a recurrent fantasy of Census critics on the Left who want population numbers more to their liking .
It would turn the science of statistics into something where speculation and guesswork could introduce egregious and prejudicial errors .
The whole adjustment scheme is a mistake .
Having the White House supervise it is even worse .
First of all , the White House and its Congressional allies are wrong in asserting that the Census in the past has reported directly to the president through his staff .
Directors of the Bureau often brief presidents and their staffs , but , as a former director ( under President Reagan ) , I do n’t know of any cases where the conduct of the Bureau was directly under White House supervision .
That includes Clinton in 2000 , Bush 41 in 1990 and Carter in 1980 .
They also are dead wrong about the feasibility of using sampling and computer models to make adjustment a credible way to improve the accuracy of the population count for purposes of reapportionment and redistricting .
The adjustment idea has been discussed for many decades .
It never has enjoyed a large following among statisticians .
Following an exhaustive three year study concluded in 2003 , an even stronger consensus has developed among professional statisticians that adjustment cannot provide as credible and accurate a Census result as a hard count assisted by such techniques as examinations of public records of various kinds ( e.g. , drivers ’ licenses ) .
In fact , for every decade since at least 1970 and especially starting in 1980 the Census Bureau has made ever - expanding outreach to minority communities , including undocumented foreign workers , trying to get as complete a count as is humanly possible .
To suggest that there has been any resistance to getting such a complete count is invidious political grandstanding and an insult to the diverse and highly professional staff at the Census Bureau .
When I was director I found the Census personnel to be among the most conscientious of any group I ’d encountered in government service .
Whatever their personal political views ( i suspect that most voted for Obama ) , their allegiance is to the integrity of the positions of public trust they hold .
The question of a fair and full Census count is to be distinguished from questions about technical problems with new technologies that periodically plague the Bureau .
In fact , the Bureau ’s eagerness to get an ever improved hard count of residents of the U.S. may have pushed it to costly inefficiencies — which , ironically , is one of the complaints from elected officials on the political right .
Instead , the real issue is who directs the Census , the pros or the pols .
If it is the pols , you may well get an order to adjust the Census count with samples and modeling .
That will take a presidential order to over - ride the scientific consensus of statisticians at the Bureau and elsewhere .
You would think that an Administration that is thumping its chest about respecting science and scientists on such matters as climate change and embryonic stem cell research would show a little respect for the scientists in the statistical field ( a branch of the science of mathematics ) and their careful work on this topic .
But even if the new politicos in the West Wing do n’t really care about the science involved , you ’d think they would have a better sense of the political dangers — for themselves , if not for the country .
The Census is one of our oldest , most treasured civic institutions and one of the few functions of government named in the Constitution .
As in matters of officials ’ ethics ( as we keep hearing ) , one not only needs to avoid the reality of impropriety , but also the appearance of impropriety .
To be fair and accurate , the process has to be transparently fair and accurate .
With adjustment by sampling and modeling , however , you will get inaccuracies baked into the process .
It might mean better macro-numbers , but once you start imputing abstract “ missing people ” into Census tracts , you not only introduce errors , but errors that are demonstrable .
“ Virtual persons ” ( as I call them ) of varying demographic characteristics will be assigned right down to the block level where anyone could go door to door and find out that such people cannot be found .
When that happens , the Census ceases to conform to common sense .
Its numbers begin to look fanciful .
A hard count might have errors , but has always been defensible in court .
An adjustment would have more errors and its process would be subject either to deceit or the appearance of deceit .
You can imagine the news stories as small town mayors show the palpable folly of specific adjusted Census figures .
The late night comics would be inviting you to “ meet your neighbor who does n’t exist . ”
If you think there is paranoia in the political field now , just wait until you have an “ adjusted Census ” — ” adjusted ” at the direction of politicians in the White House !
Has President Obama thought this through ?
“ Fixing ” the Census in a way that politicizes it is not what the new president ’s image needs .
But beyond the issue of image , does he have time for this ?
Letting the White House assume responsibility for the management of the Census is like turning the management of the war in Afghanistan over to some little group in the White House .
It will become a political quagmire .
Deciding on bombing targets in the Vietnam War did n’t do a lot for LBJ , did it ?
The Census is controversial by nature , and often in fairly petty ways — people are always demanding more attention and resources for their states and cities .
Why bring all that into the West Wing ?
The Census Bureau arguably suffered from White House neglect in the Bush Administration .
It has real problems to confront now as it readies a Decennial Census that is already well into the testing stage for a final push in a year and two months ( April , 2010 ) .
It needs to get a new Director in place — and , at this point , someone qualified by past experience .
Let that new director and his or her staff get on with the job and let the White House limit itself to assuring that politics is kept out of the picture .
That will work .
In contrast , it is hard to conceive a more damaging way to complicate the Census process now than to try to put its direct oversight into the hands of a political and novice White House staff that has a whole world of other vital concerns to contend with .
Say you do n’t mean it , Mister President !

For many people , social networking has become as much of a daily routine as brewing coffee and brushing teeth .
IT administrators dislike it and cyber crooks depend on it .
That 's because most of the time people spend on MySpace , Facebook , LinkedIn , Twitter and elsewhere is during work hours -- on work machines .
At the ShmooCon 2009 security conference in the nation 's capital recently , two security researchers demonstrated the many reasons why this is bad .
In a presentation called " Fail 2.0 : Further Musings on Attacking Social Networks , " Nathan Hamiel and Shawn Moyer guided attendees through attacks made easy because of the very nature of these sites , where users can upload and exchange pictures , text , music and other content with little effort .
" Social networking sites are meant to get as many users in one place as possible on one platform , and for attackers there 's a lot of return - on - investment in going after them , " Moyer said , describing the climate as a perfect storm of social engineering and bad programming .
Through a variety of easy tricks , attackers can hijack a person 's social network account to use as a launching pad for additional attacks against other users , other Web 2.0 - based applications , and so on .
Social networks can also be incorporated into micro botnets and , by rummaging through a page of misfired direct messages on Twitter , a motivated attacker can unearth the cell phone numbers of prominent people .
Hamiel noted that the trouble begins with so much creative power being put in the hands of those who have little or no tech savvy .
" Any application can be used to attack other applications and an application can be used to view your entire file if the privacy settings are off , " he said .
" Even if you put the privacy settings in place , you should assume you are screwed . "
The demonstrations the duo ran through included :
Creating imposter profiles on LinkedIn , assuming the identity of someone prominent , and friending as many people as possible .
For the sake of experimentation , the researchers created a fake profile for a well - known security leader ( with permission ) and accumulated 50 - plus connections in less than a day , many of them CSOs and other bigwigs .
Showing how to sabotage the MySpace page of someone you 're not directly connected with via the profile of a common connection .
This example involved fake Myspace pages for rocker Alice Cooper and actors Eva Longoria and Bob Saget .
In this scenario , Cooper and Longoria are connected to Saget but not to each other .
Longoria wants to connect with Cooper , who refuses , and she responds my using their common connection to Saget to access and deface Cooper 's page .
Rummaging through a site that accumulates old direct messages originally sent out through Twitter .
With enough patience , the bad guy can find and exploit such discoveries as phone numbers , e-mail addresses and other personal information that was originally meant for individuals rather than the general Tweeting public .
Not surprised by any of this is James Arlen , a Toronto - based security consultant who listened in on the presentation .
" At the end of the day , far too many people operate in a zone where they presume trust , " Arlen said .
" There 's an odd level of trust where you look at someone 's profile and say ' I know this person , ' but there 's no real attempt at authentication . "
This story , " Not Among Friends : The Dangers of Social Networks " was originally published by CSO .
Um , what ?
This is yet another bonus though they ’re now giving it another name .
Maybe this is capitalism to Rick Santelli and CNBC but for everyone else who works for a living to fund their plush lifestyle , it ’s socialism for the elite .
Citi and Morgan Stanley are receiving $ 55 BILLION in TARP money so let them decide to either keep that money and make do without new bonuses or hand out billions of their own money , wherever that may come from and run the risk of total failure .
Whether they want to gamble – as they ’ve done for a while – and use their own money and risk failure is fine by me , but do n’t come begging for more in the future .
Since the Wall Street worshipers love talking so much about socialism , fine , let ’s talk about it .
Let Rick Santelli walk Main Street and see how his silly rants fly with Americans who are n’t traders and banksters .
Let ’s do a live feed and see how it all works out when he talks about the path to communism .
Then let him explain how taxpayer bailouts of banks is n’t socialism .
The banksters , Santelli and CNBC can all go Cheney themselves .
30 млрд рублей , перечисленные государством ОАО « Российская венчурная компания » ( РВК ) , расходовались неэффективно — с таким заявлением об итогах проверки во вторник выступил а Генеральная прокуратура .
А генпрокурор Юрий Чайка обратился к премьер - министру Владимиру Путину с предложениями по дополнительному урегулированию венчурной деятельности , а также «о целесообразности дальнейшей деятельности компании в условиях мирового финансового кризиса и сокращения бюджетных расходов » .

« В течение 2007 –2008 годов было сформировано шесть закрытых паевых инвестиционных фондов особо рисковых инвестиций , в которые внесено 8,5 млрд руб .
( 4,1 млрд руб. внесла РВК ) .
Из них 6 млрд фондами размещено на депозитах в банках » , — отмечается в сообщении .
На 20 января 2009 года на депозитах было размещено 85 % уставного капитала компании , что дало более 2,5 млрд руб .
дохода за 2008 год .
РВК и ее фонды не заинтересованы в реализации венчурных проектов , делает вывод прокуратура , ведь размещение денежных средств на депозитных счетах в банках приносит гораздо большую прибыль .
А этой прибылью к тому же компания имеет возможность самостоятельно распоряжаться .
Также в ходе проверки выяснилось , что уставный капитал РВК был сформирован за счет бюджетных средств путем размещения дополнительных обыкновенных акций , цена которых была выше их номинальной стоимости .
В результате чего казна недополучила 1,78 млрд руб .
Но это еще не все .
В целом ряде случаев средства направлялись в уставный капитал компаний , образованных с иностранным участием .
Из 1,7 млрд рублей , перечисленных за два года , почти половина пошла именно в такие организации .
« Денежные средства , предназначенные для развития инновационной экономик и РФ , перечислялись в США на счета зарегистрированных там компаний » , — установила Генпрокуратура .
При этом иностранные получатели имели явные признаки фиктивности .
Как указывает прокуратура , « уставный капитал некоторых из них минимален , а в одной на момент проверки работал только один человек » , « выявлен и факт перечисления средств российской компании , собственник которой умер до обязательной перерегистрации и постановки на учет предприятия в налоговой инспекции » .
« Государство не получило от этих проектов прибыли и инноваций » , — резюмирует Генпрокуратура .
РВК обвинили и в расточительстве .
Расходы на собственные нужды работников компании за 2007 год составили 107 млн руб. , из них на зарплату 35 сотрудникам ушло 36 млн руб .
Эту цифр у Генпрокуратура сравнивает со статьей расходов госбюджета на содержание школ - интернатов ( 99 млн руб . ) .
А в 2008 году расходы на собственные нужды РВК увеличились до 290 млн руб. , вдвое превысив « расход ы Роснауки на реализацию федеральной целевой программ ы
« Исследовани я и разработки по приоритетным направлениям развития научно-технологического комплекс а РФ на 2007 – 2012 гг. » .
Прошлась Генпрокуратура и по Минэкономразвития — все эти злоупотребления стали возможны «в связи с отсутствием должного контроля » со стороны ведомства Эльвиры Набиуллиной .
Главный обвиняемый — РВК — уверяет , что узнал о претензиях к себе из пресс - релиза .
« Официальных документов в адрес РВК не поступало » , — заявил « Газете .

Более того , по его словам , « справк а Генпрокуратуры по итогам проведенной проверки не содержит данных о нарушениях » .
Ссылаясь на все это , РВК настаивает , что не готова отвечать на не предъявленные ей обвинения .
Это не первый скандал с участием РВК .
В 2007 году государственный венчурный фонд оказался в партнерских отношениях с « Финансгрупп » , владельцем которой был скандально известный Олег Шварцман .
Этот бизнесмен поведал в интервью газете « Коммерсантъ » о том , что занимается « бархатной реприватизацией » , то есть отбирает предприятия у владельцев в пользу государства .
Претензии к венчурной компании могли возникнуть и раньше , признают опрошенные « Газетой .
Ru » эксперты .
« У нас , если размещаешь деньги , то обвиняют в коррупции , если не размещаешь — в неэффективности » , — отмечает заместитель гендиректора Центра политтехнологий Алексей Макаркин .
« Рискованные проекты всегда могут оказаться невозвратными .
И поэтому они могут быть ширмой для злоупотреблений .
Очень трудно определить грань между финансовой махинацией и реальными рискованными вложениями » , — признает депутат от « Справедливо й России » , член комитета по финансовому рынку Госдумы Анатолий Аксаков .
« РВК оказалась заложницей той системы , с которой она была сформирована .
Двухуровневая структура инвестирования делала необходимым поиск частных соинвесторов .
А они , в отличие от государства , оказались не готовы вкладывать в рискованные проекты на ранней стадии ,
все -таки они частники , им нужны хоть какие - то гарантии .
Поэтому наблюдался дефицит проектов , поэтому деньги оставались на счетах » , — объясняет глава бизнес - объединения « Деловая Россия » Борис Титов .
Но злоупотребления вскрылись именно сейчас , и эксперты не могут не связать это с кризисом .
« Подобные проекты создавались в расчете на совсем другую экономическую ситуацию .
Теперь , очевидно , что - то будут сокращать , что - то упразднять .
Обвинения в адрес РВК могут поставить вопрос о дальнейшем существовании государственного венчурного фонда .
И стать прецедентом » , — считает Макаркин .
Впрочем , как отмечае т Титов , сейчас и без Генпрокуратуры сокращают бюджет ы Роснанотеха и даже возвращают обратно уже выданные из бюджета деньги .
С другой стороны , власти не раз говорили о намерении получить выгоду от кризиса , диверсифицировать экономику , занять выигрышные позиции на мировом рынке .
Без инвестиций в новые разработки такое будет сложно , отмечают эксперты .
« Надеюсь , это не означает сворачивания программы венчурных инвестиций .
Венчурные проекты — основа технического прорыва .
Тем более что этот проект заложен в стратегии развития до 2020 года » ,
— напоминает Аксаков .
« Если РВК расформируют , это будет очень печально .
Кризис кризисом , но он когда - то кончится .
А если мы сейчас расформируем единственный имеющийся инструмент для перехода на инвестиционную экономику , боюсь , что мы не уйдем от экспортной зависимости никогда » , — говорит Титов .

Sharper , more intense rains may reduce the water available to farmers
If you look at the numbers , it is hard to see how many East African communities made it through the long drought of 2005 and 2006 .
Among people who study human development , it is a widely - held view that each person needs about 20 litres of water each day for the basics - to drink , cook and wash sufficiently to avoid disease transmission .
Yet at the height of the East African drought , people were getting by on less than five litres a day - in some cases , less than one litre a day , enough for just three glasses of drinking water and nothing left over .
The scarcity at the heart of the global water crisis is rooted in power , poverty and inequality
UNDP , 2006 Some people , perhaps incredibly from a western vantage point , are hardy enough to survive in these conditions ; but it is not a recipe for a society that is healthy and developing enough to break out of poverty .
" Obviously there are many drivers of human development , " says the UN's Andrew Hudson .
" But water is the most important . "
At the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , where Dr Hudson works as principal technical advisor to the water governance programme , he calculated the contribution that various factors make to the Human Development Index , a measure of how societies are doing socially and economically .
" It was striking .
I looked at access to energy , spending on health , spending on education - and by far the strongest driver of the HDI on a global scale was access to water and sanitation . "
Different lives
Two key questions arise , then .
WATER TRENDS
How availability , use and needs are changing across the world
In graphics
Why do some communities have so little access to water ?
And how will the current picture change in a world where the human population is growing , where societies are urbanising and industrialising , and where climate change may alter the raw availability of water significantly ?
The UNDP is unequivocal about the first question .
" The availability of water is a concern for some countries , " says the report .
" But the scarcity at the heart of the global water crisis is rooted in power , poverty and inequality , not in physical availability . "
Statistics on water consumption appear to back the UN 's case .
Japan and Cambodia experience about the same average rainfall - about 160 cm per year .
But whereas the average Japanese person can use nearly 400 litres per day , the average Cambodian must make do with about one - tenth of that .
The number of people with access to clean water is increasing
The picture is improving to some extent .
Across the world , 1.6bn more people have access to clean drinking water than in 1990 .
But population growth and climatic changes could change the picture .
In some regions , " the scarcity at the heart of the global water crisis " could become one of physical availability , especially in places where consumption is already unsustainably high .
" There are several rivers that do n't reach the sea any more , " says Mark Smith , head of the water programme at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) .
" The Yellow River is one , the Murray - Darling ( in Australia ) is nearly another - they have to dredge the mouth of the river every year to make sure it does n't dry up .
" The Aral Sea and Lake Chad have shrunk because the rivers that feed them have been largely dried out ; and you can see it on a smaller scale as well , where streams that are important for small communities in Tanzania may go dry for half the year , largely because people are taking more and more water for irrigating crops . "
Wet and dry Last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) took an in - depth look at how the raw availability of water might alter in the future as climatic patterns change .
Its projections are derived from computer models of the Earth 's hugely complex climate system , and as such are far from being firm forecasts .
A warmer climate overall means a wetter climate ; warmer air can hold more moisture .
Mountain glaciers act as " natural reservoirs " Himalayan glaciers alone store water used by more than a billion people Scientists measure the volume of glaciers in " mm SLE " - the amount that sea levels would rise if the ice melted But weather patterns are likely to shift , meaning that water will be deposited in different places with a different pattern in time .
" In general we see drying in the sub - tropics and mid-latitudes , from southern Europe across to Kazakhstan and from North Africa to Iran , " recounts Martin Parry , who as co-chair of the IPCC 's working group on climate impacts oversaw the water report 's compilation .
" And the drying extends westwards into Central America .
And there are equivalents in the southern hemisphere - southern Africa , Australia . "
In some populated parts of North Africa and Central Asia , he says , people may struggle simply to get enough to drink .
Other areas , meanwhile , are projected to receive more rain - considerably more , in some cases .
The question then is whether societies can make use of it .
" If you look at India , Bangladesh and Burma , there are indications of an increase in water availability , " says Professor Parry .
" But when you look in more detail you see that monsoonal precipitation will become more intense - there 'll be a heavier downpour but over fewer days - so you might just end up with more runoff , which could actually mean less availability of water to the community . "
Thirsty work A changing climate is only one of the factors likely to affect the amount of water at each person 's disposal in future .
A more populated world - and there could be another 2.5 billion people on the planet by 2050 - is likely to be a thirstier world .
Those extra people will need feeding ; and as agriculture accounts for about 70 % of water use around the world , extra consumption for growing food is likely to reduce the amount available for those basic needs of drinking , cooking and washing .
Industry can also take water that would otherwise have ended up in peoples ' mouths .
FUTURE WATER STRESS
Interactive map :
Water stress in a changing world
On the other hand , as a society industrialises it tends to become less reliant on farming - which could , in principle , reduce its local demand .
It is a tremendously complex picture ; and forecasting its impacts makes simple climate modelling look a trivial task by comparison .
Researchers at the University of Kassel in Germany , led by Martina Floerke , have attempted it .
Their projections suggest that some regions are likely to see drastic declines in the amount of water available for personal use - and for intriguing reasons .
" The principal cause of decreasing water stress ( where it occurs ) is the greater availability of water due to increased annual precipitation related to climate change , " they conclude .
" The principal cause of increasing water stress is growing water withdrawals , and the most important factor for this increase is the growth of domestic water use stimulated by income growth . "
The modelling suggests that by the 2050s , as many as six billion people could face water scarcity ( defined as less than 1,000 cubic metres per person per year ) , depending , most importantly , on how societies develop - a significant increase on previous estimates .
Ideas pipeline
The irony is that the richer societies are the ones most likely to be able to adapt to these changes - perhaps relatively easily .
A century ago , a 500 km - long pipeline was built to bring water from the Western Australian coast to the parched inland goldfields around Kalgoorlie ; the economics of gold made it viable .
Now that the coastal capital Perth is drying out , there is talk of building an even longer pipeline to bring water from the north of the state .
The state recently acquired a desalination plant - an effective , but expensive , way of increasing the raw supply of clean water .
A number of Middle Eastern countries are doing the same ; it is even being contemplated near London .
Rivers can be diverted huge distances , as China is contemplating .
Spain and Cyprus can take water deliveries by ship .
But can all societies afford such measures ?
Parched Perth seeks fresh ideas
In any case , is adaptation possible to some of the really big projected changes , such as the rapid shrinking of Himalayan glaciers which may lose four - fifths of their area by 2030 , removing what is effectively a huge natural reservoir storing water for more than a billion people ?
" In principle you could do it , if you 're equipped to do the engineering , " says Mark Smith .
" But societies are going to have to get much better at deciding how they 're going to use their water .
" And very often , in developing countries where institutions are not well established , decisions are made in a very ad - hoc way - someone says ' yes let 's use this much for irrigation ' but you 're already using that much for a sugar mill , and before you know it you 've allocated more than you actually have . "
Two years ago I stood in a forest clearing in the west of the Amazon basin talking to researchers studying the deforestation and fires that are an increasing plague in the region .
They told me that some villages around there were experiencing water shortages .
How can that happen , I asked incredulously , in the middle of the Amazon rainforest , in one of the most luxuriously verdant places on Earth ?
What had brought the shortages was a combination of increased human settlement , deforestation , and a drying of some streams , possibly related to climate change .
If even the Amazon can feel these pressures , it is difficult not to think that the same picture will be played out in much starker and possibly much messier colours in parts of the world that are already feeling the heat of dwindling supplies and growing needs .

The resolution is part of a wider investigation by the Justice Department into non-payment of tax by US citizens holding money in offshore accounts .
In June last year , former UBS private banker Bradley Birkenfeld pleaded guilty to helping American billionaire Igor Olenicoff evade millions of dollars in federal taxes , even admitting to smuggling diamonds for a previous customer in a tube of toothpaste to help dodge customs officials .
In what could be the biggest embezzlement case to hit the US Catholic Church , a Florida priest pleaded guilty on Wednesday to embezzling $ US800,000 ( $ A1.21 million ) of donations to fund a very unholy lifestyle .
John Skehan pleaded guilty to taking the money placed every Sunday into the collection plates to use instead on buying luxury homes , gambling trips to Las Vegas and buying rare coins .
His pleas came in a last minute twist as he and fellow priest Francis Guinan of the St Vincent Ferrer Catholic Church in Delray Beach were about to go on trial .
He now faces up to 31 years behind bars .
Swedish firm Tham & Videgard Hansson Arkitekter is the genius behind this incredibly cool and nearly invisible treehouse .
Located in northern Sweden , the treehouse more specifically serves as a hotel .
The mirrored glass walls provide what I can only imagine to be a stunning 360 degree view .
How incredibly relaxing a night ’s stay would be here !

Picture an elderly person .
Who sprang into your mind ?
Or should I say , whose Zimmer frame hobbled slowly round the corner of your mind ?
Perhaps it was Thora Hird , the hilarious comic actress .
Or Prince Philip , the hilarious comic Duke of Edinburgh .
Maybe you pictured the beautiful , crinkly face of Nelson Mandela .
Or was it your own dear grandma ?
Whoever you imagined , I 'm prepared to bet that it was n't Nicole Kidman .
When her photograph appeared last week next to the headline " Brain Games More Harm Than Good For Elderly " , she must have wondered whom to sue first : the newspaper or her dermatologist .
( I am not suggesting that Nicole Kidman has had Botox .
No doubt her skin retains the magical texture of a Formica kitchen surface due to her being well - rested and drinking plenty of water . )
Poor Nicole was selected to be in the photographic line of fire because she is among those who have advertised " brain - training " machines on television .
Brain - training machines which , according to research from American health organisation Lifespan , do not actually train the brain to do anything very much at all , except use the machine .
The study , based on trials undertaken since 1992 , found no evidence that these exercises " delay or slow progression of cognitive changes in healthy elderly " .
Indeed , according to Professor Peter Snyder who led the research , computer games may actually be bad for our silver - haired friends .
They may , warns Professor Snyder , " decrease participation in more proven effective lifestyle interventions , like exercise " .
In other words : old people should stop hunching over their Nintendos and get out there in the fresh air .
Play in the park !
Climb trees !
Do your homework !
Bring back national service !
A ghastly image springs to mind : thousands of silver - haired obsessives poring over hand - held computer screens in darkened rooms , chainsmoking , stuffing cheesy Wotsits into their mouths .
Their children stand on the threshold , tutting and shaking their heads .
The old folk look up , roll their eyes sarcastically , flick a V sign , slam the door , turn the music up .
Perry Como booms through the house , all bass and no treble .
The children sigh , shrug , ring up friends to say : " I do n't know what to do ... it 's just tap - tap - tap all day ...
I can't get him to read a book or eat an apple ... his eyes are turning square ...
I hope it 's just a phase he 's going through ... "
All very healthy .
It 's about time we started disapproving of pensioners as a generation .
Why should they get off lightly ?
We complain that children have no manners , teenagers are violent , twentysomethings are slags , thirtysomethings are greedy and the middle aged have affairs because they 've lost respect for the institution of marriage .
Meanwhile , for the 70s and over , it 's all : " Are they warm enough ?
Can they live on their pensions ?
Should we visit more ? "
Old folk have had it too good for too long .
If young Billy gets a hard time for spending all day tweedling computer buttons in a darkened room , why should n't Grandma ?
Get out there in the sunshine , Gran , and stop wasting the best part of the day !
We feel , instinctively , that the elderly should be allowed to do whatever they like .
Slump on the couch , eat fried breakfasts , take the best seat on the bus , wear purple ; the clock is ticking , so they should aim for sheer pleasure with our blessing .
How dare some American professor tell them to be sensible !
My mother has an idea for government policy that is undeniably brilliant : drugs such as marijuana , ecstasy , heroin and cocaine should be legalised , then given free to the over - 65s .
If pensioners are off their heads on smack , it would be no drain on the national work force .
If the drugs make them aggressive , if you catch them breaking into your house at night to steal the DVD player , it would n't be very scary .
You 'd just trap them by putting a packet of Werther 's Originals on a table with a net over it .
Thus , getting high would lose its cachet among the young .
And old people would be relieved of their aches and pains while having a whale of a time .
It 's an appealing thought , because we imagine that one of the comforts of old age is the abrogation of responsibility .
Working for a living , bringing up children , getting an early night , saving for a house , eating and drinking sensibly for a long if boring future : all these worries should be behind us once we pick up the bus pass .
Nevertheless , until we are old , we do n't know what it 's like .
If the majority of elderly people did n't want to feel young again , it would not have been so easy for computer - game manufacturers to sucker them with advertising that claims their product will " keep your brain sharp " .
One of the commercials explains that the brain - training machines are " inspired by the research of Dr Kawashima " .
What a brilliantly opaque , advertising - style sentence .
The elderly target 's subliminal mind inhales " research " and " doctor " , so she comes away thinking this is a development akin to the discovery of penicillin .
But if you actually think about it , the words " inspired by " mean almost nothing at all .
I could perform a contemporary dance inspired by the research of Dr Kawashima and that would n't stave off Alzheimer 's either .
Then there 's the fact that we do n't really know who Dr Kawashima is .
They might as well have said Dr Hook .
Or Dr Prodd from Carry On Matron .
It works , presumably , because we are all seduced by the idea of being rejuvenated .
Sod the right to indulge ourselves in hazy , ageing comfort - we just want to be young .
If the machines do n't work , the answer is surely to launch a storm of disapproval at our grandparents ' sedentary lifestyle .
We must grumble at their love of computer sudoku and demand that they get off their lazy backsides at once .
If we scold them enough , they will feel like kids again after all .

Pictured snorting a line of cocaine : Facebook murderer who posted ' I feel like killin some1 ' message hours before stabbing father to death
A young man who posted a message on Facebook saying he felt ' like killin some1 " hours before stabbing a man to death in a crowded bar in Bolton has been imprisoned for a minimum of 17 years .
Leon Ramsden , 19 , stabbed Paul Gilligan , 31 , in Bolton 's Pepper Alley bar six months ago .
Mr Gilligan , from Little Hulton , Salford , was stabbed in his shoulder and chest and died from his injuries an hour after the attack , Manchester Crown Court heard .
No remorse : Police released this picture of Leon Ramsden snorting cocaine .
He had been on a three - day drink and drug binge before he murdered Paul Gilligan
Ramsden , from Turnstone Road , Bolton , posted a message on his Facebook wall earlier that evening which read : " I 'm twisted at home .
My head 's up my a*** .
' I feel like killin some1 need to stay off the hard stuff ha f*** it it 's Saturday ha . "
Sentencing Ramsden for the murder , Mr Justice Teare said : ' Paul Gilligan was 31 years old .
He lived with his partner and three children .
' His death has caused great suffering to them and also to his parents and his two brothers .
' This was a senseless and unprovoked murder which has devastated Paul Gilligan 's family . '
The court previously heard Ramsden went on a three - day alcohol and cocaine - fuelled binge before the attack and had not slept for 36 hours prior to stabbing Mr Gilligan .
Prosecutor Guy Gozem QC told the jury several customers had witnessed the attack but did not realise Ramsden had stabbed Mr Gilligan as the knife was concealed in his fist .
Father - of - three : Paul Gilligan was stabbed in the shoulder and chest
The two men were seen ' play - fighting ' minutes before the incident .
Ramsden then left the Pepper Alley bar , only to return seconds later and stab Mr Gilligan before running off .
Outside the court , Detective Inspector Mark Roters from Greater Manchester Police read a statement on behalf of Mr Gilligan 's partner and family .
' We worked so hard for justice to get a young , dangerous lad off the streets for a long time , " the statement read .
' This youth has never shown remorse and he felt he was untouchable .
' He knew he had killed a man , one loved by many , in a heartless , shocking , cowardly stabbing .
' Paul did n't deserve this , nor would he have anticipated such brutality .
' He is greatly missed and was such a happy , social , family man .
We will never get over his death . '
Mr Roters said : ' Ramsden is a pathetic individual who believed he had been slighted by Paul in front of a crowd of people .
' As revenge for this , Ramsden killed him .
' This was a needless and extremely violent attack that resulted in the death of a father - of - three .
' Ramsden 's behaviour has resulted in the loss of well - loved father , son , brother and friend .
He now has a long time to reflect on what he has done . '
The northern leopard frogs that inhabit the boreal U.S. have never recovered from some catastrophic population declines in the 1970s .
Some blame it on the acidifying lakes and streams caused by coal - burning , others point to the ongoing loss of wetlands to development , and now new evidence shows that the herbicide atrazine — widely sprayed on crop fields throughout the region — is killing the frogs by helping parasitic worms that feast on them .
" Atrazine provides a double whammy to frogs :
It increases both amphibian exposure and susceptibility , " says biologist Jason Rohr of the University of South Florida in Tampa , who tested the impact by re-creating field conditions in 300 - gallon ( 1,135 - liter ) tanks in his lab .
" Atrazine is one of the more mobile and persistent pesticides being widely applied .
In fact , residues have been found in remote , nonagricultural areas , such as the poles . "
That may explain why amphibians are on the decline worldwide .
As many as one third of the nearly 6,000 known amphibian species — frogs , toads , salamanders , even wormlike caecilians — are threatened with extinction , according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) .
And no one knows why .
In the case of the northern leopards , the culprit appears to be the common herbicide acting as a double - edged sword :
It suppresses the frogs ' immune systems while boosting the population of snails that play host to parasitic worm larvae , the latter of which infect the weakened leopard frogs .
Such herbicides are present in 57 percent of U.S. streams , according to the U.S. Geological Survey , and it is that water pollution — not inbreeding — that is the prime suspect in the high rate of deformity in U.S. amphibian populations , according to new research from Purdue University .
But national parks and other areas protected from pollution and development are providing no refuge .
The frogs and salamanders of Yellowstone National Park have been declining since the 1980s , according to a Stanford University study , as global warming dries out seasonal ponds , leaving dried salamander corpses in their wake .
Since the 1970s , nearly 75 percent of the frogs and other amphibians of La Selva Biological Station in Braulio Carrillo National Park in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica have died , perhaps due to global warming .
Throughout the tropics , amphibians are also falling prey to a devastating disease , believed to be exacerbated by climate change : chytrid fungus .
This pathogen is marching though Central America at present , leaving silent streams — those without the chorus of dozens of frog species — behind .
Researchers at the University of Georgia in Athens have surveyed such streams before , during and after such extinctions , and documented the impacts in those waters that have lost all of their amphibians , including muddier waters and a less productive food web .
" There are a whole lot of things that are n't being eaten , mostly insects , " says biologist Joseph Mendelson of Zoo Atlanta .
" And there are a whole lot of other creatures that do n't have prey . "
But the really bad news is that amphibians may be just the first sign of other species in trouble .
Biologists at the University of California , San Diego , have shown that amphibians are the first to respond to environmental changes , thanks to their sensitivity to both air and water .
What goes for amphibians may soon be true of other classes of animal , including mammals .
Whereas the exact causes of the amphibian decline remain a mystery , it is clear that man-made problems like atrazine pollution and climate change are contributing factors , both of which can be reversed .
" The easiest thing to do , " Rohr notes , " would be to identify an alternative herbicide that controls the desired pests but is less detrimental to amphibians . "
( CNN ) -- Environmentalists are encouraged by President Barack Obama 's focus this week on renewable energy and stricter emissions standards , although some economists are skeptical he can pull the country out of the recession while cleaning up the planet .
President Barack Obama with Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson .
Obama must strike a careful balance between stimulating the economy in the coming months and investing in the long - term future of the environment , said Raj Chetty , professor of economics at the University of California , Berkeley .
" If you spend money too quickly , you lose site of the long - term vision , " Chetty told CNN .
" If you focus too much on the long term , you may not act on spending money . "
Framing his remarks with an eye on the recession , the president on Monday announced a plan for " a new energy economy that will build millions of jobs . "
Obama proposes to put 460,000 Americans to work through clean energy investments , increasing fuel efficiency in vehicles and reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
By 2025 , the Obama administration hopes one - fourth of the nation 's energy will come from renewable sources .
Over the long term , the president hopes to create millions of new jobs by investing $ 150 billion in taxpayer money to help private companies develop new sources of clean energy , such as wind , solar and geothermal power .
It 's about time , say scientists who often clashed with former President George W. Bush on environmental policy .
" By repowering our nation with clean energy , we will create millions of jobs that can't be sent overseas .
By harnessing the energy of the sun and wind , we can refuel our nation and end our addiction to oil , " said Wesley Warren , director of programs for the Natural Resources Defense Council .
Environmental scholars , however , say the changes Obama seeks are not easy .
" These technologies are not new .
They have been around for 10 to 15 years , " said Bill Chameides , dean of the Nicholas School of Environment at Duke University .
" Government can push new policies , but it has to prove to be economically competitive or else it will not happen . "
" It is going to require massive investments , " said Joseph Romm , former acting assistant secretary of energy under the Clinton administration and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress .
" The only question is , are we going to be the leader and export our technologies or a follower and continue importing our resources ? "
Some economists question whether spending government money on new energy technologies is the best way to stimulate the economy in the short term .
Opponents of Obama 's proposals say renewable energy would be expensive , take up large amounts of land , and might not even be able to generate sufficient energy given the aging infrastructure of the nation 's electric grid .
" If the private sector will not invest in these technologies , it will not be efficient , " said Alan Reynolds , senior fellow at the Cato Institute .
" Creating jobs by switching from one form of energy to another is a bad idea , " he added .
" You do n't need subsidies for anything that is free .
Getting a $ 7,000 rebate on a $ 100,000 plug - in electrical hybrid that gets its power from a coal plant does n't make a lot of sense . "
Several events in Washington this week underscored the Obama administration 's commitment to environmental issues .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday named a special envoy to pursue global agreements combating global warming .
On Wednesday , former Vice President Al Gore urged Congress to approve Obama 's stimulus package and said the United States needs to join international talks on a climate - change treaty .
" For years our efforts to address the climate crisis have been undermined by the idea that we must chose between our planet and our way of life , between our moral duty and economic well - being these are false choices , " Gore told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
" In fact , the solutions to the climate crisis are the same solutions that will address our economic and national crisis as well . "
Obama may have science on his side .
By overwhelming consensus , scientists agree that our warming planet poses a greater global threat with every passing day .
The replacement of current technology with energy generated from natural resources , such as sunlight and wind , could help reduce CO2 emissions by 50 percent by 2050 , according to the International Energy Agency .
" Frankly the science is screaming at us , " said Sen .
John Kerry , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , at Wednesday 's hearing .
" Carbon dioxide emissions grew at a rate of four times faster in the Bush administration than they did in the 1990s . "
Even so , experts agree the faltering economy will complicate any discussion about investment in clean energy .
" The country is running two deficits , " said David Orr , a professor of environmental studies and politics at Oberlin College , " the economy in the short term , which will take one to five years to figure out [ and ] the environment in the long term , which if we do n't do anything about it will see catastrophic effects .

Only one thing 's going to get us through 2009 , and that 's romance .
And possibly cannibalism .
But mainly romance .
In case you missed the bulletin in your post - festive daze , let me bring you up to speed .
According to the latest predictions , here 's what we 're in for this year : MISERY .
Yes , not just misery , but MISERY .
In capitals .
Just like that .
Dim your lights .
Here 's the highlights reel .
The worst recession in 60 years .
Broken windows and artless graffiti .
Howling winds blowing empty cans past boarded - up shopfronts .
Feral children eating sloppy handfuls of decomposed - pigeon - and - baked - bean mulch scraped from the bottom of dustbins in a desperate bid to survive .
The pound worth less than the acorn .
The City worth less than the pound .
Your house worth so little it'll collapse out of shame , crushing you in your bed .
Not that you 'll die peacefully in your sleep - no , you 'll be wide awake with fear , worrying about the situation in the Middle East at the precise moment a chunk of ceiling plaster the size of a flagstone tumbles from on high to flatten your skull like a biscuit under a shoe , sending your brain twizzling out of your earholes like pink - grey toothpaste squeezed from a tube .
All those language skills and precious memories splattered over your pillows .
It 'll ruin the bedclothes .
And instead of buying expensive new ones , your grieving , impoverished relatives will have to handwash those bedclothes in cold water for six hours to shift the most upsetting stains before passing them down to your orphaned offspring , who are fated to sleep on them in a disused underground station for the rest of their lives , shivering in the dark as they hear bombs dipped in bird flu dropping on the shattered remains of the desiccated city above .
Welcome to 2009 .
So what do we do ?
Well , as with any scary situation , we could try scrunching up our eyes and wishing it all away , but that rarely works , unless you 're driving a bus across a busy junction and could n't give a fig for convention .
Instead , we 're going to have to co-operate with one another if we 're going to get through this .
I know , I know : ugh .
The concept of sharing has been knocked out of us .
For years it 's been all about you , your nice things , your signature dish and your plasma screen , and everyone else can go swing .
Now we 'll have to knock on doors and swap cups of sugar .
But maybe it wo n't be so bad .
Picture yourself sharing a meal with a neighbour .
Or maybe a bath .
A bubble bath .
Look , there are little tealight candles round the edge of the tub .
And you 're having a glass of red wine together !
It 's lovely !
Assuming you have attractive neighbours .
If not , sorry .
Just close your eyes and wish it away , especially when they stand up , turn round and bend over to search for the soap .
Actually that whole bath scenario might represent the way forward .
It sounds quite romantic , and authentic romance has been in short supply of late .
Authentic romance makes life more enjoyable , but more importantly it costs nothing .
Buying flowers and baubles and Parisian city breaks - that 's not authentic romance .
That 's lazy showboating .
Authentic romance could flourish in a skip .
Prove this to yourself .
Invite someone on a date and spend the evening sitting in a skip making each other laugh with limericks or something .
Get through that and you 've bonded for life .
Or maybe a week .
It 's hard to tell when you embark on a new relationship .
Still , if you split up : time for more romance with someone else .
Everybody wins .
Mark my words , you'd be wise to practice your romancing skills now , because when , circa October , we 're huddled together in shelters sharing body heat to survive , the ability to whisper sweet nothings could prove useful .
Come the dawn , you 'll need to pair up with someone to go hunting for supplies with , and it 'll help if you 've been cuddling all night .
The world outside will be dangerous , so there 'll have to be two of you .
One to root through the abandoned Woolworth 's stockrooms and another to stand outside warding off fellow scavengers with a flaming rag on a stick .
Obviously if two is better than one , it follows that three is better than two , especially in the thick of a food riot .
Rather than forming boring old duos as per tradition , polygamous unions involving up to 30 or 40 participants will emerge victorious , roving the landscape in packs by day , writhing around in obscene configurations in their papier - mache huts by night - strictly for the purposes of generating heat , of course .
We can all do our bit .
I , for one , am fully prepared to take on 50 wives if it 'll help make the world more manageable , provided I do n't have to talk to them and I get to wear a crown and issue decrees and everything .
We 'll create a kingdom in a cave somewhere and kill and eat unfortunate passers - by , like Sawney Bean and his family .
Now they had vision .
First potential wife to contact me with full Ordnance Survey reference numbers for a suitable location ( warm cave , close to major thoroughfare ) gets to be Minister of Skinning Trespassers Alive and Sticking Their Heads On Poles as a Warning to Others of Their Kind .
All things considered , this may be a bleak year but at least it 'll be more interesting than , say , 2006 , during which nothing happened .
So grit your teeth and meet 2009 head - on , because it 's not going anywhere until 2010 at the very earliest .
In summary : happy new year .

The city of Oslo is converting 80 municipal buses to run on biomethane captured from human waste , a novel , if somewhat disgusting , approach to cutting CO2 emissions and meeting Norway 's ambitious plan to be carbon - neutral by 2050 .
Beginning in September , the two sewage treatment plants in Norway 's capital will collect methane , a byproduct of the microbial process that breaks down sewage , and pump it into city buses .
City officials say the switch will cut fuel costs and reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by both the treatment plants and the buses .
" Oslo aims to be one of the most environmentally sustainable capitals in the world , " project manager Ole Jakob Johansen told the Guardian .
" Using biomethane makes sense .
Not only would the biomethane otherwise be wasted , but the reduction in emissions per bus will go a long way to achieving our carbon - neutral target . "
Biomethane advocates say using the wonder gas — keep those jokes to yourself , please — for fuel not only improves air quality , it can turn rural communities into alt - fuel producers .
California 's pro-biomethane camp claims collecting methane from the state 's 1.7 million dairy cows would produce eight billion cubic feet of methane a year , the equivalent to more than 150 million gallons of gasoline .
Of course , that 's less than half the 390 million gallons of gasoline the United States sucks down each day , but it 's still nothing to sneeze at .
Poo - to - pump fuel may sound gross , but it is n't like there are guys in hazmat suits shoveling raw sewage into gas tanks .
Biomethane is produced during a four - phase process called anaerobic digestion that uses microorganisms to break down everything from human waste and leftover food to lawn clippings and stuff swept from the slaughterhouse floor .
Until now , much of the methane produced by Oslo 's sewage treatment plants was flared off into the atmosphere , releasing about 17,000 tons of CO2 .
But with the city concerned by a big jump in transportation - related air pollution , which has climbed 10 percent since 2000 and contributes to more than half of the country 's annual CO2 emissions , officials decided to capture the stuff and burn it in buses .
It 's a net - zero carbon equation because the carbon originally came from the atmosphere , city officials say .
Even when you account for the electricity used to make the gas , the switch will save 44 tons of CO2 per bus per year .
Setting up the initial infrastructure required for biomethane production ain't cheap , but the gas that gets produced is .
Bean counters in Oslo say that on average biomethane gas will be €0.40
( $ 0.50 ) cheaper per liter than diesel , while conversion will require only minor modification to the buses .
And it turns out Oslo has more than enough sludge to work with .
The city 's two sewage plants can crank out enough biomethane to power all
80 of the buses involved in the trial .
Should the program succeed , it will be expanded to all 400 city buses by producing methane from household and restaurant food waste .

HMS Vanguard is now back at its home base at Faslane on the Clyde A Royal Navy nuclear submarine was involved in a collision with a French nuclear sub in the middle of the Atlantic , the MoD has confirmed .
HMS Vanguard and Le Triomphant were badly damaged in the crash in heavy seas earlier this month .
First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Jonathon
Band said the submarines came into contact at low speed and no injuries were reported .
Both the UK and France insisted nuclear security had not been compromised .
Factfile : HMS Vanguard and Le Triomphant BBC defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt said the incident was " incredibly embarrassing " for the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) .
HMS Vanguard returned to its home base Faslane on the Firth of Clyde under her own power on 14 February .
" Very visible dents and scrapes " could be seen as tugs towed her in to the port on the final stage of the journey , our correspondent said .

The submarines are equipped with sonar to detect other vessels nearby but our correspondent said it might be the case that the anti-sonar devices , meant to hide the submarines from enemies , were " too effective " .
" This is clearly a one - in - a - million chance when you think about how big the Atlantic is , " she said .
The two submarines are key parts of each nation 's nuclear deterrent , and would have been carrying missiles , though both the UK and France have insisted there was no danger of a nuclear incident .
They were carrying around 240 sailors between them .
A French naval spokesman said the collision did not result in any injuries to the crew .
Le Triomphant is based at L'Ile Longue near Brest , north - west France .
HMS Vanguard arrived back in Faslane on Saturday .
On 6 February , France 's defence ministry had said that Le Triomphant " collided with an immersed object ( probably a container ) " when coming back from patrolling , and that the vessel 's sonar dome was damaged .
But in a subsequent statement , it admitted that the collision between the two submarines took place .
" They briefly came into contact at a very low speed while submerged , " the statement added .
' Large ocean ' Retired Commodore Stephen Saunders , editor of Jane 's Fighting Ships , said the cause of the collision appeared to be procedural rather than technical .
" These submarines should not have been in the same place at the same time , " he added .
If there were ever to be a bang it would be a mighty big one
Nick Harvey
Lib Dem shadow defence spokesman
Q&A : Submarine collision Nuclear engineer John Large told the BBC that navies often used the same " nesting grounds " .
" Both navies want quiet areas , deep areas , roughly the same distance from their home ports .
So you find these station grounds have got quite a few submarines , not only French and Royal Navy but also from Russia and the United States . "
In 1992 , the US nuclear submarine USS Baton Rouge was struck by a surfacing Russian nuclear sub in the Barents Sea .
When the nuclear submarine HMS Trafalgar ran aground during a training exercise off the coast of Skye in 2002 , the damage was estimated at £ 5 m ( $ 7 m ) .
HMS Vanguard completed a two - year refit completed in 2007 as part of a £ 5 bn contract , and is not due to be replaced until 2024 .
Politicians have demanded more information on the latest incident .
Lib Dem defence spokesman Nick Harvey has called for an immediate internal inquiry with some of the conclusions made public .
" While the British nuclear fleet has a good safety record , if there were ever to be a bang it would be a mighty big one , " he said .
" Now that this incident is public knowledge , the people of Britain , France and the rest of the world need to be reassured this can never happen again and that lessons are being learned . "
Meanwhile , SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson has called for a government statement .
" The Ministry of Defence needs to explain how it is possible for a submarine carrying weapons of mass destruction to collide with another submarine carrying weapons of mass destruction in the middle of the world 's second - largest ocean , " he said .
The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament described the collision as " a nuclear nightmare of the highest order " .
CND chair Kate Hudson said : " The collision of two submarines , both with nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons onboard , could have released vast amounts of radiation and scattered scores of nuclear warheads across the seabed . "
HMS VANGUARD Launched in 1992
One of four British submarines carrying Trident nuclear missiles Displacement ( submerged ) 16,000 tonnes , 150 m ( 492ft ) long Can carry 48 nuclear warheads on a maximum of 16 missiles Full crew is 145 , including 14 officers Submerged speed of 25 knots LE TRIOMPHANT Launched in 1994

The fundamental ideas behind the theory of evolution have been scientific gospel for decades - and yet creationists refuse to go the way of the dinosaurs .
Who exactly are they ?
And just what do they believe ?
Stephen Moss reports
They do it differently in the US .
The Creation Museum in Petersburg , Kentucky ( motto : " Prepare to believe ! " ) measures 70,000 sq ft , cost $ 27 m to build , was designed by someone from Universal Studios , and promises " murals and realistic scenery , computer - generated visual effects , over 50 exotic animals , life - sized people and dinosaur animatronics , and a special - effects theater complete with misty sea breezes and rumbling seats " .
The museum , opened in 2006 by creationist group Answers in Genesis to promote " true history " , looks Edenic on its website .
By contrast , Britain 's creation museum , Genesis Expo , is housed in a former bank next to the bus station on the harbour front in Portsmouth .
It does not appear to have any connection with Hollywood , and is an animatronic - free zone .
The sign stretching across the front of the building is peeling , an elderly volunteer from a local church is manning the front desk , and the museum is only slowly converting its stock of creationist videos to DVD .
The upside is that Genesis Expo is free to enter .
The museum was opened in 2000 by the Creation Science Movement , which claims to be the oldest creationist movement in the world , beginning life in 1932 as the Evolution Protest Movement .
In 1935 , Sir Ambrose Fleming , one its founders , explained at a public meeting why the movement was necessary : " Of late years , the Darwinian anthropology had been forced on public attention by numerous books in such a fashion as to create a belief that it was a certainly settled scientific truth .
The fact that many eminent naturalists did not agree that Darwin 's theory of species production ... was generally repressed . "
The CSM still quotes his words as its credo today , and in Darwin 's bicentenary year Fleming 's successors think they are finally making progress .
The bicentenary has been good for Genesis Expo .
David Attenborough extolling the virtues of Darwin on TV - and attacking the vices of militant creationists , who he says have subjected him to hate mail , in the Radio Times - has been bringing in the punters .
On the Saturday that I drop by , there is a steady trickle of somewhat bemused visitors - small church groups , a few young foreign tourists and several children eager to play with the dinosaurs .
Creationism has surprisingly little difficulty accommodating dinosaurs .
Indeed , the first thing you bump into at the museum is Boris , a 20ft model of a tyrannosaurus rex .
Conventional scientists think T - rex died out at the end of the Cretaceous period , about 65 m years ago .
Creationists , who argue that the world was created no more than 10,000 years ago , believe dinosaurs and man co-existed in the pre-Flood period ( they date the Flood to around 1,600 years after the creation ) , that there were dinosaurs on the ark , but that they were eventually wiped out by the changes in climate which followed the Flood .
The museum itself is a little dusty , with lots of fossils in glass cabinets , the way museums were circa 1935 .
The high spots are a faux - marble gravestone on which Darwin 's picture is engraved , above the caption " Here Lies the Theory of Evolution .
RIP " , and a batch of " genuine dinosaur eggs " .
Ross Rosevear , the museum 's curator , tells me he has been licking envelopes for the CSM since 1981 and is a convinced " young earther " .
Almost all Christians used to go along with the idea that Genesis was a bit suspect on dates , and that the six days of the Bible were metaphorical , with each day representing a vast geological age .
The majority of Anglicans , theistic evolutionists who have no difficulty in believing in a Darwinian God , would still abide by that .
But the publication in 1961 of Henry Morris and John Whitcomb 's The Genesis Flood , which set out to give a scientific demonstration of the literal truth of the Bible , emboldened those who refused to accept evolution .
" The book was the turning point , " says Rosevear .
" They were voices in the wilderness at the time , but since then things have moved in that direction . "
A recent survey , commissioned by the theology thinktank
Theos , reported that half of a sample of more than 2,000 people in the UK did not believe in evolution , almost a quarter opted for creationism or intelligent design ( the latter presupposes a watchmaker with 20 / 20 vision who is not the Christian god and may well own a spaceship ) , and a remarkable 10 % accepted young earth creationism .
If you believe in young - earth creationism , as an increasing number of evangelical Christians do , virtually all existing science has to be rewritten - and the creationists are ready to do the rewriting .
The speed of light , Rosevear argues , used to be 300 times faster than it is now - necessary for creationists to explain cosmology and the distance of other solar systems from our own ; the great cataclysm of the Flood explains the formation of sedimentary rock and the distribution of fossils ; the division of the land masses occurred when the post - Flood ice melted and sea levels rose ; dinosaurs died out because they could n't adapt to the fall in oxygen levels that followed the Flood .
The theories are at best antediluvian , at worst absurd , so creationists feel more comfortable picking generalised holes in Darwinian thinking .
" Most scientists believe in evolution because they believe that most scientists believe in evolution , " says the evangelical preacher and author Brian Edwards .
" We do believe in evolution , that things develop .
But there 's not a shred of evidence for macro evolution - the jump from one species to another .
The fins of a fish can't become the wings of a bird or the arms of a man .
All we know of genetics is that you can't have a half - formed eye ; you can't have steps towards a fully formed eye .
All that we know of the genome system supports creationism , not evolution .
It 's not just a matter of our faith ; it 's an intellectual issue .
Darwin's had an easy ride .
He 's not the great hero . "
" We are forever being told [ by evolutionists ] that they 've got proof of evolution , but they have n't , " says Monty White , former head of Answers in Genesis in the UK .
" They 've got proof of change within species .
But the Bible does n't teach fixity of species ; it talks about kinds .
You can't extrapolate from change within species to say that an ape - like creature can turn into man . "
White , who is a chemist , could claim to be the grand old man of creationism in the UK .
He became a Christian as an undergraduate in 1964 , and initially accepted theistic evolution , but by the early 1970s he had come to believe that evolution was not compatible with Christianity .
He admits that his thinking on creation is a " faith position " , and wants evolutionists to do the same .
" I object to the fact that evolution is taught as fact , rather than as a hypothesis .
You 're allowed to question everything in this country except evolution . "
From the 1970s on , White spent much of his time writing on creationism and touring churches lecturing on the subject .
His evangelism was important in building the movement - Geoff Chapman , who now runs the Creation Resources Trust in Somerset , says hearing White speak was his inspiration for getting involved in 1981 - and a loose federation of creationists , working through the network of evangelical churches , began to evolve .
There are now at least half a dozen active creationist organisations in the UK .
The Leicester - based Answers in Genesis , with four full - time staff , is the most visible .
Former science teacher Paul Taylor , who took over from White as head of AIG in the UK last year , says it has the largest " reach " of any creationist group in Britain and calls his organisation the " David Attenboroughs of the creationist world " .
" Creationists are less marginal than we were 20 years ago , " he says .
" There is greater respect for us than there was , and [ as a result ] more anger among the ' new atheists ' .
They want to clamp down on what children can be taught , which is what they accuse us of . "
Other groups are smaller .
The Creation Science Movement in Portsmouth says it has a mailing list of 1,500 ; Creation Research UK - an offshoot of an organisation set up by another former science teacher , John Mackay , in Australia more than 20 years ago - has 2,000 .
But names are duplicated across organisations , and some are anti-creationists keen to keep tabs on the enemy .
As for the number of frontline creationists , involved in evangelising on a day - to - day basis , a delegate at a recent creationist conference at High Leigh in Hertfordshire told me there were about a hundred , in regular contact with each other via a subscriber - only internet site called Creation Link .
British creationism is surprisingly independent from the far bigger , better funded , more vocal , highly politicised movement in the US , where creationists and intelligent design organisations ( often a front for Christian creationists ) are fighting perpetual legal battles to get creationist teaching into the classrooms of state schools .
George Bush and Sarah Palin both appeared to give succour to the creationists .
" Teach both , " said Palin when she was running for the governorship of Alaska .
" You know , do n't be afraid of information .
Healthy debate is so important and it's so valuable in our schools . "
So far the courts have treated creationism as a branch of religion and legislated to keep it out of the classroom on the grounds of the separation , enshrined in the constitution , between state and church .
That is the official position , but the reality is fuzzier .
A survey last year suggested that 16 % of American science teachers are creationist , and there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that creationism is taught , or at least discussed , in US schools .
When we met recently , John Mackay , the founder and international director of Creation Research , told me he had lectured in many state schools in the US .
Moreover , there is a large Christian school and university sector in the US , as well as a burgeoning home education sector which is to a large extent religiously oriented .
So , whatever the American judicial system may decree and the science lobby may wish , creationism is being taught to children , in accordance no doubt with the wishes of the 45 % of those who in a Gallup poll in the US in 2001 identified themselves as creationist ( choosing , from several options , the statement " God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so " as the one closest to their own view ) .
Whether creationism or intelligent design should form part of science teaching is also the most controversial aspect of the debate in the UK .
AIG 's Taylor , a Christian since he was 17 , says that when he was a teacher , " I did n't see it was part of my job to teach creationism , but if discussion came up it was possible to discuss creationism . "
That accords with government guidelines on how to treat creationism in the classroom .
" Creationism and intelligent design are not part of the science national curriculum programmes of study and should not be taught as science , " state the guidelines .
" However , there is a real difference between teaching ' x ' and teaching about ' x ' .
Any questions about creationism and intelligent design which arise in science lessons , for example as a result of media coverage , could provide the opportunity to explain or explore why they are not considered to be scientific theories and , in the right context , why evolution is considered to be a scientific theory . "
Much is left to the discretion of individual teachers , and a spokesman for the Department for Children , Schools and Families says it is the job of headmasters to monitor what is being taught .
He also encourages parents to report teachers they believe to be overstepping the mark .
" If you are teaching evolution and a child raises his hand and says , ' But I 've heard we were created by God ' , there 's nothing wrong with having a discussion about it .
That 's common sense .
But teachers can't teach creationism , and Christian teachers have to follow the rules . "
Last year , Michael Reiss , professor of science education at the Institute of Education , lost his job as director of education at the Royal Society when members of the society objected to his call for creationism to be discussed in science lessons .
It was a bizarre episode because Reiss is a theistic evolutionist and he was arguing for no more than the government guidelines already permit .
What did for him was his suggestion that " creationism is best seen by science teachers not as a misconception but as a worldview " , which was misconstrued as an argument for giving creationism and evolution equal weight .
Reiss is wary of re-igniting the controversy and prefers not to talk about the way in which he was ousted .
But he does tell me that he feels creationism is becoming stronger , and that it is better to engage with it rather than ignore or show contempt for it .
" It is growing , both in the UK and in many other countries , " he says .
" As Christianity has become less important in the west , it has sometimes become more extreme .
That is a common phenomenon .
The rise of creationism makes teaching more challenging .
In the US a lot of pressure has been brought to bear by local school boards , and as a result the state system in the US teaches no evolution at all , or else teaches a very eviscerated , attenuated form of it .
My hope is that we can avoid the extreme politicisation of the US . "
It may be a vain hope .
Attenborough says he has received hate mail from creationists , though all the organisations declare they would never resort to such tactics .
But the creationists , too , complain of hate mail , and Randall Hardy of Creation Research UK sent me a copy of a recent exchange in which the term most frequently resorted to by his correspondent was " religious parasite " .
I suspect if anyone could be bothered to trawl through a good sample of emails and discussion board messages where these issues are being debated , I am confident that they would find a much higher percentage of abuse is aimed at Christians by atheists , than vice versa , " he says .
The viciousness reflects the fact that , at its heart , this is not a scientific debate but a moral , cultural and political one .
John Mackay , the founder of Creation Research , is frank about his agenda and admits this is really a battle of worldviews .
" All scientific research , whether we like it or not , has moral overtones and implications and applications , " he says .
" This issue is fundamental to the whole of life .
When your government is making decisions about stem - cell research , sooner or later you have to address the issue of , ' Well , did God make us or did n't he make us ? '
When you 're funding abortions , are we going to be held accountable after the grave ?
It 's not an issue you can just shove aside as if it does n't matter .
If life came from nature , it does n't matter ; we 're just hydrogen recycled ; we 'll come back again maybe .
Science is not just test tubes .
There 's always a wider worldview , and that 's where the bitterness comes from . "
One of the most corrosive arguments creationists deploy - and I heard it many times - is that Darwinism made possible eugenics , Nazism , communist materialism .
" If we come from slime and revert to slime , it 's not surprising that life is slimy , " is one mantra .
" If you realise what Darwin gave rise to , you would realise what a pernicious system it was , " says Brian Edwards .
" Eugenics and Nazism applied biological evolution quite logically . "
Creationists like to point to the original title of Darwin 's life - redefining book : " On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life " .
Favoured races !
QED , they say with satisfied expressions .
Darwin as the godfather of Hitler and Stalin .
No wonder this debate degenerates into vicious blogs and hate mail , and a reasonable man like Michael Reiss gets submerged in the flood .
The US and UK creationist movements have many points of difference , so at the High Leigh conference - seven lectures grouped under the banner " Genesis Kinds : Creationism and the Origin of Species " - it is interesting to see the two genuses side by side .
Todd Wood , director of the Center for Origins Research at Bryan College ( motto : " Christ above all " ) in Dayton , Tennessee , and the prime mover in the event , does n't want to talk to me .
He wo n't even let me record his lecture on Darwin , about whom he evidently has mixed feelings .
During the talk , he shows a slide of himself outside Down House , Darwin 's home in Kent , and his concluding remarks are affectionate , if condescending : " Darwin 's was a sad life .
He was a brilliant man who ignored the Lord 's pursuit of him .
God was after him , but he allowed the hardships he faced [ Wood is thinking principally of the death of Darwin 's young daughter ] to harden him . "
The conference 's co-organiser , Paul Garner , a geologist who works full time for Biblical Creation Ministries , is also initially reluctant but explains why standing up for the literal truth of Genesis is so important to him : " Many people have the mistaken impression that it 's Genesis , chapter one that drives young earth creationism - a rigid understanding of the word ' day ' in the creation .
But that is n't it at all .
It 's Genesis three ; it 's the introduction of death and suffering and what you might call natural evil into the creation .
If those things pre-date Adam , there 's a big theological problem for me , because it undermines the foundation of the gospel .
The young - earth position is the only one that has a coherent understanding of the history that does n't have suffering , death and bloodshed before Adam 's fall . "
It is , in other words , a life - or - death issue for Christianity : if evolution is true , the creation is founded on competition , suffering and mortality ; there never was a paradise ; a theistic evolutionist God is an accessory to eternal crime .
Sylvia Baker , another veteran creationist , biologist , former teacher and author of the anti-evolutionary bestseller , Bone of Contention , is a rare female creationist .
" The first time I 'd come across evidence for evolution was in A - level zoology , " she says , " and it had struck me as rather weak .
It seemed circumstantial , and I thought there must be more evidence than this because all of these things are vague and capable of different interpretations .
I assumed that when I got to university all the vagueness would disappear and there 'd be lots of overwhelming evidence .
But there was n't .
I still did n't query it , but a turning point came towards the end of my degree when in a seminar on the supposed evolution of the eye it suddenly seemed to me an impossibility that the vertebrate eye could have evolved from other sorts of structures [ eyes of invertebrates ] .
The two things run on completely different principles .
There 's just no connection .
So I said , ' Maybe it did n't happen . '
What happened next really taught me a lesson , which the subsequent 40 years have substantiated .
There was a shocked silence , somebody started mocking me for my belief in God and the seminar leader said , ' Quiet .
I will not have this .
I refuse to get involved in any controversy .
We will not discuss this . ' "
That moment governed the rest of Baker 's life , which has been spent teaching in private Christian schools , writing on creationism , and working with the Biblical Creation Society , another of the mosaic of similar - sounding organisations which articulate creationism in the UK .
She seems genuinely questioning , but what worries me about many of her fellow creationists is that they begin with the Bible and then start looking for scientific evidence to back up what their faith tells them is true .
" I am guided ultimately by the parameters that the Bible lays down , " admits John Peet , travelling secretary of the Biblical Creation Society .
He estimates that 90 % of the congregation at the Chertsey Street baptist church in Guildford , where he worships and where I hear him address the " creation club " , are young earthers .
The theme of pastor John Benton 's sermon in the evening is " Genesis and Evolution : Do They Fit Together ? "
He holds up a recent New Scientist cover , headlined " Darwin was wrong , " as evidence that the scientific base for evolution is crumbling , that the Darwinian tree of life can be uprooted .
Mackay , too , is clutching a copy of that issue of New Scientist when I meet him .
This is manna from heaven - the science establishment offering up gifts to the creationists .
They also claim that the aggression of the new atheists is helping them .
They paint Dawkins as a " recruiting sergeant " for creationism because he links evolutionary thinking with atheism .
" He has been a real help to the ministry , " says Randall Hardy .
Creationists argue that the new atheists are fuelling the dogmatism ; Richard Harries , the former Bishop of Oxford and a theistic evolutionary , last week threw that accusation back at them .
" Creationists totally misunderstand the Bible , " he said .
" Genesis is in the business of story , myth , poetry , metaphor .
They [ creationists and atheists ] feed off one another .
The debate has an unreality about it .
Those of us who are not fundamentalists can't find a place . "
But Greg Haslam , pastor at Westminster Chapel in central London , says a lot of people do n't understand what is lost by compromising .
" [ Jesus ] seems very clearly to have believed in the historicity of Adam and Eve .
If you do n't believe those early chapters [ of Genesis ] , you end up saying , ' Well , Jesus was wrong , ' and where does that leave you ?
What can we believe of what Jesus said ? "
If , like Haslam , you take the biblical beginning literally , you must also go along with the biblical end - apocalypse , the second coming of Christ , the final judgment , eternal damnation for non-believers , perpetual bliss for the lucky few .
It was this that really turned Darwin off Christianity : inherent in creationism is destructionism .
It strikes me , too , as a hideous doctrine , and over dinner at High Leigh I ask Kurt Wise , professor of science and theology at the Southern Baptist Theological College in Louisville , Kentucky , whether I 've understood it correctly .
Wise is a twinkling 50 - year - old with a perpetual smile , a contrarian spirit and a born ( or born - again ) preacher 's style of delivery .
Wise imagines creation as " a beautiful painting or tapestry where each individual brushmark or thread is one aspect of the creation " .
But on the apocalypse that awaits us he is unbending .
" The Bible warns us : ' As it was in the days of Noah , so it shall be - my coming . '
People are going to be wandering around on the planet when the Flood comes and they 're blown away .
People are going to be eating and drinking and marrying and doing their thing , and the judgment is going to come . "
Then he returns to his apple pie and custard , smiling at the thought of the world 's imminent demise .
God vs Darwin :
Do creationists have a case ?
In the 150 years since the publication of On the Origin of Species , Darwin 's opponents have tried numerous angles of attack to discredit the man and spear his theory .
He was lampooned in Victorian caricature as a bearded monkey , his critics have misrepresented his theory by likening it to a whirlwind in a junk yard assembling a jumbo jet by chance and they drone on endlessly about gaps in the fossil record between one group of creatures and another – even though numerous such transitional fossils have been found .
Most Darwin - sceptics , of course , hold up the Bible as " proof " that the great biologist can't be right .
A more subtle ploy is to damn the man with faint praise .
In a letter in the Telegraph to coincide with Darwin 's birthday last week , 10 authors conceded that " evolutionary adaptation , modification and variation within species – which is what Darwin actually discovered – is secure " but that the evidence for how complex organisms developed is " modest in the extreme " .
What they seem to be saying is that a finch 's beak can change over generations to allow it to eat a different type of food , for example , but where did the finch come from in the first place ?
By accepting the carefully worded " variation within species " they are implicitly rejecting speciation – the process by which one species becomes two that cannot interbreed .
In reality there is now stacks of evidence for how speciation can occur .
Scientists have studied it in great detail happening in the lab – for example in fruit flies .
There are still scientific debates to be had about the details of how natural selection operates – for example , to what extent characteristics acquired during life can be passed on to off spring via chemical modifications to DNA – but there is no serious disagreement in the scientific community about the fundamentals of Darwin 's theory .
A century and a half of science from fossils to DNA has turned up nothing that would bring Darwin 's theory down .
In fact , it has made his defences stronger .

“ Advocates of the free market must confront the fact that both the Great Depression and the current financial chaos were preceded by years of laissez - faire economic policies , ” write Katrina van den Heuvel , editor of The Nation , and author Eric Schlossel .
Knowing full well that inanities like this would become the received version of events , I wrote a book for the layman explaining what really happened to the economy , who the true culprits are , and why the free market is the only approach that has n’t been tried .
It ’s called Meltdown : A Free -Market Look at Why the Stock Market Collapsed , the Economy Tanked , and Government Bailouts Will Make Things Worse , and it was released yesterday .
My publisher has made a free chapter available for download .
I wrote Meltdown in order to give the free - market point of view the advantage of being one of the first , if not the first , of the inevitable avalanche of books on the crisis .
( Paul Krugman , as well as the editors of The Nation , have published books of rehashed columns , but those do n’t count . )
I also wanted the free - market point of view to have the advantage of a book - length defense in the first place .
I know of one self - described libertarian who has a book on the economy coming out this year , but since he supported the bailouts , his prescription is n’t exactly going to be traditional laissez faire .
And that , as we know , is the one position the establishment is trying to pretend does n’t exist .
It ’s not exactly clear how the Federal Reserve ’s policy of pushing interest rates well below where the free market would have set them , thereby inflating the biggest asset bubble in the history of the world , could be the fault of the free market , or attributable to “ laissez faire . ”
But since hardly anyone discusses the Fed , no one has to answer this inconvenient question .
The Fed ’s very existence is a violation of laissez faire .
Yet the destructive effects of what it does are then blamed on the market .
This charade has gone on long enough .
Here are some of the topics the book covers :
The housing bubble and its causes
Fannie and Freddie , the Community Reinvestment Act
The Federal Reserve System : the elephant in the living room
Is this a simple matter of “ regulation ” vs. “ deregulation ” ?
Who predicted the crash , who did n’t , and what that means
The “ too big to fail ” dogma
The bailouts : truth and propaganda
Where the boom - bust cycle comes from
Where the boom - bust cycle comes from
The foolishness of fiscal “ stimulus ”
Previous booms and busts in American history , from the Panic of 1819 to the dot - com boom , and what we can learn from them
The policies that failed in Japan , and their eerie similarity to the policies urged upon us now
“ Great Myths About the Great Depression ”
Money , inflation , gold , silver , legal tender — and why they matter now
Common fallacies answered
How to minimize the ( inevitable ) pain
A very nice foreword from Congressman Ron Paul , for whom being vindicated is probably becoming a wearying thing , is an extremely welcome addition to Meltdown .
The Austrian School is not going to have another opportunity of this magnitude to get its message heard for a long time .
If we do n’t seize this chance , we have only ourselves to blame .
That ’s why I decided to write this book .

The government wants carmakers to keep their French sites open France has decided to loan 6.5 bn euros ( $ 8.5 bn , £ 5.7 bn ) to three carmakers , President Nicolas Sarkozy has said .
Peugeot - Citroen and Renault will receive 3bn euros each , while Renault Trucks , which is owned by Sweden 's AB Volvo , will get 500 m euros .
In exchange , they had pledged to keep French sites open , the president said after talks with carmakers .
The car industry is one of France 's biggest employers .
Demand for cars has plummeted amid the global downturn .
Industry secretary Luc Chatel said the terms of the car bail - out foresaw a reining in management bonuses .
The Commission will need to scrutinise very carefully details of the subsidies , the conditions attached to make sure of their compliance with state aid and single market rules
Jonathan Todd , Commission competition spokesman " This is not a gift .
It is not a subsidy .
It is a loan offered at an interest rate of 6 % , " President Sarkozy said .
Meanwhile , The European Commission said it would look very carefully at the French car bail - out .
" The commission will need to scrutinise very carefully details of the subsidies , the conditions attached , to make sure of their compliance with state aid and single market rules , " commission competition spokesman Jonathan Todd said .
Commitments
The government loans , which will run over five years , will allow Renault and Peugeot - Citroen to " prepare calmly for the future " , the president said .
" Renault and PSA have made a commitment ... to close no sites over the duration of the loan and to do everything to avoid redundancies , " he said .
" I welcome this commitment since it gives us the assurance that an acute but temporary crisis will not destroy part of our industrial base and our auto industry skills . "
President Sarkozy also said the government would double its aid to car industry suppliers to 600 m euros .
Renault and Peugeot - Citroen 's financial services divisions will also get a doubled state aid of 2bn euros .
Both Peugeot and Renault will report their full - year results later this week .

Ever since the aptly named fraudster Bernard Madoff reminded us of the power of hiding lies in plain sight , a trickle of other fund managers have begun to own up to similar pyramid schemes : crawling out of their Florida beach homes to admit they , too , fabricated their dizzying investment returns .
Using new money to create fictitious returns for existing investors - also known as a Ponzi scheme - is one of the oldest tricks in the book .
But as the scale of the carnage in the wider financial system becomes apparent , it is time to wonder whether we have all been suckered in to a form of pyramid fraud .
The apparent financial wealth of the world increased in a seemingly endless upward spiral .
Globalisation brought billions of new players into the game .
And those on the inside were able to extract vast rewards before the music stopped .
Just 12 top bankers , for instance , paid themselves £ 1bn on the basis that their firms were hugely profitable .
The fact these same institutions have subsequently admitted to losses and accepted emergency bail - outs totalling more than £ 300bn has somehow become our problem , not theirs .
Nevertheless , the transmission mechanism from the fantasy world of international finance to the real world of home repossessions and unemployment should no longer come as a surprise .
Even the sober - suited International Monetary Fund conjured up images of the Great Depression on Thursday by predicting the British economy would contract at its fastest rate since the 1930s .
All this week , the Guardian and the Observer have been charting this " Road to Ruin " in a series of investigations designed to show just how badly broken the financial system is .
Mocked by one commentator as an overly moralistic metaphor , the series title is intended not as a hair - shirted prediction but as a description of the track we are on .
Unless something is done soon , the International Labour Organisation 's prediction of 50 million global job losses will look like an underestimate .
The current direction is not in question ; the bigger challenge is finding our way back on to a path to prosperity .
The first lesson is not to look back .
It is undeniable that excessive lending is what led us into this mess .
Greedy bankers encouraged greedy consumers to borrow more than we should have done in a collective rush to enjoy the fruits of tomorrow 's labour today .
But encouraging more lending is not automatically the wrong response .
What governments around the world are doing today is trying to manage the pace of transition to a less debt - dependent economy .
Like a junkie coming off drugs , corporate Britain needs to have its withdrawal process handled carefully .
Refuse to refinance existing debt , as many banks are doing today , and all manner of otherwise healthy firms are forced under , with devastating consequences for unemployment and the wider economy .
This explains the paradox apparently dividing Labour and the Tories .
David Cameron is right in his description of the problem , but wrong to accuse Gordon Brown of recklessly trying to reinflate the bubble .
The wreckage left by the financial pyramid scheme is so complete that that simply would not be possible .
The priority now is to limit its impact on the rest of the economy .
We 've been here before , of course .
A major cause of our latest debt explosion was former US Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan 's attempt to prevent the bursting of the last bubble running its natural course .
By keeping interest rates low , one economic cycle was suppressed - only to swing back more violently .
If history is repeating itself , Cameron is right to be cautious .
Only this time it feels like something important has snapped : there is no going back .
Once this phase of weaning companies off debt is complete , we will have to build an entirely different economy .
Without artificial stimulants , companies and economies will be locked into lower rates of economic growth for generations to come .
Yet if this is combined with a reassessment of the ways we measure growth , it might not be so bad .
Much of what we thought was growth has turned out to be illusory .
Not just because profits turned out to be losses , but because the financial engineering on which much wealth was based had lost touch with economic reality .
The notional value of financial derivatives peaked at $ 863 trillion - 16 times the world economy 's size .
It is not even clear whether we will ever be able to honour the debt created during this latest , and most extreme , bubble .
Writing much of it off may be the only solution - an admission implicit in the growing talk about establishing " bad banks " to ring - fence toxic assets .
Once stripped of its excessive dependence on finance , the free market still has much to offer .
We can concentrate on building the sustainable industries of the future in which Britain has an enviable lead : biotechnology , creative industries , professional services like architecture and law , environmental technology and high - end manufacturing .
A free market will always encourage financial speculation , but it will be generations before anyone will buy this particular brand of horse manure again .

this is pretty much as good as it gets and best of all , it 's affordable for many people
Western Digital 's WD TV HD media player is not only a bit of a mouth full to say , but an incredibly smart device in such a small form factor .
You could think of it as a DVD player without the optical DVD drive and a home theater PC without the full functionality of a computer .
It really is just that - it does n't come with any internal storage and sadly no Ethernet networking support , but it does include two hi-speed USB 2.0 ports , which allows you to hook up two external hard drives or USB flash drives which use a FAT32 , NTFS or HFS + ( no journaling ) file system .
We tested the unit with a 64GB pen drive from Patriot and it worked fine detecting it and playing back - plug n play is supported , no need to keep turning the device on and off all of the time .
One little fault about the location of the USB port on the back of the unit - it is too close to the other connectors , which means that larger pen drives such as the 64GB drive from Patriot will not fit - only standard width flash drives will fit .
We also tried out an external caddie that uses two USB ports ( one for data and one for power ) and it was also detected and worked fine .
We thought it may have issues with using two USB ports on one device , but it worked well .
The WD TV allows you to view photos , listen to music and watch movies on your TV .
We have seen several devices like in this part , but none as good as this one .
As for photos , WD TV supports JPEG , GIF , TIF / TIFF , BMP and PNG file formats .
As for music , it supports MP3 , WMA , OGG , WAV / PCM / LPCM , AAC , FLAC , Dolby Digital , AIF / AIFF and MKA file formats .
As for movies , it supports MPEG1/2/4 , WMV9 , AVI ( MPEG4 , Xvid , AVC ) , H.264 , MKV , MOV ( MPEG4 , H.264 ) , MTS , TP and TS file formats .
You will need to update your WD TV firmware to version 1.01 for all of these formats to be supported .
Ours came already updated , so you may or may not need to depending on how long yours has been sitting around in the warehouse .
Find us another device which only weighs 303 grams and measures a tiny 40 mm / 100 mm / 125.5 mm ( H / L / W ) .
Small nano - like devices are the in thing lately and if you 're squashed for space in your lounge room , the WD TV passes with flying colors here , no doubt about it .
It hooks up to your SD or HDTV via HDMI or Composite A/V cable and it also has an optical audio out port for digital audio support , if you are not using HDMI cable .
It does come with a Composite A/V cable in the package , but not HDMI , which is a bit of a shame - you will need to pay extra for that .
In the video above , we used a HDMI cable and changed the audio out option from stereo to digital in the settings menu .
We can confirm that after this change , it outputs movie audio tracks as they were ripped - you wo n't get TrueHD or DTS - HD MA on this device , but you do get the next best - DTS .
We were surprised to see our Onkyo TX SR - 705 amplifier reporting DTS 5.1 output whilst playing back a Blu-ray copy of Kill Bill : Volume 2 that we made .
It just keeps getting better .
It comes with a cute little IR remote control that works very well indeed - finally we see a product that includes batteries .
Some products come with really shocking remote controls with very poor range .
We are happy to report that the WD TV remote has very good range for its size - we even had to go outside , its range was so good .
We estimate we had it working up to eight meters away , but any further and it just stopped responding .
Nevertheless , very impressive .
As you will see if you watch the video above , the WD TV is a very simple and effective device .
It is VERY easy to use and turns on and off in a flash - no fuss or hassle .
It has some basic functionality built - in such as being able to zoom in on images and rotate , but that 's about the extent of it .
You can skip scenes and fast forward and rewind in movies .
All of the basic stuff you would expect is there .
Do n't expect it to be a replacement for your home theater PC , it is not ; but having said that , it is not designed to be either .
It is just a basic product that allows you to play media on your TV and it does a fantastic job of doing it .
We were a bit skeptical about such a small device being able to properly playback 720 p AND 1080 p content , but it did it remarkably well with no frame skipping , visual artifacts or anything to cause concern at all .
You can currently pick up the WD TV from Newegg for a very reasonable $ 109.99 USD shipped to your door ; $ 20 less than what it 's going for at the WD Shop .
We would like to see it drop in price to around the magic $ 99 USD mark , but we cannot have everything our way .
However , if you consider the cost for even building the most basic HTPC that can do the same as the WD TV , things begin to look a whole lot better for that asking price .
Inside the package of the WD TV , Western Digital also include a $ 20 USD off ticket ( promo code ) when you buy a My Passport Essential portable USB hard disk drive , as well as 20 % off on protector cases for the drive .
The WD TV does come with a nice matching black stand to seat your My Passport Essential drive - sneaky Western Digital , but a nice idea .
Also in the package is a CD which includes ArcSoft MediaConverter 2.5 , some demo files to try out and the manual .
Really , we tried to make the WD TV fail during our testing ; we tried thinking of bad points for this product , but came up almost empty besides just a few small issues .
First on the list is it is a slight disappointment that there is no Ethernet networking to stream content from a file server or your PC .
We would also like to see a price drop and maybe a HDMI cable included in the package , but besides that , Western Digital 's WD TV is a brilliantly designed product for what it is intended to do .
For anyone looking to add basic HD movie playback and more to their lounge room , Surprise us next time with a similar device that packs in a Blu-ray optical drive and that is able to bitstream out Dolby TrueHD and DTS - HD MA for a good price and you 'll sell a million of them .
What about opening up this product to the mod and developer world and letting them create applications and enhancements ?
For Microsoft 's legal department , as Yogi Berra once said , it must seem " like déjà vu all over again . "
The Redmond software giant is already enmeshed in a class - action suit over whether it mislead people who purchased PCs prior to the launch of Windows Vista -- the so - called " Vista Capable " suit .
Microsoft's ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) lawyers are also dealing with recent European Commission rulings against it for anticompetitive practices , including illegally tying Internet Explorer ( IE ) to Windows .
Now , the company is under antitrust attack again , this time for the fees PC vendors charge to consumers who buy PCs preinstalled with Vista and then " downgrade " to Windows XP .
The suit , which also requests class - action certification , was filed Wednesday by Emma Alvarado of Los Angeles County in federal district court in Seattle .
Alvarado claims that she bought a Lenovo PC last June that came with Vista preinstalled , and had to pay an additional $ 59.25 to have the system " downgraded " to XP .
" Microsoft has used its market power to take advantage of consumer demand for the Windows XP operating system by requiring consumers to purchase computers preinstalled with the Vista operating system and to pay additional sums to ' downgrade ' to the Windows XP operating system , " the suit alleges .
The Mac Pro has n't seen a design overhaul in ages — since before the Intel switchover — so MacBlogz put together their next gen dream machine .
Is it your ideal Mac Pro , too ?

At first glance , it 's just like a current Mac Pro , but with some extra / updated ports .
A closer look reveals a new surface perforation ( a product of Apple 's new unibody construction process ) and also what I find most notable about the design — two slot loading drives that mimic Apple 's laptops while finalizing the minimalist , utilitarian styling of the Mac Pro .
So are these changes alone enough for you ?
For me , it 's enough .
But then again , I 've sorta become a laptop guy anyway .

Convenience : “ ( T ) he state of being able to proceed with something with little effort or difficulty ; a thing that contributes to an easy and effortless way of life . ”
A concept or phenomenon of deep consequence .
As I read the thoughtful concerns of my fellow humans , concerns about the world situation , political and economic events impacting the people around me and the arguments for what we need to do to make the world and its immediate contacts with individual lives deliver a “ better product , ” I am amazed and cruelly amused ( only in the way an old human can be amused ) that there is so little interest in the substrate upon which these events and processes are played out .
There is a biological principle of great importance : “ The easiest way is the best way . ”
The thoughtful will immediately recognize that two important ideas are left undefined in this formulation ( and this is ultimately of considerable importance ) , but the essential concept comes through loud and clear .
If given the choice to ride or walk humans typically pick riding .
If given the choice of having ample high quality food delivered or going into the jungle and hunting a widely distributed meal , orangutans hang out at the feeding station .
Almost all living things function on a simple imperative : get as many calories as possible with as little effort as possible .
There are of course rules ; there are always rules !
One of the rules is that calories are the natural stand - in for a nutritionally complete diet .
In the native world of evolved relationships it is virtually impossible to consume adequate calories without also consuming abundant vitamins , minerals and essential amino acids .
This fact is the reason that vitamins and essential amino acids are “ required ” in the first place – because they were ubiquitous in the native diet and did not ever have to be made by the organism ’s physiology .
Not only do organisms adapt to use what they need from the environment , the physiology adapts to what is coming into the organism from the environment .
This is a vital principle and an important basis of my argument .
Living things evolve to maximize convenience .
We do n’t normally see it this way since , by our standards , living in the “ wild ” is a very inconvenient – all hunting and gathering the little bits of food , water and material that just make life possible at all .
Convenience is , of course , a human concept – evolutionary physiology is simply measuring efficiency against possibility – but it is useful to frame the ideas this way .
Convenience is a narrow idea that we easily understand as short - term ease ; and that is exactly the issue .
To make sense of these distinctions it necessary to present a theoretical construct of my invention : that the world can be seen as three systems of order based on the designs of information collection , storage and implementation .
These are the Physical System of Order ( foundational fundamental order ) , Living System of Order ( DNA / protein information nexus ) and the Consciousness System of Order ( Complex informational nexus based on the various adapting forms of Story ) .
The manifestation of a system of order is in the probabilities that it generates .
A star has a high probability in the Physical Order , but a bacterium has a positive , but vanishingly small , probability .
A mouse has a high probability in the Living Order , but a car has a vanishingly small probability .
A spear or a rocket ship have high probabilities in the Consciousness order ; we are so new at this system of order that its limits are n’t clear .
What makes this construction important is that statements about one system of order may or may not have the same meaning or value in another , e.g. , convenience in the Living Order is not at all the same as convenience in the Consciousness Order ( and has no meaning at all in the Physical Order ) .
For example , an orangutan is adapted to a widely dispersed food supply ; its whole physiology , structure , social order , and , dare I say it , its happiness .
Only the CSO or traumatic accident can deliver convenience in the form of a concentrated food supply as an immediate ( and non-evolutionary ) change and then make it disappear just as quickly .
What is convenient in the LSO is rates of change to which the organism can respond both genetically and behaviorally – this evolves the greatest degree of “ ease . ”
Convenience in the CSO is often measured in a single instance without regard to longer term efficiencies .
In the orangutan example , the animals act as though evolutionary process were still functioning , but they have been brought into the design order of the CSO for a time when co-existing with humans .
All this can do is disrupt the LSO design order .
In the simplest terms , the meaning that I take from this thinking is that we have acted on ourselves consistently over many thousands of years replacing Living Order convenience with Consciousness Order convenience driven by the principle of “ the easiest way . ”
This is a clash of primary systems of order and not just a mess that humans are making .
Our answer for orangutans , when we understood that we were making a dependent class of great apes unsuited to live the life to which they were evolved was to , as reasonably as possible , “ inconvenience ” them back into the jungle to the natural life of native foods and evolved habits .
The tyranny of convenience in our lives is the orang problem multiplied a billion times .
There is almost no one left to teach us who we are .
There is almost no convenience that we have not so thoroughly incorporate into our daily lives that doing without is incomprehensible – and for which we will rationalize the greatest suffering by other humans and other species in the history of life on the earth .
This is the context within which Gaza is occurring , and Iraq , and the squabbles in Ukraine , and China ’s ascendance and the incarceration of Leonard Peltier , and a million other major and minor consequences of Consciousness Order manifesting without the forming basis of the Living Order .
Today we can eat 10 thousand calories a day and not get sufficient vitamins ; we can travel hundreds of miles and get a mere moment of exercise ; we can tell ourselves ( or be told ) any lie and have no living or physical reality challenge it .
Our pursuit of biological convenience spread into the use of the Consciousness Order ’s powers to seek and create capacities of ease and effortlessness that deny us our basic humanity , even hiding from us any options for their rediscovery .
At least for now it may be time to reject convenience with as much thoughtlessness as we have accepted it in the past until some can find a reasonable balance and be available to help others as they recognize the hopelessness of an effortless life .
The changes that we desire for the world can only begin with what we are willing to do in our own lives .
New Delhi
So I am attending the Energy and Resources Institute climate conference in New Delhi , and during the afternoon session two young American women  along with one of their mothers  proposition me .
“ Hey , Mr. Friedman , ” they say , “ would you like to take a little spin around New Delhi in our car ? ”
Oh , I say , I ’ve heard that line before .
Ah , they say , but you have n’t seen this car before .
It ’s a plug - in electric car that is also powered by rooftop solar panels  and the two young women , recent Yale grads , had just driven it all over India in a “ climate caravan ” to highlight the solutions to global warming being developed by Indian companies , communities , campuses and innovators , as well as to inspire others to take action .
They ask me if I want to drive , but I have visions of being stopped by the cops and ending up in a New Delhi jail .
Not to worry , they tell me .
Indian cops have been stopping them all across India .
First , they ask to see driver ’s licenses , then they inquire about how the green car ’s solar roof manages to provide 10 percent of its mileage  and then they try to buy the car .
We head off down Panchsheel Marg , one of New Delhi ’s main streets .
The ladies want to show me something .
The U.S. Embassy and the Chinese Embassy are both located on Panchsheel , directly across from each other .
They asked me to check out the rooftops of each embassy .
What do I notice ?
Let ’s see ...
The U.S. Embassy ’s roof is loaded with antennae and listening gear .
The Chinese Embassy ’s roof is loaded with ... new Chinese - made solar hot - water heaters .
I am a police skeptic and a former Sheriff ’s Deputy .
I am increasingly ill at ease with the burgeoning police state , misbehavior of all levels of " law enforcement " and the willing complicity of united States subjects to an ocean of bad laws , both unconstitutional and foolish .
What one could call willful submission to illegitimate authority .
At every level of policing from local to FLEA ( federal law enforcement agencies ) , the abuse gets exponentially worse with each passing decade and now the Wars on Drugs and Terror have literally loosened the restraints on any remaining ( if tattered and threadbare ) protections from police mischief .
In the end , the robed government employees will , for the most part , excuse or rationalize the criminal or outrageous behavior of the thin blue line .
The increasing militarization of cops has worsened even more .
Why do cops need to blouse military boots and wear the silly " high and tight " haircuts ?
I cannot watch an episode of " Cops " without an airsickness bag .
Every show is a sordid chronicle of cops overreaching , overreacting and brutalizing people .
If you start to think of cop behavior as occupation behavior , the parallels start to get even more eerie .
David Kopel puts it succinctly :
" The militarization of law enforcement has created the equivalent of a standing army engaged against the American people — precisely what was feared by the Framers .
The consequences have been just what the Framers expected from a standing army involved in domestic law enforcement ( especially enforcement of laws against the possession of certain commodities ) : the erosion of the Bill of Rights , particularly the Fourth Amendment ’s protection against unreasonable searches , and the deaths of innocent people . "
I think that police as a government entity are prone to corruption and abuse in a fashion that leads to disastrous results for free men .
The FLEA phenomenon has been emblematic of the rights - destroying enterprise that is now permeating the entire " criminal justice " complex in America .
The thin blue line is a clear and present danger now .
Police brutality is ubiquitous and not as uncommon as most think .
I read a great little small circulation magazine , The Match , by Fred Woodworth out of Tucson , AZ in which he publishes a column called " Who the Police Beat . "
I have seen plenty of rough life in my time but I always have to pause after a few paragraphs after reading story after story of naked overreaction by the boys in blue across the country and wonder how can this happen here and not be common knowledge .
Look here , here , and here .
Take a gander at these videos , I do wish more cops would suffer the self - immolation shown in the last video .
America has the largest incarceration rate on planet earth with 2.2 million behind bars .
This counts the housed population and not the parolee , newly released or house arrest numbers .
The FEDGOD houses almost ten percent of this number .
The Federal jurisdictional problem and supremacy in the entire legal arena is another discussion altogether .
The percentage of victimless crimes being immense .
" Roughly half the arrests and court cases in the U.S. each year involve consensual crimes .
More than 350,000 people are in jail right now because of something they did — something that did not physically harm another ’s person or property .
In addition , more than 1.5 million people are on parole or probation for consensual crimes .
And more than 4 million people are arrested each year for doing something that hurts no one except , potentially , themselves . "
What are some of these crimes that merit incarceration :
" Who are these 2.2 million people ?
Among them are Elisa Kelly and George Robinson , sentenced to 27 months in prison for hosting a drinking party for their son ’s nine friends in their own home .
There ’s Jessica Hall , sentenced to 24 months for throwing a cup of McDonald ’s coffee at a car that cut her off .
And then there are the hundreds of thousands of people imprisoned for nonviolent drug crimes .
As these examples suggest , and the JFA report demonstrates with statistical evidence , the primary reason for overcrowded prisons is not an explosion of crime , but an explosion of prison sentences .
Not only are these sentences many times the length of those for equivalent crimes in other industrialized nations , they are “ significantly longer than they were in earlier periods in our penal history . ”
The result is greater expense for less effect , as is testified by rates of recidivism and crime alike .
The JFA Institute argues that its recommendations would save the U.S. taxpayer $ 20 billion a year and , eventually , reduce prison rolls by half .
Certainly , they represent the real reforms that California and America as a whole need : reducing sentences , eliminating the use of prison for parole violators , reducing parole and probation supervision periods and , most importantly , decriminalizing victimless crimes , particularly those related to drug use and abuse . "
Good luck in protecting yourself from what have become gang organizations in their own right .
Paul Craig Roberts spoke to wronged innocents and their inability to defend themselves in an earlier essay on LRC :
" The law makes it impossible for Americans to defend themselves from police brutality .
Law and order conservatives have made it a felony with a long prison sentence to “ assault a police officer . ”
Assaulting a police officer means that if a police thug intends to beat your brains out with his nightstick and you disarm your assailant , you have “ assaulted a police officer . ”
If you are not shot on the spot by his backup , you will be convicted by a “ law and order ” jury and sent to prison . "
It almost appears as if a cop ’s primary task today is to select various and sundry candidates to escort into the American penal system .
In essence , statist concierges forever destroying vast swaths of individual lives and their associated networks of friends and family ; a maw through which humans pass but are rendered unrecoverable by civilized standards after a few years inside .
I think the confluence of the police industry and the massive ( and illegitimate ) expansion of criminal statutes nationwide has given a vicious inertia to the problem .
I am even hard - pressed to think of a good reason to keep police on the streets .
Cops are basically historians who come to a crime scene after the fact .
Their entire charter has changed from being peace officers to becoming law enforcers ( no matter how silly ) .
Has anyone else been irritated by the changing nature of police cruisers ?
Usually festooned with light bars and clear identification , the new trend has been stealth police cars with hidden lights and antennae .
Why ?
Most likely to more readily stop speeders or other non-crimes for which the revenue streams are so lucrative .
Imagine , for instance , if a state instructed all highway patrol organizations to stop speeders but only insurance points would be assigned with no fines imposed .
The vehicle stops for speeding would dry up because the remuneration incentives would evaporate .
This is not about safety , it is about revenue .
" Research conducted by the Florida Department of Transportation showed that the percentage of accidents actually caused by speeding is very low , 2.2 percent . "
One of the most frightening implications of all this is that the continuous shaping , conditioning and consequent cowing of Americans will lead to the seamless transition to a full - blown police state ( we ’re close ) .
I can think of a number of possible solutions to include the reduction and disarming of all FLEAs .
In an America more anchored to the Founding roots , FLEA visits would be few and far between because state ’s business would be the preemption at the border .
The few FLEA visits that did occur could be escorted if necessary by armed local constabulary .
L. Neil Smith , in one of his brilliant novels , even envisioned reflagging the mission of the US Marshals as the sole armed FLEA whose charter was riding herd on FLEA misbehavior .
I can even envision the elimination of all police jobs excepting detectives who would be greatly curtailed in the level of violence they could visit on the population .
A further step would be the total privatization of the provision of " law enforcement . "
The elimination of all Federal gun laws to include the 1934 NFA , 1968 GCA and every federal gun law on the books would make the country and the states much safer .
I am wide open to new ideas because the current regime is awful and will only get worse .
I do take solace in the observation that every time a united States subject is stopped by the cops today , all visions of Officer Friendly are soundly defeated and they discover that the police are far more concerned about obedience than criminality .
I have no beef with cops per se , I simply do n’t need them .
The Best of William Buppert
Poor Barack .
His whole presidency rests on getting this bailout thing right .
If he does , he ’ll be a hero .
If he does n’t , the economy will go into a Japan - like slump and he ’ll spend his entire time in office dealing with people looking for handouts — zombie banks , comatose corporations , and desperate households .
Tim Geithner unveiled his new bank resuscitation machinery on Tuesday .
He said it cost $ 2 trillion .
Investors looked on and saw the same old second - hand , worn - out rescue equipment the Bush team had used .
The key tool is a pump that injects money into the banks , in the hope that if the bankers have a little more change lying around , they ’ll be emboldened to lend it to someone .
But the banks are n’t going to lend and neither is anyone else as long as the value of the collateral is a ) falling and / or b ) unknown .
This is a panic at least that ’s what it would have been called until 1929 .
News this morning is that US lawmakers agree on $ 789 billion stimulus plan ,  according to Bloomberg .
But that does n’t seem to have reassured investors very much .
It ’s a panic because people fear that the money they sent out to work for them may not be coming home again .
As soon as the panic hit , they immediately got on the phone and tried to find it trace its footsteps wondering worrying .
Much of it will never come home .
And even when it does make it home , it comes in the door with its clothes torn and bruises on its face .
 What happened to you ?  the owners ask .
 Credit meltdown ,  it replies .
 Everyone ’s getting beaten up .
Naturally , the owners do n’t want to send out any more of their cash until things settle down .
When will that be ?
When debt is down to a more tolerable level .
That means one of two things : either debt goes down or incomes go up .
This is a depression , not a recession ( we know you are getting tired of hearing it ; but it ’s an important distinction ) .
Private debt rose from only about 2 % of disposable income in 1945 to about 15 % in 2006 .
That huge , long trend has come to an end .
People realize that went too far .
They have n’t enough income or collateral to support that kind of debt .
What ’s more , incomes are falling and so is the value of the collateral .
This puts almost all businesses in danger and millions of households too .
And it threatens all credits that depended on incomes and collateral at boom - time levels too — almost the last five years ’ worth of loans , private equity buyouts , house sales , credit card debt , home equity lines , stock prices , property prices — you name it .
Smart money .
Dumb money .
All kinds of money .
Like those geniuses who bought Sam Zell ’s real estate empire at the top of the market .
Practically every one of them is now in trouble .
Rents are down — not enough to cover the operating costs and debt service .
And what about Sam himself ?
He put a big chunk of his money into publishing .
And now his flagship newspapers are going broke too .
Ad revenue is down and shows no sign of recovering — ever .
The problem in a panic is that no one is quite sure who ’s solvent and who is n’t .
Can GM survive ?
Starbucks ?
The LA Times ?
The local mall ?
The family next door ?
No one knows .
So , few lenders or investors are eager to let their money out of the house .
What should be done ?
So glad you asked :
The cure for a depression is a depression .
The situation wo n’t return to normal until this crisis has been able to do its work and this period of price discovery has been allowed to follow its course .
Back in the ’90s , when Americans still believed in capitalism , they sent a steady stream of advisors and kibitzers to Japan .
The world ’s second largest economy was in a stall and seemed in no hurry to get out of it .
Its largest banks were zombies ,  said the Americans ; they were propped up by the Japanese government in order to avoid losses and embarrassment .
If the Japanese wanted to get things moving again they should let those banks fail let the free market do its work let the chips fall where they may .
Then , capitalists , entrepreneurs and scrappy businessmen could pick them up and build with them .
The Japanese did n’t take the advice .
To this day , 19 years after the beginning of Japan ’s long , soft , on - again , off - again depression , the economy is still in a slump and expecting negative growth again this year .
All together , Japanese investors are said to have lost a sum equal to 300 % of the nation ’s annual GDP the equivalent to a loss of about $ 45 trillion in the United States .
Years ago , we predicted — in these daily reckonings — that when the crisis came in the United States , Americans would n’t take their own advice .
Alas , we were right .
Instead , they are keeping the zombies alive , just like the Japanese did .
And the zombies are sucking the blood out of the economy .
And poor Barack .
Our guess is that Paul Volker has spelled the nuts and bolts of the situation out for him .
But Obama , surrounded by a fluff of advisors with their dog-eared copies of Keynes ’ General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money , does n’t know who to believe or who to trust .
So , he goes with the flow .
It would take a strong man , with strong convictions about economics to resist a gaggle of Ph.D. economists and experts telling him that he risks " catastrophe " if he does n’t act quickly .
Poor Barack may be a decent fellow but he is a decent fellow in a bad trade .
He does n’t know it , but the flow leads nowhere .
The bankers got our sympathy this week .
" Tramps and thieves , " is what everyone says of them .
" Stupid banker " is said to be redundant .
 Do you have a different moral compass ?  asked John Mann , member of Parliament , of Sir Fred Goodwin , recently retired from banking .
It was a low question .
 Different to what ?
Sir Fred should have answered .
But there was no fight in any of them .
The poor bankers are playing along , of course .
They ’re apologizing to politicians for all the harm they ’ve done .
" Yes , we wrecked Western civilization , but we ’ve said were sorry , all right ?
Now , can we have the money ? "
The banks are essential to our economy ; at least , that ’s what everyone says .
So the politicians are giving them money — as much as $ 2 trillion more , according to the Geithner plan — so they ’ll stay in business .
 Son of TARP ,  the Financial Times calls it .
Why do the banks need money ?
Because they do n’t have any .
If you add up their assets and subtract their liabilities , you end up with a hole .
Maybe that hole is only $ 200 billion deep .
Maybe it is trillions deep .
Nobody really knows .
But nobody seems to want to find out , either .
At this stage in a financial crisis , the markets should be doing some serious price discovery .
Values have been put in doubt .
Everyone wants to know what things are worth before they lend , invest or buy .
But instead of allowing the price system to work , the feds are on the case jiggling one price squeezing another propping up one zombie company running an extension cord out from the Fed to a local bank so it can keep the lights on .
" Son of TARP " ?
Wait a minute .
What did original TARP produce ?
We recall its inventor Hank Paulson promising that it would be a good deal for the taxpayer .
He was buying bank assets at such low prices the taxpayers were going to make a profit , remember that ?
We got a laugh out of it then .
Now we get another laugh .
Comes word last week from the Congressional Oversight Panel that assets bought by TARP are now worth $ 78 billion less than they paid for them .
Joblessness
For every company that is adding to payrolls , three are cutting them .
In manufacturing , according to David Rosenberg of Merrill Lynch , there are 14 people laid off for every one that is hired .
And a total of 3.6 million people have lost their jobs since Dec. ’07 half of them in the last three months .
Smoot & Hawley are back in business all over the world .
Smoot was spotted in France early this week , when Sarkozy gave its automakers $ 12 billion but on condition they shut their plants in other countries , not in France .
Then , the U.S. trade deficit fell to its lowest level in six years — reflecting Americans ’ inability to continue living in the style to which they had become accustomed .
Meanwhile , at the other end of the shipping lane , China ’s exports plunged 17.5 % in January .
And now Mr. Hawley is writing from Alaska , asking federal regulators to kick Virgin America out of its airspace .
Alaska Airlines says Virgin has no right to fly in the United States because it is not a U.S. - owned company .
Unemployment in the United States is pushing 8 % .
But that ’s nothing ; in Zimbabwe it ’s said to be 94 % .
If that ’s true , practically no one is working .
Must be more to the story .
What about all the people who are preparing Robert Mugabe ’s 85th birthday bash ?
He ’s ordered 2000 bottles of Moet & Chandon champagne 8,000 lobsters 500 bottles of Johnny Walker whiskey 3,000 ducks .
Hey , why not ?
Have a little fun .
Someone has to have a little fun in Zimbabwe .
The rest of the population is starving or so it says in the paper .
Gold is sparkling maybe too much .
 Bullion sales hit record in rush to safety ,  says a headline from Tuesday ’s Financial Times :
 Investors are buying record amounts of gold bars and coins , shunning risky assets for the relative safety of bullion amid renewed fears about the health of the global financial system . 
Health of the global financial system ?
Do n’t worry about it ; that system is dying .
And word is beginning to get out .
There ’s no other reason for them to be buying gold .
Oil is going down .
Deflation is taking hold .
Jewelry sales are off .
Why would anyone want gold ?
Only if they thought the system was in trouble .
They fear there may be more bubbles more blow - ups and more panic .
But when the dust clears , the last things still standing will be gold .
The U.S. Mint , for example sold 92,000 ounces of its American Eagle coins last month .
That ’s four times as much as it sold a year ago and more than it sold in the whole first half of 2008 .
It bothers us contrarians — a bit .
We do n’t like to see a crowd gathered around admiring our favorite refuge .
Still , the crowds are pretty thin , compared to what they will be when the bull market in gold really takes over .
Then , your neighbors will be talking about gold and telling you how much money they made in gold .
That ’s still ahead when gold goes over $ 1,000 over $ 1,500 over $ 2,000 .
Everyone ought to own gold coins .
Few people do .
Most people never even think about it .
Sure , some people are talking about the yellow metal .
People are buying coins in record quantities .
But gold is still regarded as a little kooky a little marginal .
What is interesting now is the movement in the gold shares ; they ’re going up .
And this week , we got a recommendation for a gold share from colleague Chris Mayer .
We liked the idea so much , we bought some of the stock for the children ’s account .
Probably not too much downside in the stock , we reasoned .
And if the price of gold goes above $ 1,000 again , this share could really fly .
 The economics of gold stocks have never looked better to me ,  writes Chris .
 Gold trades for around $ 900 an ounce and the average cost to produce it is around $ 450 an ounce or so .
You do n’t have to know much about economics to know that ’s a nice combination . 
Chris continues ,  A gold stock you can warm up to even if you do n’t think gold will go to the moon .
And it has one of the stronger balance sheets in the business .
Shares go for just under $ 7 per share as I write .
They are worth nearly twice the price at current gold prices trades at 7 times cash flow should trade for at least $ 12 per share . 

The Best of Bill Bonner
WASHINGTON , Feb. 16 , 2009  --
There 's been no shortage of outrage in Congress about CEOs and their corporate jets , but members of Congress know something about luxury travel , too .
Congressmen regularly travel the world on the taxpayers ' dime -- as members of so - called congressional delegations , or " CoDels . "
A bipartisan group of members of Congress and their spouses went on an official trip to Europe this week , traveling through Brussels , Vienna , Paris -- where they spent Valentine 's Day -- and the Bavarian Alps .
As is the case with almost all of these congressional trips , they were able to avoid annoying airport lines , frustrating flight delays and baggage nightmares , because they were flown at no cost to them by the Air Force .
Commercial airfare for a comparable trip across Europe would cost roughly $ 10,000 per person .
A good deal on a private charter flight for a trip like this would be at least $ 200,000 .
ABC News caught up with Rep. John Tanner , D - Tenn. , who is leading the delegation , shortly before he left for the trip .
Tanner strongly defended the group 's travels , saying he has important meetings at each stop and the trip is part of a greater effort to improve relations with Europe .
" I will give you our schedule .
There is not a lot of downtime in our schedule , I can tell you that , " he said .
" We are going to Brussels .
That is where NATO headquarters are .
We are going to Vienna because I as NATO president am speaking to the OSCE , another organization we are trying to build a relationship with to help us in the war on terrorism . "
Tanner led another delegation on a similar trip in November for NATO and other meetings in Rome and Florence , Italy , and Valencia , Spain .
" We need to build relationships , " Tanner told ABC News .
" I would rather personally go home and see my grandchildren .
It takes a lot of time and effort to go over there during every break . "
Tanner also defended the practice of bringing spouses on the congressional trip .
" NATO parliamentarians in Europe have wives .
Our wives go to embassies in these countries we visit ... " he said .
" Whether it is going to schools , orphanages , libraries , whatever that is what our wives do ... there is no extra expense . "
Tanner is n't the only frequent flier in Congress .
Rep. Gary Ackerman , D - N.Y. , has taken four taxpayer - financed trips to nine countries over the past four years , despite criticizing corporate executives for flying on private jets to Washington and asking for taxpayer handouts .
" They had a political tin ear coming to Washington looking for a handout by flying three separate corporate jets , " he told ABC News .
" It just seemed kind of ridiculous for the mission they supposedly were on , pleading poverty . "
According to congressional records , over the past year , Ackerman has traveled on congressional trips to Iraq and Afghanistan -- but to more exotic destinations as well , including Italy , Slovenia and England .
Congressional records show that in February 2008 , Ackerman took a three - day trip to England , flying first class on a commercial flight for $ 14,000 .
Ackerman told ABC News that he " represented the United States Congress " during his trip .
When asked about spending $ 14,000 on the flight , the congressman said , " Whatever the airline costs -- I do n't book the flights .
This is not what you are trying to make it look like -- living the romantic , posh life of luxury . "
The cost of military travel is a tightly guarded secret .
Congress and the Pentagon would not comment on the cost of congressional travel , but it is many times more expensive than flying commercial .
The congressional record lists pages upon pages of trips , including one taken by eight congressmen and three staffers to Australia , New Zealand and Antarctica .
No one would comment on the cost of the air travel , but a private charter plane on a trip like that would cost approximately $ 500,000 .
Members of Congress may say it 's a trip to foster relationships , but it's also a great photo and a once - in - a - lifetime experience -- paid for with taxpayer money .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Surgeons have replaced 80 percent of a woman ’s face , transplanting bone , teeth , muscle and nerve in the first such operation in the United States .
They said the woman suffered severe trauma that cost her an eye , much of her nose and her upper jaw and left her unable to breathe , smell , taste or smile properly .
“ You need a face to face the world , ” Dr. Maria Siemionow , director of plastic surgery research at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio , where the operation was performed , told a news conference on Wednesday .
The clinic gave no details about the woman , how she was injured , or who the donor was .
The operation is the fourth done globally .
French surgeons replaced much of the face of a woman in 2005 after she was disfigured in an attack by her dog .
Last year , her doctors reported that she recovered slowly and steadily , overcoming two episodes of rejection .
In 2006 , Chinese doctors performed a face transplant on a 30 - year - old mauled by a bear , and a French team did a transplant in 2007 on a 29 - year - old man who suffered from von Recklinghausen disease , which deforms the face .
The U.S. operation , which was performed two weeks ago , took 22 hours .
A team of eight specialists transplanted bone , muscle , blood vessels and nerves .
Slideshow ( 10 images )
“ We transferred the skin , all the facial muscles in the upper face and mid-face , the upper lip , all of the nose , most of the sinuses around the nose , the upper jaw including the teeth , the facial nerve , ” said Francis Papay , chair of dermatology and plastic surgery at the clinic .
“ Our hopes are ... that she will be able to smile again . ”
Some controversy has surrounded the issue of face transplants , in part because face injuries are not seen as life - threatening .
In this case , the doctors said , the patient had virtually no life because of her injury .
“ We know that there are so many patients there in their homes where they are hiding from society because they are afraid to walk to the grocery stores , they are afraid to go the the street , ” Siemionow said .
“ Our patient was called names and was humiliated . ”
“ We very much hope that for this very special group of patients there is a hope that someday they will be able to go comfortably from their houses and enjoy the things we take for granted . ”
Dr. Eric Kodish , a bioethicist , said a team of experts , called an institutional review board , approved the operation .
“ This is not a cosmetic surgery in any ... sense .
The face is the embodiment of personal identity , ” Kodish told the news conference .
“ A person who has sustained trauma or other devastation to the face is generally isolated and suffers tremendously , ” Kodish added .
“ We have hope that our patient will begin to smile again , will be able to smell again . ”
The patient will take immune - suppressing drugs and may have to fight rejection , the doctors noted , like any other transplant patient .
The New Windows Experience Index ( WinEI )
Although Microsoft has consistently asserted in public that Windows 7 will probably only be launched in 2010 , the truth is they are rushing for a December 2009 release .
Here are more signs of how close they are to completion .
We recently obtained documents detailing the in - depth details of the new Windows Experience Index ( WinEI ) scoring model which will be used in Windows 7 .
The documents reveal interesting details of how Microsoft grades the performance of hardware and what has changed in the new Experience Index for Windows 7 .
It is especially interesting to see what they consider " good enough " performance for Windows 7 .
Microsoft closed the feedback period for this scoring model on February 16 , so unless there are significant opposition from their OEM partners , this would be the final scoring model for hardware in Windows 7 .
Let 's take a look at the details of the improved Windows Experience Index !
What Is The Windows Experience Index ?
The new Windows Experience Index ( WinEI ) scoring model for Windows 7 adds or updates the following :
New scoring levels 6 and 7 .
The maximum score is now 7.9 .
The maximum score is now .
DX10 graphics tests .
Storage performance tests based on random I/O and the write - flush policy tests which measure performance using a mix of reads and writes .
These tests are in addition to the existing sequential read test .
which measure performance using a mix of reads and writes .
These tests are in addition to the existing sequential read test .
A new disk scoring limit ( “ cap ” ) for storage scores based on the results of the write - flush policy tests
( “ cap ” ) for storage scores based on the results of the write - flush policy tests Addition of single - threaded CPU performance tests .
. Improvements in robustness .
Enables the DWM test to be run independently of the other WinSAT tests .
Moves non-DWM tests to run post - OOBE ( at idle , well after the user ’s initial “ out - of - the - box experience ” ) , thereby speeding up OOBE .

IBM Predicts Solar Sidewalks in 5 Years
December 2nd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
According to IBM ’s annual “ Next Five in Five ” report , thin - film solar cells will be embedded in driveways , sidewalks , paint , rooftop , and windows within 5 years .
The prediction is based on an expected drop in the price of thin - film solar cells , which are 100 times thinner than silicon solar cells .
Thin - film solar cells are already cheaper than silicon - wafer cells because of a production process that allows them to be printed and arranged on any flexible backing , including cell - phones , notebook computers , and clothing .
Other IBM predictions include digital shopping assistants , personalized genetic maps , and advances in voice recognition software .

【 Top10 】さら ばDLL地獄、純関数型OS 「 NixOS 」
先週の ＠IT NewsInsightのアクセスランキングの第1位は「2009年はトレンドを追うな――小飼弾氏が講演」だった。未曾有の経済不振の渦中にあっては、目先のトレンドを追うよりも、じっくり腰を落ち着けて“確立された知恵”を学ぼうという主張には、多くの技術者がうなづいたかもしれない。
2位となった記事、「 Linuxに勝てなかっ たPlan 9」は、十分に良い既存技術を、新規の技術で置き換えることは、たとえそれがより洗練されていたとしても難しいということを指摘したものだった。すでに広く普及していて使われているLinuxを置き換えるほどには、Plan 9がもたらすメリットは十分に大きくなかった。
この言及に対して、その名もずばり「 Plan9日記」を公開しているoraccha氏から貴重なご指摘をいただいた。該当段落を引用すると、
また、研究OSってそんなもんだよという思いもある。Linuxという下位レイヤを維持するために、日々膨大な人的／知的リソースが投入されているわけだけど、Plan9のような少数精鋭による思考実験も、新しい進化のためには必要だ。その成果が新しい燃料として、実用OS（Linux）に投下されると。
という指摘だ。新しいアイデアを実際に動く実装で試すために研究OSというのは必要で、それは実用OSと分けて考えたほうがいいのではないかということだと思う。そう考えると、Plan 9は失敗というより、むしろ、数多くの論文にネタを提供し、しかもLinuxやBSD系UNIXにアイデアが取り込まれた成功事例ということもできるかもしれない。
ただ、それにしても相対的に言えば、基盤技術の研究開発の重心は上位レイヤへと動いている気がする。Plan 9開発チームにいたロブ・パイクやケン・トンプソンが、すでに現在、グーグルに移籍しているのは象徴的だ。ロブ・パイクは、グーグル社内でMapReduceを利用する際に使う言語「Sawzal」で論文を書いたりもしている。分散OSよりも、クラウド上の分散コンピューティングを研究することのほうが市場的な意味も大きいだろう。
いずれにしても、この視点でいえば、インターネットとNGNを対比させるのは間違いだった。NGNは実験の場などではなく、実用を目指したものだからだ。
NixOS は2009 年 のPlan 9 か？
oraccha氏は 、 「 2009 年 のPlan9」がいろいろ出てくるのを期待すると書いているが、実験的試みという意味では同感だ。最近、私は2つのOSが気になっている。これらを研究OSと呼ぶべきかどうか分からないが、とても実用レベルで普及しそうには思えないもので、少なくとも研究目的の実装という感があることは間違いない。
1つ は「 Zero Install 」 だ。Linux やMac OS Xなどを対象にしているので、これはOSというよりもアプリケーションのインストール・配布システムと呼ぶべきかもしれない。現在、Zero Installは、これらのOSが共通に抱える課題を解決することを目指している。Zero Installは、その名が示すとおり、アプリケーションのインストールという概念自体をひっくり返したようなシステムだ。例えばシステム管理権限（root）がなくても、一般ユーザーはアプリケーションを導入できる。また、初回起動時にネットワークからバイナリパッケージを持ってくるが、それはローカルのストレージから読み込むのと本質的に変わらない。Zero Installでは、このほか中央集権的なアプリケーション配布レポジトリを排して、誰でも自分のWebサイトでアプリケーションを公開できる仕組みもある。ほかのユーザーがこのアプリケーションを利用するにはURLを引数にしてコマンドを叩くか、それに相当するメニューをクリックする。ソフトウェアは必ず電子署名が施されている。ほかにも、アプリケーションの自動アップデートや、コンフリクトが起こらない設計、事前に安全確認ができるサンドボクシング、同一アプリケーションの複数バージョンの共存、など目が覚めるような機能が盛りだくさんだ（各種パッケージング方式の機能比較リスト）。
メジャー なLinuxディストリビューションで、Zero Installを採用したものはないが、部分的にでも、そのアイデアを取り入れてくれればと思うことがある。既存のパッケージシステムと共存する形で入れることも可能かもしれない。
も う1つ、最近私が気になっている実験的OSは“ 純関数型” を標榜する「 NixOS」だ。これもLinux上に構築したシステムで、本来の意味でのOSとは違うのだが、ユーザーが利用するシステムが抱えている課題を解決しようとしているという意味ではOSと呼んでもいいと思う。NixOSの公式ページには純関数型ディストリビューションと書いてある。
容易に想像できる通り（？）、関数型ディストリビューションのNixOSでは、多くの操作が破壊的ではない……、のだという。設定ファイルの変更はNixエクスプレッションというものを使って行い、これは既存の設定ファイルを上書きするものではない。Nixエクスプレッションを連ねていくことで設定ファイルを生成し、そのシンボリックリンクだけを/etcの下に置いておくという。だからNixエクスプレションの組み合わせを変えるだけで、任意のバージョンにロールバックできるし、ちょっとした変更テストの操作も確実に行える。これは起動関連の設定情報に関しても同様だ。
Windows で もLinuxでもライブラリのバージョンの衝突や非互換によって、多くの不具合が起こる。WindowsではDLL地獄と呼ばれている。ある特定バージョンのDLL（共有ライブラリ）を想定したアプリケーションが、他のアプリケーションのインストール時に行われる当該DLLのバージョンアップ（上書き）によって動作が不安定になり得る。
Linuxではバージョンの違うライブラリのファイル名には番号が付いていることが多いため多少はマシだが、それでも困ることが多い。Debian GNU / Linux やUbuntuはパッケージ間の依存関係を考慮してくれるので、ほとんどの場合、インストールもアンインストールもクリーンに行える。しかし、2つのアプリケーションが、あるライブラリの異なる2つのバージョンを要求している場合など、本質的に解決が難しい問題もある。
ガベージ・コレクタも備えたパッケージ管理システム
NixOSのパッケージ管理システムでは、こうしたパッケージ間依存に付随して起こる問題を、一気に、エレガントに解決しているように私には見える。パッケージをインストールすると実体は「/nix/store」の下に入る。このとき、サブディレクトリ名には、そのパッケージやソフトウェア、ライブラリの名前、バージョン番号だけではなく、依存関係の情報を含むハッシュ値が含まれる。バージョンの違いだけであっても、異なるパッケージは異なるディレクトリに入る。つまり、バージョンの異なるアプリケーションやライブラリの共存が可能で、パッケージのロールバックも依存関係の矛盾や衝突の心配なく行えるというわけだ。ライブラリなどのパッケージを削除しても、すぐには実体が消えずにシステムに残る。本当にハードディスク上から消えるのは、ほかのパッケージから参照されていないことを“ガベージ・コレクタ”が確認してからだ。ガベージ・コレクタは概念上の存在やシステム内部の奥深くにあるものではなく「nix-collect-garbage」というコマンドだ。
例えば 、Firefoxのバージョン2系と3系、あるいはGIMPの2.4系と2.6系などを共存させるためには、これまで何らかの工夫が必要だったが、こうしたものを、矛盾やムダを省いた形で共存できる。異バージョン間で共通して参照しているパッケージがあれば、それはシステム上でも1つ。逆に異バージョン間で同一ライブラリを使っているものの、依存しているライブラリのバージョンが違っていれば、それは異なるディレクトリに収まっている。Firefox 2だけを削除してFirefox 3を残すと 、Firefox 2だけが使っていたライブラリはいずれガベージ・コレクタに回収される。実行形式に付けるリンク名はどうしても衝突するかもしれないが、それは比較的小さな問題だろう。
実用になるかどうかは別として、NixOSは面白い。パッケージ管理システムやOS全体に対して、関数型プログラミング言語の概念を適用すると、こうもスッキリ多くの課題が解決するのかとうなってしまう。パッケージ管理が抱えている依存地獄という問題は、名前が指し示している実体がどこかで誰かに変更されてしまう可能性を排除できないから起こるわけで、いったん名前を付けたら、その名前が必ずバイナリレベルで同じ実体を指すようにしましょう、ということだと思う。
ずいぶん長々と書いてしまったが、2002年頃にPlan 9にワクワクしたように、2009年のいま、私はZero InstallやNixOSにワクワクしてしまう。そのエッセンスだけでもメジャーなLinuxディストリビューションに取り込まれればと思う。こうした意味では、私も2009年のPlan 9をもっとたくさん見てみたいと願う1人だ。そして最後にもう1度同じ論点に戻ると、そうした新しい試みの多くは、カーネル空間で動く何かではないと私には思えるのだが、どうだろうか。Amoeba、Spring、GNU/Hurd、Plan 9といろいろあったが、分散OSの研究・開発というパーティーは終わってしまった。今はLinuxベースのクラウド上で連日、にぎやかなパーティーが開かれているように思う。

DNA left at crime scene could be used to create picture of criminal 's FACE , say scientists
Analysis of DNA left at several crime scenes helped identify serial killer Derek Todd Lee
Forensic experts will soon be able to reconstruct facial features and skin just by reading DNA , U.S. scientists said .
' Forensic molecular photofitting ' maps the genes that are linked to skin pigmentation and facial structure which means a person 's face could emerge from the analysis , Dr Mark Shriver from Pennsylvania State University said .
The process has already been used to help identify and convict serial killer Derek Todd Lee who murdered seven women in Louisiana .
Witness statements said the offender was white but genetic testing of DNA at the crime scenes showed he was African American - which helped lead to his arrest .
He was convicted in 2004 .
Dr Shriver said he has now linked DNA that mark a person 's ethnic origin with the gene mix of fixed points on the face , e.g. corners of the mouth and tip of the nose .
This allows the computer to build up an image of a face based on the gene mix found in the DNA .
Speaking to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Chicago at the weekend , Dr Shriver said ' maybe 500 facial markers and 500 ancestry markers ' would be enough to build an accurate and complete face .
Sometimes I worry that I ’ve run out of new things to blog about , but then out of the blue up pops something that proves me wrong .
I recently received an email from Joanne Nova , who writes a blog where she claims global warming is n’t caused by human created greenhouse gas emissions .
In her first email to me she wrote “ there is no empirical evidence left that supports the theory that man made CO2 makes much difference to the climate . ”
Note , “ no empirical evidence ” , not “ I disagree with the evidence ” , or “ there is contrary evidence ” – but there is no evidence .
None !
She emailed me to ask why I had come to a different conclusion from her .
Why do I accept global warming science as being true ?
Well , it ’s partly because I followed the many claims of the global warming “ skeptics , ” and although their arguments had been debunked numerous times by experts ( for example , read RealClimate ’s Responses to common contrarian arguments ) , the so - called skeptics kept repeating the already debunked arguments .
After a while you just start thinking , “ but that ’s been explained already , ” and stop taking those people seriously .
So that would be my initial reason .
But the other main reason would have been the thousands of articles published every year in peer reviewed scientific journals , virtually all of them supporting the anthropogenic global warming ( AGW ) hypothesis .
And it ’s also because of the denier tactics employed by the “ skeptics ” .
( More on this later . )
Nova writes back that this is argument from authority , and that it ’s intellectually lazy to argue this way .
Well , I disagree .
Argument From Authority
It is n’t necessarily fallacious to consider that thousands of climate scientists writing in peer reviewed journals might know more than you do about such a complex subject .
Of course , this one is a little tricky for newbies , and I ’m sure I got it wrong myself initially .
Nizkor is one of the many sites that tries to explain it :
… a person who is a legitimate expert is more likely to be right than wrong when making considered claims within her area of expertise .
In a sense , the claim is being accepted because it is reasonable to believe that the expert has tested the claim and found it to be reliable .
So , if the expert has found it to be reliable , then it is reasonable to accept it as being true .
What we have here is trust in the scientific method .
And we trust it because we have reason to believe it works – just look around you .
( You ’re reading this on a computer are n’t you ? )
And on a blog that promotes science and the scientific method , I ’d have to be pretty perverse , or have a very good reason , to oppose thousands of peer reviewed scientific papers .
Note that what we should have is trust in science .
This is not the same as faith , which is what Nova claimed I have .
Faith is belief without evidence , while trust is acceptance of something based on what we have experienced before – ie what has worked and what has been right .
In other words , trust of the scientific method is based on evidence that it works .
Claiming that trust and faith are the same thing is the fallacy of equivocation that I have written about before .
The fallacy is to use the same word in different meanings in an argument , implying that the word means the same each time .
Implying that trust is the same as faith is actually the classic example I gave two years ago to explain the fallacy .
Hilariously , Nova responded to this point with dictionary definitions of trust , that I think were supposed to show that trust can be defined in the same way as faith .
But duh , that ’s the point .
They can be defined in the same way .
But they can also be defined differently .
And employing these ambiguous definitions s how they can be used to make a fallacious argument .
Just because a dictionary gives definitions of the two words , and some of the definitions are similar , that does n’t mean that trust in the scientific method is the same as faith .
Nova even debunked her own point by writing “ Planes do n't fly on " trust " .
They fly on physics . ”
Yes .
But I do n’t need to understand the physics to get on a plane .
I get on a plane because I trust that planes fly – and that trust is based on what we see in the real world ( all those planes in the sky ) not on faith .
Of course , trusting experts is n’t the same as Michael Egnor listing dead philosophers and scientists who he claims agreed with his views on Dualism .
Science has moved on since the days of Galileo and Newton , and who knows what they might think now ?
It also is n’t the same as a certain commenter we all remember suggesting that since he studied plant breeding 30 years ago , his arguments on genetic engineering must be correct and everyone else ’s wrong now .
Those were fallacious appeals to authority because the people quoted were not necessarily experts .
That would be the actual argument from authority fallacy .
It ’s not intellectually lazy either to accept the majority peer reviewed science on a topic in which I ’m not an expert .
I do n’t have any obligation to research and become an expert on every subject under the sun to determine whether to accept or reject a claim ; I ’ll study in detail only the subjects I feel an interest or a need to study , and no more .
So sometimes I will rely on experts .
Of course , relying on experts is weaker than understanding the evidence in detail , no one would deny that .
And this would be a problem if I were writing a blog on global warming , or even writing posts on the details of global warming .
But I ’m not .
Nova replies that in that case , I should n’t refer to the AGW “ Skeptics ” as “ deniers . ”
Again , I disagree .
I refer to them as deniers because they also rely on denier tactics .
Denier Tactics
As I said , one reason I gave up with the global warming ( so called ) skeptics , was because of the denier tactics they clearly relied on .
Here I think it would be useful to refer to Denialism Blog and their explanation of What is Denialism , because why reinvent the wheel ?
They talk about five general tactics used by denialists , namely :
Conspiracy Selectivity ( cherry - picking )
Fake experts Impossible expectations ( also known as moving goalposts ) General fallacies of logic .
I would add a sixth , namely continuing to repeat arguments long after they have been debunked .
Climate denialists like Nova rely on many of these techniques , as I will show using this email exchange and her own web page .
Selectivity ( Cherry Picking )
Denialism Blog explains Selectivity ( Cherry Picking ) :
Denialists tend to cite single papers supporting their idea
Bingo .
Nova claimed AGW had been “ falsified ” by David Evans ’s The Missing Greenhouse Signature paper ( which is not a peer reviewed paper as far as I can tell , despite what Nova claimed ) .
This paper starts with :
Each possible cause of global warming has a different pattern of where in the planet the warming occurs first and the most .
The signature of an increased greenhouse effect is a hotspot about 10 km up in the atmosphere over the tropics .
Read the second sentence in that piece again .
It ’s presented as a fact that , if falsified , falsifies the whole of AGW .
The problem is , as far as I can tell , it ’s not true .
For example , Tim Lambert writes :
This could n't be more wrong .
Study the graphs below ( from RealClimate ) .
The left one shows the pattern predicted for doubling CO2 , while the right one shows the pattern for a 2 % increase in solar output .
Both patterns include a hot spot .
The difference between the two graphs is that the CO2 one shows cooling in the stratosphere , while the right one does not , so the " greenhouse signature " is stratospheric cooling .
And guess what , that 's what 's been happening .
Then there is Chris Colose at Climate Change :
Tropospheric warming in the tropics is a signature of greenhouse warming , but it is more accurate to say that it is not a unique signature ( i.e. , you get this “ hotspot ” with all types of forcings ) .
And :
It looks to me as though experts disagree with Evans .
Certainly few if any of them take seriously this unpublished and non peer reviewed essay .
Of course , experts can be wrong , but clearly this paper does not “ falsify ” AGW as Nova claimed .
The point is , Nova citing this paper as “ showing that the theory has been falsified ” is as clear an example of cherry picking as it is possible to make .
The idea that the whole of AGW – thousands of peer reviewed scientific papers and evidence – is falsified by this one article on a web site , is just absurd .
And a standard denialist / crank tactic .
Fake Experts
In Denialism Blog ’s section on Fake Experts , they state that :
[ real ] experts have experience in their field , and they can provide answers that are consistent with the state of knowledge in that field
And that :
… a fake expert is usually somebody who is relied upon for their credentials rather than any real experience in the field at issue , who will promote arguments that are inconsistent with the literature , are n't generally accepted by those who study the field in question , and / or whose theories are n't consistent with established epistemological requirements for scientific inquiry .
So who does Nova write about excitedly on her blog ?
John
Theon , who was supposedly James Hansen ’s supervisor at NASA but who now disagrees that global warming is man made .
Of course we know that Theon was n’t actually Hansen ’s “ boss ” , and that he retired from NASA in 1994 .
Theon seems like the archetypal fake expert – someone with credentials but who has n’t worked in the field for a long while – too long to be taken seriously over current experts to be sure .
Nova adopts standard denialist tactics by writing about this as though it is meaningful , just as she also appeals to this list of 650 supposed experts who dispute AGW , although we know this list is padded with TV weathermen , economists , non-climate experts , and a number who are actually not AGW “ skeptics ” anyway .
In fact 58 % of the " experts " quoted have no credentials in climate research and only 16 % have top - notch credentials .
Also see another debunking of this list .
Compare these 650 ( really less than 100 ) " skeptics " with the American Geophysical Union ( AGU ) which has 50,000 members , most of whom really are earth scientists .
Only a few dozen AGU members are on this latest denier list .
Again , standard denier techniques from Nova .
Impossible Expectations and Moving Goalposts
Denialism Blog defines Impossible expectations ( and moving goalposts ) as “ the use , by denialists , of the absence of complete and absolute knowledge of a subject to prevent implementation of sound policies , or acceptance of an idea or a theory . ”
And guess what , the example they give is of global warming deniers :
One finds that they harp endlessly about models , how much models suck , how you can't model anything , on and on and on .
True , models are hard , anything designed to prognosticate such a large set of variables as those involved in climate is going to be highly complex , and I 'll admit , I do n't understand them worth a damn .
Climate science in general is beyond me , and I read the papers in Science and Nature that come out , blink a few times , and then read the editors description to see why I should care .
But with or without models , which I do trust the scientists and peer - reviewers involved to test adequately , that does n't change the fact that actual measurement of global mean temperature is possible , and is showing an alarmingly steep increase post - industrialization .
I do n’t need to add much to that , except to state that ( unsurprisingly )
Nova does n’t believe climate models are empirical evidence .
Add the list of debunked AGW skeptic arguments that the AGW “ skeptics ” keep repeating , and you have quite a litany of denialism .
Cherry picking one non peer reviewed and unpublished paper that few if any climate scientists take seriously and claiming in all seriousness that it falsifies the whole of AGW .
Reporting on lists of “ skeptics ” as though this actually means anything .
Claiming models are n’t science .
Calling logical fallacies that are n’t while relying on them herself .
After this exchange I ’m even more convinced of the science behind AGW .
I describe the AGW skeptics as deniers because they employ denier tactics .
Employ denier tactics , you ’re a denier .
Evidence for AGW
Nova claims there is none .
For those interested , here is some .
The links are not direct to peer reviewed papers ( although there are links in some of the articles to peer reviewed work ) .
Obviously it ’s not comprehensive .
But it ’s a good place to start and you certainly can’t claim there is “ none . ”
Unless you ’re a denier .
RealClimate is a good place to start .
Also see their site index .
Coby on The Models are Unproven which includes a list of significant predictions of enhanced greenhouse gas warming that have been made and confirmed .
Also How to Talk to a Climate Sceptic which also explains denier tactics .
IPCC Fourth Assessment Report .
Note : the IPCC collates research published by scientists and institutions across the world – that ’s thousands of peer reviewed climate science papers .
Scientific opinion on climate change – an article that documents scientific opinion as given by synthesis reports , scientific bodies of national or international standing , and surveys of opinion among climate scientists .
Agreed it ’s a Wikipedia page , but there are 90 links to follow .

Recent cryoturbation has exposed plant roots on the edge of a peat plateau ( Photo courtesy Maija Repo )
It seems the Arctic is belching out nitrous oxide – commonly known as laughing gas .
Unfortunately , the punchline is that it is a powerful greenhouse gas .
Previously , emissions of N 2 O were thought to enter the atmosphere mainly from tropical forests and intensively managed farmland , with only a negligible amount from northerly environments .
Maija Repo and colleagues from the University of Kuopio , Finland , measured emissions from peat circles in northern Russia .
These sit on peatland plateaux , which are widespread throughout the Arctic , covering 20 % of the total land surface .
The bare surfaces of peat circles develop because cycles of freezing and thawing churn up the peat , preventing plant growth .

During the snow - free season , they found the peat circles emitted 1.2 grams / m2 of N 2 O , which is just as much as tropical forests release in a year .
The team reckons that a lack of plants decreases competition for the mineral nitrogen .
This allows nitrate to accumulate in the soil which is then metabolised by bacteria to produce N 2 O .
Although this means N 2 O remains a small contributor to the greenhouse effect , compared with methane and carbon dioxide , the gas persists unaltered in the atmosphere for over 110 years , compared with around 10 years for methane – which is also periodically released by the tundra .
Unfortunately , global warming may promote churning , and expand bare areas .
Since the flow of the gas from the peat circles is so high , even a small increase in bare surfaces would cause significant changes in N 2 O emissions , says Repo .

Glum faces are everywhere nowadays .
And why not ?
The media has very little by way of good news , usually some story about a woman in Palm Beach finding her prized Chihuahua still alive in the belly of a gator .
Nothing to make you sit back and say , " You know what ?
Things are okay . "
The talk around the water cooler , in the pews at church , and around the dinner table has turned decidedly negative .
Well , I met a man today who was actually excited about the recession .
He owns a landscaping business in Utah and sees this time as a chance to outpace his competition .
While they are tightening their budgets and cutting down on advertising , he is able to find better deals on advertising and increase his market presence .
When everyone else is frowning , Mr. Landscaping is grinning from ear to ear .
What 's the difference between Mr. Landscaping and the grumpy masses ?
He saved his money when times were good and put a little away for times like these .
He avoided taking on debt .
Now , when the best opportunities are presenting themselves , he is in a unique position to take advantage of them .
While not all of us were smart enough to save during the good times ( myself included ) , I think all of us can take a lesson from Mr. Landscaping :
When rainy days happen , the winners are the ones positive enough to open an umbrella stand .
The losers just stand there , mope , and get soaked .

In Newton 's world , time is a simple concept — a universal time exists by which all events can be measured .
However , special and general relativity state that the time measurements becomes dependent on how you relate to the process you wish to time .
The classical example is that of someone on a rapidly moving train would measure time at a different rate than a person standing still on the station platform .
The equations that describe such phenomena are well understood as they apply to deterministic ( non-random ) systems , but it is not known how to describe stochastic ( random ) processes or motion in a relativistic sense .
One of the most well known examples of a stochastic process in physics is Brownian motion .
This was originally used to describe the random , jiggling motion of particles suspending in a fluid medium .
While relativistic issues with colloids in water are pretty much nonexistent , the same mechanics describes thermalization in quark - gluon plasmas and other complex , high - energy processes that take place in our Universe .
One problem that arises is how to properly measure time in these complex systems .
In relativity , there are two definitions of time : the coordinate time and the proper time .
Coordinate time can be described as what a stationary ( inertial ) clock , infinitely removed from an event , would measure .
Proper time , on the other hand , is the time measured by a clock that exists at the same point as the event taking place — this means that it depends not only on the nature of the event , but on the path taken through space by the clock as the event occurs .
When one has a process that involves random motion over time , which time should be used ?
The time evolution of a stochastic process is defined by a Langevin equation , which is a differential equation similar to those that describe the time evolution of motion in classical mechanics , but with an extra term that captures the random nature of the process at any given time .
In a paper set to be published in an upcoming issue of Physical Review Letters , a trio of theoretical physicists derive the mathematical relation between the proper time of a stochastically moving particle and the coordinate time of the same particle .
In doing so , the trio derive a relationship between the two types of time for a relativistic stochastic process .
Through computer simulations , they demonstrated the difference between the two measurement types .
They plotted the ' stationary ' probability density function , or PDF — a measurement of the probability of finding a particle at a particular time , position , and momentum — and compared it to the absolute momentum of a particle undergoing a type of stochastic process .
The PDF normally takes a shape similar to a normal bell curve distribution .
When the proper time is used , it has a lower peak at zero momentum and is " smeared out , " having a larger width at half the maximum height than it does when the coordinate times are used .
With an understanding of the relationship between proper and coordinate time in this class of stochastic processes , the researchers look at the problem of how to describe a stochastic process that is moving relative to an observer .
Working through the mathematics , they derive how a stochastic process will appear when it undergoes a Lorentz transformation — that is , what it will look like when it moves by a stationary observer at a high rate of speed .
They conclude the paper by pointing out that the current work renders " the special relativistic Langevin theory [...] as complete as the classical theories of nonrelativistic Brownian motions and deterministic relativistic motions , respectively , both of which are included as special limit cases . "
They point out one critical underlying issue : one must be careful about describing the " stationarity " of stochastic processes in special relativity .
The coordinate parameterization of time is better suited when describing diffusion processes , but the proper time parameterization is better for events where particle creation / annihilation is occurring , since a particle 's lifetime is described by its proper time .
They finish by pointing out that the paper lays the groundwork for describing stochastic processes in general relativity .

Military Robots and the Laws of War
P. W. Singer
More than just conventional wisdom , it has become almost a cliché to say that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have proved “ how technology does n’t have a big place in any doctrine of future war , ” as one security analyst told me in 2007 .
The American military efforts in those countries ( or so the thinking goes ) have dispelled the understanding of technology - dominated warfare that was prevalent just a few years ago — the notion that modern armed conflict would be fundamentally changed in the age of computers and networks .
It is true that Afghanistan and Iraq have done much to puncture that understanding of war .
The vaunted theory , so beloved in the Rumsfeld - era Pentagon , of a “ network - centric ” revolution in military affairs can now be seen more clearly as a byproduct of the 1990s dotcom boom .
The Internet has certainly affected how people shop , communicate , and date .
Amid this ecstatic hype , it is not surprising that many security studies experts , both in and out of the defense establishment , latched onto the notion that linking up all our systems via electronic networks would “ lift the fog of war , ” allow war to be done on the cheap , and even allow the United States to “ lock out ” competition from the marketplace of war , much as they saw Microsoft doing to Apple at the time .
Nor is it surprising that now analysts are writing off high - tech warfare altogether in the wake of Afghanistan and Iraq .
Insurgents armed with crude conventional weapons have proven frequently able to flummox their well - equipped American foes .
Many observers increasingly seem to believe that if irregular warfare is likely to be the future of armed conflict , advanced technologies have no great role .
These “ all or nothing ” attitudes are each incorrect .
High technology is not a silver bullet solution to insurgencies , but that does n’t mean that technology does n’t matter in these fights .
In fact , far from proving the uselessness of advanced technology in modern warfare , Afghanistan and Iraq have for the first time proved the value of a technology that will truly revolutionize warfare — robotics .
When U.S. forces went into Iraq , the original invasion had no robotic systems on the ground .
By the end of 2004 , there were 150 robots on the ground in Iraq ; a year later there were 2,400 ; by the end of 2008 , there were about 12,000 robots of nearly two dozen varieties operating on the ground in Iraq .
As one retired Army officer put it , the “ Army of the Grand Robotic ” is taking shape .
It is n’t just on the ground : military robots have been taking to the skies — and the seas and space , too .
And the field is rapidly advancing .
The robotic systems now rolling out in prototype stage are far more capable , intelligent , and autonomous than ones already in service in Iraq and Afghanistan .
But even they are just the start .
As one robotics executive put it at a demonstration of new military prototypes a couple of years ago , “ The robots you are seeing here today I like to think of as the Model T .
These are not what you are going to see when they are actually deployed in the field .
We are seeing the very first stages of this technology . ”
And just as the Model T exploded on the scene — selling only 239 cars in its first year and over one million a decade later — the demand for robotic warriors is growing very rapidly .
The truly revolutionary part , however , is not robots ’ increasing numbers , or even their capabilities .
It is the ripple effects that they will have in areas ranging from politics and war to business and ethics .
For instance , the difficulties for the existing laws of war that this robotics revolution will provoke are barely beginning to be understood .
Technology generally evolves much more quickly than the laws of war .
During World War I , for example , all sorts of recent inventions , from airplanes dropping bombs to cannons shooting chemical weapons , were introduced before anyone agreed on the rules for their use — and , as to be expected , the warring sides sometimes took different interpretations on critical questions .
While it is far too early to know with any certainty , we can at least start to establish the underlying frameworks as to how robots will reshape the practice and the ethics of warfare .
Rise of the Robots
Mechanization and mass production made possible early automatic weapons in the nineteenth century .
Military experimentation with machines that were also mobile and unmanned began during World War I — including even radio - controlled airplanes , the very first unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) .
World War II saw the operational use of several unmanned weapons by both the Allied and Axis forces , including remote - controlled bombs ; it was also a period of rapid advancement in analog and electronic computing .
Military interest in robotics was spotty during the Cold War , with inventors repeatedly finding that what was technically possible mattered less than what was bureaucratically feasible .
Robotic systems were getting better , but the interest , energy , and proven success stories necessary for them to take off just were n’t there .
The only substantial contract during this long dry spell was one that the Ryan aeronautical firm received in 1962 for $ 1.1 million to make an unmanned reconnaissance aircraft .
The drone that came out of it , the Fire Fly , flew 3,435 missions in Southeast Asia .
Overall , though , the Vietnam experience was as bad for robotics as it was for the broader U.S. military .
Most of the uses of unmanned systems were classified and thus there was little public knowledge of their relative successes , as well as no field tests or data collection to solve the problems they incurred ( 16 percent of the Fire Flys crashed ) .
As veteran robotics scientist Robert Finkelstein has pointed out , “ It took decades for UAVs to recover from Vietnam misperceptions . ”
The next big U.S. military spending on unmanned planes did n’t come until 1979 , with the Army ’s Aquila program .
The Aquila was to be a small propeller - powered drone that could circle over the front lines and send back information on the enemy ’s numbers and intentions .
Soon , though , the Army began to load up the plane with all sorts of new requirements .
It now had to carry night vision and laser designators , spot artillery fire , survive against enemy ground fire , and so on .
Each new requirement came at a cost .
The more you loaded up the drone , the bigger it had to be , meaning it was both heavier than planned and an easier target to shoot down .
The more secure you wanted the communications , the lower the quality of the images it beamed back .
The program originally planned to spend $ 560 million for 780 Aquila drones .
By 1987 , it had spent over $ 1 billion for just a few prototypes .
The program was canceled and the cause of unmanned vehicles was set further back , again more by policy decisions than the technology itself .
Work continued , but mainly on testing various drones and ground vehicles , which were usually regular vehicles jury - rigged with remote controls .
During this period , most of the ground systems were designed to be tele - operated — that is , using long fiber - optic wires to link the robot to the controller .
Any enemy with a pair of scissors could take them out .
One of the few to be built from the ground up to drive on its own was Martin Marietta ’s eight - wheeled “ Autonomous Land Vehicle . ”
Unfortunately , the weapon had a major image problem :
It was shaped like an RV , what retirees would use to drive cross-country to see the Grand Canyon .
This killed any chance of convincing the generals of its use for warfighting .
Another significant program that did n’t take off in this period was a 1980 Army plan for a robotic antitank vehicle .
The idea was to take a commercial all - terrain vehicle , rig it for remote control , and load it with missiles .
Congress thought that ATVs , while certainly fun for country kids to ride around behind trailer parks , were a bit too small to be taking on Soviet tanks .
So the program was canceled .
But the military mistakenly came to believe that Congress ’s real objection was to the weaponization of unmanned systems .
“ So , ” as Finkelstein says , “ misinterpretation kept weapons off for almost a decade . ”
Despite these setbacks , the American military robotics community did n’t waver in its belief in the usefulness of its work .
It could point to other nations beginning to successfully deploy unmanned systems , like Israel ’s successful experience with drones in the 1980s .
By the time of the 1991 Persian Gulf War , unmanned systems were gradually making their way into the U.S. military , but in very small numbers .
The Army had a handful of M - 60 tanks converted into unmanned land - mine clearers , but they were left behind in the famous “ left - hook ” invasion force that drove across the desert into Iraq .
The Air Force flew just one UAV drone .
The only notable success story was the Navy ’s use of the Pioneer drone , an unmanned plane ( almost exactly like the planned Aquila ) that the Navy had bought secondhand from the Israelis .
It flew off of World War II - era U.S. battleships that had been taken out of mothballs in the 1980s and updated for use in pounding ground targets with their massive sixteen - inch guns .
The guns fired shells that weighed 2,000 pounds and could leave a crater the size of a football field .
The little drones , which the Iraqis took to calling “ vultures , ” would fly over targets and spot where the shells were landing .
“ The Iraqis came to learn that when they heard the buzz of a Pioneer overhead , all heck would break loose shortly thereafter because these sixteen - inch rounds would start landing all around them , ” said Steve Reid , an executive at the Pioneer ’s maker , AAI .
In one case , a group of Iraqi soldiers saw a Pioneer flying overhead and , rather than wait to be blown up , waved white bed sheets and undershirts at the drone — the first time in history that human soldiers surrendered to an unmanned system .
Of course , the real stars of the Gulf War were not unmanned systems in the way we think of them now , but new “ smart bombs ” — that is , cruise missiles and laser - guided bombs .
A massive PR campaign was built around the guided weapons as the “ heroes ” of the hundred - hour war .
The only problem was that they were n’t .
Only 7 percent of all the bombs dropped were guided ; the rest were “ dumb . ”
The most influential technology in the Gulf War was not the sexy smart bombs , but the humble desktop computer .
By 1990 , the U.S. military had bought into the idea of digitizing its forces and was spending some $ 30 billion a year on applying computers to all its various tasks .
The Gulf War was the first war in history to involve widespread computers , used for everything from organizing the movement of hundreds of thousands of troops to sorting through reams of satellite photos looking for targets for missiles to hit .
Calling it a “ technology war , ” the victorious commanding general , “ Stormin ’ ” Norman Schwarzkopf , said , “ I could n’t have done it all without the computers . ”
Over the rest of the 1990s , as sensors and computer processors improved , unmanned systems became ever more capable .
But the “ magic moment , ” as retired Air Force Colonel Tom Erhard put it , occurred in 1995 , when unmanned systems were integrated with the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) .
“ That ’s when it really came together . ”
Now widely accessible by devices in automobiles , the GPS is a constellation of military satellites that can provide the location , speed , and direction of a receiver , anywhere on the globe .
It allowed unmanned systems ( and their human operators ) to automatically know where they were at any time .
With GPS , as well as the advance of the video game industry ( which the controllers began to mimic ) , the interfaces became accessible to a wider set of users .
Drones began to be far more intuitive to fly , while the information they passed on to the generals and troops in the field became ever more detailed .
The programs also began to pass some key hurdles of acceptability .
The various military services had long resisted buying any unmanned systems , but slowly they began to accept their use .
In 1997 , for example , the Air Force Chief of Staff , General Ronald R. Fogleman , instructed his planners that his service could “ no longer ... spend money the way we have been , ” and mandated that they consider investing in new technologies such as UAVs .
The military advantages of unmanned systems became increasingly clear to observers in the Pentagon .
In many situations , robots have faster reaction times and better aim than human beings .
They are often ideal for filling roles that people in the field call the “ Three Ds ” : dull , dirty , or dangerous .
Unlike humans , who get tired and hungry and lose concentration and effectiveness , robots can perform boring tasks with unstinting accuracy for long periods of time .
( As one advertisement for an unmanned plane put it , “ Can you keep your eyes open for thirty hours without blinking ? ” )
They can operate in dirty environments , such as battle zones filled with biological or chemical weapons , or under other dangerous conditions , such as in space , in rough seas , or in flights with very high gravitational pressures .
The rising interest in robots in the late 1990s coincided with changing political winds — a shrinking U.S. military as part of the post - Cold War so - called “ peace dividend , ” and an increasing belief that public tolerance for military risk and casualties had dropped dramatically after the relatively costless victory in the Gulf War .
In 2000 , this was the main factor that led Senator John Warner ( R. - Va. ) , then chairman of the Armed Services Committee , to mandate in the Pentagon ’s budget that by 2010 , one - third of all the aircraft designed to attack behind enemy lines be unmanned , and that by 2015 , one - third of all ground combat vehicles be driverless .
And then came September 11 , 2001 .
The annual national defense budget since 9/11 has risen to $ 515 billion ( an increase of 74 percent between 2002 and 2008 ) , not counting the cost of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq .
There has been a massive increase in spending on research and development and on procurement , with a particular focus on anything unmanned .
“ Make ’em as fast as you can ” is what one robotics executive recounts being told by his Pentagon buyers after 9/11 .
Enthusiasm has only grown thanks to successes on the battlefield .
With this change in military mentality , money , and use , the groundwork was finally laid for a real military robotics industry .
As the Washington Post put it , “ The undertaking has attracted not only the country ’s top weapons makers but also dozens of small businesses ... all pitching a science - fiction gallery of possible solutions . ”
Robert Finkelstein recalled a time when he personally knew most of the engineers working on military robotics .
Today , the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International has fourteen hundred member companies .
Almost four thousand people showed up at its last annual meeting .
Cleaning Floors and Fighting Wars
During the war in Iraq , improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) became the insurgents ’ primary way of attacking U.S. forces .
Often hidden along roadsides and disguised to look like trash or scrap metal , these cheap and easy - to - make bombs can do tremendous damage .
At the peak of the Iraq insurgency in 2006 , IED attacks were averaging nearly two thousand a month .
They have been the leading cause of casualties among American personnel in Iraq , accounting for 40 percent of the troop deaths .
On the ground , the military bomb squad hunting for IEDs is called the Explosive Ordnance Disposal ( EOD ) team .
Before Iraq , EOD teams were not much valued by either the troops in the field or their senior leaders .
They usually deployed to battlefields only after the fighting was done , to defuse any old weapons caches or unexploded ammunition that might be found .
In Iraq , though , EOD teams went from an afterthought to a critical assignment .
In a typical tour in Iraq when the insurgency was at its peak , each team would go on more than six hundred IED calls , defusing or safely exploding about two IEDs a day .
Perhaps the best sign of how critical the EOD teams became is that the insurgents began offering a rumored $ 50,000 bounty for killing an EOD team member .
Working alongside many EOD teams have been robots — scouting ahead for IEDs and ambushes , saving soldiers ’ lives many times over .
Most of these unmanned ground vehicles ( UGVs ) have been made by two Boston - area robotics firms .
One of these , iRobot , was founded in 1990 by three M.I.T. computer geeks ; it is best known for the Roomba , the disc - shaped automatic vacuum cleaner that the company released in 2002 .
Roomba actually evolved from Fetch , a robot that the company designed in 1997 for the U.S. Air Force .
Fetch cleaned up cluster bomblets from airfields ; Roomba cleans up dust bunnies under sofas .
The company ’s other breakout product was PackBot , which came out of a 1998 contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) .
Weighing forty - two pounds and costing just under $ 150,000 , PackBot is about the size of a lawn mower .
It is typically operated via remote control , although it can drive itself , including even backtracking to wherever it started its mission .
PackBot moves using four “ flippers ” — essentially tank treads that can rotate on one axis .
These allow PackBot not only to roll forward and backward like regular tank tracks , but also to climb stairs , rumble over rocks , squeeze down twisting tunnels , and even swim in under six feet of water .
The designers at iRobot view their robots as “ platforms . ”
PackBot has eight separate payload bays and hookups that allow its users to swap in whatever they need : mine detector , chemical and biological weapons sensor , or just extra power packs .
The EOD version of the PackBots serving in Iraq comes with an extendable arm on top that mounts both a head , containing a high - powered zoom camera , and a claw - like gripper .
Soldiers use these to drive up to IEDs , peer at them closely , and then , using the gripper , disassemble the bomb , all from a safe distance .
PackBot made its operational debut on 9/11 when engineers from iRobot drove down to New York City to help in the rescue and recovery efforts at Ground Zero .
Soon after , PackBot went to war .
As U.S. forces deployed to Afghanistan , troops came across massive cave complexes that had to be scouted out , but were often booby - trapped .
The only specialized tool the troops had were flashlights , and they often sent their local Afghan allies to crawl through the caves on hands and knees .
“ Then we began to run out of Afghans , ” recounts a soldier .
iRobot was then asked by the Pentagon to send help .
Just six weeks later , PackBots were first used in a cave complex near the village of Nazaraht , in the heart of Taliban territory .
Production and profits for Packbots boomed in the years that followed , culminating in a $ 286 million Pentagon contract in 2008 to supply as many as three thousand more machines .
Meanwhile , iRobot has new and improved versions of the PackBot as well as a host of plans to convert any type of vehicle into a robot , be it a car or ship , using a universal control unit that you plug into the engine and steering wheel .
One new robot that iRobot ’s designers are especially excited to show off is the Warrior .
Weighing about 250 pounds , the Warrior is essentially a PackBot on steroids : it has the same basic design , but is about five times bigger .
Warrior can drive at 15 miles per hour for five hours , while carrying one hundred pounds — yet it is agile enough to fit through a doorway and go up stairs .
It is really just a mobile platform , with a USB port — a universal connector — on top that can be used to plug in sensors , a gun , and a TV camera for battle , or an iPod and loudspeakers for a mobile rave party .
The long - term strategy is for other companies to focus on the plug - in market while iRobot corners the market for the robotic platforms .
What Microsoft did for the software industry , iRobot hopes to do for the robotics industry .
Just a twenty - minute drive from iRobot ’s offices are the headquarters of the Foster - Miller company .
Founded in the 1950s — also by M.I.T. grads —
Foster - Miller makes the PackBot ’s primary competitor , the Talon .
The Talon , which first hit the market in 2000 , looks like a small tank , driven by two treads that run its length .
Weighing just over a hundred pounds , it is a bit bigger than the PackBot .
It too has a retractable arm with a gripper , but mounts its main sensors on a separate antenna - like “ mast ” sticking up from the body and carrying a zoom camera .
Talon can go up to speeds of about 5.5 miles per hour , the equivalent of a decent jog on a treadmill , a pace it can maintain for five hours .
Like the PackBot , the Talon helped sift through the wreckage at Ground Zero and soon after deployed to Afghanistan .
And like iRobot , Foster - Miller has boomed , doubling the number of robots it sells every year for the last four years .
The company received an initial $ 65 million in orders for Talons in the first two years of the insurgency in Iraq .
By 2008 , there were close to two thousand Talons in the field and the firm had won a $ 400 million contract to supply another two thousand .
Under an additional $ 20 million repair and spare - parts contract , the company also operates a “ robot hospital ” in Baghdad .
Foster - Miller now makes some fifty to sixty Talons a month , and repairs another hundred damaged systems .
In technology circles , new products that change the rules of the game , such as what the iPod did to portable music players , are called “ killer applications . ”
Foster - Miller ’s new product gives this phrase a literal meaning .
The Special Weapons Observation Reconnaissance Detection System ( SWORDS ) is the first armed robot designed to roam the battlefield .
SWORDS is basically the Talon ’s tougher big brother , with its gripping arm replaced by a gun mount that can carry pretty much any weapon that weighs under three hundred pounds , ranging from an M - 16 rifle and .50 - caliber machine gun to a 40 mm grenade launcher or an antitank rocket launcher .
In less than a minute , the human soldier flips two levers and locks his favorite weapon into the mount .
The SWORDS ca n’t reload itself , but it can carry two hundred rounds of ammunition for the light machine guns , three hundred rounds for the heavy machine guns , six grenades , or four rockets .
Unlike the more - automated PackBot , SWORDS has very limited intelligence on its own ; it is remote - controlled from afar by either radio or a spooled - out fiber optic wire .
Thanks to the five cameras mounted on the robot , the operator can not only see as if he has eyes in the back of his head , but farther than had previously been possible when shooting a gun .
As one soldier put it , “ You can read people ’s nametags at 300 to 400 meters , whereas the human eye ca n’t pick that up .
You can see the expression on his face , what weapons he is carrying .
You can even see if his [ weapon ’s ] selector lever is on fire or on safe . ”
The cameras can also see in night vision , meaning the enemy can be fired on at any hour and in any climate .
And the gun is impressively precise ; it is locked in a stable platform , so its aim is n’t disrupted by the breathing or heartbeat that human snipers must compensate for , and it does n’t get nervous in a sticky situation .
So far , SWORDS has been used for street patrols , reconnaissance , sniping , checkpoint security , and guarding observation posts .
It bodes to be especially useful for urban warfare jobs , such as going first into buildings and alleyways where insurgents might hide .
SWORDS ’s inhuman capabilities could well result in even more intrepid missions .
For example , the robot can drive through snow and sand , and can even drive underwater down to depths of one hundred feet , meaning it could pop up in quite unexpected places .
Likewise , its battery allows it to be hidden somewhere in “ sleep ” mode for at least seven days and then wake up to shoot away at any foes .
Foster - Miller and iRobot feel a keen sense of competition with each other .
At iRobot , researchers describe their rivals as thinking , “ We hear that robots are trendy , so let ’s do that . ”
At Foster - Miller , they retort , “ We do n’t just do robots and we do n’t suck dirt . ”
( Indeed , thanks to its Roomba vacuum cleaner , iRobot may be the only company that sells at both Pentagon trade shows and Bed Bath & Beyond . )
The two companies have even become locked in a bit of a marketing war .
If robots were pickup trucks , Foster - Miller represents the Ford model , stressing how the Talon is “ Built Tough . ”
Its promotional materials describe the Talon as “ The Soldier ’s Choice . ”
Foster - Miller executives love to recount tales of how the Talon has proven it “ can take a punch and stay in the fight . ”
The iRobot team , meanwhile , bristles at the idea that its systems are “ agile but fragile . ”
They insist that the PackBot is tough , too , citing various statistics on how it can survive a 400 g - force hit , what they describe as the equivalent of being tossed out of a hovering helicopter onto a concrete floor .
They are most proud of the fact that their robots have a 95 percent out - of - the - box reliability rate , higher than any other in the marketplace , meaning that when the soldiers get them in the field , they can trust the robot will work as designed .
Beneath all the difference and rancor , the two companies are similar in one telling way .
The hallways and cubicles of both of their offices are covered with pictures and thank - you letters from soldiers in the field .
A typical note from an EOD soldier reads , “ This little guy saved our butts on many occasions . ”
Future Ground - Bots
Foster - Miller ’s SWORDS was not the first ground robot to draw blood on the battlefield .
That seems to have been the MARCBOT ( Multi- Function Agile Remote - Controlled Robot ) , a commonly - used UGV that looks like a toy truck with a video camera mounted on a tiny antenna - like mast .
Costing only $ 5,000 , the tiny bot is used to scout out where the enemy might be and also to drive under cars and search for hidden explosives .
One unit of soldiers put Claymore antipersonnel mines on their MARCBOTs .
Whenever they thought insurgents were hiding in an alley , they would send a MARCBOT down first , not just to scout out the ambush , but to take them out with the Claymore .
Of course , each discovered insurgent meant $ 5,000 worth of blown - up robot parts , but so far the Army has n’t billed the soldiers .
Meanwhile , both iRobot and Foster - Miller are hard at work on the next generation of UGVs .
For testing purposes , iRobot ’s PackBot has been equipped with a shotgun that can fire a variety of ammunition , including non-lethal rubber bullets , rounds that can blow down a door , and even more powerful “ elephant killer ” bullets .
Another version of PackBot is the Robotic Enhanced Detection Outpost with Lasers ( REDOWL ) , which uses lasers and sound detection equipment to find any sniper who dares to shoot at the robot or accompanying troops , and instantly targets him with an infrared laser beam .
Foster - Miller has similar plans to upgrade its current generation of ground robots .
For example , the first version of the armed SWORDS needed the remote human operator to be situated within a mile or two , which can still put the human in danger .
The company plans to vastly extend the range of communications so as to get ground robot operators completely off the battlefield .
And the SWORDS itself is being replaced by a new version named after the Roman god of war — the MAARS ( Modular Advanced Armed Robotic System ) , which carries a more powerful machine gun , 40 mm grenade launchers , and , for non-lethal settings , a green laser “ dazzler , ” tear gas , and a loudspeaker , perfect for warning any insurgents that “ Resistance is futile . ”
We will also soon see entirely new armed UGVs hit the battlefield .
One such prototype is the Gladiator .
Described as the “ world ’s first multipurpose combat robot , ” it came out of a partnership between the U.S. Marine Corps and Carnegie Mellon University .
About the size of a golf cart , the first version of the vehicle was operated by a soldier wielding a PlayStation video game controller , but software plug-ins will allow it to be upgraded to semiautonomous and then fully autonomous modes .
Fully loaded , it costs $ 400,000 and carries a machine gun with six hundred rounds of ammunition , antitank rockets , and non-lethal weapons .
Not all future UGVs , it should be noted , will take on combat roles .
Some are being designed as “ medbots , ” to supplement the work of field medics .
The Bloodhound , yet another version of the PackBot , will be able to search on its own for a hurt soldier ; it can then be remotely controlled to provide rudimentary treatment .
The next step will be specially designed medbots , such as REV and REX .
REV , the Robotic Evacuation Vehicle ( a robot version of an ambulance ) , carries REX , the Robotic Extraction Vehicle , a tiny stretcher - bearer that zips out to drag soldiers into the safety of the ambulance .
REX has an arm with six joints to drag a soldier to safety , while REV has a life - support pod that even comes with a flat - screen TV facing the wounded soldier ’s face so that operators can see and communicate with the human on the other end if he is conscious .
Ultimately , REV will be configured so that complex surgeries can occur inside the medbot .
Coordinating many of the ground robots on the drawing boards is the U.S. Army ’s $ 230 billion Future Combat Systems ( FCS ) program .
It involves everything from replacing tens of thousands of armored vehicles with a new generation of manned and unmanned vehicles to writing the many millions of lines of software code for the new computers that will link them all together .
Starting in 2011 , the Army plans to start spiraling a few new technologies at a time into the force .
By 2015 , the Army believes it will be in a position to reorganize its units into new FCS brigades , which will represent a revolutionary new model of how military units are staffed and organized .
Each brigade will actually have more unmanned vehicles than manned ones ( a planned 330 unmanned to 300 manned ) .
Each brigade will also have its own unmanned air force , with over a hundred drones controlled by the unit ’s soldiers .
They will range in size from a fifteen - pounder that will fit in soldiers ’ backpacks to a twenty - three - foot - long robotic helicopter .
Up , Up , and Away
Military robots have also taken to the skies .
Unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) , like the now - well - known Predator and Global Hawk , made their debut in the Balkan wars in the 1990s , gathering information on Serb air defenses and refugee flows .
These drones are an indispensable part of the U.S. efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq , but commanders ’ attitudes toward them were very different just a few years ago .
Lieutenant General Walter Buchanan , the U.S. Air Force commander in the Middle East , recalled the run-up to the Iraq war in an interview with Air Force Magazine :
In March of 2002 , [ during ] the mission briefings over Southern Iraq at that time , the mission commander would get up and he ’d say , “ OK , we ’re going to have the F - 15 Cs fly here , the F - 16s are going to fly here , the A - 6s are going to fly here , tankers are going to be here today . ”
Then they would say , “ And oh by the way , way over here is going to be the Predator . ”
We do n’t go over there , and he ’s not going to come over here and bother us ....
It was almost like nobody wanted to talk to them .
This is far from the case today .
The Predator , perhaps the best known UAV , is a twenty - seven - foot - long plane that can spend some twenty - four hours in the air , flying at heights of up to 26,000 feet .
Given its price tag — at just $ 4.5 million , it costs a fraction of what a manned fighter jet costs — the Predator can be used for missions where it might be shot down , such as traveling low and slow over enemy territory .
It was originally designed for reconnaissance and surveillance , and about a quarter of the cost of each Predator actually goes into the “ Ball , ” a round mounting under the nose that carries two variable - aperture TV cameras , one for seeing during the day and an infrared one for night , as well as a synthetic - aperture radar that allows the Predator to peer through clouds , smoke , or dust .
The exact capabilities of the system are classified , but soldiers say they can read a license plate from two miles up .
Predators do n’t just watch from afar ; they have also been armed to kill .
The back - story of how this happened is one of the sad “ what ifs ? ” of what could have been done to prevent the 9/11 attacks .
Over the course of 2000 and 2001 , Predators operated by the CIA spotted Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan many times , usually when he was driving in a convoy between his training camps .
But the unmanned spy planes were toothless and could only watch as bin Laden disappeared .
Proposals to arm the drone by mounting laser - guided Hellfire missiles on its wings were not pursued .
After 9/11 , the gloves were taken off , and the CIA and Air Force armed their Predators .
In the first year , armed Predators took out some 115 targets in Afghanistan on their own .
( That ’s in addition to the thousands of targets that were destroyed by other means after they were laser - designated by Predators . )
With that precedent , the Predator also joined the fight in Iraq .
Among its first missions was to help take down the Iraqi government ’s television transmissions , which broadcast the infamous “ Baghdad Bob ” propaganda .
In the days and weeks that followed , the Predator struck at everything from suspected insurgent safe houses to cars being prepped for suicide attacks .
The little drone has quickly become perhaps the busiest U.S. asset in the air .
From June 2005 to June 2006 , Predators carried out 2,073 missions , flew 33,833 hours , surveyed 18,490 targets , and participated in 242 separate raids .
Even with this massive effort , there is demand for more .
Officers estimate that they get requests for some 300 hours of Predator imagery a day , but that there are only enough Predators in the air to supply a little over 100 hours a day .
The result is that the Predator fleet has grown from less than 10 in 2001 to some 180 in 2007 , with plans to add another 150 over the next few years .
Besides the Predator , there are many other drones that fill the air over Iraq and Afghanistan .
At forty feet long , Global Hawk has been described as looking like “ a flying albino whale . ”
Originally conceived as an unmanned replacement for the half - century - old U - 2 spy plane , Global Hawk can stay aloft up to thirty - five hours .
Powered by a turbofan engine that takes it to sixty - five thousand feet , the stealthy Global Hawk carries synthetic - aperture radar , infrared sensors , and electro - optical cameras .
Working in combination , these sensors can do a wide - area search to look at an entire region , or focus in on a single target in high resolution .
Like the Predator , the Global Hawk is linked back to humans on the ground , but it mainly operates autonomously rather than being remotely piloted .
Using a computer mouse , the operator just clicks to tell it to taxi and take off , and the drone flies off on its own .
The plane then carries out its mission , getting directions on where to fly from GPS coordinates downloaded off a satellite .
Upon its return , “ you basically hit the land button , ” describes one retired Air Force officer .
With such capability , the Global Hawk is not cheap .
The plane itself costs some $ 35 million , but the overall support system runs to over $ 123 million each .
Even so , the U.S. Air Force plans to spend another $ 6 billion to build up the fleet to fifty - one drones by 2012 .
The Predators and Global Hawks are mostly directed by personnel in Air Force bases back in the United States , but a veritable menagerie of UAVs now circling above Iraq are controlled by troops on the ground .
Big Army units fly the Shadow , which looks like the radio - controlled planes flown by model plane hobbyists .
Just over twelve feet long , it takes off and lands like a regular plane , and its propeller makes it sound like a weed - whacker flying overhead ; it can stay in the air for five hours and fly seventy miles .
Like its older sibling the Hunter , which is twice as big and can stay in the air twice as long , the Shadow is used on a variety of tactical missions in support of ground forces , including reconnaissance , target acquisition , and battlefield damage assessment .
The Raven , the most popular UAV , is just thirty - eight inches long and weighs four pounds ; it is launched by tossing it into the air like a javelin .
The Raven then buzzes off , able to fly for ninety minutes at about four hundred feet , carrying three cameras in its nose , including an infrared one .
Soldiers love it because they can now peer over the next hill or city block , as well as get their own spy planes to control , rather than having to beg for support from the higher - ups .
“ You throw the bird up when you want to throw it .
You land it when you want to land , ” says Captain Matt Gill , a UAV company commander with the 82nd Airborne Division .
The other part of the appeal is that the pilots of the Raven are just regular soldiers ; one cook from the 1st Cavalry Division is actually considered among the best pilots in the entire force .
In just the first two years of the Iraq war , the number of Ravens in service jumped from twenty - five to eight hundred .
The small UAVs , like the Raven or the even smaller Wasp , fly just above the rooftops , sending back video images of what ’s on the other side of the street ; Shadow and Hunter circle over entire neighborhoods ; the larger Predators roam above entire cities , combining reconnaissance with the ability to shoot ; and too high to see , the Global Hawk zooms across an entire country , capturing reams of detailed imagery for intelligence teams to sift through .
Added together , by 2008 , there were 5,331 drones in the U.S. military ’s inventory , almost double the number of manned fighter planes .
That same year , an Air Force lieutenant general forecast that “ given the growth trends , it is not unreasonable to postulate future conflicts involving tens of thousands . ”
Among the UAVs likely to see action in those future conflicts will be Predators reconfigured for electronic warfare , submarine hunting , and even air - to - air combat ; the Reaper , a bigger , smarter , and more powerful successor to the Predator ; a variety of planned micro-UAVs , some the size of insects ; the Peregrine , a drone designed to find and shoot down other drones ; and even an unmanned stealth bomber .
And it ’s not just intelligence and bomber pilots who will be replaced with machines ; planning is proceeding on UCAVs , unmanned combat aerial vehicles , which will replace fighter jocks , too .
Meanwhile , DARPA is working on a VULTURE ( Very - high - altitude , Ultra - endurance , Loitering Theater Unmanned Reconnaissance Element ) drone , which the agency hopes will be able to stay aloft for as long as five years .
We may even see the return of blimps to warfare .
Lockheed Martin has been given $ 150 million to design and build a robotic “ High Altitude Airship ” twenty - five times larger than the Goodyear blimp .
Such huge , long - endurance blimps open up a whole new range of roles not normally possible for planes .
For example , airships could literally be “ parked ” in the air , as high as one hundred thousand feet up , for weeks , months , or years , serving as a communications relay , spy satellite , hub for a ballistic missile defense system , floating gas station , or even airstrip for other planes and drones .
The Pentagon has also started work on a number of unmanned systems for potential use in space , although most are still only on the drawing boards .
And a broad new set of robots is being introduced for war at sea , too , where the main differentiation is whether they are designed to operate on the surface , like a boat , or underwater , like a submarine .
The former are called USVs ( unmanned surface vehicles or vessels ) .
They actually have a great deal in common with the simpler land robots , as they both primarily operate in a two - dimensional world , and can be equipped with sensors and guns .
The Spartan Scout , one such USV , got its first real - world use in the Iraq war in 2003 , inspecting small civilian boats in the Persian Gulf without risking sailors ’ lives .
The boat also mounts a loudspeaker and microphone , so an Arab linguist back on the “ mothership ” could interrogate any suspicious boats that the Spartan Scout had stopped .
As one report put it , “ The civilian sailors were somewhat taken aback when they were interrogated by this Arab - speaking boat that had no one aboard . ”
The other type of navybots are UUVs ( unmanned underwater vehicles ) .
These are designed for underwater roles such as searching for mines , the cause of most naval combat losses over the last two decades .
Many UUVs are biologically inspired , like the “ Robo - lobster , ” which operates in the choppy waters close to shore .
But others are mini-submarines or converted torpedoes — like the REMUS ( Remote Environmental Monitoring Unit ) , which was used to clear Iraqi waterways of mines and explosives .
Impersonalizing War
The hope that technology will reduce the violence of war is a venerable one .
The poet John Donne told in 1621 how the invention of better cannons would help limit the cruelty and crimes of war , “ and the great expence of bloud is avoyed . ”
Richard Gatling hoped his new fast - firing gun would serve to reduce the bloodshed of war , while Alfred Nobel believed the explosives he invented would make war unthinkable .
Now , some analysts believe that robot warriors can help reduce the flow of blood and perhaps make war more moral .
In some ways , this seems reasonable .
Many wartime atrocities are not the result of deliberate policy , wanton cruelty , or fits of anger ; they ’re just mistakes .
They are equivalent to the crime of manslaughter , as compared to murder , in civilian law .
Unmanned systems seem to offer several ways of reducing the mistakes and unintended costs of war .
They have far better sensors and processing power , which creates a precision superior to what humans could marshal on their own .
Such exactness can lessen the number of mistakes made , as well as the number of civilians inadvertently killed .
For example , even as recently as the 1999 Kosovo war , NATO pilots spotting for Serbian military targets on the ground had to fly over the suspected enemy position , then put their plane on autopilot while they wrote down the coordinates of the target on their lap with a grease pencil .
They would then radio the coordinates back to base , where planners would try to figure out if there were too many civilians nearby .
If not , the base would order an attack , usually made by another plane .
That new plane , just arriving on the scene , would carry out the attack using the directions of the spotter plane , if it was still there , or the relayed coordinates .
Each step was filled with potential for miscommunications and unintended errors .
Plus , by the time a decision had been made , the situation on the ground might have changed — the military target might have moved or civilians might have entered the area .
Compare this with a UAV today that can fly over the target and send precise GPS coordinates and live video back to the operators ; it is easy to see how collateral damage can be greatly reduced by robotic precision .
The unmanning of the operation also means that the robot can take risks that a human would n’t otherwise , risks that might mean fewer mistakes .
During that Kosovo campaign , for example , such a premium was placed on not losing any NATO pilots that planes were restricted from flying below fifteen thousand feet so that enemy fire could n’t hit them .
In one case , NATO planes flying at this level bombed a convoy of vehicles , thinking they were Serbian tanks .
It turned out to be a convoy of refugee buses .
If the planes could have flown lower or had the high - powered video camera of a drone , this tragic mistake might have been avoided .
The removal of risk also allows decisions to be made in a more deliberate manner than normally possible .
Soldiers describe how one of the toughest aspects of fighting in cities is how you have to burst into a building and , in a matter of milliseconds , figure out who is an enemy and who is a civilian and shoot the ones that are a threat before they shoot you , all the while avoiding hitting any civilians .
You can practice again and again , but you can never fully avoid the risk of making a terrible mistake in that split second , in a dark room , in the midst of battle .
By contrast , a robot can enter the room and only shoot at someone who shoots first , without endangering a soldier ’s life .
Many also feel that unmanned systems can remove the anger and emotion from the humans behind them .
A remote operator is n’t in the midst of combat and is n’t watching his buddies die around him as his adrenaline spikes ; he can take his time and act deliberately in ways that can lessen the likelihood of civilians being killed .
Marc Garlasco of Human Rights
Watch told me how “ the single most distinguishing weapons I have seen in my career were Israeli UAVs . ”
He described how , unlike jet fighters that had to swoop in fast and make decisions on what targets to bomb in a matter of seconds , the UAVs he observed during the 2006 Lebanon war could loiter over a potential target for minutes or even hours , and pick and choose what to strike or not .
In Vietnam , an astounding fifty thousand rounds of ammunition were expended for every enemy killed .
Robots , on the other hand , might live up to the sniper motto of “ one shot , one kill . ”
As journalist Michael Fumento put it in describing SWORDS , the operator “ can coolly pick out targets as if playing a video game . ”
But as journalist Chuck Klosterman put it , a person playing video games is usually “ not a benevolent God . ”
We do things in the virtual world , daring and violent things , that we would never do if we were there in person .
Transferred to war , this could mean that the robotic technologies that make war less intimate and more mediated might well reduce the likelihood of anger - fueled rages , but also make some soldiers too calm , too unaffected by killing .
Many studies , like Army psychologist Dave Grossman ’s seminal book On Killing ( 1995 ) , have shown how disconnecting a person , especially via distance , makes killing easier and abuses and atrocities more likely .
D. Keith Shurtleff , an Army chaplain and the ethics instructor for the Soldier Support Institute at Fort Jackson in South Carolina , worries that “ as war becomes safer and easier , as soldiers are removed from the horrors of war and see the enemy not as humans but as blips on a screen , there is a very real danger of losing the deterrent that such horrors provide . ”
Participation via the virtual world also seems to affect not merely how people look at the target , but also how they look at themselves ( which is why people in online communities , for example , take on identities and try out behaviors they never would in real life ) .
Research shows that this sort of “ externalization ” allows something called “ doubling . ”
Otherwise nice and normal people create psychic doubles that carry out sometimes terrible acts their normal identity never would .
One Air Force lieutenant colonel who led a Predator operation noticed how the virtual setting could make it easy for the drone operators to forget that they were not gods from afar and that there are real humans on both ends .
“ You have guys running the UAV saying , ‛ Kill that one , do n’t kill that one . ’”
Each new military technology , from the bow and arrow to the bomber plane , has moved soldiers farther and farther from their foes .
Yet unmanned systems have a more profound effect on “ the impersonalization of battle , ” as military historian John Keegan has called it .
These weapons do n’t just create greater physical distance , but also a different sort of psychological distance and disconnection .
The bomber pilot is n’t just above his target , but seven thousand miles away .
He does n’t share with his foes even those brief minutes of danger that would give them a bond of mutual risk .
We , Robot
As military robots gain more and more autonomy , the ethical questions involved will become even more complex .
The U.S. military bends over backwards to figure out when it is appropriate to engage the enemy and how to limit civilian casualties .
Autonomous robots could , in theory , follow the rules of engagement ; they could be programmed with a list of criteria for determining appropriate targets and when shooting is permissible .
The robot might be programmed to require human input if any civilians were detected .
An example of such a list at work might go as follows : “ Is the target a Soviet - made T - 80 tank ?
Identification confirmed .
Is the target located in an authorized free - fire zone ?
Location confirmed .
Are there any friendly units within a 200 - meter radius ?
No friendlies detected .
Are there any civilians within a 200 - meter radius ?
No civilians detected .
Weapons release authorized .
No human command authority required . ”
Such an “ ethical ” killing machine , though , may not prove so simple in the reality of war .
Even if a robot has software that follows all the various rules of engagement , and even if it were somehow absolutely free of software bugs and hardware failures ( a big assumption ) , the very question of figuring out who an enemy is in the first place — that is , whether a target should even be considered for the list of screening questions — is extremely complicated in modern war .
It essentially is a judgment call .
It becomes further complicated as the enemy adapts , changes his conduct , and even hides among civilians .
If an enemy is hiding behind a child , is it okay to shoot or not ?
Or what if an enemy is plotting an attack but has not yet carried it out ?
Politicians , pundits , and lawyers can fill pages arguing these points .
It is unreasonable to expect robots to find them any easier .
The legal questions related to autonomous systems are also extremely sticky .
In 2002 , for example , an Air National Guard pilot in an F - 16 saw flashing lights underneath him while flying over Afghanistan at twenty - three thousand feet and thought he was under fire from insurgents .
Without getting required permission from his commanders , he dropped a 500 - pound bomb on the lights .
They instead turned out to be troops from Canada on a night training mission .
Four were killed and eight wounded .
In the hearings that followed , the pilot blamed the ubiquitous “ fog of war ” for his mistake .
It did n’t matter and he was found guilty of dereliction of duty .
Change this scenario to an unmanned system and military lawyers are n’t sure what to do .
Asks a Navy officer , “ If these same Canadian forces had been attacked by an autonomous UCAV , determining who is accountable proves difficult .
Would accountability lie with the civilian software programmers who wrote the faulty target identification software , the UCAV squadron ’s Commanding Officer , or the Combatant Commander who authorized the operational use of the UCAV ?
Or are they collectively held responsible and accountable ? ”
This is the main reason why military lawyers are so concerned about robots being armed and autonomous .
As long as “ man is in the loop , ” traditional accountability can be ensured .
Breaking this restriction opens up all sorts of new and seemingly irresolvable legal questions about accountability .
In time , the international community may well decide that armed , autonomous robots are simply too difficult , or even abhorrent , to deal with .
Like chemical weapons , they could be banned in general , for no other reason than the world does n’t want them around .
Yet for now , our laws are simply silent on whether autonomous robots can be armed with lethal weapons .
Even more worrisome , the concept of keeping human beings in the loop is already being eroded by policymakers and by the technology itself , both of which are rapidly moving toward pushing humans out .
We therefore must either enact a ban on such systems soon or start to develop some legal answers for how to deal with them .
If we do stay on this path and decide to make and use autonomous robots in war , the systems must still conform with the existing laws of war .
These laws suggest a few principles that should guide the development of such systems .
First , since it will be very difficult to guarantee that autonomous robots can , as required by the laws of war , discriminate between civilian and military targets and avoid unnecessary suffering , they should be allowed the autonomous use only of non-lethal weapons .
That is , while the very same robot might also carry lethal weapons , it should be programmed such that only a human can authorize their use .
Second , just as any human ’s right to self - defense is limited , so too should be a robot’s .
This sounds simple enough , but oddly the Pentagon has already pushed the legal interpretation that our drones have an inherent right to self - defense , including even to preemptively fire on potential threats , such as an anti-aircraft radar system that lights them up .
There is a logic to this argument , but it leads down a very dark pathway ; self - defense must not be permitted to trump other relevant ethical concerns .
Third , the human creators and operators of autonomous robots must be held accountable for the machines ’ actions .
( Dr. Frankenstein should n’t get a free pass for his monster ’s misdeeds . )
If a programmer gets an entire village blown up by mistake , he should be criminally prosecuted , not get away scot - free or merely be punished with a monetary fine his employer ’s insurance company will end up paying .
Similarly , if some future commander deploys an autonomous robot and it turns out that the commands or programs he authorized the robot to operate under somehow contributed to a violation of the laws of war , or if his robot were deployed into a situation where a reasonable person could guess that harm would occur , even unintentionally , then it is proper to hold the commander responsible .
To ensure that responsibility falls where it should , there should be clear ways to track the authority in the chain of design , manufacture , ownership , and use of unmanned systems , all the way from the designer and maker to the commanders in the field .
This principle of responsibility is not simply intended for us to be able to figure out whom to punish after the fact ; by establishing at the start who is ultimately responsible for getting things right , it might add a dose of deterrence into the system before things go wrong .
Not merely scientists , but everyone from theologians ( who helped create the first laws of war ) to the human rights and arms control communities must start looking at where this technological revolution is taking both our weapons and laws .
These discussions and debates also need to be global , as the issues of robotics cross national lines ( forty - three countries now have military robotics programs ) .
Over time , some sort of consensus might emerge — if not banning the use of all autonomous robots with lethal weapons , then perhaps banning just certain types of robots ( such as ones not made of metal , which would be hard to detect and thus of most benefit to terrorist groups ) .
Some critics will argue against any international discussions or against creating new laws that act to restrict what can be done in war and research .
As Steven Metz of the Army War College says , “ You have to remember that many consider international law to be a form of asymmetric warfare , limiting our choices , tying us down . ”
Yet history tells us that , time and again , the society that builds an ethical rule of law and stands by its values is the one that ultimately prevails on the battlefield .
There is a “ bottom line ” reason for why we should adhere to the laws of war , explains a U.S. Air Force major general .
“ The more society adheres to ethical norms , democratic values , and individual rights , the more successful a warfighter that society will be . ”
So as we begin to wrestle with the problems that robots present for the laws of war , we might find instructive the wisdom from a past generation that grappled with a revolutionary and fearsome new technology ( in that case , atomic weapons ) .
As John F. Kennedy said in his inaugural address , “ Let us never negotiate out of fear , but never fear to negotiate . ”
Lloyds Banking Group faces substantial losses after taking over HBOS The Scottish businessman who led a bid for HBOS before it was merged with Lloyds TSB has called for a legal inquiry into the banking system .
Jim Spowart said recent events raised serious questions about the banking sector , particularly in Scotland .
It comes after the chancellor moved to dampen speculation that the Lloyds Banking Group could be nationalised .
The organisation has said that it expects its subsidiary to make record losses of nearly £ 11 bn .
Shares in Lloyds Banking Group , which is 43 % owned by the taxpayer , closed down 32.5 % at the end of last week .
I do think we really need now , given all the revelations of last week , to call for something like a judicial inquiry into what 's actually going on
Jim Spowart
Businessman Chancellor Alistair Darling said that allowing HBOS to collapse would have had knock - on effects for all of Britain 's banks .
The chancellor refused to rule out nationalisation of Lloyds but insisted a range of options remained open to help the banking sector .
He later moved to stress that " properly regulated and supervised " banks were best run on a commercial basis .
Mr Spowart , who set up HBOS 's Intelligent Finance online division , told BBC Scotland 's Politics Show shareholders should still be worried about nationalisation .
But he said : " If I was a shareholder I would be shocked by the news coming out in the last few days that [ nationalisation ] is now a possibility and very much on the cards .
" I do think we really need now , given all the revelations of last week , to call for something like a judicial inquiry into what 's actually going on with our banks , particularly in Scotland . "

Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Spowart said he wanted to see a " forensic examination " of how HBOS was managed .
Independent MSP Margo Macdonald has also said she fears the superbank created by the Lloyds TSB / HBoS merger is too big .
Sir Peter Burt was chief executive of the Bank of Scotland when it merged with the Halifax and launched a bid to prevent the Lloyds merger .
He told BBC Radio Scotland 's
The Business programme that while he was not surprised by the projected losses , nationalisation was not a serious prospect .
He said : " I think it was a very good acquisition , there will be some bumps in the road but it put Lloyds in a very strong position . "
Sir Peter also rejected the concept of a judicial inquiry into the running of HBOS .
Scottish Secretary Jim Murphy said he thought the current parliamentary inquiries into the banking crisis were the right way forward .
We know that the money would have been better used to fully nationalise HBOS and leave Lloyds fully in the private sector
Tavish Scott
Scottish Lib Dem leader
He said : " The Treasury select committee chaired by John McFall and now the Scottish affairs select committee chaired by Mohammad Sarwar are going to have their own inquiry into some aspects of the HBOS , RBS arrangements - I think that 's the right way to progress . "
But Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she felt there was a need for a wider investigation .
She said : " As we learn more about this I do think there may well be a case for a further inquiry , there are some big questions to be answered about the practices of the banks , about the regulators and also frankly about the role of politicians . "
Scottish Lib Dem leader Tavish Scott has written to the chancellor to invite him and the prime minister to explain why they " steam - rollered " through Lloyds ' takeover of HBOS .
In his letter , Mr Scott challenges the chancellor and prime minister : " There is broad consensus in the Scottish Parliament that there should be an inquiry into Scottish banking .
" I 'm sure that MSPs would welcome you and the prime minister to explain why , as Scottish MPs , you drove through this takeover . "
He calls the situation a " debacle " .
" We know that the money would have been better used to fully nationalise HBOS and leave Lloyds fully in the private sector , " he claims .
Meanwhile , shadow business secretary Kenneth Clarke branded the merger a " disaster " , especially for Lloyds TSB , and accused ministers of overseeing a " shotgun marriage " of the two banks .
" They should never have been allowed to merge , " he added .
" Lloyds TSB was a boring bank , it was a steady bank , it had n't done silly things . "
Lloyds chief executive Eric Daniels insisted the company 's longer - term prospects were brighter .
" Lloyds Banking Group has the largest UK financial services franchise , with excellent long - term earnings potential , " he added .

Six individuals accused of leaking a DVD screener of a movie to the Internet have been handed suspended jail sentences and fines of 15,000 euros .
Three of the sentenced are employees of a major European TV channel .
None of the six made any money from their actions .
The movie Les Bronzes 3 Amis Pour La Vie ( Bronzés III , Friends for Life ) was France ’s biggest box - office success in 2006 , going on to sell an impressive 10 million tickets .
However , in March 2006 two copies of the movie leaked to the Internet , one credited to a group calling themselves ‘ AcRoChE ’ and another with no credit .
The Internet uploaders had managed to acquire a DVD screener of the movie from insiders at private TV channel TF1 , one of Europe ’s largest television channels .
By November 2006 it was reported that police had begun making arrests , including some at TF1 .
Eventually , three employees of TF1 were detained , including two men aged 45 and 47 who admitted making a copy of the movie for their own private use .
Another three from outside the company using the nicknames Darkpingoo , H2o and Vb2n were also arrested for leaking the movie to Usenet , following a complaint by the video editors Union ( SEV ) and the distributor of the film .
The case was heard yesterday at the 15th Criminal Chamber of the Tribunal de Grande Instance ( TGI ) in Paris .
The court heard that the individuals did n’t profit from leaking the movie to the Internet but nevertheless , StudioCanal , the DVD publisher of the movie , was looking for stiff punishment .
It demanded jail sentences of between 2 and 4 months for the six , claiming 13 million euros losses .
With lawyers for the prosecution branding the defendants a “ Gang of Chihuahuas , ” some actors in the movie demanded 1 million euros each in damages .
The stars of the movie – Josiane Balasko , Thierry Lhermitte and Gerard Jugnot – requested a symbolic 1 euro each .
The prosecution said the leak was “ helping to torpedo the cinema market , ” but in their defense , the employees of TF1 Film Production argued that the practice of copying movies for personal use was tolerated at the company .
The court ruled that collectively the six defendants , aged 21 to 53 years old , must pay 15,000 euros damages to StudioCanal , but dismissed the multi-million Euro damages claim , issuing 1 month suspended jail sentences instead .
The stars of the movie got their 1 euro each .
Recently , France has been gathering a reputation as being tough on Internet pirates , with President Sarkozy taking a very aggressive stance .
According to Wikipedia , “ key figures within TF1 are close friends to some of the most powerful politicians in France . ”
A Newbie Switches to Ubuntu : What Worked and What Didn't ?
by Ostatic Staff - Jan. 12 , 2009
I got a kick out of reading AshPringle 's series about his New Year 's resolution to switch from Windows and the Mac to Linux for a week .
( You can find the daily entries at the bottom of this first entry . )
Remember how , when you first took the SAT , people told you to " go with your first answer - - it 's probably correct ? "
This series is by no means written by a Linux expert , but several of the off - the - cuff impressions about using Ubuntu , add - ons and more are interesting precisely because they are off - the - cuff .
Here were a few of the good takeaways that I spotted in the conclusion post of the series .
Here are AshPringle 's dislikes after his forced week of Ubuntu use :
Too many confusing names -- KDE , Compiz , Compiz Fusion , Wubi , tomato , potato .
OpenOffice 's spellcheck -- he could n't get it to work .
The inflexible wallpaper - - he could n't customize wallpaper for different desktops .
Hardware issues -- Wireless adapters , graphics accelerators and other peripherals did n't work properly .
Notably , though , Ash 's list of likes after his week of Ubuntu use is longer than the list of dislikes .
Among other things , he likes :
The speed --" every operating system should run this fast , " he says .
The comprehensive antivirus software -- this is a tongue - in - cheek reference to his conclusion that nobody running Linux needs to be bogged down by antivirus software .
The cost -- it 's free !
The pre-loaded software .
The Add / Remove Programs option -- he likes how easy Ubuntu makes it to get compelling new applications .
Ash ends up concluding that he will use Ubuntu as a third operating system , but wo n't abandon Windows and the Mac , which happens to be how I work as well .
I find all three platforms to have their advantages .
Among
Ash 's list of pros , I definitely concur that Linux distros of all stripes need to do a better job of hardware compatibility .
Whenever people switch to Linux , they immediately start caterwauling about Wi-Fi compatibility and the like .
The Linux Foundation has done some good work toward getting better industry - wide handling of drivers , and more buy - in from hardware makers , but there is still work to be done .
On Ash 's list of likes , one item that really jumps out to me is his quip about anti-virus software ( you do n't need any on Linux ) .
I do n't recommend going without AV software on any platform , but it is true that both the Mac and Linux are becoming more attractive as security problems persist for Windows .
If you use Windows , you constantly have to scan for malware , and often use multiple products to do so because of the sheer volume of nastiness aimed at the platform .
Ash serves up quite a few more interesting conclusions .
Good reading .
Well , you did n't ask for it , but here it is : Miley Cyrus 's Upskirt pics in London .
I know some of you perverts appreciate a good pan ...
I do n’t often disagree with ScepticIsle , but I do on one point .
He says we ’re sleepwalking towards a police state .
I fear we ’re marching there .
From tomorrow , it will , in effect , be illegal to photograph policemen .
Of course , the government will claim that the intention of this act is to stop terrorists preparing to kidnap policemen .
This is phooey .
For one thing , we know that so - called “ anti- terrorist ” laws are used to harass innocent people and have no use in catching terrorists .
And the police are already using absurd pretexts to stop people taking photos .
Instead , the effect of this measure is obvious .
Say the police are attacking an innocent person - which they do .
A by - passer takes photos as evidence .
He is then arrested under the act and the photos then disappear .
The CPS then drops charges against the police as it has no evidence .
It does n’t matter that our by - passer will probably escape conviction as he has a “ reasonable excuse . ”
The damage is done .
It ’s already very difficult to prosecute the police even when a jury finds that they lied through their teeth .
This act will make it even harder , and will enable the police to further mistreat and harrass ordinary people .
The police are , in effect , above the law .
What ’s more , whereas the public cannot photograph the police , the police are increasingly freely photographing even wholly innocent members of the public .
In this sense , the police - far from being the servants of the public , as Robert Peel intended , are increasingly becoming an army of occupation .
Any of you , I suspect , could give everyday examples of an arrogance more suited to an ill - disciplined mob than to a public service .
Herein , though , lies something that puzzles me .
Leftists of my generation were raised to be deeply suspicious of the police : Blair Peach Cherry Groce , and the miners strike taught us this .
Why is it , then , that a government many of whose members were similarly socialised should be so keen to give them even more power , even though they know this will be misused ?
A new version of the quick - firing Linux keyboard launcher GNOME
Do landed last week , bringing with it a " theme " that acts as a whole new desktop interface .
Let 's check out how it works .
Advertisement
If you 're just getting started with GNOME Do , head to the release page and check out how to download the latest version for your distribution .
Using the Docky " theme " requires a 3D compositing manager like Compiz Fusion , or GNOME 's built - in 3D effects .
Advertisement
After installing GNOME
Do , launch it from your applications menu or with a gnome - do terminal command .
Click the options arrow in the upper - right of the main window , and set your keyboard shortcut ( Windows key + Space is the default ) and choose the " Docky " theme .
You 'll get a strip across the bottom of your screen , re-sizable by dragging on the edges with a mouse , and still functional as your main GNOME
Do window for searches and action shortcuts .
When it first launches , GNOME
Do fills your dock bar with recently frequently accessed items , book - ended by a GNOME
Do options button on the far left and a functional trash can on the right end :
Advertisement
That calendar item is actually a link to a Google Calendar event I created in GNOME Do , and as seen above , Docky knows what tools to offer for it .
Removing these items is a quick right - click option , or a drag onto the desktop if you want to preserve the shortcut .
Left alone , Docky will keep your dock , whatever size you 've made it , filled with items you 've recently accessed , but you can pin any file , folder or shortcut to the dock and keep it there :
Advertisement
When you 've got apps with multiple windows and documents open , Docky takes the Windows 7 approach , giving you access to each window and document .
You can also see at a glance how many windows are open for each app by checking the little LED - like blips under each icon :
Advertisement
The real reason the GNOME
Do team incorporated Docky was n't to start a needless competition with AWN for dominance of the desktop 's bottom edge , though .
Docky integrates directly with what you get done in GNOME Do's launcher .
So , let 's say you find yourself repeatedly tapping in the shortcut to create a new Remember the Milk task , check a certain Google Calendar , IM a frequent contact through Pidgin , or any of the other plugin - powered abilities of GNOME Do ; the launcher transforms Docky into a standard , contextual launcher reminiscent of Quicksilver for Macs :
Advertisement
If you want to keep a search , shortcut , or just about anything you can pull up in the launcher window handy , hit the little " + " sign in the lower - left when it 's pulled up , and it 's pinned to your Docky bar , with smart right - click contexts kept in tact :
Advertisement
There 's not much more to show in screenshots , because Docky , like GNOME
Do , is all about figuring out a system that works for you , using a wide array of wide - open tools .
I 'll say here , however , that Docky does n't offer the customized looks , responses , or effects of a dock like AWN , but it 's seriously fast , and , at least in my Ubuntu 8.10 experience , less crash - prone than AWN and its many Python - powered dock applets .
Read more on Docky 's features at its wiki page .
Have you been checking out Docky or the latest GNOME Do ?

The world faces its worst recession since the Second World War , with the UK on course to be bottom of the international growth league among the major advanced economies , according to the latest forecasts from the International Monetary Fund .
The British economy will shrink by 2.8 % this year , says the IMF , with dire implications for jobs , house prices and the public finances .
As recently as November , the IMF forecast a relatively mild downturn of 1.3 % in the UK .
In its latest World Economic Outlook , the IMF now sees economic activity contracting by around 1.5 % in the United States , 2 % in the eurozone , and 2.5 % in Japan .
Two of the brightest stars in the economic firmament , China and India , have seen their growth forecast slashed to 6.75 % and 5 % respectively .
The global economy as a whole is perilously near to shrinking , with a mere 0.5 % growth predicted — the lowest since the 1940s .
“ We now expect the global economy to come to a virtual halt , ” said Olivier Blanchard , the IMF 's chief economist .
The International Labour Organisation said that global unemployment and poverty are set for a “ dramatic increase ” in the coming year .
The UN agency added that in a worst - case scenario , recorded unemployment could rise by more than 50 million from 2007 levels to 230 million , or 7.1 % of the world 's labour force , by the end of 2009 .
The scale of economic decline forecast for the UK by the IMF suggests that the jobless figure would exceed three million within a year , surpassing peaks last experienced in the 1980s .
Yesterday , the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the UK faces a £ 20 bn - a - year “ double whammy ” of tax rises and spending cuts to restore public finances to order — it will take until 2029 for government debt to recede to levels seen before the credit crunch .
It warned taxes would rise and spending would be cut whoever wins the next election .
As Mr Brown spoke of the “ deep world recession ” , the reports added to jitters among Labour MPs .
They are starting to express concern that the Government 's initiatives are cutting little ice with the public and are urging Gordon Brown to find “ new language ” to explain his measures .
One senior Labour figure and Brown ally told The Independent : “ He needs to start using simpler language to explain the measures we are taking .
He keeps repeating phrases like ‘ global recession ' , but that is too much jargon .
He needs to say , ‘ Look , we 're facing problems .
The whole world is facing problems .
But we 're helping to sort it out . '
The average man on the street is not going to understand our message if it contains too much economics . ”
Opposition parties seized on the double blow to Mr Brown 's efforts to reassure his MPs .
George Osborne , the shadow Chancellor , said : “ Gordon Brown cannot answer the simplest question of all : if Britain is well prepared as he claims , why are we facing the worst recession in the world ? ”
And Vince Cable , the Liberal Democrats '
Treasury spokesman , claimed : “ The Prime Minister likes to pretend Britain is simply the victim of a global crisis , but many of the UK 's problems are clearly home grown . ”
Alistair Darling , the Chancellor , warned of a grim start to 2009 , forecasting " a lot of downsides " in the period ahead .
In an interview with the New Statesman published today he insisted : " We will get through it . "
Stephen Timms , the Treasury Minister , conceded that the Government would have to revise its forecasts for the public finances in the Budget this spring .
" Things are changing , that is true and we will need to update them when we get to the Budget , " he said .
Today , Mr Brown will try to paint an upbeat picture of a post - recession Britain as Lord Carter , the Communications Minister , outlines plans to make high - speed broadband available to all .
In a speech in London , the Prime Minister will say the digital economy market is worth over £ 50 bn a year in Britain alone and expected to grow rapidly in the future .
" So even at this difficult time for the economy , we will not turn our backs on the future , we will build bridges to the future .
From the digital economy to fuel - efficient cars , from pharmaceuticals to renewables , Britain must invest in the industries of the future even as we fight our way out of what the IMF has described as a ' global economic slump ' . "
The IMF 's downbeat view found agreement among the elite financiers and economic thinkers gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland .
George Soros , who " broke the Bank of England " in the ERM crisis of 1992 , said the size of the problem facing world 's financial system is " significantly larger than in the 1930s " .
Nouriel Roubini , Professor of Economics at New York University added : " There is nowhere to hide ...
We have for the first time in decades a global synchronized recession .
This is not your traditional minor recession . "
The IMF says the tax cuts and public spending and borrowing boosts administered by governments all over the world will be useless unless the financial system is rebooted .
IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss - Kahn issued a blunt warning : " If there 's not a restructuring of the banking system , then all the money you can put into [ monetary and fiscal ] stimulus will just go into a black hole . "
Belfast Telegraph
Jan. 29 , 2009  --
Could your cookware and cleaning supplies make it harder for you to have a baby ?
In the current issue of Human Reproduction , researchers suggest that chemicals called perfluorinated compounds , or PFCs for short , might be linked to delays in getting pregnant .
But study authors and experts in the field caution that the findings are preliminary and mainly highlight an area that needs more research .
" The finding is interesting , " says one of the study 's authors , Joseph K. McLaughlin , professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville , Tenn .
" We need to know more about these chemicals because they are long lasting and have had effects in animals . "
And until more is known , the researchers say , changes in health policy are unlikely .
" This is the first study in the world that has looked at this particular association , " says lead study author Dr. Jorn Olsen , chair of the Department of Epidemiology at the UCLA School of Public Health .
" Normally we do n't base our conclusions on public health information on one study .
We need to wait for other studies to make policy recommendations . "
PFCs Abound in Everyday Environment
PFCs are everywhere .
They 're found in Teflon cookware , the original Scotchgard , some shampoos , floor wax , food wrapping , carpet treatments and other cleaning products .
PFCs are also present in air and water in the form of industrial waste from chemical plants .
" The whole issue of things in our environment affecting reproduction is important , and any studies that bring attention to it are of value , " says Dr. Howard Zacur , professor and director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore .
There have already been animal studies demonstrating the toxic effects of PFCs .
" In the laboratory , we 've seen negative effects in animals , " says Dr. Philip Landrigan , professor and chairman of Community and Preventive Medicine at the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York City .
" We 're now starting to see studies looking at the impact they [ PFCs ] have in humans . "
The study released Wednesday looked at 1,240 women in the Danish Birth Cohort when they were six to 12 weeks pregnant .
If they reported that it took them longer than 12 months to get pregnant or if they used drugs designed to increase their chances of conceiving , they were considered to have infertility .
This is a generally accepted definition of infertility by experts in the field .
An Apparent Increase in Risk
Researchers found that for higher levels of PFCs in the blood , the odds of infertility increased from 70 to 134 percent for one kind of PFC called PFOS , while another PFC called PFOA was linked to a 60 to 154 percent increase in the chance of infertility .
This apparent increase in risk existed even after researchers took other factors into account , such as age of the parents and economic and social factors .
" The most potent aspect of the study ... is that [ the researchers ] see a ' dose - response relationship , ' " Landrigan says , referring to the idea that as the level of exposure goes up , so does the apparent effect on the individual exposed .
" When you see that kind of parallel trend , especially for the two PFC compounds they looked at , this is very powerful evidence . "
Not So Fast , Researchers Say
But McLaughlin is cautious not to over - interpret the findings .
" The major strength of the study is that it is a world - class nationwide longitudinal study of pregnant women .
Do I believe that PFCs really affect time to pregnancy ?
It remains to be seen . "
Dr. Richard Paulson , chief of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at the University of Southern California , agrees .
" The study can only show an association and not causation , " he says .
" The time to pregnancy is dependent on so many different factors that it would be impossible to control for all of them . "
In the paper , the authors admit that they did not have information on some other important factors that affect fertility , including the frequency and timing of intercourse and sperm quality .
" Nevertheless , it is provocative to have an association between these chemicals and time to pregnancy , " Paulson says .
" We should be anxiously awaiting further confirmation of these preliminary results in future , larger , hopefully prospective , studies . "
Limiting Your Exposure
The jury is still out on what impact , if any , PFCs have on fertility .
Even so , several years ago the U.S. Environmental and Protection Agency negotiated with 3 M , the sole manufacturer of PFOS , to stop producing the chemical .
Since that time , however , PFOA continues to be used and the EPA does not have enough information to recommend that consumers stop using products that contain it .
But they have created a voluntary program for companies to reduce and ultimately eliminate PFOA emissions and product content by 2015 .
' Stop Using Teflon '
Landrigan , however , says a more aggressive approach is needed .
" PFCs are n't banned but there are a couple of common sense things people can do to reduce their exposure , " he says .
" There 's a lot we do n't know about toxicity but we can use common sense .
" So stop using Teflon frying pans , do n't use scotch guard that contains these compounds and , whenever possible , families should think twice about using plastic to store food and should go back to glass . "

When you think about places to post advertisements , rants , and just general ridiculousness , Craigslist should be at the top of the list .
Each and every day , hundreds of thousands of people flock to Craigslist to buy things , look for love or sex , and look for jobs .
With so many people coming together in one place , you can bet that hilarity will ensue .
Thankfully , the Craigslist Gods foresaw such a possibility , and the Best of Craigslist was born .
Essentially , the Best of Craigslist consists of numerous posts about many different things , having been nominated for a prize .
When perusing the oodles of entries , you can tell that some not - so - funny ones were selected by people who just decided to be idiots and nominate worthless posts .
Such people clearly have lives that they are ashamed of , and if they are n’t , well , they should be !
However , there are some true pearls of mediocrity on Best of Craigslist .
These posts have made their way to the surface of the oozing amounts of crap exuded by numerous other posts .
That is why , the following posts ( in no particular order , mind you ) should be thought of as “ The Top 10 Most Ridiculous Craigslist Posts of All Time ” :
1 . Let us frolic in my totally dope blanket fort
Obviously , the post title gets one ’s attention , and is the epitome of ridiculous .
Then , of course , it only gets better when you check out the pictures of this guy ’s “ totally dope ” blanket fort .
Clearly , this guy went to all the trouble of building a fabulously crappy blanket fort in the feeble attempt to prove that he could do so .
At least he admits that it ’s crappy , calling it just a “ prototype . ”
Um , hello ?
If you want to impress the ladies , oh Blanket Fort Man , you should have built an impressive blanket fort in the first place .
Do n’t you know that women only want guys who can build AMAZING blanket forts ?!
Nevertheless , let ’s hope that , if this guy did n’t find love , he at least found better blankets .
2.Haunted toaster
It ’s hard enough selling things on Craigslist , so people have resorted to selling things with a bit of extra provenance .
Take this woman , who claims that the haunted toaster hates her and burns her toast .
If that is the case , well then , they ’re a lot of haunted toasters .
Or maybe , just MAYBE , there are a lot of ridiculously stupid people out there who ca n’t figure out how to use a toaster !
If nothing else , though , it would have been very amusing to watch her drop the toaster off the roof , which is probably what ended up happening .
3. My Casual Encounters Experience
Oh yes , the seedy side of Craigslist is exposed here .
It ’s funny to read the disclaimer when entering these more sinister parts of Craigslist , in which they advise people to practice safe sex .
Yeah , like that happens .
The people who are desperate enough to post an advertisement looking for NSA ( No Strings Attached for all you virgins out there ) are n’t thinking about that , They want to get it on , and get it on quickly .
Clearly , this ridiculous post shows the rantings of a very sexually frustrated and overall bitter woman .
She wasted her time ranting on good ‘ ol Craigslist , when she could have , say , gone out into the real world and possibly met a well - endowed , normal guy .
On the other hand , with all of the trouble she went to , she might as well have just purchased a vibrator .
4. Space Ship for Sale $ 3500.00 or best offer
Upon first reading the title to this classically ridiculous post , you might think that it was some sort of a joke , that a person was drunk and just put up an advertisement for kicks .
Not this time , and there is ridiculously amazing photographic evidence to prove it .
Yes , this person really did build a spaceship .
Or , one could call it a cosmically themed sculpture of some sort , since ( well , hopefully ) it does n’t actually run , landing sensors or not .
If it DID happen to be in working order , I think you ’d agree that $ 3500.00 is quite a reasonable price .
5. Large Glass Jar ( possibly containing a ghost )
Why is it that people are resorting to selling haunted things on Craigslist ?
Really now , enough is enough .
However , if you ’re ridiculously stupid like this poster , you too can buy a foggy glass ( or is it plastic ? ) jar and pretend that the ghost of George Harrison is inside !
6 . Trying to have a missed connection – m4w
One of the most interesting sections of Craigslist is the “ Missed Connections ” section .
There , people who gazed lustily at a total stranger from afar can post to see if that same stranger noticed them too .
How romantic .
Let ’s face it , who would n’t want to have a missed connection ?
So , be ridiculous like this guy , and post an advertisement in which you actually want to coordinate a missed connection .
Um , part of the fun of a missed connection is that it ’s completely , totally missed !
Maybe this guy was confused , and was just awkwardly asking for a date .
Well , for his sake , and any of those who actually were silly enough to respond to his advertisement , let ’s hope so .
7 . No taxation without representation
This post is not just ridiculous in the amount of time and angered effort ( note the aggressive use of the Caps Lock key ! ) that was put into creating it , it ’s also ridiculously true .
Clearly , it took tax season for these truths to become self - evident to this angry person .
One can just imagine Mr. or Mrs. Angry Person standing on a soapbox , screaming about taxation atrocities .
Only , these screams will probably be falling on deaf ears ; everyone else will be too busy doing something that this person clearly does n’t do enough of : WORKING .
8. Rant : Person with a wooden leg that lives above me
Everyone at some point has had an annoying neighbor .
However , this person actually was ridiculous enough to write a letter to a neighbor who quite possibly has a wooden leg .
Or , as this person muses , might like wearing stilts .
Um , hello ?
First of all , the person is far too busy walking around and being noisy to read your rant .
Second of all , ever heard of that marvelous little invention called high heels ?
9 . Things I ’d like to tell students that would probably get me fired
Probably the most ridiculous thing about this post is that this neurotic person tells off his or her imaginary students in really not - so - blunt ways , mixed in with jokes that are horribly bad .
C’mon now , stop being such a coward !
Be like Morgan Freeman in the movie Lean On Me .
Okay , so he was a principal , not a professor , but the man got his point across with a bat !
The key thing here is he commanded respect without ever having to use it .
In the case of this ridiculous professor , this whiny rant gets an F .
10 . Autographed Copy of Plato ’s Republic
Finally , someone ’s selling something that is n’t haunted !
How refreshing .
Obviously , the ridiculousness of this post is self - explanatory .
Alas , there ’s no price mentioned in this advertisement .
Surely such a gem would be priceless , at least to someone who actually cares about philosophy .
This begs the question : what does it mean to truly care ?
Does philosophy truly have one definition ?
Oh , shut up .
There you have it , the 10 most ridiculous posts on Craigslist .
Of course , there are hundreds of other posts to read on there and laugh at .
So , the next time you ’re on a boring lunch break , why not check them out ?
Or , better yet , post one yourself .
Just make sure it ’s ridiculous .
Honda has invented robot legs .
As you can see , this assistive device is designed to help handicapped , elderly or people who stand for a long time , such as factory workers .
The device is designed to reduce stress and make you feel less tired .
Engineer Jun Ashihara said ,
This should be as easy to use as a bicycle .
It is still not yet commercially available and no price has been set .
This seems similar to HAL .
We are just waiting for day an entire body suit is invented so we can become a cyborg .

Video after the break .
It looks as if scientists will one day be able to manipulate genes to create super humans .
I hope it happens soon .
http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2009/01/are-we-close-to.html
The thing that most interested me is the ability to borrow features from one species and embed them in another .
I ca n’t wait to get my tail and wings .
Flying monkeys got a bad reputation from The Wizard of Oz , but I ca n’t think of a cooler way to go .
Obviously I would n’t wear the bell hop costume , or even pants .
But that ’s okay because I would be covered with fur , everywhere except for my genetically enhanced giraffe - style genitalia .
I ’d be giving up something in terms of aerodynamics , but you have to make tradeoffs .
I think most people would want to have wings if they had the option .
But it would be a mistake to choose the form factor of a bird .
You want to go with the monkey design for your fuselage so you get the gripping hands and feet .
You do n’t want to have giraffe - style genitalia and nothing but two scratchy feet and a beak .
That ’s just asking for trouble .
The most exciting part of this wonderful future is that when you can fly , the whole world is your toilet .
You might want to avoid any homes that have anti-winged - monkey artillery , and there might be a lot of that in the future , but everywhere else is fair game .
Some people might manipulate their genes to become smarter .
I think that ’s a mistake , especially after you become a winged monkey .
The smarter you are , the more easily bored you will be .
I want to be happy all the time so I ’d trim 40 % off my IQ and get some new hobbies such as collecting rocks that are roundish , or running for Congress .
Well , I can dream .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) - Key fault lines are emerging at the Federal Reserve over the central bank 's journey into uncharted monetary policy .
In a speech on Tuesday , Philadelphia Fed Bank president Charles Plosser publicly took issue with positions advocated by Fed chief Ben Bernanke .
In a breathtaking innovation in monetary policy , the Bernanke Fed since the fall has not only expanded its balance sheet from $ 900 billion to well over $ 2 trillion in its efforts to restore the credit markets to health but has stopped offsetting the expanding bank reserves .
The Fed has begun purchasing commercial paper , mortgage - backed securities , and other assets to keep the markets from collapsing .
Bernanke signaled on Monday that it was full speed ahead with these new purchases .
See full story .
He even talked about an expansion of the plan - saying the Fed 's plan to purchase consumer and small business loans with the help of the Treasury was a model " that can be expanded to accommodate higher volumes or additional classes of securities as circumstances warrant .
He said he sees no near - term problem with inflation .
On the other hand , Plosser urged the Fed to " proceed with caution " with the new policy .
Others outside the Fed are much more strident and want plans in place immediately to reverse it .
They believe an inflation storm is already in train .
" It is a huge disagreement , " said Robert Brusca , chief economist at FAO Economics .
While the Fed chairman has made it a practice to run a more democratic central bank , the disagreements come at a crucial time when the Fed is striving to appear on top of the current financial market crisis and steep recession .
Bernanke argued that focusing on the size of the balance sheet misses the point , arguing the Fed 's various asset purchase programs are not easily summarized in a single number .
But Plosser said that the growth of the Fed 's balance sheet was a key metric .
" It is not appropriate to ignore quantitative metrics in this new policy environment , " Plosser said .
On the surface , the debate is about how the describe the programs .
Bernanke and Fed officials have gone to great lengths to say that the new policy is not " quantitative easing " similar to the Bank of Japan 's actions in the 1990s .
Instead , Bernanke called the new program " credit easing " and tried to put the focus on " the mix of loans and securities that it holds and on how this composition of assets affects credit conditions for households and businesses . "
But Plosser is bringing the spotlight right back to the Fed 's balance sheet .
" The size of the balance sheet does offer a possible nominal anchor for monitoring the volume of our liquidity provisions , " Plosser said .
Underneath the surface is a real concern about how and when the Fed tries to exit from its new monetary policy .
Fed officials who pay attention to the money supply believe that the Fed 's current policy of printing money never ends well and the danger of inflation is very high .
They believe the Fed must withdraw the stimulus before there is any sign of inflation or it is too late .
Bernanke 's remarks indicate he wants the flexibility and does n't want to tie his hands .
William Poole , who recently left his post as president of the St. Louis Fed , says it is crucial that the Fed set a target for cutting its balance sheet .
Poole said the expansion of the Fed 's balance sheet is unprecedented and research suggests that a surge of inflation is sure to follow .
" I would say if the policy is not reversed , there is a high probability that the unpleasant risk ( of inflation ) materializes , " Poole said in an interview .
" I believe that the Fed should set a hard number - a target that they take seriously for the overall size of the balance sheet , " he said .
Plosser also argued that the Fed has put its independence at risk by buying long - term assets .
He worried that some " interest groups " will try to use political persuasion to stop the Fed from selling these longer - term assets even if the central bank has decided it makes sense .
" We will need to have the political fortitude to make some difficult decisions about when our policies must be reversed or unwound , " Plosser said .
Bernanke said that he would watch this situation closely but did n't expect it to be a " significant problem . "
Poole said he was very concerned that the Fed could simply lend money to anyone , without constraint .
In the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe during the Cold War era , economies were inefficient because they had a soft - budget constraint .
If a firm got into trouble , the banking system would give them more money , Poole said .
The current situation at the Fed seems eerily similar , he said .
" What is discipline - where are the hard choices - when does Fed say our resources are exhausted ? "
Poole asked .
( The Frisky ) --
What do you get when you fall in love ?
According the fan - freaking - tastic Dionne Warwick -- and she should know from heartache --" You get enough tears to fill an ocean / That 's what you get for your devotion . "
Sing it , sister !
You can find ways to trash your date to avoid falling in love .
Sure , you get other stuff , too : hearts , cupids , hickeys , the fun stuff .
But sometimes the bad outweighs the good , and every once in a while a lady needs to take a break and keep her heart safe from scoundrels looking to shatter it .
However , that does n't mean you should hole up alone in beat - up pajamas with only your old pals Netflix and Jim Beam for company .
Even when you 're not in the market for love , it 's good to keep one toe in the dating pool .
You just need to date effectively .
Here are some ways to keep your heart safe while the rest of you has fun .
1 . Date only the wildly inappropriate :
If you 're an early riser , date a party boy who'll turn your mornings into misery .
If you 're a Sporty Spice , trawl the local comic books store and land yourself a sweet dork who could n't arm - wrestle his way out of a Mylar bag ( that 's what they store comics in , FYI ) .
Eventually , the novelty of dating The Other will wear off , and you 'll be single again , but without any of the heartache that usually accompanies breakups .
2 . Take up recreational complaining :
Whine about your health , your stress level , your childhood , the meal you just ate .
If it exists , you can put a negative spin on it .
3 . Pair the bitching and moaning with bragging :
If you 're artful enough , you can combine the two .
" I 'm so tired because I was out all night at a totally hot new restaurant , fending off some guy named Josh ... something ... Hartnett ?
Anyway , apparently he 's an actor .
I do n't know because I do n't own a television .
I 'm far too busy with my literature to watch movies . "
4. Develop an annoying catchphrase and use it constantly : Why ?
" Cause I'm a GIRL ! " or " Catch ya on the flipside ! " are fairly effective man deterrents to call into play if a date is going too well .
Extra points if you can combine it with an obnoxious hand gesture .
5 . If , God forbid , you find yourself starting to really like a guy , pick out his negative traits : Believe me , even Mr. Right has a little wrong .
It can be anything -- his pecs might be too firm , his taste in cinema could be too smart , or maybe he 's just too good looking .
I mean , who wants to go out with someone prettier than you ?
If you look hard enough , you 'll find something .
Then , every time you start to fall , you can stop yourself by focusing on his ragged cuticles or sometimes - difficult - to - decipher French accent .

EVERY week parents of private school students are losing their homes to bankruptcy actions taken by cash - strapped schools that can no longer wait for overdue fees .
There had been a 25 per cent increase in schools pursuing debtors to bankruptcy in the past year , said Roger Mendelson , the chief executive of Prushka , a debt collection agency that represents more than 400 private schools .
He said that as a result , " across the nation a few homes every week " were sold by trustees .
New Hampshire Fights Back Against Massachusetts Sales Tax Plan ( The Border War is on ) Part 2
For background on this issue you can read my previous posts on this issue here , here , and here .
The border war between New Hampshire and Massachusetts is heating up .
New Hampshire legislators are furious at Massachusetts ’ attempt to sue New Hampshire businesses and force them to collect Massachusetts sales taxes for them , a clear violation of the United States Constitution .
Governor Lynch has already announced that the New Hampshire attorney general will file a motion in the court case to “ ensure that New Hampshire businesses will not become agents of Massachusetts tax authorities , ” and today he has announced that he is in favor of legislation to protect New Hampshire businesses from the communist down under .
The fight against collection efforts north of the border by the Massachusetts Department of Revenue now involves the New Hampshire Legislature as well as the Bay State ’s top court .
Today , Lynch said he favors a change in state law to protect New Hampshire businesses from being required to collect Massachusetts sales taxes .
This is Governor Lynch ’s statement from today :
We need to send a clear message that Massachusetts and other states shall not impose their sales taxes on New Hampshire businesses
All comments to every article that I have read about this issue signal a verbal call to arms .
Residents of New Hampshire are just as upset about this as Massachusetts residents .
The New Hampshire government is just as upset about this as the people .
For the first time as governor , John Lynch is taking a stand .
For the first time I agree with him .
It is kind of ironic however because the man who has brought increased taxes and fees and spending to New Hampshire residents is now trying to stop Massachusetts from enforcing a tax law .
It is also ironic because if John Lynch does n’t reign in his out of control spending he may be the governor that implements a New Hampshire sales tax .
The question is , if Massachusetts loses this court case does it really help the residents of Massachusetts ?
It may because there is no way that the state will be able to enforce the “ use ” tax on the individual residents , that is why they are trying to thwart the constitution in the first place .
I feel that if this attempt by Massachusetts fails than the state will be forced to abandon the notion of the “ use ’ tax .
Bocsánat , ez most nincs magyarul , mert lusta vagyok …de csak sima pörkölt recept a külföldieknek .
Well , originaly , I thought , the only recipe I would n’t post about on this site would be the one of a Hungarian goulash .
However , then I looked around a bit on internet ( before , of course I was never looking for a goulash recipe , since it ’s something I ’ve cooked thousend times .. ) , have discovered a lot of different recipes with the title of an „ authentic Hungarian goulash recipe ” and seeing those , I told myself , oh yes , post it !
And my parcel sent in the framework of the EBPP ( help , where is it , it should have arrived already and no signs yet …. ) also contains a few ingredients and maybe my adressee is willing to try it .
So without any further much ado and without going into poetry about the history of the Hungarian cuisine – which I shall do another time but I ’m so lazy for right now ..
( but here I found a good article if you are interested –although the author seem to have a Polish name , but still .. ) , here we go :
Let ’s start with some quick : there might be some confusion about what exactly is called a goulash ( although I think maybe only English speaking Hungarians may have created this confusion because for everyone else it seems to be obvious that it ’s that thick meat stew . )
But in theory it could cover the following Hungarian dishes : – a slowly cooked thick meat stew ( it looks like on the picture above ) which can be made of all kinds of meat : beef , chicken , pork or even fish .
I consider this one as the typical Hungarian stew that is translated as a goulash in other languages .
My recipe goes for this .
It ’s served normally with bite size dumplings ( galuska ) , or boiled potatoes ( or even sometimes with plain pasta in school or company cantines ) – goulash soup - you see , this one at least really contains the word goulash .
This is indeed a liquid soup – the preparation starts exactly the same way as of a stew but then more water is added , plus vegetables ( a few carrots , parnsnips and a lot of cubed potatoes ) .
In terms of spices , it contains caraway seeds .
So , it has really a soup consistancy and is eaten with some good fresh bread .
This one is made of beef only . – this one is mainly known as the famous chicken paprikash .
It is mostly made of - well , chicken , but it ’s also common to prepare it with veal or also fish ( such as freshwater catfish ) .
The base is absolutely the same as with pörkölt but then a bit more water is added and at the very end of the cooking the sauce is thickened with the addition of sour cream and flour .
So it has more sauce on it as pörkölt .
This one is always served with dumplings .
( Ok , and finally we also have something which is really called GULYÁS – as it is - it would be a dish somewhere between a pörkölt and a gulyás soup – it would be thicker then a soup and contain potatoes .
This would be mainly cooked outdoor in a big cast - iron kettle ( bogrács ) and most of the time a good amount of red wine would also be added .
This is often prepared during folkloristic events for tourists , sometimes at outdoor parties but very rarely in home - cooking .
And by the way , all above ( well , at least the three first ones ) are dishes which are cooked and eaten in everyday life in Hungary , so those are not touristy dishes offered only on restaurant menus for foreigners but something which families prepare and eat very often .
Now , to the .
Of course , you can imagine , there are as many different goulash recipes as cooks .
So , this is how we prepare it in my family and I would consider is as a basic recipe for a pörkölt .
I think it ’s really easy to cook it and you just absolutely can’t go wrong if you follow a few basic rules .
There a twoof a good goulash : the ingredients youto it and the ones you In my opinion the secret ingredient of a perfect Hungarian stew ( besides a good quality Hungarian paprika of course ) is .
A lot .
More .
A lot more !!
For 1 kg meat ( two pounds ) I would use about 3 - 4 big onions .
That seem to be a lot but this will create your thick sauce .
As you ’re simmering the stew on very low heat for about 1,5 hours , the onions melt into a sweet , spicy sauce , so you wo n’t have any pieces of it at the end .
What youwould add to a pörkölt are any of the following ones : flour , butter , canned tomatoes ( all three I see in many „ authentic ” recipes ) .
There are a few optional ingredients that could be added , this really depends on your taste , on habits and on what you have on hand .
( e.g. pork fat instead of oil , smoked bacon , green pepper , fresh tomato , red wine , caraway seeds ) 1 kg beef for stews , cubed3 - 4 big onions , finely chopped4 - 5 tbsp groundnut oil3 - 4 tbsp best quality Hungarian sweet paprikasalt , pepper1 green pepper , sliced ( the kind which is on the picture , not bell peppers ) 1 fresh tomato ( this one I add only if I ’m in Hungary or if I can get some really tasty good quality tomato , otherwise it just makes the sauce too watery and sour and does n’t add anything to the flavour ) Heat oil in a saucepan .
Add the finely chopped onions and cook until translucent .
Now comes an important secret step : remove the saucepan from the heat and now add the paprika – this is very important as if you would do this step still on the heat , the paprika could burn from the sudden heat and get bitter .
Put it back , add beef cubes and stir so that the spicy onion mix covers th meat evenly .
Cover with about 100 - 150 ml water so that the liquid does n’t completely cover the meat .
Add the sliced green pepper , the whole tomato ( later will be removed at the end ) , salt , pepper .
Simmer covered on very low heat for about 1 - 1,5 hours .
After 1 hour , check , add a litle more water if necessary , so the stew does n’t burn .
Depending on the thickness of the sauce , cook for 10 - 15 minutes uncovered so that all the liquid reduces and all what you get is a spicy , thick sauce which covers the meat .
It tastes even better reheated , I normally prepare it a day ahead .
While the economy is hitting technology companies hard , a new report suggests that corporate information technology jobs may be a bit more recession - proof .
Computer Economics 's 2009 IT Salary Report finds that while salary growth has slowed , IT worker pay is still projected to increase on average by 2 percent this year -- and the salaries of IT executives , managers and software developers are outpacing others in the field .
Computer Economics has published its report on IT salaries for the last 20 years , John Longwell , research director at Computer Economics , told InternetNews.com .
The report is based on a survey of IT organizations taken in the 4th quarter of the year , collecting data on current and projected salaries for 70 specific IT job titles .
" We were quite surprised , " Longwell said .
" I expected to see at least flat growth in some areas , but we see two percent growth across the board . "
Developers are projected to see the strongest wage growth , with an average 3.6 percent salary increase in 2009 .
IT Managers are projected to see a salary increase of 3.5 percent on average , while IT executives and directors will see a 3.4 percent raise on average .
The increase in developer pay is likely linked to the need to improve efficiency , Longwell said .
" Companies still have to maintain their applications , they are still investing in legacy application modernization initiatives .
While there 's not a lot of new initiatives , they still want to squeeze more productivity out of IT .
If you 're cutting staff in general , you 're trying to make that up with more efficient IT . "
As far as managers and executives go , their salary increases may simply be offsetting decreases in other compensation , the report speculated .
" More of their compensation is based on variable incentive pay , so their overall compensation may not be rising any faster than other workers , " Longwell said .
" That 's one explanation . "
But there was no wide gulf between the wage prospects of the fastest - growing wage earners and the rest of the field in the study .
" There 's not a lot of differentiation across different levels or functions this year , " Longwell said .
" That flattening is probably related to the recession -- these raises probably have more to do with cost of living than performance - based annual raises . "
And while the report suggests that staffing levels would remain steady from 2008 to 2009 , indications are that wo n't hold for long .
" Now what we 're seeing in the preliminary polling that began in the first quarter is that the mood is changing a bit , and we are going to see some reductions in staff levels , " said Longwell .
" How much , we do n't know .
It is impacting IT , how much we do n't know , but we think IT is going to be more sheltered than some areas . "
Geert Wilders should be allowed in because this is a country that has pioneered freedom of speech , from Milton and Locke through to Mill .
We have a strong , resilient society that is capable of tolerating debate without losing its temper or making personal attacks on those who are deemed offensive .
When I debated Ayaan Hirsi Ali [ the Dutch feminist and critic of Islam ] last year , it was a civilised affair with powerful arguments on both sides and we need that sort of debate , if only to illustrate that Muslim communities are an asset to wider society .
Tolerant Muslims must be allowed to show we have the strength of our convictions and are allowed to handle criticism in a robust way , just as any other community would .
We have to show people Muslims are n't just the most sensitive , the most aggressive , the most critical community ; rather we 're very prepared to take on these debates and win .

Mr Wilders has been invited over here by Lords and Ladies who have , to put it mildly , an anti-Muslim stance .
They want to flare up divisions and show that Muslims are an aggressive bunch who wo n't tolerate free speech .

My second job in Hollywood was working for a bottom - feeding production company .
The kind that made a lot of straight to Showtime movies , basic cable primetime “ dramatic ” series , and Skinemax softcore porn .
I quickly rose through the ranks to Story Editor for one of our softcore series .
I would evaluate the scripts that came in , making sure they met our strict editorial standards ( no gang rape ) .
I also got a nifty credit on every episode of the series .
One day , my boss asked if I ’d like to write one of the episodes .
Finding out that it paid $ 800 , I quickly accepted .
A half - hour of writing work later and I submitted my script for approval to Cinemax .
They bought it , and I had my first professional writing credit on the way .
My girlfriend at the time was n’t pleased that I was employed on softcore porn .
I ’d have to work late , spending hours on set with former Playmates , Penthouse Pets , and porn stars .
It was grueling work , but someone had to do it .
Unfortunately , I missed the pussy boat .
The executive producer ( my boss ) and the producer both fucked their way through pretty much our entire cast .
By the time I was single , our company was out of the softcore business .
But while it was going on , my girlfriend was pissed and jealous , and the producer would fuck with me by having girls put their giant fake breasts on my head and moan my name while I called to tell her I ’d be working late .
When my episode was finished , I told my parents about it .
Proud Jews that they are , they told all my relatives and family friends .
The day after it aired , I got unsettling congratulatory calls from my parents and Nana telling me how impressed they were with the dialogue during the three - way scene .
Since then , I ’ve worked on dozens of TV shows and films , and have a lot of other credits under my belt .
But every job I have , someone will come up to me and tell me they saw my name on something the night before .
And every time , it ’s POON ADVENTURES : THE SAGA CONTINUES *.
* Not the actual name of the series , so do n’t bother looking it up .

Space agencies target Jupiter system for orbiters that will launch in 2020 .
NASA and the European Space Agency ( ESA ) have chosen Jupiter 's moons as the destination for their upcoming joint outer planet flagship mission .
A trip to Saturn 's moon Titan needs further study , the agencies decided .
The Europa Jupiter System Mission will launch two orbiters , one built by NASA and the other by the ESA , in 2020 , with a scheduled arrival time in the Jupiter system of 2026 .
The NASA orbiter will study the icy shell of Jupiter 's moon Europa , which may harbour an ocean capable of supporting life .
The ESA orbiter will investigate Ganymede , the largest moon in the solar system , which has a unique magnetic field .
Europa , as imaged by the New Horizons spacecraft on its way to Pluto .
NASA / JHUAPL / SwRI
" I'm thrilled " , says Robert Pappalardo , a planetary scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , who has worked on Europa mission studies for more than a decade .
" We 've been working long and hard on this .
It 's the right place to go to understand the potential habitability of icy satellites . "
Although the Europa mission was deemed more technically ready , NASA and the ESA did not close the door on a Titan mission .
" Titan will not be forgotten " , says Jim Green , director of the planetary science division at NASA headquarters in Washington DC .
The Titan studies will provide " very important " input to an upcoming ranking of potential planetary missions , he says .
The Europa mission will help scientists investigate the emergence of habitable worlds around gas giants , says Curt Niebur , a programme scientist for outer planets research at NASA .
A Titan mission would have sent a lander and a balloon to explore the moon 's organic chemistry , which may be similar to that of the early Earth .
Jonathan Lunine , a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson who supported the Titan mission , says the decision is not entirely surprising .
The Europa mission was given top priority in a 2002 community survey of solar system exploration .
" To imagine that it would turn the decadal survey process upside down was unrealistic " , he says .
Lunine says the real question is when the postponed Titan mission might occur , an issue left open by NASA .
" I 'd like to see Titan again before I die " , he says .
The NASA portion of the Jupiter mission will cost at least $ 2.5 to $ 3 billion , says Green .
The European portion of the mission , called Laplace , still needs to compete with two other missions to secure a slot within ESA 's Cosmic Vision programme .

Genetic algorithms are a mysterious sounding technique in mysterious sounding field -- artificial intelligence .
This is the problem with naming things appropriately .
When the field was labeled artificial intelligence , it meant using mathematics to artificially create the semblance of intelligence , but self - engrandizing researchers and Isaac Asimov redefined it as robots .
The name genetic algorithms does sound complex and has a faintly magical ring to it , but it turns out that they are one of the simplest and most - intuitive concepts you 'll encounter in A.I .
What Can Genetic Algorithms Do ?
In a word , genetic algorithms optimize .
They can find better answers to a question , but not solve new questions .
Given the definition of a car , they might create a better car , but they 'll never give you an airplane .
I Like The Term Genetic Programming More !
Me too -- it has a much nicer ring to it -- but unfortunately using one or the other is n't a personal preference ; they refer to different techniques .
Genetic algorithms are about optimization , while genetic programming is about using the techniques from genetic algorithms to build computer programs from primordial programming language soup .
Imagine , if you will , that you have spent the last decade trying to write a " Hello World " program in Scheme , but simply cannot overcome that tremendous hurdle .
But imagine that you were smart enough to put together a tremendous list of commands and strings , such that some combination could print " Hello World " to standard out .
Then you could mix and match the commands and strings and eventually you might generate " Hello World " , much like monkeys typing randomly will -- given an infinitely long period of time -- recreate Shakespeare .
Sort of .
So , where generic algorithms are a collection of optimization techniques , genetic programming is a novel approach for solving problems for which you already know the answer .
Ok , ok , this is n't a fair description .
We 'll take a more indepth look later in another article , for the time being lets just remember they are n't the same .
Defining a Problem to Optimize
Now we 're going to put together a simple example of using a genetic algorithm in Python .
We 're going to optimize a very simple problem : trying to create a list of N numbers that equal X when summed together .
If we set N = 5 and X = 200 , then these would all be appropriate solutions .
lst = [ 40 , 40 , 40 , 40 , 40 ] lst = [ 50 , 50 , 50 , 25 , 25 ] lst = [ 200 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ]
( I 've been told that randomly stating Pretty easy , right ?
at random junctions of articles is not helpful .
Otherwise I would have uselessly added one here . )
Ingredients of The Solution
Each suggested solution for a genetic algorithm is referred to as an individual .
In our current problem , each list of N numbers is an individual .
>>> from random import randint >>> def individual ( length , min , max ) : ... ' Create a member of the population .' ... return [ randint ( min , max ) for x in xrange ( length ) ] ... >>> individual ( 5 , 0 , 100 ) [ 79 , 0 , 20 , 47 , 40 ] >>> individual ( 5 , 0 , 100 ) [ 64 , 1 , 25 , 84 , 87 ]
The collection of all individuals is referred to as our population .
>>> def population ( count , length , min , max ) : ... " " " ... Create a number of individuals ( i.e. a population ) .
... ... count : the number of individuals in the population ... length : the number of values per individual ... min : the min possible value in an individual 's list of values ... max : the max possible value in an individual 's list of values ... ... " " " ... return [ individual ( length , min , max ) for x in xrange ( count ) ] ... >>> population ( 3 , 5 , 0 , 100 ) [ [ 51 , 55 , 73 , 0 , 80 ] , [ 3 , 47 , 18 , 65 , 55 ] , [ 17 , 64 , 77 , 43 , 48 ] ]
Next we need a way to judge the how effective each solution is ; to judge the fitness of each individual .
Predictably enough , we call this the fitness function .
For our problem , we want the fitness to be a function of the distance between the sum of an individuals numbers and the target number X .
We can implement the fitness function as follows :
>>> from operator import add >>> def fitness ( individual , target ) : ... " " " ... Determine the fitness of an individual .
Lower is better .
... ... individual : the individual to evaluate ... target : the sum of numbers that individuals are aiming for ... " " " ... sum = reduce ( add , individual , 0 ) ... return abs ( target - sum ) ... >>> x = individual ( 5 , 0 , 100 ) >>> fitness ( x , 200 ) 165
Personally , I 'd prefer to have a high fitness score correlate to a fit individual rather than the current implementation where a perfectly fit individual has a fitness of 0 , and the higher the worse .
Ah well , regardless , keep that detail in mind while following this code .
It 's also helpful to create a function that will determine a population 's average fitness .
>>> def grade ( pop , target ) : ... ' Find average fitness for a population .' ... summed = reduce ( add , ( fitness ( x , target ) for x in pop ) , 0 ) ... return summed / ( len ( pop ) * 1.0 ) ... >>> x = population ( 3 , 5 , 0 , 100 ) >>> target = 200 >>> grade ( x , target ) 116
Now we just need a way evolve our population ; to advance the population from one generation to the next .
Evolution
This is the secret sauce of genetic algorithms , where secret means fairly obvious , and sauce means sauce .
Consider a population of elk which are ruthlessly hunted by a pack of wolves .
With each generation the weakest are eaten by the wolves , and then the strongest elk reproduce and have children .
Abstract those ideas a bit , and we can implement the evolution mechanism .
For each generation we 'll take a portion of the best performing individuals as judged by our fitness function .
These high - performers will be the parents of the next generation .
We 'll also randomly select some lesser performing individuals to be parents , because we want to promote genetic diversity .
Abandoning the metaphor , one of the dangers of optimization algorithms is getting stuck at a local maximum and consequently being unable to find the real maximum .
By including some individuals who are not performing as well , we decrease our likelihood of getting stuck .
Breed together parents to repopulate the population to its desired size ( if you take the top 20 individuals in a population of 100 , then you 'd need to create 80 new children via breeding ) .
In our case , breeding is pretty basic : take the first N/ 2 digits from the father and the last N/2 digits from the mother .
>>> father = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] >>> mother = [ 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 ] >>> child = father [ : 3 ] + mother [ 3 :] >>> child [ 1,2,3,40,50,60 ]
It 's okay to have one parent breed multiple times , but one parent should never be both the father and mother of a child .
Merge together the parents and children to constitute the next generation 's population .
Finally we mutate a small random portion of the population .
What this means is to have a probability of randomly modifying each individual . >>> from random import random , randint >>> chance_to_mutate = 0.01 >>> for i in population : ... if chance_to_mutate > random ( ) : ... place_to_modify = randint ( 0 , len ( i ) ) ... i [ place_to_modify ] = randint ( min ( i ) , max ( i ) ) ...
This -- just like taking individuals who are not performing particularly well -- is to encourage genetic diversity , i.e. avoid getting stuck at local maxima .
Putting it all together , the code to evolve a generation can be implemented like this :
def evolve ( pop , target , retain = 0.2 , random_select = 0.05 , mutate = 0.01 ) : graded = [ ( fitness ( x , target ) , x ) for x in pop ] graded = [ x [ 1 ] for x in sorted ( graded ) ] retain_length = int ( len ( graded ) * retain ) parents = graded [ : retain_length ] # randomly add other individuals to promote genetic diversity for individual in graded [ retain_length :] : if random_select > random ( ) : parents .
append ( individual ) # mutate some individuals for individual in parents : if mutate > random ( ) : pos_to_mutate = randint ( 0 , len ( individual ) - 1 ) # this mutation is not ideal , because it # restricts the range of possible values , # but the function is unaware of the min/max # values used to create the individuals , individual [ pos_to_mutate ] = randint ( min ( individual ) , max ( individual ) ) # crossover parents to create children parents_length = len ( parents ) desired_length = len ( pop ) - parents_length children = [ ] while len ( children ) < desired_length : male = randint ( 0 , parents_length - 1 ) female = randint ( 0 , parents_length - 1 ) if male != female : male = parents [ male ] female = parents [ female ] half = len ( male ) / 2 child = male [ : half ] + female [ half :] children .
append ( child ) parents .
extend ( children ) return parents
Now we 've written all the pieces of a genetic algorithm , and we just have to try it out and see if it works .
Testing It Out
Here is a simple way to use the code we 've written :
>>> target = 371 >>> p_count = 100 >>> i_length = 5 >>> i_min = 0 >>> i_max = 100 >>> p = population ( p_count , i_length , i_min , i_max ) >>> fitness_history = [ grade ( p , target ) , ] >>> for i in xrange ( 100 ) : ... p = evolve ( p , target ) ... fitness_history .
append ( grade ( p , target ) ) ... >>> for datum in fitness_history : ... print datum ...
Running that code , you 'll get to watch as generations ' fitness gradually ( but non-deterministically ) approach zero .
The output of one of my runs looked like this :
[ ' 76.06 ' , ' 32.13 ' , ' 26.34 ' , ' 18.32 ' , ' 15.08 ' , ' 11.69 ' , ' 14.05 ' , ' 9.460 ' , ' 4.950 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.800 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.239 ' , ' 0.780 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 1.48 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.149 ' , ' 0.239 ' , ' 0.12 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.149 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 4.200 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 2.049 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.200 ' , ' 0.080 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 1.360 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 1.399 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.149 ' , ' 1.389 ' , ' 1.24 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.16 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.680 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 1.78 ' , ' 1.05 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 1.860 ' , ' 4.080 ' , ' 3.009 ' , ' 0.140 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.38 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 2.189 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 3.200 ' , ' 1.919 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 4.950 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' , ' 0.0 ' ]
With 20 % survival ( plus an additional 5 % of other individuals ) and 1 % mutation , it only took nine generations to reach a perfect solution .
Then the algorithm joyfully runs in circles for as long as you 'll let the mutations continue
But this is a good feeling right ?
If it only took us half an hour to solve a problem of this magnitude , imagine what we could do with a day .
A genetic algorithm for optimizing your Apache2 configuration file for number of children processes ?
Easy as pie .
There are a nearly endless variety of techniques for and variations of genetic algorithms , but all of them rest on this straight forward foundation .
We 'll look more at those sometime in the future , but for now you know enough to go out and throw together something interesting .

Alexander Bichkov , who was regarded as Russian 's own Rambo , has died in a police shoot - out
A heavily armed recluse nicknamed Russia 's Rambo of the Forest has been gunned down in a shoot - out with police .
Alexander Bichkov , had lived a semi-feral existence in the woods for 20 years , terrorising locals and the police if they ventured near him .
A giant at 6ft 7in with a wild straggly beard , the man lived in an old shack and self - made camps , hunted animals for food and only ventured out of the forest in summer when he would n't leave footprints leading back to where he lived .
Russian police said he descended from a family of criminals who were exiled by Stalin to the Kostroma region 450 miles east of Moscow , in the 1940s .
At the end of Soviet times nearly 20 years ago he disappeared from his home in a village in the region after refusing a court order to pay alimony to his ex-wife following an acrimonious divorce .
He was declared dead by his family in 1997 because he had been missing for so long .
But now it is known the former forestry worker had fled into the dense Kologriv woods near his village , which were designated as a nature reserve a few years ago .
Terrified local police refused to go into the woods to hunt him down ever since he captured a local commander while out hunting and held him at gunpoint for hours before freeing him and then disappearing into the trees .
Even after he burned down 30 holiday homes in the area belonging to rich Muscovites , police refused to pursue the man they dubbed " Rambo " , after the popular action - film hero played by Sylvester Stallone , who was skilled in weaponry and survival .
They did not know - until killing him on March 14 - his true identity , which was obtained from documents they found and through checks with his family .
He was finally shot after the head of the Department of Natural Reserves in Moscow , angered by the inaction of local police , ordered a surveillance operation on him .
After finding out where he lived , six specialist policemen - including Afghan war veterans - from outside the local police and four armed Park rangers went into the forest on snowmobiles to hunt him down and try to arrest him .

Rambo on the rampage : Having lost his faith on people our hero proceeds to kill half of Burma
But the hermit , who carried two shotguns and a home - made pistol , ambushed them and wounded two .
He then set alight a swathe of forest as a diversion , tracked behind the men and was apparently preparing to start firing on them again .
But a police sniper managed to shoot him in the head , killing him instantly .
One of the policemen , Andrei Potemkin , said : " He ambushed us and I told him to surrender and that we would n't hurt him .
" He yelled ' I 've nothing to lose ' and opened fire .
" He hit two of the others and fired at me .
My bullet - proof vest saved my life .
He then set his place on fire , and everything was covered with smoke .
" He 's a real professional .
While we were helping the wounded , he made a circle around us , hiding in the smoke , and cut us off .
" It was pure chance the sniper suddenly saw his figure in the trees and pulled the trigger .
He shot him right in the head and he died in a flash . "
Police later found in his semi- destroyed lair more weapons , dozens of furs , hundreds of traps and books about hunting and survival .
Locals told of their relief that the man who had haunted the region for so long was dead .
Maria Muzhalova said : " Parents would not let their children go to school without dogs going with them .
" He would steal boots from outside people 's homes and steal potatoes from the fields .
If you came across him in the summer , he was way too scary - looking to confront him . "
Director of the Kologriv nature reserve , Maxim Sinitzin said ; " We were all sick and tired of him .
He kept leaving traps for animals everywhere .
" We 'd break them and he'd make more .
Once he trapped three of our inspectors and told them he'd kill them if he ever saw them in the woods again . "
Police said that the man used to be a forestry worker .
After his wife left him and the court order against him , he turned into a recluse , cutting himself off from society .
He lived at an abandoned forestry station , miles from the nearest village .
Police sources said : " At the time the forest had not been designated as a nature reserve so no one bothered him for years .
" Then his parents died and his sister and her husband had him declared legally dead - as they had not seen him for so long - and sold his house .
" We think this may have enraged him , making him angry at anybody who moved into the region to build a house , so much that he would burn down their homes because he had none of his own . "
When the forest was later made into a nature reserve , hunting was banned , leading to violent clashes between Bichkov and park rangers who would remove his traps , police said .
" He felt he was the king of the forest , " one said .
" He had his house , a shed , and his hunting traps .
When we went after him he fought to the end .
" It was all he had left .
He had nowhere to go . "
Perhaps the only commendable thing newly installed Economic Dictator ( and Barton Fink look - alike ) Tim Geithner has done in a public career otherwise devoted to serving the Power Elite was to “ cheat ” on his taxes .
Given that taxation is theft , “ cheating ” the taxman is bit like refusing to disclose every hidden pocket of household wealth to an armed robber .
Unless they ’re sick unto death with some form of collectivist psychosis , Americans submit to taxation for the same reason they would pay off any other irresistibly powerful extortionist .
At some point in any conversation about taxes someone , acting with smugly misplaced confidence in the power of clich , will deploy Justice Holmes ’ dictum about taxes being “ the price we pay for civilization . ”
Actually , taxes are the price extracted from us by those determined to undermine civilization , which is built on the peaceful , mutually enriching exchange of knowledge , goods , services , sound traditions , and culture among people of goodwill .
As Justice Holmes would have understood , had he not been a blinkered positivist and deranged militarist , taxation is what fuels the forces of barbarism — the Warmakers , empire - builders , and practitioners of public plunder in all of its malignant varieties .
The “ civilizing ” deeds of such people are measured by the graveyards they have filled , the prisons and gallows they have built , and the number of names listed in the obscene war memorials they erect in their own honor , if that word applies .
All of these depredations are made possible by taxation .
By way of contrast , all of the genuinely civilized functions of life — those that take place in families , churches , the marketplace , and private associations of shared interest — require not a farthing in taxes .
Tacitus famously lamented the work of imperialists who make a desert and call it “ peace . ”
In the same fashion , tax - fed Kleptocrats impose systems of official plunder , corruption , and violence and call it “ civilization . ”
As a young man at Kissinger Associates ( KA ) , Geithner was deeply involved in brokering the kind of “ civilized ” deals the Power Elite thrives on .
Among other things , Kissinger ’s influence - peddling operation helped arrange the Iraq War :
It promoted the U.S. taxpayer - subsidized Iraqi arms build - up while simultaneously representing the state - owned Kuwaiti Petroleum Corporation .
Kleptocrat as Imperial Proconsul : L. Paul “ Jerry ” Bremer , head of the Coalition Provisional Authority in occupied Iraq , makes his rounds under the watchful eyes of his Blackwater Praetorian Guard .
One of Geithner ’s associates at that enigmatic firm was L. Paul Bremer , who went on to become the imperial proconsul in “ liberated ” Iraq following the second Gulf War .
Bremer has followed a pretty conventional Kleptocratic career arc :
He ended up presiding over the “ reconstruction ” of a country whose demolition he and his KA comrades had helped to arrange .
This proved to be immensely profitable to Geithner ’s kleptocratic cronies , who were in a position to benefit from no -bid , “ cost - plus ” contracts and the other lucrative scams that proliferated during the festive orgy of official corruption called the “ reconstruction ” of Iraq .
Oh , sure : Iraq itself was left — and remains today — a wrecked and ruined land .
But at least the Lords of Plunder made out pretty well .
Geithner is pursuing a career trajectory similar to Bremer ’s , albeit in a slightly different field .
In the years leading up to his coronation as Treasury Secretary , Geithner was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
This means he was a member in good standing in the world ’s most important criminal syndicate , the Federal Reserve System .
It also means he spent a good part of his public career abetting the destruction of the economy he now has been given dictatorial powers to “ save . ”
The Fed ’s loose money and credit policies created the inflationary boom and led to the ongoing economic bust .
Since the bust began , Geithner ’s chief priority has been to pillage the earnings of poor and middle - class Americans on behalf of the super - wealthy and politically connected .
His first service of that kind came early last summer , when he helped devise a $ 29 billion taxpayer - backed bailout of the mortally wounded Bear Stearns investment house .
At the time , both Geithner and the Capo of his criminal order , Ben Bernanke , insisted that with that bailout the investment markets had been stabilized , and the economic downturn had been arrested .
That was seven months and at least $ 3 trillion ( and probably as much as $ 8 trillion ) in taxpayer - backed bailouts ago .
During that time , Congress enacted a measure giving the Treasury Secretary — acting in collusion with the Fed Chairman — unlimited and unaccountable power to appropriate “ bailout ” funds , and disburse them as he sees fit , without congressional review or accountability of any kind .
The power of economic “ reconstruction ” has thus been vested in two of the chief demolitionists of the world economy , one of whom , Mr. Geithner , belongs to an ber-secret clique of central bankers and Keynesian socialists called the Group of 30 .
Not to put too fine a point on the matter , this group is n’t composed of the kind of people whose sleep is troubled by concerns about the impact of their machinations on the civilized affairs of Main Street .
Given his vita and associations , there ’s every reason to believe that Geithner will use the means at his disposal to siphon the wealth that remains in our economy into the hands of the international Plunderbund .
Perhaps the only genuinely interesting question left is this :
What will parasites of his kind do once they have killed their host ?

Advertisement UK unemployment rose to 1.97 million between October and December , the highest level since 1997 , figures show .
The jobless number climbed 146,000 for the three - month period , data from the Office for National Statistics showed .
For January , the number of those getting jobseeker 's allowance added 73,800 to reach 1.23 million .
The unemployment rate hit 6.3 % , the highest since 1998 , and comes as The Bank of England recently warned of a " deep recession " for 2009 .
See how unemployment has risen
Many analysts had forecast that unemployment could reach two million for the three - month period - which would have been the highest since 1997 .
But there are fears the situation will worsen further in the months ahead as the economy cools .
Tony Dolphin , senior economist at the Institute for Public Policy Research said : " Unfortunately it seems inevitable that unemployment will exceed 3 million during 2009 " .
As the recession bites , this strengthens still further the case for making a sharp reduction in the number of non-EU workers permitted to come to Britain
Sir Andrew Green , Migration Watch
Increase in foreign - born workers Peter Mooney , head of consultancy with Employment Law Advisory Services , said : " From early in December , the number of firms seeking our help in making redundancies simply exploded . "
He added : " Things will certainly get worse before they get better .
We would expect to see another significant increase in the number of people out of work in the figures published next month , as many more firms were forced to cut staff early in the New Year . "
Young people between the age of 18 and 24 have been particularly hard hit , with the unemployment rate for the three - month period standing at 11.8 % .
The number of those receiving jobseeker 's allowance has now climbed for 12 consecutive months .
At 1.23 million , it stands at the highest level since the summer of 1999 .
Apprenticeships Following the release of the data , David Kern , chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce , commented : " Unemployment continues to rise in the face of a worsening recession .
" We know businesses do not want to lose key staff , but they are struggling with cash - flow . "
Mr Kern added that cutting business rates , freezing the national minimum wage and scrapping plans to increase National Insurance would help firms retain employees .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown is meeting business leaders later to discuss how to help .
We know businesses do not want to lose key staff , but they are struggling with cash - flow

Special report : Britain 's jobless Executives from Sainsbury's , the Royal Mail , Whitbread , Centrica , National Express and Travelodge are expected to attend Downing Street for the first meeting of the National Employment Partnership .
The companies , as well as NHS and local authority leaders , will agree to advertise all non-specialist vacancies through the Jobcentre Plus network and to start offering more apprenticeships .

A local employment partnership scheme has been launched to get people back into work .
Councillor Margaret Eaton , chairman of the Local Government Association , said : " The LGA has committed to working with local authorities to increase the number of council apprenticeships by 7,500 to ensure that people are given practical skills that will stand them in good stead for years to come . "
Redundancies mounting BBC business correspondent Nils
Blythe says figures on the wider measure of unemployment - which also includes people not claiming benefits - only cover the three months up to December , so do not include the most recent job losses .
However , our correspondent says the total is expected to rise above two million once the latest redundancy programmes are captured in official statistics .
The sector with the largest fall in jobs was finance and business services , which shed 72,000 positions .
As employers seek to cut costs , the number of jobs available falls .
Vacancies for the three - month period fell to 504,000 , down 76,000 from the period to October .
In the same period a year earlier , vacancies had been 684,000 .
A TUC study said that while unemployment in the UK was lower than the European average , it was now increasing twice as fast as the average across Europe .
The UK 's unemployment rate remains below the European average , which is 7.7 % .
TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said : " The UK began the global recession with a relatively strong jobs position , but our advantage is beginning to disappear as redundancies mount . "
In the Bank of England 's latest forecast for economic growth and inflation , it said the UK economy would contract sharply in the first half of the year .

The UN 's special torture rapporteur called on the US to pursue former president George W. Bush and defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld for torture and bad treatment of Guantanamo prisoners .
" Judicially speaking , the United States has a clear obligation " to bring proceedings against Bush and Rumsfeld , the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture Manfred Nowak said . (..)
He noted Washington had ratified the UN convention on torture which required " all means , particularly penal law " to be used to bring proceedings against those violating it .
" We have all these documents that are now publicly available that prove that these methods of interrogation were intentionally ordered by Rumsfeld , " against detainees at the US prison facility in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , Nowak said .
" But obviously the highest authorities in the United States were aware of this , " added Nowak , who authored a UN investigation report on the Guantanamo prison .

Dollar Bill Origami ( or money origami ) is a type of origami that uses money instead of paper .
We hope you enjoy this collection of dollar bill origami .
Origami is an ancient Japanese art of paper folding .
The goal of this art is to create a representation of an object using geometric folds and crease patterns preferably without the use of gluing or cutting the paper , and using only one piece of square paper .

Open source is an outsider , not part of the establishment .
One price it pays for this is not being privy to all the decisions that are made in the field of governmental policy .
Too often , established players are involved without any counterbalancing input from the free software side .
Generally , we do n't see all the machinations and deals that go on here behind closed doors .
But thanks to the increasingly - indispensable Wikileaks , we have the opportunity to observe how an organisation close to Microsoft is attempting to re-write – and hijack – an important European Union open source strategy paper .
Here 's Wikileak 's explanation of why this is an important document :
This file is an edited version of the EU OSS Strategy draft with the input of Jonathan Zuck , President of the Association for Competitive Technology , an organisation that has strong ties with Microsoft
The file is a draft for an expert panel formed by the European Commission .
This panel is divided into workgroup ( IPR , Open Source , digital life , etc. ) ACT and Comptia have been infiltrating every workgroup , even the one on Open Source ( WG 7 ) .
They are doing the best they can to drown any initiative that would not only promote OSS in Europe but also that could help Europe create a sucessful European software sector .
The audience for this document could be journalists who would be interested in getting to know more how lobbies of all kind influence the European institutions .
Here it is perhaps even more stringent as ACT is clearly an US organization with ties to Microsoft .
Verifications might not be easy as this is an internal draft .
The best contact might be commission personnel : Lars.PEDERSEN@ec.europa.eu ; Michel.Lacroix@ec.europa.eu
It has been leaked as it is important to have the public know how actual policy making is being influenced by lobbies that are precisely under the legal scrutiny of the European Commission .
The urgency of the publication of this document is real in the sense that outside pressure would foce the Commission to " clean the committees " or at least give a lesser credit to the work of this workgroup .
What makes this document fascinating is that it contains both the original and modified text ( in glorious colour , so it 's really worth downloading it and taking a look ) , which means that we can see what exactly an organisation sympathetic to Microsoft – and partly funded by them – is worried about , and how it is trying to head off the threat .
The dominant theme of the changes is foregrounding what the paper calls “ mixed mode ” or “ mixed source ” : using open source with proprietary code in hybrid solutions .
For example , early on , the Context is originally described as :
To be provided as part of the OSS work group work and V2 of the EC document
But the ACT wants to change that is to this :
To be provided as part of the OSS work group work and V2 of the EC document , while noting that the increasing use of OSS within mainstream commercial offerings and mixed - source software and solutions makes a distinct treatment of or preferences for OSS more difficult to define .
Similarly , the Scope goes from
In this document OSS covers :
Open Source providers ( OSS communities ) ,
Service providers for OSS integration and support ,
to
In this document OSS covers :
Open Source providers ( OSS communities ) ,
Service providers for OSS integration and support ,
OSS as part of mixed solutions blending open and proprietary code .
It 's easy to see the hand of Microsoft in this , albeit indirectly , since this is precisely the current line it is pushing : that , yes , open source has its place , but that place is in a world where open source and proprietary are treated as if they were the same thing , and ignoring the special characteristics of the former so as to negate them .
Here 's another telling change , later on , when this :
At the current point in time it is impossible to predict when and if that trend will come to an end the future of mixed mode .
New companies enter the market with models spanning the entire range of proprietary models over mixed models to OSS models .
Only time will show which models will be most successful in Europe .
becomes this :
At the current point in time it is impossible to predict the future of mixed mode .
New companies enter the market with models spanning the entire range of proprietary models over mixed models to OSS models .
The economic success of firms based on mixed model , however , suggests it is a promising model for the future .
As you might expect , the issue of intellectual monopolies is another area where the ACT is keen to re-write the facts .
Indeed , this document 's changes show that it wants the * whole * of the following to be deleted , since it was clearly far too near the knuckle for lovers of intellectual monopolies :
There were heated debates about patent licensing schemes .
We provide the following point as an input to Workgroup n°3
Exclusion from standards implementation ( amoung the workgroup SAP and CompTIA did not agree to the following ) :
The procurement issue is aggravated by discrimination against OSS in the licensing conditions for some IT standards .
Over the past years it has become clear that specific patent licensing schemes , most importantly the so - called “ RAND ” 7 terms , discriminate against OSS implementation .
This issue complicated the recent antitrust cases in Europe and was subject of a specific workshop on “ IPR in ICT standardisation ” 8 organised by DG Enterprise .
The workshop revealed a fundamental incompatibility of RAND models with OSS implementations , as well as a very controversial debate around this issue .
From the perspective of OSS adoption , 9 it could be said that RAND conditions fall short of the Common Patent Policy of ITU -T , ITU -R , ISO and IEC , which states that “ a patent embodied fully or partly in a Recommendation | Deliverable must be accessible to everybody without undue constraints . "
This calls forth the following howl from the ACT :
[ THERE IS NO FUNDAMENTAL INCOMPATIBILITY .
SEE FOOTNOTE 15 ]
The deleted passage continues :
Examples of such exclusions can be found in various areas .
One of these areas are the MPEG standards in multimedia , where innovation has been dramatically reduced before the recent development of the Dirac codec by the BBC as OSS provided a high - quality modern alternative that is not patent encumbered .
10 /
Unsubstantiated use of IPR threats .
It is important that effective measures are implemented to protect the interests of both open source and proprietary software both as a software development and as a business model .
Governments should ensure a level playing field for both software development models .
While we recognises the legitimate rights of intellectual property rights owners , we regret recent incidents of patent holders abuse and unsubstantiated use of their rights against open source / free software developers .
A recent development , which deserves the careful attention from the Commission , is the use of unsubstantiated threats of intellectual property rights infringements against those who attempt to develop interoperable software products .
As an example , a major software company has publicly stated that it believes Linux and other open source software infringes 235 of its patents , but has never identified any of these patents .
Vague claims by patent holders that open source software may infringe their patent rights should be obliged to identify supposedly infringed patents or cease to make unsubstantiated allegations .
This would prevent patents from being invoked to spread fear , uncertainty and doubt ( “ FUD ” ) against open source software products in the minds of both developers and users .
The behaviour of creating FUD against open source software solutions should not be tolerated , as it amounts to an anticompetitive strategy aimed at distorting conditions in the marketplace to the detriment of OSS products .
Which provokes an even louder howl :
WE DISAGREE WITH SEVERAL POINTS IN THIS SECTION .
THIS PAPER SHOULD NOT ENCROACH ON THE WORK OF WG 3 , SO
THE SECTION WOULD BEST BE DELETED .
As you might expect , 180 degree U - turns are also requested in the Actions section .
So what starts out as :
In addition , it is fundamental to ensure that open source / free software developers and distributors enjoy adequate protection that allows them to implement standardised technologies protected by patents in a way compatible with open source / free software licenses .
Becomes :
According to some , in addition , it is fundamental to ensure that open source / free software developers and distributors enjoy adequate protection that allows them to implement standardised technologies protected by patents in a way compatible with open source / free software licenses .
plus its exact opposite :
Others believe the current standardisation environment is already technology neutral , and that standardisation should continue to be voluntary and market - led .
Others as in Microsoft and mates .
All - in - all , the modifications to the document provide a fascinating insight into how lobbyists operate in their attempt to neuter threats to their constituencies through the shameless evisceration and outright inversion of content .
Fortunately , when the final strategy document comes out , we will be able to pinpoint exactly where ACT 's agenda has been inserted .
Of course , before then we need to make the above document as widely known as possible , so that the relevant people at the European Union are aware of what 's going on , and maybe even take action to prevent this gross distortion of the paper 's purpose .
In addition , we must ensure that Wikileaks can continue to provide its invaluable service .
The world of openness – including open source - would be the poorer without it .
To that end , we need to support its current call for funds to help it carry on its work , and I urge you to make a donation , however modest .

A new study by Yale University School of Medicine , National Institutes of Health , and California Pacific Medical Center finds that exposure to media damages children ’s long - term health .
80 % of the studies reviewed link greater exposure to media with negative health effects for kids and adolescents.[ social_buttons ]
Common Sense Media published the report , Media and Child and Adolescent Health : A Systematic Review , which reviewed 173 of the best studies from the last 30 years which examine the connection between media exposure and negative health effects on children .
The average modern child spends nearly 45 hours a week with television , movies , magazines , music , the Internet , cellphones and video games , the study reported .
By comparison , children spend 17 hours a week with their parents on average and 30 hours a week in school , the study said .
“ This review is the first ever comprehensive evaluation of the many ways that media impacts children ’s physical health .
The results clearly show that there is a strong correlation between media exposure and long - term negative health effects to children .
This study provides an important jumping - off point for future research that should explore both the effects of traditional media content and that of digital media –– such as video games , the Internet , and cell phones –– which kids are using today with more frequency . ”
– Ezekiel J. Emanuel , M.D. , Ph.D. , National Institutes of Health
Seven different health outcomes were analyzed : attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity ( ADDH ) , obesity , low academic achievement , tobacco use , drug use , alcohol use , and sexual behavior .
Studies on all types of media ( including television , movies , internet , video games , magazines and music ) were searched for , but most of the quality studies found involved television , movies and music .
Fewer studies were available that examined the impact of internet and video games , and there were no studies found on the impact of cell phones .
The strongest connection was found between the amount of TV watching and childhood obesity :
86 % of these studies found a statistically significant relationship between increased media exposure and an increase in childhood obesity .
82 % of studies concluded that more hours of media predicted increased weight over time .
A longitudinal study of 5,493 children reported that those who spent more than eight hours watching TV per week at age three were significantly more likely to be obese at age seven .
“ Media is increasingly pervasive in the lives of children and adolescents .
Parents and educators must consider the effects of media when they ’re trying to address issues with their child ’s health .
This report makes it clear that we need a bold new agenda on media and technology use .
We hope this report will create a new sense of urgency in that regard . ”- James P. Steyer , CEO and founder of Common Sense Media
The study makes some recommendations about kids and media exposure :
Limit the amount of time kids use media .
Monitor their use , and explain to them why too much
time in front of a screen is harmful .
time in front of a screen is harmful .
Take kids outside to play .
Encourage them to spend more time playing instead of watching – and playing real games instead of virtual ones .
Teach kids to be smart media users .
Schools can help children – and parents – learn simple ways to manage the media in their lives , and to balance media use with more healthy activities .
Bring back physical education .
Sports and physical activities are an important part of kids physical and social development , and school is a great opportunity for kids to learn more about saying healthy .
For policymakers : Encourage more research on media and kids .
Establish limits on advertising of junk food to kids .
Develop public service advertising campaigns that encourage healthy habits .

The healthiest thing you can do for your kids ( and yourself ) might be to trash the TV !

How to be paid more than men : Stay single
Men in their 20s no longer earn more than women , an official analysis of the ' pay gap ' declared .
It found that the difference between the earnings of men and women twenty - somethings is ' non-existent ' .
Women who choose to stay single are likely to earn more than single men throughout their lives , it said .
The study found no pay gap between the ages of 20 and 29 , while women who remained single throughout their lives earned more than single men
The breakdown , published by the Office for National Statistics , showed that women match men in the pay stakes from when they leave university until they reach 30 - the point at which , on average , a woman has her first baby .
The real pay gap , the analysis showed , comes after women have children and many decide either to give up careers or ease back on work to devote time to their family .
The claim that a pay gap currently put at more than 17 per cent separates men and women has become an article of faith among politicians and quangocrats .
Last year Margaret Prosser , one of the Government 's Equality Commissioners , said women ' are cheated of £ 330,000 over the course of their lifetime ' .
But the ONS analysis has led free - market economists to call for an end to worrying over unequal pay .
Ruth Lea , adviser to the Arbuthnot Banking Group , said : ' It is a matter of choice .
People earn the same until they get together , and then they make choices about work , family and lifestyle .
That is what adults are expected to do - make decisions .
' I suspect that in reality the pay advantage lies with women and I think the whole pay gap debate should stop now . '
The ONS analysis , by Sarah Conn , examined figures for median hourly pay rates .
Miss Conn said : ' There is a very small gender pay gap for those aged 18 to 21 .
It is non-existent for those aged 22 to 29 years . '
But the Government 's Equality and Human Rights Commission said the pay gap does exist and reflects discrimination against women .
A spokesman said : ' One of the major causes of the pay gap , beyond the concern about women and men who are paid different rates for the same job , is the fact that they choose low - skill , part - time jobs after they have children .
' We want to know if that is a genuine choice or a Hobson 's choice based on the limited opportunities available to women to work more flexibly . '

Conyers Seeks Probe of Bush Crimes
In one of the first acts of the 111th Congress , House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers proposed legislation to create a blue - ribbon panel of outside experts to probe the “ broad range ” of policies pursued by the Bush administration “ under claims of unreviewable war powers , ” including torture of detainees and warrantless wiretaps .

Printer friendly Conyers ’s proposal for a National Commission on Presidential War Powers and Civil Liberties also signals that Congress will devote significant time this year to investigating the Bush administration ’s most controversial actions with an eye to rolling back its expansion of executive power .
Many civil liberties and human rights groups feared that the Democratic - controlled Congress and Barack Obama ’s administration would duck any sustained inquiry into wrongdoing by George W. Bush and his subordinates , to avoid angering Republicans .
While Conyers ’s plan falls short of the criminal probe that civil rights groups have sought , neither would it prevent a criminal investigation by Obama ’s Justice Department if the new administration moves in that direction , said two aides on Obama ’s transition team who spoke on condition of anonymity .
Obama has been ambivalent about how to proceed regarding wrongdoing by the Bush administration .
He said during the campaign that willful criminality should be punished because “ nobody is above the law , ” but also expressed concern that an investigation might get bogged down in recriminations and could be viewed by Republicans as “ a partisan witch hunt . ”
Obama also has suggested he might support some form of truth commission as a way of ascertaining the facts , which would be in line with Conyers ’s plan .
The proposed blue - ribbon panel would consist of nine members , with no more than five from the same political party .
Appointed by the President and congressional leaders , the panel would have a budget of about $ 3 million and subpoena power to compel testimony from high - level members of the Bush administration .
The panel would file an initial report to the President and Congress within one year and a final report six months later .
The report would include “ any recommendations the Commission considers appropriate . ” lt is unclear if criminal prosecution could be one of the recommendations of the panel .
Mukasey 's Stand Last year , amid disclosures about White House approval of brutal interrogation tactics used against “ war on terror ” detainees , Conyers called on Attorney General Michael Mukasey to appoint a special prosecutor to determine whether these actions constituted war crimes .
But Mukasey did n’t act .
In a roundtable discussion with reporters on Dec. 3 , Mukasey revealed his thinking , arguing that there is no legal basis to prosecute current and former administration officials for authorizing torture and warrantless domestic surveillance because those decisions were made in the context of a presidential interest in protecting national security .
" There is absolutely no evidence that anybody who rendered a legal opinion , either with respect to surveillance or with respect to interrogation policies , did so for any reason other than to protect the security in the country and in the belief that he or she was doing something lawful , ” Mukasey said .
Regarding Justice Department legal opinions sanctioning these actions , Mukasey said he feared that second - guessing of those opinions would send “ the message … that if you come up with an answer that is not considered desirable in the future you might face prosecution , and that creates an incentive not to give an honest answer but to give an answer that may be acceptable in the future . ”
The war - crimes issue surfaced again when Vice President Dick Cheney gave media interviews last month in which he talked unapologetically about his role in approving harsh interrogation tactics , including the simulated drowning of waterboarding which is widely regarded as torture .
Conyers ’s proposed legislation was introduced on the same day that the Senate Judiciary Committee gave reporters three previously unreleased Justice Department legal opinions pertaining to Bush ’s authority to declare war with Iraq .
The legal opinions were written by Jay Bybee and John Yoo , former Justice Department attorneys who also drafted the infamous August 2002 “ Torture Memo ” that authorized CIA interrogators to waterboard high - level prisoners at Guantanamo Bay .
The Justice Department ’s Office of Professional Responsibility has spent the past four years investigating the genesis of that memo , specifically whether Bybee and Yoo provided the White House with poor legal advice .
In Bybee ’s newly released Oct. 23 , 2002 , 47 - page opinion , he stakes out broad war - making powers for Bush , claiming the President " possesses constitutional authority for ordering the use of force against Iraq to protect our national interests . ”
The memo was drafted about two weeks after Congress approved a resolution authorizing Bush to " use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq . ”
In the memo , Bybee reaffirmed an earlier opinion that Bush possessed the necessary war - making powers regardless of what Congress did .
" This memorandum confirms our prior advice to you regarding the scope of the President 's authority .
We conclude that the President possesses constitutional authority for ordering the use of force against Iraq to protect our national interests , " Bybee 's memo said .
“ This independent authority is supplemented by congressional authorization in the form of the [ 1991 ] Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution ... , which supports the use of force to secure lraq ' s compliance with its international obligations following the liberation of Kuwait , and the [ 2001 ] Authorization for Use of Military Force ... , which supports military action against Iraq if the President determines Iraq provided assistance to the perpetrators of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
" In addition , using force against Iraq would be consistent with international law , because it would be authorized by the United Nations Security Council , or would be justified as anticipatory self - defense . "
As it turned out , the UN Security Council did not approve military action against Iraq , forcing Bush to assemble an ad hoc multinational force that he called the " coalition of the willing . "
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan later acknowledged that the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq was a violation of international law .
There also has been no credible evidence indicating that Iraq provided any assistance to the 9/11 hijackers .
Another newly released legal opinion , written by Bybee ’s successor , Jack Goldsmith , authorized Iraqi prisoners be moved to other countries to be interrogated — a practice known as rendition .
The existence of the three new legal opinions were first reported Tuesday by McClatchy Newspapers , which added that “ Yoo supplements those arguments [ on presidential powers ] in two other memos dated Nov. 8 , 2002 and Dec. 7 , 2002 . ”
Conyers ’s legislation for the blue - ribbon commission was co-sponsored by Democratic Reps .
Maxine Waters , Hank Johnson , Sheila Jackson - Lee , Jerrold Nadler , Linda Sanchez , Bill Delahunt , Luis Gutierrez , Debbie Wasserman - Schultz , and Steve Cohen .

The developers behind the Debian Linux distribution are preparing for the upcoming release of Debian 5 , which is codenamed Lenny .
The decision to move forward with the release follows a contentious vote over whether to permit the inclusion of binary blobs in the new version of the distribution .
Consensus coalesced around a controversial proposal to " assume blobs comply with the GPL unless proven otherwise . "
The issue centers around a long - running dispute about the licensing implications of allowing binary firmware components to be bundled in the kernel .
Although the practice of embedding proprietary firmware in hardware devices is widely accepted , some free software purists object to scenarios where the binary firmware components are stored in the kernel and loaded into the hardware at runtime .
The debate over this issue has raged for years and a close examination of what it entails is beyond the scope of this article .
Some mainstream Linux distributions — such as Ubuntu — take a pragmatic view on the issue .
Debian , however , has deep ideological roots and a development culture that holds software freedom in high regard .
Critics of binary firmware within the Debian community argue that the growing tolerance of binary firmware represents an unambiguous deviation from the principles embodied in Debian 's social contract and free software guidelines .
Voting controversy
The debate renewed last month as the Debian development community began the task of determining whether or not the release of version 5 should be delayed to facilitate the purge of binary firmware blobs .
The matter was put to a vote through the general resolution process .
The Debian election methodology is moderately complex and somewhat confusing to outsiders .
Each voter ranks the available options in an order that reflects their preference .
The Condercet Method , with Schwartz Sequential Dropping , is used to compute the winner based on the rankings .
The election was managed by Debian secretary Manoj Srivastava , who resigned in response to allegations of mismanagement and ballot irregularities shortly after the elections were completed .
Srivastava , who assembled the ballot and maintains the software used to compute the election results , has been Debian 's secretary since 2001 .
Critics accuse Srivastava of abusing his power by selectively applying super - majority requirements to proposals that he disliked .
In Debian elections , any proposals that are viewed as being fundamentally in contradiction with the project 's core principals generally have to be supported by a 3 - to - 1 supermajority in order to pass .
Srivastava 's decision to invoke that requirement on several of the ballot proposals in the binary blob vote is perceived by some critics as arbitrary and unreasonable .
They argue that he intentionally tried to sink propsoals that did n't match with his views .
" In the years I have spent in this role since Darren left us , I have tried to conduct the votes as I saw the rquirements of the constitution , and the limitations of the voting software .
But this not a view shared by very many people .
I concede that I have made mistakes with the current set of votes , " he wrote in an e-mail stating his intention to resign .
" There are , in my opinion , far more cogent arguments being offered now , than there were in the discussion period , and had these being made earlier , we would not have come to this pass . "
Getting Debian 5 out the door
The winning proposal suggests that getting Debian 5 out the door is more important than completing the crusade against binary - only firmware .
It also states that binary firmware should only be included if it can be legally redistributed .
" We give priority to the timely release of Lenny over sorting every bit out ; for this reason , we will treat removal of sourceless firmware as a best - effort process , and deliver firmware as part of Debian Lenny as long as we are legally allowed to do so , and the firmware is distributed upstream under a license that complies with the DFSG , " the proposal states .
On the surface , the final decision seems a bit radical for a freedom - oriented distribution like Debian .
The issue has , however , been around for a long time and was addressed with a similar outcome prior to at least two previous releases .
The general view of the Debian community is that they are satisfied with allowing releases to go forward as long as consistent progress is being made in eradicating binary blobs and there are no clear regressions in this area between releases .
Some of the ballot options that failed to pass reflect very different philosophies .
For example , one proposal suggested that firmware should be categorically excluded from the source availability requirements of the free software guidelines .
Another proposal called for an unconditional delay until the non-free components are fully purged .
And another proposal aimed to grant the Debian release team the authority to evaluate each case individually .
The Debian 5 controversy invited criticism from several key figures in the Linux development community , including kernel developer and Linux Foundation CTO Ted Ts'o .
In a personal blog entry , Ts'o criticized the Debian project and argued that the extreme and uncompromising language in the organization 's social contract is counterproductive .
He suggests that placing such extreme emphasis on software freedom above all else is like idolatry and erodes principles that he thinks are more important , such as civility and fair treatment of other people .
The Debian 5 schedule originally specified the second half of 2008 as a likely window for release .
Debian is notorious for major release delays and there always seems to be some kind of significant argument or dispute at the last minute .
Prior to the release of Etch , the last major version , controversy erupted over Dunc Tank , a community - sponsored group that raised funds to pay prominent release managers in the month leading up to the release .
It was hoped that delays could be prevented if two release managers had funding to work on Debian full - time for a month each .
The plan was attacked by critics and the release fell behind schedule despite the funding .
Despite all of the controversy and squabbling , Debian 5 is shaping up to be a pretty strong release .
It will include version 2.6.26 of the Linux kernel and Xorg 7.3 .
Debian stable releases are engineered to be rock solid , so they tend to fall back on older application versions where necessary rather than jumping ahead .
An example of this can be seen in the changes that they made to their GNOME stack .
The default version of GNOME included in the Debian repositories will be 2.22 , which was released last year .
GNOME 2.22 was a transitional release , and some of the major features — such as the new virtual filesystem layer — were still incomplete .
Instead of backporting the improvements in those areas from 2.24 , Debian has taken its characteristically conservative approach and has dropped GIO in favor of the legacy gnome - vfs framework in Nautilus and several other core desktop components .
Debian 5 will also ship with OpenOffice 2.4 instead of the recently released 3.0 version .
The most significant addition in 3.0 that is relevant to Linux users is support for Microsoft 's Office Open XML format ( OOXML ) format .
This feature will still be available to Debian 5 users because Debian uses Novell 's Go-OO branch of OpenOffice.org , a custom version that includes OOXML support and higher - quality Linux integration .
For a complete list of the new features in Debian 5 , check out the overview in the Debian wiki .

Russian ex-KGB agent Alexander Lebedev is to buy the London Evening Standard newspaper for the sum of £ 1 .
The paper 's publisher - the Daily Mail & General Trust ( DMGT ) - said it had agreed to the sale of a majority interest in the paper to Mr Lebedev .
The billionaire businessman is believed to have made an offer for approximately a 76 % share of the paper .
He has previously revealed that he used the paper to find out information when he was a young spy based in London .
DMGT said the Evening Standard would pass into the hands of Evening Press , a company formed by Mr Lebedev and his son Evgeny Lebedev and owned by Lebedev Holdings .
DMGT 's Associated Newspapers division is to retain a minority share of 24.9 % in the new firm , called Evening Standard Ltd. Imagine the French having Le Monde or Le Figaro taken over by a Russian multi-millionaire ?
Sir Peregrine Worsthorne
Profile : Alexander Lebedev
It is the first time a Russian oligarch has owned a British title , but Mr Lebedev said he strongly supports a free press and would not interfere with the paper editorially .
In an attempt to head off any such fears , DMGT said the Evening Standard would establish a new editorial committee to " safeguard the principle of editorial independence " .
Mr Lebedev said : " We are strong supporters of a free and independent press and we greatly admire the Evening Standard as an iconic publication with its pedigree of fine journalism and commentary .
" We are committed to strengthening the newspaper 's competitiveness and look forward to working with Associated , which will continue to be involved as a minority shareholder . "
' Fully committed ' DMGT chairman Lord Rothermere said the company was " very proud " to have owned the paper .
He said : " It has a long and distinguished history as one of the world 's great city newspapers , based on outstanding journalism .
" I believe that Alexander Lebedev shares my commitment to newspapers and will continue to invest in the Evening Standard . "
He said none of DMGT 's other newspaper publications would be involved in the deal , adding that the company " remains fully committed to journalism and newspaper ownership " .
It 's an illustration of how our national pride has declined
Sir Peregrine Worsthorne Sir Peregrine Worsthorne , former editor of the Sunday Telegraph , said the take - over was a sign of " national decline " .
He told the BBC : " I think it 's one more example that we are no more a serious nation that we allow a serious paper to be taken over in our capital by a Russian oligarch .
" Imagine the French having Le Monde or Le Figaro taken over by a Russian multi-millionaire ?
It 's an illustration of how our national pride has declined . "
Mr Lebedev 's fortune , which is reported to be worth around $ 3.1 bn ( £ 2.1bn ) , was made mostly through banking , insurance companies and from his stake in the Russian airline Aeroflot .
In 2006 , he teamed up with ex-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to buy shares in the Russian paper Novaya Gazeta and his property portfolio includes a string of boutique hotels across Europe .
BBC media correspondent Torin Douglas has said the Evening Standard had been hit by the advertising downturn and a fierce free newspaper battle in London .
Mr Lebedev has also expressed an interest in buying out other struggling newspapers both in the UK and the United States .
His take - over of the Evening Standard s expected to take place in February following consultation with employees .

SCOTT Nixon was crossing Flinders Street from the railway station when a loud honk frightened him .
A hybrid car had " nearly cleaned me up " .
Mr Nixon , 30 , has been blind from birth .
He relies on his ears to get around , but silent - technology vehicles are on the rise  and the visually impaired community is lobbying the Federal Government to research how dangerous the roads will become when there are a lot more hybrids .
Scott Nixon says he has had several near - misses with almost - silent vehicles .
Credit : Ken Irwin
" It 's one more thing we have to contend with , " says Mr Nixon , who tells of " other incidents ( with hybrids ) , like walking into one that had stopped halfway across the intersection .
In the CBD it 's impossible to know there 's one there unless you 're on top of it . "
The issue has been on the boil for some time .
In June , the Blind Advocacy Group , in its online newsletter , published a story called " Silent but Deadly ? "
It was actually a reprint of a Wall Street Journal article from February 2007 that reported on US blind organisations demanding that vehicle makers install safety noise - makers on their otherwise quiet cars .
A year later , Fisker Automobiles , with headquarters in green - friendly California , announced the development of the $ US80,000 ( $ A121,160 ) Karma , a sporty sedan that one magazine described as " the sexiest hybrid ever " .
NLnet to Help Fund AbiWord 's ODF Compatibility Efforts
by Ostatic Staff - Jan. 08 , 2009
Ars Technica brings the good news that the AbiWord project has received funding from the NLnet Foundation to further a number of the project 's efforts on the OpenDocument front .
One of the areas receiving special support is the newly formed AbiSource Corporation , which cites improving AbiWord 's collaborative tools as one of its driving forces .
NLnet will also work with the AbiWord team to improve the application 's support for the OpenDocument standard in other areas , including its import / export filters .
AbiWord has long held a soft spot in the hearts of open source enthusiasts , and with good reason .
It may not have the high profile that OpenOffice enjoys , but it 's fast , has a " clean " user interface , and simply gets the job done .
It is available for a number of platforms , and features a variety of plugins that enhance function and compatibility .
NLnet is a non-profit organization created to support projects and individuals working to increase the awareness and adoption of open information / open access efforts .
Posted by Big Gav in credit crunch , zbigniew brzezinski
I have some fond memories of Zbigniew Brzezinski's " head in the bed " speech to the US Senate a few years ago , warning the neocons not to attack Iran .
Zbig ( who was the one who lured the Soviets into Afghanistan , amongst other things ) has been on MSNBC lately to warn US elites that they'd best chip in some of their own money to keep the economy afloat , otherwise things might get nasty - Zbigniew Brzezinski warns of class warfare and riots .
OE SCARBOROUGH :
You also talked about the possibility of class conflict .
ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI : I was worrying about it because we ’re going to have millions and millions of unemployed , people really facing dire straits .
And we ’re going to be having that for some period of time before things hopefully improve .
And at the same time there is public awareness of this extraordinary wealth that was transferred to a few individuals at levels without historical precedent in America . . .
And you sort of say to yourself : what ’s going to happen in this society when these people are without jobs , when their families hurt , when they lose their homes , and so forth ?
We have the government trying to repair : repair the banking system , to bail the housing out .
But what about the rich guys ?
Where is it ?
[ What are they ] doing ?
It sort of struck me , that in 1907 , when we had a massive banking crisis , when banks were beginning to collapse , there were going to be riots in the streets .
Some financiers , led by J.P. Morgan , got together .
He locked them in his library at one point .
He would n’t let them out until 4:45 AM , until they all kicked in and gave some money to stabilize the banks : there was no Federal Reserve at the time .
Where is the monied class today ?
Why are n’t they doing something : the people who made billions , millions .
I ’m sort of thinking of Paulson , of Rubin .
Why do n’t they get together , and why do n’t they organize a National Solidarity Fund in which they call on all of those who made these extraordinary amounts of money to kick some back in to [ a ]
National Solidarity Fund ? ...
BRZEZINSKI : And if we do n’t get some sort of voluntary National Solidarity Fund , at some point there ’ll be such political pressure that Congress will start getting in the act , there ’s going to be growing conflict between the classes and if people are unemployed and really hurting , hell , there could be even riots .

You will need :
The board from the centre of The Economist 's Christmas issue ( or pdf version of board below )
These rules
Risk cards , currency and icons from the pdfs below ( or you can use your diamond cufflinks , or any other mementos of your former wealth , to represent you on the board )
Four coins
Scissors ( to cut out currency and cards )
Three or more players ; probably six at most
How it works
Players start with 500 m econos each .
One player doubles as banker .
Players move round by throwing four coins and progressing as many squares as they throw heads .
If a player throws four heads , he moves forward four spaces and has another turn ; if he throws four tails , he throws again .
When a player lands on a + square , he collects money from the bank ; equally , when he lands on a minus square , he pays the bank .
The aim is to be the last solvent player .
In order to achieve this , players try to eliminate the competition .
Risk cards encourage players to pick on each other .
Players who cannot pay their fines may borrow from each other at any rate they care to settle on — for instance , 100 % interest within three turns .
They should negotiate with the other players to get the best rate possible .
Players who cannot borrow must either go into Chapter 11 or be taken over .
Players may conceal their assets from each other .
Chapter 11
When a player gets into debt and can't persuade anybody else to lend to him , he goes bankrupt .
A player who goes bankrupt three times is eliminated .
A bankrupt player must move to the Chapter 11 cell and stay there until :
1 . He uses a “ Get out of Chapter 11 ” card
2 . He rolls four heads or four tails during his turn
3 . He is taken over
A player coming out of bankruptcy goes to START .
If a player cannot escape Chapter 11 for five turns he is eliminated .
Takeover
A player may be taken over either if he cannot pay his debts or if he is already in Chapter 11 .
The purchaser pays the purchased player 's debts .
If there is a takeover battle , the aspiring purchasers must bid against each other , and the highest bidder pays his bid to the bank .
The purchaser and subsidiary then play , in effect , as a team , though the purchaser is in charge .
He gets to choose the beneficiaries and victims of the risk cards his subsidiary picks and may use the subsidiary 's assets to pay his fines , or pay the subsidiary 's fines if he wishes .
But he does not have to : if his subsidiary gets into debt again , he can let the subsidiary go into Chapter 11 .
The subsidiary is then a free agent once more , and may get out of Chapter 11 in the usual ways .
But the player who has just abandoned him may not take him over during that stay in Chapter 11 , although he may during a subsequent visit .
Printing money
The Bank of Econia supplies the currency for this game .
To access the banks vaults , download and print the money using the currency pdfs .
Money may be printed in colour or grayscale .
The econo is available in five notes : Ec 10 million ( here ) , Ec 50 million ( here ) , Ec 100 million ( here ) , Ec 500 million ( here ) and Ec 1000 million ( here ) .
There is a pdf page for each denomination with 10 bills on each page .
The Bank encourages a print run of :
60 x Ec 10 m ( 6 pages with 10 bills on each page )
60 x Ec 50 m ( 6 pages with 10 bills on each page )
60 x Ec 100 m ( 6 pages with 10 bills on each page )
20 x Ec 500 m ( 2 pages with 10 bills on each page )
20 x Ec 1000 m ( 2 pages with 10 bills on each page )
Use scissors to separate notes .
Printing “ Financial Risk ” cards
There are 30 “ Financial Risk ” cards contained in three pdfs ( here , here and here ) .
Print one copy of each pdf and use scissors to separate cards .
Place separated cards in a pile face down during play .
Printing icons
Players may choose any item to represent them on the board .
Optional icons are contained on an icon pdf ( here ) .
Print page and separate desired icons using scissors .
Fold back base flaps in order to allow the icon to stand upright .
Printing game board
The game board is available for printing on two pdfs ( here and here ) with one half of the board on each file .
Enlarging the board is encouraged .
This may require utilising larger paper or printing then assembling the board from several pages .

Ford reported a record loss for 2008 Ford , General Motors ( GM ) and Chrysler have all reported a sharp fall in US sales in January , as industry - wide American sales fell to a 27 - year low .
Sales at Ford plunged 42 % last month , compared with a year earlier , while those at GM declined 49 % , and Chrysler was hit by a fall of 55 % .
GM and Chrysler needed a $ 17.4bn ( £ 12 bn ) rescue package from the US government in December .
While Ford last week reported a record $ 14.6 bn annual loss for 2008 .
' Monster ' American car sales have slumped as consumers have cut back on making large purchases as the US recession has deepened .
US consumers have cut back on buying new cars " We 're in the mouth of this monster , and we have a lot of work to do , " said Chrysler sales chief Steven Landry .
Chrysler argues that more customers would like to buy new cars , only they can't secure the loans to do so , because of the continuing problems in the US banking sector .
January 's decline has also hit sales of foreign cars in the US .
Toyota 's January American sales were down 32 % from a year earlier , while those at Nissan dropped 30 % .
" The truth is that the entire auto industry finds itself in the eye of this economic storm , " said Toyota US executive Bob Carter .
However , both Subaru and Hyundai bucked the trend , with their January US sales rising 8 % and 14 % .
Government support GM and Chrysler gained their bail - out from the White House last month after they warned that they were running out of cash .
The financial situation at Ford is not as bad , although it has secured a $ 9bn government credit line that it will be able to access in the future if needed .
GM said on Tuesday that it would offer voluntary redundancy to 22,000 US employees as it seeks to cut costs .
Industry - wide US car sales fell 18 % in 2008 to 13.2 million vehicles .
Sales for 2009 are expected to drop near 10.5 million , analysts say .
" Even with a boost from the anticipated federal stimulus plan , we see consumers taking a cautious approach to large ticket discretionary purchases , " said S&P equity analyst Efraim Levy .

Feb. 26 , 2009 --
About a third of common adult cancers may be preventable in the U.S. -- and that does n't even count cancers that could be prevented by not smoking .
That 's according to a new report from the World Cancer Research Fund ( WCRF ) and its sister organization , the American Institute for Cancer Research ( AICR ) .
In the new report , the WCRF and AICR estimate that in the U.S. , eating a nutritious diet , being physically active , and keeping body fat under control may prevent :
38 % of breast cancers
45 % of colorectal cancers
36 % of lung cancers
39 % of pancreatic cancers
47 % of stomach cancers
69 % of esophageal cancers
63 % of cancers of the mouth , pharynx , or larynx
70 % of endometrial cancers
24 % of kidney cancers
21 % of gallbladder cancers
15 % of liver cancers
11 % of prostate cancers
Diet , physical activity , and limited body fat could prevent 34 % of those 12 cancers overall in the U.S. , and 24 % of all cancers , according to the report .
Those estimates are all about the big picture -- the effect on the overall population -- not an individual 's chance of developing cancer .
The WCRF / AICR report also includes tips for governments , industries , school , media , and other institutions worldwide to promote healthy lifestyles .
Among those recommendations :
New developments should be designed to encourage walking and cycling .
Government and school cafeterias should provide healthy foods and drinks .
Food and drink industries should price healthy fare competitively with other products and stop promoting sugary drinks and unhealthy foods to kids .
Workplaces should have policies and environments that are supportive of breastfeeding .
Media should promote cancer prevention and flag misleading cancer claims .
That guidance is in line with the American Cancer Society 's recommendation for community action , notes Colleen Doyle , the American Cancer Society 's director of nutrition and physical activity .
" Reversing the obesity epidemic will require bold action and multiple strategies , including policy changes at national , state , and local levels that make it easier for people to eat better and be more active , " Doyle says in an American Cancer Society statement .
The WCRF / AICR , which has previously published cancer prevention tips for individuals , stresses that cancer prevention means trimming the odds of developing cancer , not totally eliminating cancer .
Many factors affect cancer risk , and some of them -- like family history -- are n't within your control .
A healthy lifestyle does n't wipe out cancer risk -- but it also has no downside .
And , because early detection is often a big help in treating cancer when it does occur , check with your doctor about routine cancer screening tests .
2600 years ago a fable was written , read by generations , understood by none .
The boy cried , Wolf ! and the villagers came , but there was no wolf .
And the boy laughed , amused with himself and by their gullibility .
He did it a second time with the same results ; and a third time , each time to him more amusing .
But the next time was not a joke , a wolf indeed came , and killed most of the flock , and almost killed him .
Wolf !
Wolf !
But no one came , of course .
It was too many times .
Even when a liar tells the truth , they are never believed .
II .
The winter came , and the villagers were cold and hungry , and many died , for there were no sheep .
An old man from another village shook his head : why was such an important aspect of their survival trusted to a boy ?
How much did you expect from a child ?
He seemed really mature , observed one man .
And we 're really just children ourselves .
We did n't notice much of a difference .
Why continue to leave him in place after the first lie ?
Or the second ?
Clearly he does n't take the job seriously .
If you no longer trusted his call , why did you leave him there ?
" But we were busy with other things .
" Perhaps you knew wolves were coming , inevitably ; there was no stopping them .
And rather than try and fail , you did n't want to be the one blamed .
Or perhaps you expected that because he lied about the wolf , that there wasas wolves .
Not : he lied because there are no wolves .
he lied , therefore there are no wolves .
Other than the solitary boy you left in the field to do a job you did n't trust him to do , what other warning signals were you expecting ?
The boy grew up , resentful at the villagers ' resentment towards him , what did he do wrong ?
They told him they would .
And like the children they are , they took no responsibility -- they tried to blame him .
The adults in the village failed , the blame is theirs entirely .
Wolves exist , you do n't throw a boy to the wolves .
And when you send a boy to do a man 's job but still treat him like a boy , then the problem is n't the boy , the problem is you .
As we noted last week , the new WhiteHouse.gov site uses embedded YouTube movies , raising concerns of privacy and open government advocates .
Embedded video clips can place or add to a cookie on the user ’s computer – thus enabling tracking of users as they use the web .
In response , the Obama Administration acted quickly , implementing a partial fix that ensures cookies will only be used when the user chooses to play the video , and not automatically upon loading a page .
This is an improvement , particularly impressive for the speed of the response , and we commend the Obama Administration for it .
But during this process the White House counsel issued a waiver for video on WhiteHouse.gov , moving away from the longstanding presumption against the use of cookies on government websites first issued in 2000 .
The federal rule directing the government to avoid the use of cookies is based on the important principle that the government — and third parties — should not be tracking the movements of citizens when they visit government sites .
The waiver reads in part :
For videos that are visible on WhiteHouse.gov , a “ persistent cookie ” is set by third party providers when you click to play a video .
This persistent cookie is used by some third party providers to help maintain the integrity of video statistics .
A waiver has been issued by the White House Counsel 's office to allow for the use of this persistent cookie .
Given the importance of the “ no cookie ” presumption to the privacy of visitors to WhiteHouse.gov , we ’d like to know why the White House Counsel decided to waive it .
To answer this question , we have sent a letter to White House Counsel Gregory Craig , asking him to detail the “ information and analysis ” on which his waiver is based .
While the White House counsel has no obligation under the law to reply to our query , we hope he will do so in light of the memo issued by the President on his first day in office instructing all agencies to “ adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure … to usher in a new era of open Government . ”
We have also provided Craig , the folks at WhiteHouse.gov and YouTube with a short list of suggestions to better protect the WhiteHouse.gov users regardless of the waiver :
Work with YouTube to end the retention of cookie data for any video embedded on a government site , including so - called “ flash cookies . ”
We see no reason why YouTube needs to retain this information and every reason why it can use this opportunity to make a solid commitment to the public good .
The White House has already taken the helpful step of providing visitors with a direct - download link to a high definition MP4 of most video .
To build on this , the site could embed the low definition videos using its own Flash - player and stream the video directly from the White House ’s own server , rather than relying on YouTube .
Add a link to privacy information near each video embed specifically identifying third parties that may have access to the data , so that users will be fully informed of their risks and options .
And we have pointed out that the privacy concerns do n’t begin and end with the use of cookies .
There are other ways that visitors to WhiteHouse.gov are leaking private data to third parties :
An " invisible pixel " style webbug / tracker on every page on the site , hosted by WebTrends.com .
The entire WhiteHouse.gov domain appears to utilize edge - caching technology provided by Akamai , Inc . Access to direct - download MP4s of video content appears to be hosted by Amazon S3 .
In each of these cases , when a person visits the WhiteHouse.gov site , a third - party logs IP addresses and other personally identifiable information .
Yet the limitation on cookies was espressly adopted in 2000 out of concern about the risk of the technologies that “ can track the activities of users over time and across different websites . ”
So in addition to asking the White House Counsel for information about this waiver to allow third - party cookies , we ’ve asked a specific question :
What is the White House willing to do to continue to protect the privacy of visitors to government websites , even as it utilizes tools other than cookies that can do similar tracking ?
President Obama is leading the way in making new and unprecedented use of the new technologies to keep the public informed and engaged .
We are hopeful that his Administration will readily recognize that part of open and responsive Government is making sure that neither the government , nor any third parties , are tracking the activities of those who seek to access government information .
We have asked the White House counsel to respond to our two questions by February 6 , 2009 .
We ’ll let you know what happens .
A growing number of Steve McGreens are souping up their gas - electric hybrids to make them go faster and handle better , while delivering stellar fuel economy .
It is n't just gearheads busting their knuckles , either .
A lot of the hybrid hackers are tech geeks whose innovations may well appear in the cars we 'll buy tomorrow .
" The gearhead of today has evolved .
People today want performance and fuel economy , " Paul Goldman , the 46 - year - old CEO of the hot - rod hybrid shop Juiced Hybrid , tells Wired.com .
He sells more than 500 items ranging from suspension kits and chassis stiffeners to body kits and floor mats .
Most of his customers are " educated people who care about the environment " and modify their cars " because they 're tech savvy , not necessarily because they 're car savvy . "
Like all automotive trends , hybrid hot rodding started at the grassroots with green gearheads wrenching at home .
But it 's entered the mainstream , with big - name builders like Braille Battery bringing big - budget hybrids like the 440 - horsepower " Hot Rod Hybrid Altima " to the annual Specialty Equipment Manufacturers Association auto industry trade show in Las Vegas .
As the number of automakers producing hybrids grows and the number of people buying them explodes , SEMA officials say , so too will the number of people demanding go - fast goodies for them .
" The green performance revolution is well underway , " says John Waraniak , SEMA 's VP of vehicle technology .
" Bringing more environmentally friendly , responsible - vehicle technologies and products to the marketplace does n't mean that you have to sacrifice performance and the coolness factor . "
Arah Leonard was among those who did n't want to sacrifice performance when he picked up a Toyota Prius , so about a year ago he started asking the guys at Priuschat.com for advice about modding his ride .
Leonard says he wanted to " show the world that hybrid does n't mean a slow car . "
He aimed high , hoping to make the Prius quick and nimble enough for autocrossing .
Turns out he did n't have the time or the money to make it happen – never mind that the Prius is n't designed for racing .
Its gas - electric drivetrain , regenerative braking and traction control " make for an incredibly bad racer , " Leonard tells us .
All the high - tech hardware " makes autocross racing rather ... disappointing .
You just can't power - steer through a turn . "
That 's not to say people have n't raced hybrids with varying levels of success .
This YouTube video shows someone putting a Prius through its autocrossing paces .
A Japanese gearhead pushed a Prius to 135 mph at the Bonneville Salt Flats a few years ago .
The British team that has rally raced a Honda Civic Hybrid is developing a hybrid for road racing .
German boutique supercar company Gumpert ran an 800 - horsepower hybrid at the 24 Hours of Nurburgring endurance race , and Peugeot says it will bring a hybrid to Le Mans .
Many of these cars bear little resemblance to the hybrids you 'll see outside Whole Foods , but it 's only a matter of time before the technology trickles down from the race track to the showroom .
Of course , most people who hack their hybrids are n't so ambitious .
Goldman says most of his customers – the majority of them drive a Prius , and nearly half of them are women – simply want to make their hybrids look and handle a little better .
" They buy a spring set , EV mode and a body kit , " he says .
A thriving online community of modders provides noobs with the support to tackle big jobs , Goldman says .
" If it 's documented well , they 'll do it , " he says of budding eco-modders .
" I have people who have never worked on a car engine before taking apart a direct injection . "
The most ambitious hybrid hackers were converting their cars to plug - in hybrids long before there was a cottage industry to do the job , and they 're years ahead of Toyota and General Motors in getting these super fuel - efficient wonders on the road .
Of course , the major manufacturers frown on people second - guessing their engineering , and some mods may run afoul of emissions regulations and void your warranty .
But hot rodding has never been about following the rules .
People have been modifying cars almost as long as automakers have been building them , and no one expects that to change .
" We have this emotional response to automobiles , " Goldman says .
" We can even get a better experience with a hybrid because you 're helping the environment and you can have some fun with it too . "

Race car engineering firm Braille Battery turned a sedate Nissan Altima hybrid into a 440 - horsepower tarmac terror .
The car sports a a supercharged E85 - burning engine massaged to produce 270 horsepower ; it 's mated to a synchronous electric motor .
Just about every part of the car , from the drivetrain to the suspension to the brakes , has been heavily modified .
Yeah , it 's extreme and bears almost no resemblance to the Altima Hybrid you 'll find in a showroom , but it shows what 's possible .

We ’ve truly entered a Bizarro World universe , where up is down , right is left  and the Russians , of all people , are now lecturing us about the virtues of free enterprise .
Yes , it happened at the Davos conference of bigwigs , insiders , and their sycophantic hangers - on , where the elite meet to munch canapés and discuss the way the world works , or , in this case , the way it is n’t working .
The conference was heavy with the sort of pessimism that does n’t usually accompany a gathering of the rich and pompous , yet instead of the usual self - congratulatory vaunting of their own virtue and “ concern ” for the world ’s peasants , these aristocrats of the conference table were less than ebullient about the downward spiral of the global economy  which , you ’ll remember , yesterday was touted as the savior of us all , but these days is portrayed as the instrument of our collective doom .
While the walkout of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan grabbed the biggest headlines  he did n’t like it when David Ignatius of the Washington Post shushed him in favor of letting former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres drone on uninterrupted  the real shocker was Vladimir Putin ’s peroration , which sounded more like Ron Paul than the leader of a nation that has intruded the state into the economy and polity in a big way .
Putin likened the economic crisis the world is facing to “ the perfect storm , which denotes a situation when nature ’s forces converge in one point of the ocean and increase their destructive potential many times over . ”
This is very similar to the apocalyptic tone not only of Rep .
Paul , but of gold bugs and libertarians outside the Beltway : save your candles , the dark ages are coming !
Yet our leaders were unprepared : in spite of strong indications that the crisis was breaking over our heads , only a prescient minority realized that our chickens were coming home to roost , while the “ majority strove to get their share of the pie , be it one dollar or a billion , and did not want to notice the rising wave . ”
As the Remnant looked on , Western elites were oblivious to their onrushing doom :
“ I just want to remind you that , just a year ago , American delegates speaking from this rostrum emphasized the U.S. economy ’s fundamental stability and its cloudless prospects .
Today , investment banks , the pride of Wall Street , have virtually ceased to exist .
In just 12 months , they have posted losses exceeding the profits they made in the last 25 years .
This example alone reflects the real situation better than any criticism .
“ The time for enlightenment has come .
We must calmly , and without gloating , assess the root causes of this situation and try to peek into the future . ”
Well , perhaps he was gloating just a little , but who can blame him ?
After all , the high - and - mighties of the West had recently undergone a spasm of unrestrained hubris , from which we have only just begun to recover .
This manic mood was given expression not only by the Bush Doctrine and its attendant military campaigns , but also by a mad triumphalism that predated 9/11 and really started with the fall of the Soviet empire .
The “ unipolar ” delusion distorted our thinking and gave rise to all sorts of grandiose projects that wound up costing us dearly .
One of those projects was  and is  the encirclement and economic strangulation of Russia : the ill - fated “ color revolutions , ” the deployment of “ soft power ” in the service of penetrating the former Soviet republics with “ civil society ” organizations , funded and directed by Western governments , and the challenge to Russian predominance in the “ near abroad ” of the Caucasus and central Asia , where the U.S. seeks to build bases ostensibly to fight the “ war on terrorism ” in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
That this dagger pointed at the throat of Kremlin leaders will have to be withdrawn , albeit reluctantly and temporarily , is doubtless where the gloating comes in .
So far , Putin ’s critique is pointed , yet hardly shocking .
Well , hang in there , dear reader , because we ’re just getting to the good part :
“ Add to this colossal disproportions that have accumulated over the last few years .
This primarily concerns disproportions between the scale of financial operations and the fundamental value of assets , as well as those between the increased burden on international loans and the sources of their collateral . ”
This realistic perspective is in sharp contrast to the frantic gyrations of our own political and financial leaders , who are wholly invested in maintaining that disproportion in all its gargantuan perversity .
Collateral ?
Real value ?
Such bothersome impediments to omnipotence have long since been thrown overboard by the Washington - Wall Street crowd .
As a top White House aide once told journalist Ron Suskind , guys like him  disdainfully dubbed “ the reality - based community ”  who “ believe that solutions emerge from [ their ] judicious study of discernible reality ” are n’t clued in to the new reality :
“ That ’s not the way the world really works anymore .
We ’re an empire now , and when we act , we create our own reality .
And while you ’re studying that reality  judiciously , as you will  we ’ll act again , creating other new realities , which you can study too , and that ’s how things will sort out .
We ’re history ’s actors and you , all of you , will be left to just study what we do . ”
The same hubris that drove the Iraq war and led us to believe we could “ transform ” the Middle East , as some of the more perfervid neocons insisted , drove our financial leaders over a similarly steep cliff .
The empire is now crumbling , along with the economic assumptions that financed it , as Putin points out :
“ The entire economic growth system , where one regional center prints money without respite and consumes material wealth , while another regional center manufactures inexpensive goods and saves money printed by other governments , has suffered a major setback . ”
Whether the Russian leader has been boning up on the works of the Austrian economists and has absorbed or at least understood their critique of central banking as the flaw in the otherwise beneficial ointment of Western - style capitalism , or has independently come to similar conclusions , is open to speculation .
Suffice to say that the parallelism is astonishing .
For the long period of American economic and imperial expansion , the dollar was the reserve currency of choice , its markets the freest and most profitable in the world .
As we enter a perhaps even lengthier period of decline , the leading indicator of our protracted contraction is the end of the dollar - denominated world economy .
Whereas the Chinese premier , in his Davos speech , merely called for closer monetary regulation and restraint on the part of his American trading partner , Putin called on the markets to dump the dollar .
Putin accurately describes the bubble of American supremacism and diagnoses its cause .
It was “ brought about , ” he avers , “ by excessive expectations .
Corporate appetites with regard to constantly growing demand swelled unjustifiably .
The race between stock market indices and capitalization began to overshadow rising labor productivity and real - life corporate effectiveness . ”
The industrial West engaged in an orgy of consumption , without producing any more  indeed , while producing much less .
Our entire system was and is based on the generation of “ unearned wealth , a loan that will have to be repaid by future generations . ”
It all “ would have collapsed sooner or later , ” and “ in fact , this is happening right before our eyes . ”
As America ’s political leaders rush to reinflate the bubble , Putin would let it pop :
“ This means we must assess the real situation and write off all hopeless debts and ‘ bad ’ assets .
True , this will be an extremely painful and unpleasant process .
Far from everyone can accept such measures , fearing for their capitalization , bonuses , or reputation .
However , we would ‘ conserve ’ and prolong the crisis , unless we clean up our balance sheets . ”
In short , the malinvestment engaged in during the bubble years must be liquidated .
The longer we try to conserve enterprises supposedly “ too big to fail , ” the more painful and prolonged will be the process of economic recovery .
This is precisely what libertarians such as Ron Paul and analysts such as Peter Schiff have been saying all along .
Unlike Barack Obama and his advisers , whose faith in government action is near religious , Putin warns against “ excessive intervention in economic activity and blind faith in the state ’s omnipotence . ”
It may be a “ natural reaction ” to turn to an increased state role in such times as these , yet “ instead of streamlining market mechanisms , some are tempted to expand state economic intervention to the greatest possible extent .
The concentration of surplus assets in the hands of the state is a negative aspect of anti-crisis measures in virtually every nation . ”
Oh , but this is my favorite part :
“ In the 20th century , the Soviet Union made the state ’s role absolute .
In the long run , this made the Soviet economy totally uncompetitive .
This lesson cost us dearly .
I am sure nobody wants to see it repeated . ”
I lived to see an American president red-baited by the Kremlin !
That , in itself , is utterly amazing , and proof positive that we have indeed slipped into an alternate universe , a Bizarro World where history runs backward  and in reverse .
Sounding more like Barry Goldwater than any Russian leader I ever heard of , Putin took aim at the Obama - commies :
“ Nor should we turn a blind eye to the fact that the spirit of free enterprise , including the principle of personal responsibility of businesspeople , investors , and shareholders for their decisions , is being eroded in the last few months .
There is no reason to believe that we can achieve better results by shifting responsibility onto the state . ”
Those remarks would not be out of place coming out of the mouth of a Republican congressman  and a fairly conservative one  inveighing against the “ stimulus ” package .
Putin goes beyond even this , however , when he warns against the danger of military Keynesianism :
“ Unfortunately , we are increasingly hearing the argument that the buildup of military spending could solve today ’s social and economic problems .
The logic is simple enough .
Additional military allocations create new jobs .
“ At a glance , this sounds like a good way of fighting the crisis and unemployment .
This policy might even be quite effective in the short term .
But in the longer run , militarization wo n’t solve the problem but will rather quell it temporarily .
What it will do is squeeze huge financial and other resources from the economy instead of finding better and wiser uses for them . ”
Paul Krugman and his media echo chamber happily inform us that it does n’t matter how or where we spend the money , just as long as we “ stimulate ” the economy with massive injections of monetary steroids .
So why not military spending  lots more military spending ?
After all , this is a point both conservatives and liberal Keynesians can agree on , as Putin surely realizes .
I suspect his call for disarmament will be largely ignored , along with his insight that demilitarization will “ bring significant economic dividends . ”
That a Russian leader is now telling Americans that their turn toward statism and militarism is harmful both to themselves and to the world is a turn of events no one of my generation could possibly have imagined , certainly not anyone of libertarian inclinations .
It is a sad and telling commentary that no American leader of any stature , aside from the previously mentioned Rep .
Paul , has the courage to tell us what we need to hear .
Court says private school can expel lesbians SAN BERNARDINO
A private religious high school can expel students it believes are lesbians because the school is n't covered by California civil rights laws , a state appeals court has ruled .
Relying on a 1998 state Supreme Court ruling that allowed the Boy Scouts to exclude gays and atheists , the Fourth District Court of Appeal in San Bernardino said California Lutheran High School is a social organization entitled to follow its own principles , not a business subject to state anti-discrimination laws .
" The whole purpose of sending one 's child to a religious school is to ensure that he or she learns even secular subjects within a religious framework , " Justice Betty Richli said in the 3 - 0 ruling , issued Monday .
As with the Boy Scouts , she said , the primary function of the school is to instill its values in young people , who are told of its policies when they enroll .
Kirk Hanson , a lawyer for the two girls , said he was disappointed and would talk to them about a possible appeal to the state Supreme Court .
According to the court , he said , " if you 're a religious school , you can discriminate on any basis you want . "
He also noted that all children must attend school , either public or private , and said schools serve different purposes from a voluntary organization like the Boy Scouts .
John McKay , a lawyer for California Lutheran , said he was pleased the court recognized that " a religious school is not a business , and the purpose of a religious school is to teach Christian values . "
Any state law that required the school to admit gays or lesbians would violate the school 's freedom of expression and religion , McKay said .
The ruling is the first to consider a religious school 's status under California 's Unruh Civil Rights
Act , which forbids discrimination by businesses and was amended in 2005 to include discrimination based on sexual orientation .
State education law also forbids anti-gay bias , but that law applies only to public schools .
The girls were juniors at the high school in Wildomar ( Riverside County ) when the principal , Gregory Bork , summoned them to his office in September 2005 and questioned them separately about their sexual orientation and whether they loved each other .
The principal acted after another student reported postings on the girls '
MySpace pages .
Bork suspended the girls based on their answers , and the school 's directors expelled them a month later .
The girls , who later graduated from another high school , have not been identified and have not discussed their sexual orientation , Hanson said .
Their suit said the school had no right to dismiss them because of its perception that they were lesbians .
The court acknowledged that past rulings have interpreted the Unruh Act 's definition of businesses broadly , to include a Boys ' Club , the Rotary Club and a private golf club that let the public use its facilities .
But the school differs from those institutions , the court said , because the main reason for its existence is the religious message it seeks to instill in its students .
Yesterday 's show trial of bankers in the House of Commons was a waste of urgent time .
It was an exercise in apologetic hindsight conducted , so it seemed , almost entirely in Scottish .
Extracting parliament 's favourite word , sorry , was predictably easy , and meaningless .
Anyone can say sorry .
What we await is the remotest idea as to why bankers , or the institutions they represent , should still be trusted with rescuing the British economy from recession .
They yesterday presented themselves as like the lame - duck carmakers , shipbuilders and steelworkers of the 1970s .
They had been beaten by the market and run out of money .
They wanted more .
So what was new ?
MPs and the public expect these people to rescue the economy from a mess , but that depends on their re-establishing credit .
The sole justification for the government bailing out a bank is to protect confidence in its credit .
The Northern Rock rescue in 2007 achieved that goal .
A year later , when Lehmans was allowed to collapse , confidence evaporated and credit across the –banking sector imploded .
At this point a banker has no profession , let alone a role as a national hero .
He is a mere receiver of debts .
If you give such people a sudden stash of unearned wealth , they are duty - bound to use it to pay off their debts , not donate it to the public .
Yet each week over the past three months we have been told that billions are being provided to banks " in the hope " that it will be lent on to companies .
What is this hope ?
It is like giving addicts heroin in the hope that they will pass it on to their local hospital .
The money has gone into relieving balance sheets coated in red .
It is throwing good money after bad , otherwise known as madness .
With £ 200bn of public money apparently available to rescue the economy , giving it to already failed institutions in such a way that they were sure to cause it to vanish was plain stupid .
The Treasury must have known full well that none of the money it was supplying would go into extending credit , yet it continues to supply the money .
It is as if Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling were willing the economy into deflation and depression .
MPs seem to want bankers to behave like social workers .
They are not social workers , and never presented themselves as such .
They are bankers , and bankrupt ones .
Their retail arms have become mere money boxes .
They should have been taken into temporary public ownership , their deposits protected by the state and their commercial lending ring - fenced with public money .
It happens in war .
It is not that difficult .
Just as Labour opposed privatisation when it was needed , so now it opposes nationalisation when it is needed .
Its ideological knickers are in a total twist .
Some ministers were allegedly persuaded by officials ( and journalists ) that they should not " play banker " .
It is hard to see what else they were playing when they were devoting such huge sums of public money to bank subsidies .
Why give the money if not for some public purpose ?
I am reinforced in my view that the attempt to rescue the world from depression during the last six months has been based on a gigantic folly , that salvation would lie in rejecting Keynesian demand stimulus and depend instead on using public money to underpin bank speculation .
Not since the Treasury in 1720 invested £ 27,000 in the stock of the South Sea Company , gambling that it would relieve the national debt , has that department indulged in such massive stupidity .
Money is currently being taken from consumers – which means taken from spending and thus manufacturers , services and investment – and tipped into a black hole of financial bankruptcy .
Even now , the Bank of England talks of boosting money supply to the economy by buying bonds from banks , in the repeated " hope of getting the banks to lend " .
The Treasury can print £ 1bn or £ 50bn and it will make no difference .
Unless banks are –nationalised and directed , and financial institutions can channel public money into credit , these sums will just vanish into balance sheets .
One illustration of the present –madness was the reaction to the one basically sensible measure taken by Alistair Darling , the pre-Christmas reduction by 2.5 percentage points in VAT .
This injected £ 12bn into demand and must have played some part in underpinning spending at that time .
Because it was boring and circumvented the banks , the VAT cut was –vilified by financial journalists and others .
There was no spicy upturn in the stockmarket and therefore the reduction " did not do the trick " .
They would have preferred the money being given to their friends in the City , or invested in something spectacular , like infrastructure , roads or the Olympics .
That the VAT cut was swamped by adverse news did not make it wrong .
But the effect of criticism was to ensure that the Treasury did not repeat such direct demand stimulus .
Four times as much was promptly given to the banks , where it disappeared into Icelandic debt or sub - prime collaterals .
So did the next £ 150bn .
As one of the journalists who appeared before this same Treasury committee last week , I was shocked at the limited range of the questioning .
Like yesterday , the MPs seemed ill briefed and desperate to score points , in our case to prove that the credit crunch was somehow the fault of the press .
MPs were not concerned with the real economy , only the banks and the reporting thereof .
The show trial that should be staged is not of bankers or journalists but of ministers , who have now blown £ 200bn of public money on a massively failed strategy for staving off recession – indeed on making it worse .
Because ministers are from the same club as MPs , they are let off lightly .
There will be no show trial of the chancellor .
The truth is that if anyone has slept through this sorry affair , it has been parliament .
If I were the second team of bankers appearing before the Commons today , I would take a large mirror into the room and hold it up in the face of the committee .
Let them see themselves in the dock for once .
What were they doing as the economy lurched to war ?
Perhaps they might say sorry too .
Berlin is at last having to deliver on the Faustian bargain made by Germany 's political class when it swapped the D - Mark for French acquiescence in reunification .
It must either go the whole way towards EMU fiscal union and take responsibility for Italy 's public debt ( 111 pc of GDP by next year ) , Austria 's loans to Eastern Europe ( 70 pc of GDP ) , the adventures of Ireland 's ' Canary Dwarf ' ( €400bn or so in liabilities ) , and Spain 's housing collapse ( 1 m unsold homes ) , or jeopardize its half - century investment in the political order of post - war Europe .
Letting EMU fail at this stage would have far higher costs than never having launched the project in the first place .
The UK 's policy will make historians wince .
But being seen to be " doing something " is easier than doing what really needs to be done .
For that would involve politicians tackling powerful vested interests and admitting to previous regulatory mistakes .
Ministers , first and foremost , need to hose down a banking sector that 's holding the country to ransom .
Our most senior bankers should be gathered in a locked room and – under threat of custodial sentence – be forced to disclose the full extent of their potential sub - prime losses .
At the moment , banks are lying about the liabilities they face .
That 's why they wo n't lend to each other – which has gridlocked the inter - bank market , blocking crucial credit lines to firms and households .
The official website for the new Fullmetal Alchemist television anime series has launched with a short teaser video , and it has confirmed that the television series will launch in Japan in April .
It also promised that new information will be provided in the January issue of Square Enix 's Monthly Shonen Gangan magazine ( where Hiromu Arakawa 's original manga is still serialized ) on December 12 .
The same issue will also include a poster with a key visual image .
The new Fullmetal Alchemist teaser trailer ran at the end of the episode of Mobile Suit Gundam 00 Second Season that aired in Japan on Sunday .
The trailer says , " New training … a fullmetal artificial limb , a body of armor … the brothers ' journey begins .
Fullmetal Alchemist : April 2009 Training .
In this palm , is there hope or despair ? "

VMware Saw the Threat , Releases Open Source Virtualization Client
by Ostatic Staff - Feb. 03 , 2009
Last year , following a crash in its share price and the replacement of its CEO with a seasoned Microsoft executive , I wrote about the perils that virtualization titan VMware faces .
The problems come from two trends : 1 ) open source virtualization offerings ; and 2 ) free virtualization within operating systems .
From the free virtualization project Xen to the virtualization that Microsoft , Sun , Red Hat and others offer in operating systems , VMware 's proprietary strategy looked mighty shaky .
Today , VMware made what I consider the shrewdest move it could : launching an open source client for virtual desktops .
The CEO replacement who entered VMware last year was Paul Maritz , a long - time Microsoft executive with intimate familiarity with how Windows swallowed up entire categories of utility software as it grew up , by simply wrapping free utilities into the operating system .
Paul knows about that , and he had to have seen last year the dual threats to VMware of open source virtualization offerings and virtualization on board in operating systems .
The VMware View Open Client allows businesses to host virtualized desktops in the data center , and users can access their desktops from any device .
Going with an open source solution like this was VMware 's only choice , especially as Microsoft includes Hyper - V virtualization in Windows Server .
I 'm sure Maritz was very focused on the Microsoft threat , because he used to be behind similar threats .
VMware can grab market share with this move , stave off Microsoft dominance , and offer support and services around its open source offering .
The company will also get substantial good PR from the decision .
You can get VMware View Open Client here , licensed under the Lesser GPL .
It 's essentially a bet that customized user desktops are hosted in data centers , and that businesses will take to the idea that they can save money by centralizing custom solutions in data centers for desktop users to take advantage of through virtualization .
I agree with Dana Blankenhorn that this could cause a big shakeup in the software world .
" Imagine what the PC world would be like if enterprises are able to slow purchases regardless of head count , " he writes .
" Imagine what Microsoft revenues might look like in that world . "
Indeed .
Even before this new musical style called blues was being invented , perfected and evolved into rock and roll , a separate form of music with similar ethnic and geographic heritage was following it ’s own trajectory .
From it ’s roots as ragtime and dixieland in the late 1800 ’s , jazz was moving toward swing even before Son House and Robert Johnson had started recording .
From the early 1920 ’s through to his death in 1974 , “ Duke ” Ellington was a giant of the jazz , or as he called it “ American Music ” , scene .
Born Edward Kennedy Ellington on April 29 , 1899 he was said to have inherited an elegance and fine manner from his mother and self confidence from his father .
His childhood friends noticed his noble airs and dubbed him “ Duke ” .
Ellington considered himself a composer and band leader first and pianist second , treating his orchestra as his primary instrument .
And what an instrument they were – his orchestra featured some of the greats of jazz , many of whom stayed with him for decades .
I ’ve picked this week ’s album , Ellington At Newport 1956 ( Complete ) , mostly because I fell in love with the story behind it .
The story goes something like this …
By 1956 the Duke and his band were in a bit of a flat spot .
They had been a major part of the establishment for the best part of three decades and with rock and roll on the up and up – jazz , and big band jazz in particular , was under threat .
Music festivals were a relatively new thing at this point ( the Newport was founded in 1954 ) and so were live recordings of concerts .
And audiences were generally fairly sedate .
On July 7 1956 , after some drenching thunderstorms , Duke Ellington ’s orchestra took the stage to kick off the closing night of the festival .
Or at least some of them did – for some reason four of the band had failed to make it on stage .
After a rendition of “ Star Spangled Banner ” and a couple of standards Ellington and his band left the stage .
They returned at the end of the evening with the full compliment and started off with “ Take The A Train ” followed by recently composed and under - rehearsed medley called “ The Newport Suite ” .
These fell flat and the band moved on through a couple of other lack lustre numbers that also failed to give any indication of what was to come .
The band then went back to some of their earlier material with a pair of blues called “ Diminuendo in Blue ” and “ Crescendo in Blue ” – these songs were to be joined by an interlude from saxophonist Paul Gonsalves .
At the proper moment , Gonsalves dug in with his tenor and started blowing .
Somewhere around the seventh chorus , it happened .
A young blonde woman in a stylish black dress sprung up out of her box seat and began to dance .
She had caught the spirit , and everyone took notice — Duke included .
In a few moments , that exuberant feeling had spread throughout the crowd .
People surged forward , leaving their seats and jitterbugging wildly in the aisles .
Hundreds of them got up and stood on their chairs ; others pressed forward toward the stage .
Sam Woodyard and Jimmy Woode kept driving the beat mercilessly .
The power of that beat , and the ferocity of Paul ’s solo , is what stirred the crowd to those heights .
Duke himself was totally caught up in the moment .
The audience was swelling up like a dangerous high tide .
Gonsalves played 27 choruses before Duke let him quit and then he apparently collapsed in exhaustion .
But 7000 people in the audience wanted more .
The band played a couple more numbers and then the concert organisers tried to call it a night , but neither Duke nor the crowd were having any of it .
When the next song “ Tulip or Turnip ” drew to a close concert organiser George Wein jumped up , grabbed the mic and told everyone “ That ’s it !
End of story ” .
This is and the altercation between Ellington and Wein that followed can be heard on the track colourfully titled “ Riot Prevention ” .
Wein insisted Duke call it quits , but Duke was n’t to be dissuaded .
“ Let me tell them good night , ” he pleaded .
“ Can I tell them good night . . . ” “ No more music , Duke . . . ” But I let him approach the microphone for a final adieu , one last “ We love you madly ” for the masses .
They quieted as Duke stepped up and began to speak .
“ Thank you very much , Ladies and Gentlemen . ”
The roar began again .
Duke continued over the din .
“ We have a very heavy request — for Sam Woodyard !
And “ Skin Deep ” !
And so the band kicked on with a raucus , 9 minute song with a number of wild drum solos – definitely not the thing to calm a mutinous crowd .
However once the noise had died down the band moved onto a soothing classic called “ Mood Inidgo ” and Ellington farewelled the crowd :
“ Ladies and Gentlemen , we certainly want to thank you for the way you ’ve inspired us this evening .
You ’re very beautiful , very sweet , and we do love you madly .
As we say good night , we want to give you our best wishes , and hope we have this pleasure again next year .
Thank you very much . ”
And that was the end of that .
This concert , and the recording of it , propelled Ellington into the second half of his career and on to another couple of decades of success .
But the recording itself was largely a fabrication .
During the concert there were a range of stuff ups that resulted in the much of the recording being lost – the main example being the famous Gonsalves solo which he played into the wrong mic .
Ellington and the band went into the studio shortly after the gig and rerecorded significant chunks , mixed these recordings with the original and some canned applause and released it as a live album .
But the story does n’t even end there …
In 1996 someone , somehow incredibly located the recording captured by the mic that Gonasalves did play into and in 1999 a new version of the concert , which mixed the original recording and the lost pieces , was released .
And finally the original concert could be heard in it ’s entirety .
This recording , tittled Ellington At Newport 1956 ( Complete ) is this weeks album .
It ’s a small piece of musical history and one of those rare moments of beautiful madness .
The quotes in this story all come from Duke Ellington at Newport , 1956As told by Newport Jazz Festival founder George Wein – a first hand account of the evening by the festival organiser .

In this time of social distancing , small groups and less travel , atlatls do offer a wonderful opportunity to get outdoors without a lot of people .
While many of the atlatl meets have been cancelled this year at state parks or public places , a few have and continue to be held in backyards or private locations .
Check out the World Atlatl Association Event Page to see the status of events .
The Ohio Atlatl Association is still keeping its dates but has switched to private locations as public places grapple with summer of 2020 events .
Events are being held with awareness of small groups , social distancing and masks .
If you are unable to get to a group , spend some time by yourself or with a family member practicing your skills .
The WAA will try to keep everyone updated about events .
Stay safe as our country wrestles with this pandemic .
A researcher has come up with some simple math that sucks the life out of the vampire myth , proving that these highly popular creatures can't exist .
University of Central Florida physics professor Costas Efthimiou 's work debunks pseudoscientific ideas , such as vampires and zombies , in an attempt to enhance public literacy .
Not only does the public believe in such topics , but the percentages are at dangerously high level , Efthimiou told LiveScience .
Legend has it that vampires feed on human blood and once bitten a person turns into a vampire and starts feasting on the blood of others .
Efthimiou 's debunking logic :
On Jan 1 , 1600 , the human population was 536,870,911 .
If the first vampire came into existence that day and bit one person a month , there would have been two vampires by Feb.
1 , 1600 .
A month later there would have been four , and so on .
In just two - and - a - half years the original human population would all have become vampires with nobody left to feed on .
If mortality rates were taken into consideration , the population would disappear much faster .
Even an unrealistically high reproduction rate could n't counteract this effect .
" In the long run , humans cannot survive under these conditions , even if our population were doubling each month , " Efthimiou said .
" And doubling is clearly way beyond the human capacity of reproduction . "
So whatever you think you see prowling around on Oct. 31 , it most certainly wo n't turn you into a vampire .

Mr Wickramatunga died of head wounds
The editor of a Sri Lankan newspaper often critical of the government has been shot dead in Colombo .
Police say Sunday Leader editor Lasantha Wickramatunga was shot by unidentified gunmen on motorcycles as he drove to work in the city suburbs .
He died from head wounds after nearly three hours of surgery , doctors say .
Correspondents say Mr Wickramatunga had numerous run-ins with the government .
It is the second major attack on the media in Sri Lanka this week .
On Tuesday , gunmen armed with grenades ransacked offices of the largest private TV broadcaster in the country .
Journalists in Sri Lanka have suffered a string of recent attacks and media freedom groups say intimidation and violence make it one of the most difficult countries in the world in which to report .
Lasantha Wickramatunga meticulously collected the facts , which was why so many politicians feared him
Vijitha Yapa ,
Ex -Sri Lankan newspaper editor
Grievous blow to Sri Lankan media Gunmen raid Sri Lanka TV station Amnesty International said in November that at least 10 media employees had been killed in Sri Lanka since 2006 .
Some reporters say the intimidation has got worse as the war has intensified with the Tamil Tigers .
The BBC's Roland Buerk in Colombo says the government has been accused of encouraging the violence , by branding reporters seen as critical rebel - sympathisers and enemies of the state .
Sri Lanka 's government has condemned the incidents and ordered full police investigations .
' Courageous ' Television pictures of Mr Wickramatunga 's car showed blood - stained seats and bullet holes in the windscreen .
" We tried our best to revive him but we couldn't , " hospital director Anil Jasinghe told the AFP news agency .
Police are investigating the attack Police spokesman Ranjith Gunasekera said gunmen on two motorcycles had escaped after carrying out the attack .
No arrests have been made .
President Mahinda Rajapaksa said in a statement he was " grieved and shocked " by the killing and ordered police to investigate .
The campaigning group Reporters Without Borders said : " Sri Lanka has lost one of its more talented , courageous and iconoclastic journalists .
" President Mahinda Rajapaksa , his associates and the government media are directly to blame because they incited hatred against him and allowed an outrageous level of impunity to develop as regards violence against the press . "
Mr Wickramatunga , 52 , had been highly critical of government policy and the war with the Tamil Tiger rebels .
He received numerous death threats through his career and was detained on several occasions because of the controversial nature of his stories .
In his last editorial he accused the president of pursuing the war to stay in power .
Critics say press freedom is under attack in Sri Lanka " Winning the war ?
Then there must be elections around the corner .
It is no secret that the war has become Mahinda Rajapaksa 's recipe for electoral success , " he wrote .
He also criticised opposition parties for staying " mute " , suggesting journalists were having to do their job for them .
" That is why more journalists have been attacked in recent years than have opposition politicians , " he said .
Mr Wickramatunga 's death follows Tuesday 's attack on the MBC group in Colombo .
He worked for the channel as a presenter on a weekly current affairs programme .
MBC had been criticised by the government for its coverage of the war against the Tamil Tigers .
More than a dozen intruders held guards at gunpoint and shot up equipment , causing extensive damage .
Libel cases
The anti-establishment Sunday Leader has regularly sent up the country 's politicians and its editor had fought a number of libel cases .
He was prosecuted for criminal libel of President Chandrika Kumaratunga in 2000 , but escaped serious punishment .
Correspondents say that while some of his stories verged on the salacious , others exposed high - level corruption - he recently reported on an arms procurement deal with Russia in which it was alleged that government ministers were receiving financial " kick - backs " .
Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa , the president 's brother , is currently suing the paper for defamation .

All bamboo rats are slow - moving and usually spend their time in underground burrows , feeding on bamboo .
Chinese bamboo rats are often sold for meat in Chinese markets .
The largest rats in the world are thought to be African giant pouched rats , which can grow up to 36 inches in length .
Aspiring scientists from the Zurich School of Applied Sciences have built a video simulation that displays the flight path of every commercial flight in the world over a 24 - hour period .
There is n't much of an application for it , but it sure is cool to look at .
While the map may look complex , Dr. Karl Rege tells us he and his team found it surprisingly simple to assemble using data readily available on the internet .
" We used a commercial website called FlightStats to gather global flight and schedule information , " he says .
" So there was no need to contact the different airlines . "
The team mined FlightStats for the departure and arrival times of every commercial flight in the world , then plugged it all into a computer to assemble their simulation .
For the sake of simplicity , they assumed every plane traveled at the same speed and every flight took the most direct route to its destination .
Then every flight was assigned a position on a Miller cylindrical projection , which is similar to a Mercator Projection but does n't distort the poles so much .
" After that we drew it , that was it , " Rege says .
" It was that easy .
We are astonished that nobody did it beforehand . "
Well , others have done it , but on a much smaller scale ...

Good news ( nerds alike ) !
In an attempt to combat early - morning insomnia , I was flipping through the channels and saw a commercial for the new season of Breaking Bad .
Having fallen victim to last years writer strike , the show was cut at 7 episodes with no indication whether it would get picked up .
Fortunately , the second season of Breaking Bad premieres March 8 ( 10 EST/9 CST ) on AMC .
For what it ’s worth , Comcast is running the whole first season in its On - Demand package .
For those not familiar with the show , Walt White ( portrayed by Bryan Cranston ) is a high school chemistry teacher in his 50’s recently diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer .
In what appears to be a mid-life crisis , White partners up with a former student to launch a fairly lucrative methamphetamine business .
The show twists and turns through a maze of fundamentally accurate synthetic chemistry ( chem - geeks no doubt rejoiced in terms such as “ chirality , ” “ reductive amination ” and “ titration ” ) and the street drug business .
While most pilots are pretty rough around the edges , Breaking Bad ’s was reasonably tolerable and starts the show off fairly well .
I ’ll caution you ( should you need it ) that the show is quite graphic in some scenes and largely presents an overall sense of dread .
We used S&G for an important family event that I booked a few months in advance .
I had called to confirm prior to the event and the operator I spoke with was great and assured me all was in the system .
On the day before I received an email reconfirming the pick ups .
This gave me a sense of comfort that they would come on time .
We needed a town car for the way to the event and to our surprise a stretch Limo pulled up in front of our house 10 minutes early .
The driver was great and said that the upgrade was courtesy of Steve the owner .
What a nice touch .
On the way home we needed a 14 passenger van and that too came a few minutes early and the driver was also awesome .
He helped us take stuff home from our party in addition to giving our family and some friends a safe event free ride home .
I highly recommend this company and will use them again next time for a ride to and from the airport .
The vehicles were clean and the drivers could n't be nicer

Dubai Bans Novel from Literary Festival for Gayness ; Margaret Atwood Leads Festival Boycott
The first - ever literary festival in the Middle East has banned its first - ever book , a novel called " The Gulf Between Us , " by Geraldine Bedell , which contains a gay Muslim character .
The book , published by Penguin , was intended to debut at the " Emirates Airline International Festival of Literature " but was axed because the committee running the show decided that it would n't make it past the Government censor .
As soon as the ban was announced , Canadian author Margaret Atwood ( author of " The Handmaid 's Tale , " and who was probably going to be murdered anyway ) dropped out of the festival where she was slated to attend Isobel Abulhoul is running the festival for Emirate Airlines , the chief sponsor .
Abulhoul also directs a bunch of bookstores called Magrudy 's in the region .
She had this to say about the festival 's decision : " I have lived in Dubai for forty years .
Based on my knowledge of who would appeal to the book - reading community in the Middle East , and having read 150 pages of Ms Bedell 's manuscript I knew that her work could offend certain cultural sensitivities .
I did not believe that it was in the Festival 's long term interests to acquiesce to her publisher 's ( Penguin ) request to launch the book at the first Festival of this nature in the Middle East .
We do , of course , acknowledge the excellent publicity campaign being run by Penguin which will no doubt increase sales of her book and we wish Ms Bedell the very best .
"
In a blog post for the Guardian entitled " The only offensive thing about my novel is that it 's been banned , " Bedell defended her book , a thing which she did n't really have to do :
" The Gulf Between Us , now coming out in April , is n't an earnest book .
It 's a comedy , and a romantic comedy at that .
But it does have a theme , and it 's prejudice .
All kinds of thoughtlessness crop up -- not just homophobia , but Islamophobia , anti-Americanism , prejudice against women , against Arabs .
The thread running through the novel is that the blinkered ideas that stop us understanding each other are often nonsensical .
"
The festival was created with the intent to spread awareness of Arab literature , in addition to inviting authors from the West to sign books , talk about literature , and tell the rest of the world how enlightened Dubai is in order to suck investment dollars from corporations and real estate developers .
From the EAIFL wesbite " His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum , the Ruler of Dubai and Vice President of the UAE , has recently announced his vision of eradicating illiteracy from the Arab World .
Suddenly everyone in Dubai is reading ( or at least carrying a book under their arm ) and every day we hear how important literacy is ; there is active encouragement for budding authors and attractive awards for those involved in the world of books .
A festival of literature held in Dubai will heighten everyone 's awareness and enjoyment of anything connected to the written word : books , authors , poetry and debates .
" Other authors from the West slated to attend the festival include Frank McCourt , Terry Brooks , Brian Aldiss , Kate Adie , Simon Armitage , Anne Fine , Anthony Horowitz , Julia Glass , Alexander Maitland , Grace Nichols , Edmund O'Sullivan , and James Waterson .
The festival will feature 66 writers from all over the world , and while a few of them probably DO have problems with gay people , we only know for certain that Margaret Atwood would rather sleep at night than get paid and chill out in a golden whirlpool full of dewy , high - class , know - their - place prostitutes .
Although , to be fair , the situation is complicated .
Do you boycott , or do you show up and make a complete ass of yourself ?
The only thing sweeter than refusing to eat is to bite the hand that feeds .
Frank McCourt : rabid , drunken after - dinner speech ?
Note : Terry Brooks , your elves are gay .
The only UNACCEPTABLE stance for a writer who plans to attend this festival is ambivalence .
We will remember those who smile for the publicity photos , make bank , and lend their credibility to a festival which has no problem squashing brave writers for expressing themselves .
Dubai : Walk before you run .
Literary festivals are n't what make the West liberal , secure , and good for long - term financial investment : human rights , free speech , and democracy do this .
People are waiting for a bloody revolution to stain your beautiful glass buildings before they start sinking money into your future .
Ten undescribed species of amphibians — including nine frog and one salamander — have been discovered in the mountains of Colombia , report scientists from Conservation International ( CI ) .
The amphibians were discovered during a recent Rapid Assessment Program ( RAP ) expedition in the Tacarcuna area of the Darien , near the border with Panama .
Also sighted were 50 other species of amphibians , 20 species of reptiles , and almost 120 species of birds .
The survey also documented the presence of large mammals including Baird ’s tapir ( Tapirus bairdii ) , listed on the IUCN Red List as Endangered in Colombia ; white - lipped peccary ( Tayassu pecari ) ; and four species of monkeys , including Geoffroy ’s spider monkey ( Ateles geoffroyi ) , Geoffroy ’s tamarin ( Saguinus geoffroyi ) , white - throated capuchin ( Cebus capucinus ) and the mantled howler monkey ( Alouatta palliata ) .

The “ new ” amphibians included spiky - skinned , orange - legged rain frog , three poison dart frogs and three glass frogs , named for their transparent skin .
“ The potentially new species of amphibians include three glass frogs of the Nymphargus , Cochranella and Centrolene genus ; three poison dart frogs of the Dendrobatidae family ( Colostethus , Ranitomeya and Anomaloglossus genera ) , one harlequin frog of the Atelopus genus , two species of rain frogs of the Pristimantis genera and one salamander of the Bolitoglossa genus , ” said CI in a statement .
“ Colombia holds one of the most diverse amphibian communities in the world , with 754 species currently recorded . ”
The scientists called the area a “ Noah ’s Ark ” of wildlife , alluding to both its biodiversity and its importance as a biological bridge between Central and South America .
“ Without a doubt this region is a true Noah ’s Ark .
The high number of new amphibian species found is a sign of hope , even with the serious threat of extinction that this animal group faces in many other regions of the country and the world , ” said Jose Vicente Rodriguez - Mahecha , Scientific Director of CI - Colombia .
CI - Colombia hopes to use the results to help justify greater protection of the region , including the establishment of a new protected area in the Tacarcuna hills .
While much of the Colombian Darien is under some form of protection , it faces threats from logging , cattle ranching , agricultural development , unsustainable hunting , and mining .
The RAP took place over three weeks and involved herpetologists from CI - Colombia and ornithologists from the Ecotrópico Foundation , with the support of the local Emberá community of Eyakera .

ROME , Italy ( CNN ) --
The world 's richest countries committed to " any further action that may prove necessary " to restore confidence in the global financial system , their finance ministers said as they wrapped up a two - day meeting in Rome .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is calling on governments to help restart the flow of credit .
The Group of Seven finance ministers also urged countries not to close their markets to goods and services from abroad .
" An open system of global trade and investment is indispensable for global prosperity , " they said in a statement at the end of their meeting Saturday .
" Protectionist measures ... would only exacerbate the downturn " in the worldwide economy .
The ministers said the global banking crisis had revealed " fundamental weaknesses in the international financial system " and called for urgent reform .
Watch workers put pressure on the ministers »
New U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , making his international debut at the meetings , called on governments to focus on stabilizing and strengthening financial systems and help restart the flow of credit .
" Although the precise mix of measures must be tailored to each country 's situation -- our financial systems are different , [ the ] structures of our systems are very different -- there is a common recognition of more capital and government financing to help restart credit markets , " he said .
Italy hosted the meeting in its role as G - 7 president for 2009 .
G - 7 members includes the United States , Germany , Japan , France , Italy , Britain and Canada .
The agenda drawn up by Rome calls for adopting global measures and economic policy reforms capable of stabilizing the world economy and ensuring transparency to allow markets to function correctly .

Geithner spoke just after the U.S. Senate gave final approval late Friday to a $ 787 billion recovery package to boost the U.S. economy .
He told attendees that the package " provides a very powerful mix of investments and tax cuts to create jobs and to strengthen our long - term growth potential . "
" As we act together to build a strong foundation for economic growth and recovery , we need to begin the process of comprehensive reform of our financial system , so that we never again face a crisis of this severity , " Geithner said .
Another attendee , International Monetary Fund Managing Director Dominique Strauss - Kahn , said he supports such stimulus packages for advanced countries .
" The question is no more to convince the governments to move today , but for them to implement the policies they need to manage , " Strauss - Kahn said .
He also warned of the dangers of protectionism , which he said may still come " through the back door , especially in the financial sector . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A 13 - year - old Arizona girl who was strip - searched by school officials looking for ibuprofen pain reliever will have her case heard at the Supreme Court .
The U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether school officials were right to strip - search a student over ibuprofen .
The justices accepted the case Friday for review .
They will decide whether a campus setting gives school administrators greater discretion to control students suspected of illegal activity than police are allowed in cases involving adults in public spaces .
Arguments are expected to be heard in April .
At issue is whether school administrators are constitutionally barred from conducting searches of students investigated for possessing or dealing drugs that are banned on campus .
A federal appeals court found the search " traumatizing " and illegal .
Some parents say older children deserve the same constitutional rights as adults , but educators counter that a school setting always has been treated differently by the courts .
They say a ruling against them could jeopardize campus safety .
The case involves Savana Redding , who in 2003 was an eighth - grade honor student at Safford Middle School , about 127 miles from Tucson , Arizona .
Earlier that day the vice principal had discovered prescription - strength ibuprofen pills in the possession of one of Redding 's classmates .
That student , facing punishment , accused Redding of providing her with the 400 - milligram pills .
The school has a zero - tolerance policy for all prescription and over - the - counter medication , including the ibuprofen , without prior written permission .
Redding was pulled from class by a male vice principal , Kerry Wilson , escorted to an office and confronted with the evidence .
She denied the accusations .
A search of Redding 's backpack found nothing .
Then , although she had never had prior disciplinary problems , a strip - search was conducted with the help of a school nurse and Wilson 's assistant , both females .
According to court records , she was ordered to strip to her underwear and her bra was pulled out .
Again , no drugs were found .
In an affidavit , Redding said , " The strip - search was the most humiliating experience I have ever had .
I held my head down so that they could not see that I was about to cry . "
With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union , Redding and her family sued , and a federal appeals court in San Francisco , California , ruled against the school .
The court wrote : " Common sense informs us that directing a 13 - year - old girl to remove her clothes , partially revealing her breasts and pelvic area , for allegedly possessing ibuprofen ... was excessively intrusive . "
The court said the school went too far in its effort to create a drug - and crime - free classroom .
" The overzealousness of school administrators in efforts to protect students has the tragic impact of traumatizing those they claim to serve .
And all this to find prescription - strength ibuprofen . "
In its appeal to the high court , the school district said requiring a legal standard of " probable cause " to conduct student searches would cast a " roadblock to the kind of swift and effective response that is too often needed to protect the very safety of students , particularly from the threats posed by drugs and weapons . "
The high court has had a mixed record over the years on students ' rights .
The court could now be asked to clarify the extent of student rights involving searches , and the discretion of officials over those for whom they have responsibility .

A Catholic Priest from Haiti gives his assessment
TITUSVILLE , Florida ( Reuters ) - NASA unveiled a modest telescope on Friday with a sweeping mission -- to discover if there are any Earth - type planets orbiting distant stars .
Though astronomers have found more than 330 planets circling stars in other solar systems , none has the size and location that is believed to be key to supporting life .
“ A null result is as important as finding planets , ” Michael Bicay , director of science at NASA ’s Ames Research Center in California , told reporters in Titusville , Florida , where the Kepler telescope is being prepared for launch .
Named after the 17th century astronomer who figured out the motions of planets , Kepler is scheduled for liftoff on March 5 aboard an unmanned Delta 2 rocket from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station .
Once in position trailing Earth in orbit , Kepler will spend at least 3 1/2 years focused on a star - rich patch of sky between the constellations Cygnus and Lyra .
Equipped with a 95 megapixel camera -- the largest ever flown in space -- Kepler will attempt to find Earth - sized planets flying across the face of their parent stars .
Scientists say it will be a bit like trying to spot a gnat in the glare of a floodlight .
To an outside observer , a planet as large as Jupiter temporarily blots out about 1 percent of visible light from the sun as it makes its transit .
Passage of Earth - like worlds produce a change in brightness of about 84 parts in a million .
“ This is a very small signal and it ’s very difficult to predict , ” said James Fanson , Kepler project manager at the U.S. space agency ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California .
“ The plan is to stare at this place for three years and wait for the stars to wink . ”
Kepler will need to keep extraordinarily still for weeks at a time , breaking its gaze only once a month for 12 - hour radio linkups with Earth .
Data from 170,000 target stars will be relayed for scientists on the ground to analyze .
The selected stars are just a fraction of the estimated 4 million objects that will fall within Kepler ’s view , but scientists want to maximize the telescope ’s observing time to make sure they catch as many blinking stars as possible .
To find a planet like Earth , scientists will need to catch at least four transits , a process that will take about 3 1/2 years .
Ground - based telescopes will be used to verify results .
“ There ’s several astrophysical phenomena that masquerade as planets , ” Bicay said .
“ We ’re going to have to sort them out . ”
No one knows how many stars have solid - body planets like Earth orbiting in what are called habitable zones , places where liquid water can exist .
Water is believed to be crucial for life , although that evidence is based on a sample of one -- Earth .
“ We ’re privileged to live in a time and in a country that has the technology to answer these questions scientifically , ” said Fanson .

Late last week through this weekend I started receiving numerous emails about gold backwardation theories , Amero sightings , Yuan devaluations , and all sorts of other stories that do not stand up to even the most casual of scrutiny .
Let 's kick off the hit parade with Red Alert : Gold Backwardation
Gold going to permanent backwardation means that gold is no longer for sale at any price , whether it is quoted in dollars , yens , euros , or Swiss francs .
The situation is exactly the same as it has been for years : gold is not for sale at any price quoted in Zimbabwe currency , however high the quote is .
To put it differently , all offers to sell gold are being withdrawn , whether it concerns newly mined gold , scrap gold , bullion gold or coined gold .
Negative basis ( backwardation ) means that people controlling the supply of monetary gold cannot be persuaded to part with it , regardless of the bait .
These people are no speculators .
They are neither Scrooges nor Shylocks .
They are highly capable businessmen with a conservative frame of mind .
They are determined to preserve their capital come hell or high water , for saner times , so they can re-deploy it under a saner government and a saner monetary system .
Nothing Special About Backwardations
I have seen countless commodities go into backwardation for numerous reasons , the most frequent being a radical temporary divergence between immediate demand and overall demand .
I have seen backwardations that have lasted years .
The article is based on the assumption that a backwardation will necessarily lead to a breakdown of the delivery mechanism .
For every breakdown of delivery there have been thousands of backwardations .
It is only if and when the actual breakdown occurs that the conclusions the author draws make any sense .
Gold No Longer For Sale At Any Price ?
Mish : James what size bars of gold and silver do you buy ?
Turk : Bars that meet the standards of the LBMA .
Gold bars weigh approximately 400 oz per bar , and silver 1000 per bar .
Mish :
Any problems with deliveries ?
Turk :
Not yet , we buy in the spot market for cash .
We have had difficulty though in finding bonded silver bars in London ( i.e. , bars in bonded warehouses which enables our customers to buy silver without UK 's onerous 17.5 % value added tax - by buying bonded bars , the tax is levied only if they take delivery of the bars ) .
Consequently , we raised our fees in London to discourage buying there so that customers buy silver in Zurich instead , where we have had no problem finding bars .
Mish :
What do you know about smaller sized bars and getting deliver of them ?
Turk :
Only what I have been reading , namely , that they are in short supply and premiums as a consequence have soared .
Mish :
Can you address or speculate as to why manufacturers are not making smaller retail sized bars of silver and gold , as well as coins ?
Turk :
The manufacturers are primarily government owned mints .
So one theory is typical government incompetence .
There is another theory .
Given that all government mints around the world are not meeting demand , the theory is that we are seeing a coordinated effort by governments to purposely not meet demand .
Their objective is to keep people out of metal so that their money remains in the banking system .
Why Pay A Premium ?
China To Devalue Renminbi ?
" Rumors are flying that China and another nation are going to intentionally devalue their currencies within days by 30 - 35 % in retaliation for the US ( Henry Paulson and Heli Ben ) having double - crossed the Chinese .
The rumor has it that the dynamic - duo promised the Chinese the US would bail them out of the hundreds of billions ( trillions ? ) of garbage mortgage securities US bankers sold them over the past few years and would use TARP / EESA funds to do so .
And , while making the case for the bailout before the Congress they used the threat of Chinese retaliation as leverage . "
China ‘ Highly Unlikely ’ to Reverse Policy , Weaken Yuan
China is “ highly unlikely ” to favor a weaker yuan because the government will rely more on spurring domestic demand than exports to support the economy , a former adviser to the central bank said .
Twelve - month forward contracts rose for a second day as traders scaled back bets on depreciation after Assistant Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said last week China will keep the yuan stable at a reasonable and balanced level .
The central bank last week allowed the biggest decline in the yuan since ending its fixed exchange rate in 2005 , prompting speculation it favors a weaker currency .
“ It is highly unlikely that China will reverse its course , ” Yu Yongding said in an interview via e-mail .
“ The export sector can and should be helped by means other than devaluation .
Why should China do something that is not in its long - term interests and whose impact in the short - run is uncertain ? ”
Amero Nonsense
Please Think !
Amero Uproar
Neither the U.S. Mint nor the U.S. Treasury had a hand in creating these " Ameros . "
These coins are merely collectibles offered to the buying public by a private company in the business of manufacturing such curiosities .
On 31 August 2007 , conservative radio host Hal Turner used images of the Amero tokens offered by Designs Computed as the basis for a far - fetched tale about his having been given a " real " Amero coin on the sly by an anonymous Treasury agent .
In that story he claimed that a few days after he posted about the coin , a web site proclaiming Ameros to be fantasy coins ( i.e. , the Designs Computed site ) was erected on the Internet as part of " a full blown effort to discredit my story and the images as fake . "
That was not the case .
The Amero story was just another of Turner 's outrage - provoking fictional tales .
In December 2008 , Turner tried beating the same tired , apocryphal drum by claiming that he had obtained samples of Amero " paper currency notes . "
Trump Sees Act Of God
Guess who is complaining that condominiums in Donald Trump ’s latest big project are ridiculously overpriced .
Donald Trump is .
But he is n’t cutting the prices .
He says the banks wo n’t let him .
The project is the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago , which is to be the second - tallest building in that city ( after the Sears Tower ) .
By Mr. Trump ’s account , sales were going great until “ the real estate market in Chicago suffered a severe downturn ” and the bankers made it worse by “ creating the current financial crisis . ”
Rather than have to pay the $ 40 million , Mr. Trump thinks the bank should pay him $ 3 billion for undermining the project and damaging his reputation .
Those assertions are made in a fascinating lawsuit filed by Mr. Trump , the real estate developer , television personality and best - selling author , in an effort to avoid paying $ 40 million that he personally guaranteed on a construction loan that Deutsche Bank says is due and payable .

I want to follow up today on my postings over the weekend on how organizing to defend progressive congressional representatives and punish reactionary ones is far superior to street protests as political action on the Israeli - Palestinian issue .
Cont’d
People wrote to defend street protests or minded that I said I was annoyed .
I stand by what I said .
Street protests have not stopped the US Congress from turning Israel into a massive arms arsenal in the Middle East or from granting it $ 3 billion a year , in part for such military purposes .
( Israel has received the lion ’s share of US foreign aid in recent decades , even though people in Rwanda need the help more and even though the Israeli per capita income in the early zeroes has been something like $ 17,000 a year , more than Potugal or Poland and similar to Greece . )
Protests have not stopped US complicity in the creeping Israeli colonization of the West Bank , including the area around Jerusalem .
They have not stopped the 2006 or 2009 wars of their client on weak and virtually defenseless opponents such as the south Beirut tenement buildings or Gaza hospitals .
Street protests have their uses as a means of creating a political movement , but they are helpless in this case because the important decisions are taken on Capitol Hill .
I wrote on Saturday :
‘ Europe has ceded dealing with the Israelis to the United States .
The people of the United States have ceded dealing with the Israelis to the US Congress .
The US Congress generally abdicates its responsibilities when faced with large powerful single - issue lobbies such as . . . the Israel lobbies .
So Congress has ceded Israel , and indeed , most Middle East , policy to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and its myriad organizational supporters , from the Southern Baptist churches to the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs .
The Israel lobbies take their cue on what is good policy from the Israeli government and the Likud Party .
So , US Israel policy is driven by . . . the Israeli rightwing .
That is why Congress voted 309 to five to support Israel ’s war on the people of Gaza , with 22 abstaining . ‘
The US Senate and the US House of Representatives are not afraid of street protests in San Francisco .
And why should they be ?
What sort of threat is it to them , that we say if they do n’t change their legislation we will . . . walk in the street ?
Their response would be , “ Make sure you have comfortable shoes ; now , I have to see this nice lobbyist in my office in a thousand dollar suit and alligator shoes who has an enormous check for my current political campaign . ”
The representative would say to us , “ I want to be reelected .
You cannot stop that by walking in the street , nor can you help me win by doing so .
This televangelist from an Israel lobby , in contrast , is going to help me buy loads of television commercials dissing my opponents in the next election .
And , if I do n’t help the gentleman out , he ’s threatening to give the money instead to my rival and unseat me .
So you ’ll forgive me if I turn my back on you and wish you well with your , uh , walking .
But I ’ve got an election to win , rather than to lose , and you are irrelevant to that task . ”
And the big oak door in the Dirksen building slams in our faces .
The US Congress is the best proof of evolution .
Its members are constantly subjected to unnatural selection by single - issue lobbies ..
Run for office demanding gun control , and you will likely lose , because the National Rifle Association will arrange for its members to fund your opponent ’s campaign .
If you do win , the NRA will redouble its efforts for the next time , which if you are a representative , is only 2 years later .
After a while , there just are n’t a lot of strong gun control proponents in Congress .
It is the same with the Israel lobbies , which are just as single - minded .
We have had people in Congress who dared criticize Israel .
They were Paul Findley , Charles Percy , William Fulbright , Roger Jepson , Pete McCloskey , Earl Hilliard , and Cynthia McKinney .
They were all successfully ousted by AIPAC - coordinated campaigns .
US political races are close and candidates have flaws , so AIPAC often denies in public that it made the difference and implies with high dudgeon that there is something wrong with alleging that it did .
In private , AIPAC officials boast endlessly on the HIll about how no one messes with them and survives .
The reason AIPAC and its constituencies among the Evangelicals and American Likudniks has been so successful is that there is virtually no countervailing political force .
Madison and other Founding Fathers set up the US , as Ian Lustick has argued , on the assumption that on most important issues there would be opposing factions who would check each other in the legislature .
The drawback of their system is that when there is only one effective faction on an issue , it completely dominates politically .
Madison ’s system worked to prolong the heyday of Big Tobacco far beyond what was reasonable .
Anti-smoking campaigners who knew that smoking kills you dead could not make headway with Congress because the tobacco - growing and cigarette industries would counter - lobby .
But on some issues there is no one on the other side of it to lobby and threaten Congressmen .
Thus , there was not much precentage until recently in pushing for an end to the boycott on Communist Cuba , since the Florida Cuba lobby would punish you politically and virtually no one would reward you .
Sometimes it is alleged that AIPAC is so successful because those Americans who support Zionism are extremely wealthy .
But this thesis is wrong on two counts .
First , the general society in the US generates $ 13 trillion a year , and no small single - issue faction can compete with that vast public wealth .
The general public could always out - fund a smaller single - issue opponent if the general public was motivated to do so .
While in the past , raising small $ 25 and $ 50 contributions from large numbers of people was difficult , Obama showed that it can now be done .
Second , AIPAC [ pdf ] does not manage to get its affiliated PACs to give that much money to individual campaigns , as the Washington Report on Middle Eastern Affairs points out .
Sometimes it is just $ 1000 or $ 2000 , sometimes it is much more .
Of course , one has to take into account that they might fund a rival with much more money if the congressperson defied them .
I wrote on Saturday :
‘ a lot of US congressional races , which happen every two years , are close , and [ even ] $ 4000 is very welcome , especially when there are no costs to signing AIPAC letters and supporting AIPAC positions because there is nobody to speak of on the other side .
And if the money comes in every campaign , along with lots of office visits and letters and local community support , it builds loyalty over time .
AIPAC gets in before the ground floor , introducing potential candidates to big donors and has its supporters in the Democratic party machine , e.g. , vet candidates .
Tom Hayden , a leftist American if there ever was one , had to be approved of by the Bermans to amount to anything in southern California Democratic politics , and it led to his taking an unfortunate stand on the 1982 Lebanon War of which he came to be ashamed .
If all this is true for Hayden , imagine how it is with some used car salesman in southern Indiana . ’
So I am proposing a coordinating committee that would have two purposes :
1 . It would develop a large database of leaders of concerned civic organizations so as to tip them when big votes in Congress were coming .
These organizations would then tip their members , who would deluge Congress with millions of emails on what is at stake .
There are lots of allies in US civil society for this enterprise , including religious congregations ( liberal synagogues , Presbyterians , Catholics , Quakers , Mennonites , Muslim mosques , Unitatiran Universalists , etc. ) .
Such an effort could also mobilizer Greens , Libertarians , and Socialists , as well as sections of the Democratic and Republican Parties .
2 . It would direct sympathetic PACs to donate money in close races to anti-war candidates , and to defend representatives and senators who dared buck the Israel lobbies from reprisals .
It would also try to unseat hawks like Joe Lieberman and Saxby Chambliss .
This “ For America Public Affairs Committee ” could easily be organized and could quickly become very influential .
All we would need to do is win a couple of rounds with AIPAC and suddenly congressional votes would be much closer .
It would also coordinate the lobbying of those existing small PACs which are more narrowly focused but which have a strong interest in the peace process –J Street , the Peace Action Politica Action Committee , the Arab American Political Action Committee , the National Iranian American Council , etc. , etc .
From looking at the reaction to my post on Saturday , I can see that a lot of people just do n’t understand how all this happens .
They do n’t know that the US Congress is arming Israel to the teeth and passing laws that implicitly enable colonization of the Palestinians and make it impossible for the Palestinians effectively to resist , even peacefully .
Others accept the argument but think that Congress ca n’t be changed in this regard .
But of course it can be changed .
There is also a false meme that I am talking about blogging here .
I am not .
I am talking about a lobby , an organization with brick and mortar offices .
I pointed out Saturday ,
‘ I underline that such an organized push in American politics for more equitable policies in the Middle East is not anti-Israel , but rather intended to help Israel find a way forward with its neighbors that does not involve continued displays of sado - masochistic politics on both sides .
Make no mistake .
AIPAC and other rightwing Israel lobbying organizations are enablers and drug dealers , hooking Israeli politicians on the high of power and violence , and we can only heal Israel and Palestine by cutting off that supply .
Such an effort would also have wider implications for US foreign policy .
In the coming two or three decades , the US military industrial complex will want to fight several ruinous wars on major oil - producing and gas - producing states not in the US political orbit , such as Iran .
At the moment , the US public is helpless before such ambitions , because the War Lobby is even more effective than the Israel lobbies are . ’
With regard to protecting and rewarding the principled members of Congress who do put America first the collective blog Journalscape understood exactly what I am talking about and tried to dig up donation or contact information for the five who voted “ no ” :
These 5 and the 22 who voted ‘ present ’ are now on the endangered species list .
( I did not find that anyone made a similar list of donation / contact information for the 22 ; they are in danger , too ) .
AIPAC officials are as we speak holding secret meetings with donors to strategize how to turn them or get rid of them even as we speak .
But since the parts of the blogosphere that care about rights for Palestinians , about demilitarizing the Middle East , and about helping Israel attain its potential as a positive factor in Middle Eastern affairs instead of attack dog for people like Dick Cheney in the region , do n’t seem to understand how pivotal lobbying , Congress , and loyalty to political friends are– likely we will go on losing 309 to 5 .
It ’s been a while since I played any otome games but with the Da Capo otome game I decided to get back into it .
Similarly with the whole Da Capo series , this takes place on the Hatsunejima island with the never wilting cherry trees .
In addition the “ magical sakura tree ” is there as well .
As far as time period , it seems to take place simultaneously as the Da Capo II series would have .
With this in mind , characters like Suginami and Shirakawa Nanaka are present in the game as the “ senpais ” of the main character ( and her best friend . )
Nanaka plays a minor role in the story .
So let ’s begin with a brief introduction .
The heroine , ( the player ) is Koujou Shio .
Shio ’s name sounds like “ salt ” but the kanji in her name come from “ history ” and “ cherry tree ” so that was probably meant to be purposely ironic .
The premise is Shio lives with her brother in a huge house while her parents who are “ very much in love with each other ” live abroad .
The reason is her father got sent abroad for his job and the mother who is so in love with him abandoned her kids and went with him lol .
Well at the time the older brother was in college anyway but yea your daughter is umm still in high school ?
😯
Anyway Shio ’s brother came back to live with her after he graduated and became a teacher at her school – her homeroom teacher to be precise .
Oose & her shota brother Yuu
Shio has a best friend named Oose .
She has these fugly short bangs and a stupid side ponytail .
In addition her head is too big for her body and rather than being a good friend who “ helps you out ” she actually cockblocks more often than I wish she would .
But then she ’ll be like “ OOPS I GUESS I ’M A COCKBLOCKER ALLOW ME TO LEAVE LOL ! ” and then disappears .
In addition she blatantly makes fun of Shio for being flat chested and I had never realized it from the promo pic but at the end of the first route I played I was like “ damn she looks like a 12 year old loli 😯 ” Anyway , I was hoping Nanaka - senpai would play a bigger role as Shio ’s friend but unfortunately we ’re stuck with cockblock - chan .
Shio has a special power that when she touches someone , ( holding hands etc ) they will be able to hear her inner thoughts .
Sometimes this can be bad because she may not always want people to know what she ’s thinking .
Anyway , one day Shio runs into a bunch of guys moving into a new place .
She finds out that 2 of them are the same age as her .
One is a big butthole while the other one is really sweet and gentle … from there our story begins .
Shinomiya Kouhei – I was originally going to just do Ryohei ’s story first because it was the first name on the list but he was pissing me off so I decided to do the nice guy ’s route first .
Kouhei is one of the youngest Shinomiya brothers and a twin of Ryohei .
Unlike Ryohei he has the cute babyface and all the girls fawn around him forming a “ little harem ” as Shio likes to call it .
Despite this , Kouhei always wants to hang out with Shio and always asks her to go home with him and eat lunch with him and his brother .
He likes Shio so much that he even goes as far as to try to shoot a 3 point shot in a basketball match so that he can confess to her .
Unfortunately he loses and he gets really depressed about it but then Shio urges him to confess to the “ girl he likes ” .
BOY WAS SHE SHOCKED WHEN SHE FOUND OUT SHE’S THE APPLE OF HIS EYE 😆
Things were pretty cool but then Kouhei got all weird and started acting like his brother .
In addition he even felt the same pain as his brother even if Ryohei was in a completely different place .
I guess he had wished upon the magical sakura tree that he wants to be like Ryohei .
The reason behind his madness is when they were looking at old baby pictures , Shio saw a picture of Ryohei as a shota and thought that she may have met him when she was little .
In addition Ryohei knew that she hurt her foot at the night festival and what color of hair clip to get her for her birthday .
Kouhei got really jealous of his brother and got really depressed and ran off to be under the tree ( cause that ’s where everyone in Da Capo goes when they ’re sad . )
Shio found him there and explained to him that she found an old paper airplane that he had made when they were little so yes , the 2 of them had memories together as well and she would n’t suddenly pick Ryohei over him .
And so with this it ’s a happy ending ( with a really lame kiss CG ) .
I ’ll forgive it though because Kouhei is so freaking MOEEEE and adorable some fangirl inside me kept trying to bust out .
: shy :
Koujou Takaaki – Takaaki is Shio ’s older brother , the oniichan character of the game .
The best part is , he has glasses which I find hot , but he ’s not a kichiku megane character .
( That role is saved for Kei , read below . )
He acts like a very caring and overprotective oniisan but in actuality he can’t wait to bed his sister soon as she becomes legal . 😆
In fact it takes his old college friend to come down to make him more aware of his feelings ( along with a ton of alcohol of course . )
Meanwhile , it takes
Shio ’s best friend cockblock - chan , er I mean
Oose to make her realize that she wants her oniisan in “ that ” way too .
But not to worry , there is no incest for this is Da Capo where non blood related siblings falling in love is as common as breadsticks at a pizza place .
So since they are not blood related one day Shio admits her love to him and says she knows he feels the same way .
He denies it for a while but a hug from behind ™ gets his loins stirring to admit his feelings back to her .
Unfortunately this does n’t quite roll well with Oose and she begins spreading rumors and saying things like a “ teacher hitting on his sister is disgusting ” .
By then everyone except for the Shinomiya brothers whisper about Shio and ignore her .
Eventually Shio gets pissed and drags
Oose to the roof threatening that she will not allow her to spread anymore rumors and get Takaaki fired from his job ( since rumors in Japan is the equivalent of committing murder or something . )
Once Takaaki admits that he loves shio deeply , Cockblock - chan gives up and as an apology holds a bootleg wedding ceremony for Shio & Takaaki in the classroom .
Umm how is this going to help with the rumors ?
P.S. Cockblock - chan , you ’ve now made my shitlist for the rest of the game routes .
Ryunosuke – Omg this arc left me in tears .
😥 I KNEW it was gonna happen and I KNEW what the ending would be like but I bawwwed anyway .
;-;
So please do n’t read this part because it contains major spoilers .
The story is similar to the original Da Capo game story about the cat girl but in this version it ’s a dog .
Basically a boy who says he knows
Shio follows her and ends up staying at her house due to memory loss .
He acts a lot like a dog but he always is very loyal to Shio and loves her very much .
However as time passes he eventually gains his memories back and it turns out that he was a dog that Shio had rescued a few years back .
She could n’t keep the dog because her mother was allergic so she ended up giving it to an old man to take care of .
Unfortunately a week prior to the story , the old man had died leaving the dog all alone .
The dog went looking for Shio but in the cold wet rain it was too much for him and so he curled up near the infamous sakura tree .
He thought he was going to die but the tree allowed him to make a wish .
The wish was that he could get a chance to say thank you to Shio one last time before his death .
When he turned into the boy he completely forgot about this wish because all he could think of was to see Shio .
Eventually Shio goes looking for him because he leaves her house after telling her “ thank you ” and then she finds him disappearing in front of the tree .
She then realizes he ’s the dog and after his human form disappears , all Shio is left with is the corpse of the dog . 😥
The next day she buries the dog with the help of Ryouhei who is there to help and comfort her .
( I swear Ryohei ’s been there for her in like every story so far , more on that later . )
Shinomiya Kei – Kei is the Kichiku Megane character of the series .
He is voiced by the same seiyuu as Junichi from the recently aired Akaneiro ni Somaru Saka anime .
Basically it means he is very cold and aloof and no matter how nice the heroine acts , it takes the entire story to finally “ thaw ” his cold ice queen king heart .
He is also the oldest Shinomiya brother and he is sort of the “ father ” figure because both of the Shinomiya parents died in a car accident when they were young .
Shio first meets him when he becomes her tutor because she ’s like failing her exams .
Thanks to him she ranks 3rd in the class and after this they get more involved .
He even forces her to watch horror movies , which she absolutely hates .
😆 Eventually Shio falls in love with him and confesses her feelings .
He tells her that he ’ll “ go out with her ” for a year because he has plans to go to college off the Hatsunejima island next year .
Despite their “ boyfriend and girlfriend status ” Kei still treats her like a child .
Despite her wanting to go on dates with him , hold hands , kiss etc. he acts like he HAS to do it .
Eventually after a failed picnic date , Shio goes home depressed and gets hit by a motorcyclist ( seriously wtf ? 😯 ) Kei thinks it ’s his fault and gets very upset and emotional at the hospital once Shio wakes up .
He then blames himself for it and tells Shio to stop this “ dating game ” and to never see him again ( including the tutoring . )
Later on Shio speaks with her brother and Aoi about the accident and finds out that Kei was in the car when his parents crashed – but he was the only survivor .
Due to this he has been blaming himself for it and wearing a non-ticking watch from his deceased father .
Eventually with the help of Aoi , Shio tricks Kei into coming to see her .
She knows he still loves her because he continues to carry a photo of the 2 of them from the amusement park that Cockblock - chan took .
Shio gives Kei back his watch and she was able to get it to work again .
It ’s as if she has “ made his time move ” .
They go on a date to the amusement park and Kei tells her that he wo n’t be leaving the island for college and will instead attend a university on the island for her .
They finally share their first kiss in the haunted house that they went on their first date on 😆
Shinomiya Aoi – Aoi is the “ playboy ” type of the game .
He has many fangirls fawning over him and making him bentos every day .
In addition he slacks off a lot , and often skips classes or comes late to school .
He takes interest in Shio , well interest in making fun of her .
However like a “ little boy who really likes a girl , only shows it by teasing her ” he makes fun of her a lot .
He tells her very serious things , but then immediately says “ just kidding ! ” afterwards making her really annoyed .
Unfortunately all the jokes he makes are actually true .
It turns out , he was left on the door step of the Shinomiya house and so the Shinomiya parents adopted him as one of their own .
Therefore he is n’t related to any of the Shinomiya brothers by blood .
In addition , he has some sort of life threatening disease that may kill him when he reaches a certain age .
Due to this , he ’s has to get left behind a year and he has no desire to bother with class anyway because he could “ die tomorrow ” .
Shio of course does n’t know any of this and he somehow ends up asking her to be his girlfriend but he keeps leaving her hanging on dates .
She thinks that he ’s just messing with her until she finds out about his disease and that he ’s basically passed out and had to get taken to the emergency room each time he did n’t show up .
One night he is supposed to stay home due to his illness but he runs off to the night festival with Shio .
He goes with her to the infamous sakura tree and asks to break up with her because he does n’t want to be a burden on her like he ’s been a burden on his brothers .
He says the reason they all moved back to Hatsunejima was so that he could ge better care for his health .
Shio is upset but later hears that he will be transferring to a hospital outside the island .
She runs to see him and says she will wait for him .
A few months pass and he returns to the island in ( presumingly ) better health .
This whole plot felt a lot like the plot for Shiori from Kanon so I guess I did n’t really get too emotional here .
In addition , Aoi ’s personality is SOOOO annoying I just could n’t get to like him as a character .
Shinomiya Ryohei – Please note , for best results / feelings / etc play his route last as he is the “ destined one ” for Shio in this story .
I mean yea we know in these kinds of games the routes are usually somewhat self contained , but similarly to how in Under the Moon Lenny was the “ main guy ” Ryohei is the main guy here .
Because of this the story and Shio ’s daily life drastically changes due to this so playing it first or in the middle would sorta throw things off .
Ryohei and Shio were childhood friends but when the Shinomiyas moved off the Hatsunejima island , Shio wanted to say goodbye but did n’t get a chance .
She made a wish on the sakura tree for her voice to be able to reach Ryohei one more time – which is how she gained the ability for others to read her thoughts when they touch her .
However with Ryohei , he has always been able to hear her thoughts , whether he actually touches her or not .
When Shio first runs into Ryohei he immediately recognizes her as the girl from the past , but not only that , she was his first love .
Unfortunately for Shio it takes the entire story for her to realize that Ryohei was the one who always protected her from bullies when she was a loli ( she still look like one 😛 ) .
In Ryohei ’s story , Shio is often bullied by her female classmates and forced to do cleanup duty for all her male classmates .
She just pretends like its no big deal and does it without thinking .
Ryohei tells her that it ’s ok to show your emotions and get angry out loud , there ’s no need to take their shit .
One day when it rains the stupid bitches destroy Shio ’s umbrella and she goes home soaking wet .
However Ryohei finds her , takes her home and there she begins crying .
He tells her that he does n’t mind about “ hearing her voice ” and that just in front of him she does n’t need to worry about it .
Eventually Kouhei and Oose get tired of seeing the 2 of them act so tsundere around each other and have “ lovers quarrels ” so they set the 2 of them up in the park with some fireworks .
This obviously works and when Aoi even makes a joke saying “ why do n’t you guys just kiss do n’t mind us ! ” and Ryohei gets annoyed at all his brothers and promptly smacks one on an unpexpected Shio right then and there .
😉
Anyway after that Shio & Ryohei begin to officially date even though they still get teased by Aoi , Oose and Kouhei .
One day however Shio wakes up and the whole day everyone can hear her inner thoughts .
Even when she ’s not trying to project them she disrupts class and everyone stares at her like it ’s disgusting .
She runs home crying and when Ryohei tries to comfort her she tells him she ’s scared and asks him to leave .
When he is told that he scares her , Ryohei gets seriously upset .
He gives her the birthday present as well as the little chick phone strap that he ’s been carrying from the “ girl who he first fell in love with . ”
The next day Shio feels terrible and tries to appologize to him but he just ignores her and tells her he has nothing to say to her .
That day after school the stupid bitches trick her into going to the roof top and they lock her out .
Everyone leaves and she is left alone with no cell phone to call for help .
It begins raining and she ’s once again stuck in the rain .
She does n’t know what to do so she calls out in her inner thoughts for Ryohei to rescue her .
Lo ’ and behold her thoughts of course reach him and he opens the door from the rooftop and brings her inside .
They go into the classroom to talk about the magical sakura tree and their childhood and that they have had a lot of misunderstanding between each other .
This of course ends in them kissing alone in the classroom ( ＊´∀` )
Of course the story is a happy ending with the 2 childhood friends finally reuniting together and once again falling in love .
It ’s interesting but out of all the stories , this one focuses more on SHIO rather than on the MALE protagonist whose ending you ’re trying to reach .
Some notes and after thoughts :
In the omake section there ’s a BGM called “ Dream of Cherry Tree ” which is basically identical to “ 懐かしい夢 ” from the original Da Capo soundtrack .
First run of the game took me about 15 hours .
After that it averaged between 3 - 5 depending if I went to eat dinner or something in between .
I have no idea why but there was no actual “ KISSING ” CGs in the game .
It was either “ implied ” or it would show characters ’ faces “ close together ” but no actual mouth to mouth CGs ( except one with Ryohei orz ) .
Seriously what the hell is this ?
I know it ’s an all ages game but gimme a break ! 😯
Until I played Ryohei ’s story , Kouhei was my favorite but I gotta say I really like Ryohei after playing his route ( ＊´ω` ) I guess I ’ll admit Ryohei is # 1 for me while Kouhei is # 2 .
After these 2 I ’d say I really liked Takaaki ’s route .
He was such a sweet oniisan ( and a really hot one at that lol . )
Not a fan of Aoi or Kichiku - megane and the dog story made me cry so much I had to wash my face with cold water 20 times OTL
Ryohei is a tsunderella boy .
But that ’s what makes him so moeee when he ’s all deredere ( ＊´ω` )
Suginami shows up a lot in Aoi ’s arc but he just says random shit and then disappears .
At least Nanaka had some sort of involvement in the story sheesh !
Cockblock - chan ’s younger brother has a crush on Shio and wants to marry her when SHE grows up . 😆
Junichi- san from the first Da Capo series comes in as an advice giving grandpa to Shio about the sakura tree .
Junichi- san ; ____ ; I almost cried for no reason lol .
Junichi- sannnnnn ;___ ;
Anyway great game .
Glad I got to play an otome game without some nasty ass sex scene with horrible sound effects and all that other terrible １８ 禁 game crap that I can’t stand .
It sorta makes you focus on the story more and enjoy it for what it is rather than sitting there going “ oh god I hope I do n’t have to DO this character ” or “ oh god I ca n’t wait till we get to the sex scene ! ”
The worst part is how most otome games also have the stupid rape scenes ugh .
That ’s something I definitely did NOT miss while playing Girl ’s Symphony .
I recommend this game to all otome game fans as well as Da Capo fans alike . ヽ(*´∀｀* ) ﾉ
When I went to bed the evening of finishing the game I ended up crying lol .
I think more becuase I really liked the story so much that because it was over it made me sad .
😦
Oh well .
Nowadays , in the digital age , we ’re used to sharing our photos on social media , but we do n’t often get to hold those captured moments in our hands as a printed photo .
Even though there are tons of flashy digital cameras with impressive , high - tech features , not all of them have the tactile quality of a classic instant camera that we still find ourselves yearning for .

This is because of the movie Coraline .
Take not its not Caroline movie but Coraline movie .
Some searches are just wrong .
And I could not leave the topic without correcting the same .
Coraline movie showtime is today February 6 , 2009 .
Actually , I did not know of this movie until now .
So that I could not give you a Coraline movie review .
Other casts of the movie are Teri Hatcher , Dawn French , Jennifer Saunders , and Ian McShane .
The Coraline 3d movie centers on the exploration of Coraline in the outside world .
And how she realizes that what was once she thought a wonderful place became a dangerous one for her and her family .
Kudos to Dakota Fanning !
I am fan .
Below is the Coraline trailer .

I 'm writing this from the fastest domestic broadband connection I 've yet experienced .
It 's at a new housing development in Wembley in north London which lured me here with the promise of 100 Mbps .
From their show flat with a view of the roof of Wembley Stadium I 've so far managed to do a live radio broadcast via fast broadband - though my PC crashed and needed rebooting minutes before I had to go live - and we 're also trying to broadcast live TV over the net , though here we 're being slightly hamstrung by the limitations of our broadcast software .
While this housing development has been wired with fibre from the start , and residents have access to phone , broadband and TV over the network , nobody is actually being offered a 100 M bps subscription .
Instead residents pay for an 8 , 16 or 32 M bps service - but then can press a button marked " boost " to get their speed up to 100 Mbps .
That costs them £ 1 for 30 minutes .
It seems the developers are n't convinced there is yet a real demand for 100 Mps .
They have " future - proofed " the homes , but if you want to spend a lot of time in the internet fast lane the bills will mount up .
What the developers Quintain tell me is that for plenty of residents 32 M bps at around £ 30 a month is more than enough .
For some of the students who live here , that means they can also get by without a television , using the BBC iPlayer and other online services for all their viewing needs .
I did n't inquire too closely whether they had got themselves a television licence .
We pressed the boost button - and revved up to " 100 Mbps " .
A quick speed test proved pretty impressive .
I got 78 Mps downstream and as much as 50 M bps upstream , meaning I could have sent my video files to the BBC in seconds rather than minutes .
And nobody really expects to get right up to the advertised speed , do they ?
But showing just what fast broadband could do proved tricky .
There had been some rather over - excited claims that it meant you could download a movie in seconds , which was obviously untrue .
But we tested it with Apple 's iTunes , attempting to download a 1 Gb movie .
We got a message telling us that would take 20 minutes , so we stopped .
A helpful network engineer from the organisation running the service told me that even if you were getting out onto the internet at 100 Mbps , you would find the brakes being slammed on once you hit Apple 's servers .
" iTunes has a limit on the speed at which you can download , " he said .
With very few people able to go that fast , it 's apparently not worthwhile catering for them .
In order to see this content you need to have both Javascript enabled and Flash installed .
Visit BBC
Webwise for full instructions .
If you 're reading via RSS , you 'll need to visit the blog to access this content .
So we turned to the good old iPlayer and downloaded a programme .
The latest edition of " Who Do You Think You Are ? " is an hour long and is a 341 Mb file .
We had that downloaded and playing within a minute - pretty impressive .
( By the way , you may notice that on the tape the man from Quintain ends up clicking on the stream rather than the download but I can assure you that the file was there - I had a go after him and downloaded an episode of Top Gear in under a minute too ) .
This kind of speed will only spread slowly across Britain - it 's relatively cheap to lay fibre into new homes , but costs a fortune to dig up the streets and bring fast broadband to everyone .
But from what I 've seen in Wembley , fast broadband will mean big changes to the way we view - and make - television .
Continental jet 516 — a two - engine Boeing 737-800 — completed a two hour test flight out of Houston today with one engine powered by a 50 - 50 blend of regular petroleum - based jet fuel and a synthetic alternative made from Jatropha and algae .
" The properties of the fuel are fabulous , in fact , the bio part of the blend has a lower freeze point than Jet A , " says Billy Glover , managing director of environmental strategy at Boeing , which is helping organize similar test flights throughout the world .
" The fuels we 're testing now have equal or better energy content than the Jet A requirements , " of at least 48 megajoules per kilogram ( 20,700 British thermal units per pound ) .
In fact , the alternative jet fuel — known as synthetic paraffinated kerosenes — has as good or better qualities than Jet A refined from petroleum :
It does not freeze at high - altitude temperatures , delivers the same or more power to the engines , and is lighter , as well .
And the refiners , UOP , LLC , a division of Honeywell , can turn almost any plant oil into the alternative jet fuel .
" They 're all the same as far as we 're concerned .
We 're feedstock agnostic , " says chemist Jennifer Holmgren , UOP 's general manager of the renewable energy and chemicals business ..
" If the feedstock is available , we can process it to make fuels of the same capability . "
For this flight , UOP transformed gallons of oil derived from the seeds of the Jatropha plant — an African weedy shrub that can be grown on land that is not being used for food production — provided by Terasol Energy .
The Jatropha oil made up the bulk of the biofuel but 2.5 percent of the blend was also derived from 600 gallons ( 2,270 liters ) of algae oil procured by Sapphire Energy from Cyanotech , an algae grower in Hawaii — the first time such algae oil has been used for flight .
" Crude oil is nothing but algae from 10 million years ago during a great algae bloom that got transported underground and today we call it crude oil , " says Tim Zenk , vice president of corporate affairs at Sapphire Energy .
" We take that process and speed it up by 10 million years and produce green crude . "
Of course , making algae oil in any quantity remains a huge challenge , from perfecting the growth of the organism and its oil production to extracting the product in a cost - effective manner .
Zenk says the company hopes to produce 300 barrels of oil from algae grown in brackish ponds at its test facility in Las Cruces , N.M. , by 2011 and 10,000 barrels a day in five years .
It will cost " between $ 60 to $ 80 per barrel , " he says .
" That 's with very conservative numbers in terms of oil produced per acre . "
Companies ranging from Science Applications International ( SAIC ) in San Diego to San Francisco - based start - up Solazyme are working to produce jet fuel from algae oil as well .
In the meantime , efforts to grow Jatropha — already planted in quantity in Africa and India — may be scaled up , whereas other feedstocks that can be rotated with wheat , such as Camelina — a relative of canola — will play a role .
" The way to think about it is that Camelina and Jatropha will be at the correct price point — $ 80 per barrel or less — within three to five years and algae in eight to 10 years , " UOP 's Holmgren says .
The next test flight — a Japan Airlines flight scheduled for January 30 — will employ a jet biofuel made from Camelina supplied by Bozeman , Mt. - based Sustainable Oils , a joint venture of Seattle biotech company Targeted Growth and Green Earth Fuels in Houston .
" It 's a nonfood primary crop , can be grown on land that is n't being used , but it fits with existing farm infrastructure , " says CEO Tom Todaro of Targeted Growth .
" If you 're expecting to have hundreds of millions of gallons of jet fuel in the next five years produced from a plant feedstock , it 's almost certainly going to be Camelina . "
That 's because it can be grown on wheat fields that would otherwise be left fallow without harming the soil and in some cases improving it .
" You give farmers an opportunity to make money in a year when they were n't going to , " Todaro says , and the company is already recruiting farmers to grow the crop as part of plans to produce 1 million gallons ( 3.8 million liters ) of the oil this year .
" By 2010 , at current wheat prices [ of $ 5.50 per bushel ] , we can supply oil at $ 2 per gallon [ and ] … we could make north of 50 million gallons . "
But the commercial aviation industry burns nearly 240 million gallons ( 945 million liters ) of Jet A daily and if oil prices were to approach the $ 150 - per - barrel mark reached last year , the demand for Camelina oil might end up driving farmers to grow less wheat — a staple food crop .
" If the incentives are wrong it could displace wheat , " UOP 's Holmgren says .
" We do n't want it to be priced above what the price is for food . "
That is why the industry is likely to use a variety of different feedstocks —
Jatropha , Camelina , algae and others — to create the jet biofuel , Boeing 's Glover says .
" Different parts of the world will source differently , " he adds .
" That 's another thing we are trying to do with these flights : show that we can use a variety of feedstocks and still get consistent high quality results . "
In the near - term , the jet biofuel is likely to be blended with the petroleum - based variety , because the biofuels lack aromatics — hydrocarbon rings — that interact with the seals in current engines , helping swell them shut .
" We fully expect that the first fuels will be 50 - 50 blends or less just due to the supply availability and the conservative nature of the industry , " Glover says .
The Continental flight — and the Air New Zealand and Virgin Atlantic flights prior to it — prove that such blends can be effective , or even better than petroleum - based kerosene alone .
" We have also found that engines running this mix emit less smoke even than those fueled by traditional jet fuel , " said Eric Bachelet , president and CEO of CFM International in a statement .
And with this Continental flight , UOP has proved that blending the biofuels themselves , in this case algae and Jatropha , works well , too .
" We have demonstrated two different fuel feedstocks into the same feedtank , " Holmgren says .
" We 're going to use a lot of different feedstocks so if you had to use a different fuel tank for each fuel that would be a big problem . "
Already , the first alternative fuel for jets has been certified for use worldwide by the American Society for Testing and Materials International ( ASTM ) — coal turned to liquid jet fuel by South Africa 's SASOL .
And the jet biofuel made by the UOP process has the exact same chemistry ; the flights are designed to gather enough data so that the jet biofuel can undergo certification as soon as the end of 2010 , according to Richard Altman , executive director of the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative .
By 2017 , the Air Transport Association , a Washington , D.C. - based industry group , hopes to source 10 percent of all aviation fuel from such sustainable plant sources , both to ease the volatility of fuel prices and to cut the emissions of climate - change causing greenhouse gases from aviation .
Boeing hopes to help such biofuels become a " significant part of the commercial fuel supply by 2015 , " Glover says .
" Three years ago , we started out saying this does n't look like it 's possible .
But every day we become more and more convinced it 's not only possible , it has huge benefits for industry and the public . "
Mr Randle told WAtoday.com .au he was forced to go to the tribunal when a US lawyer , with her three - year - old daughter in tow , was looking to holiday in WA a couple of years ago .
Believing she would be refused accommodation at so - called adult retreats , she took 14 of them to the Equal Opportunity Commission .
Mr Randle claims she also asked him for three nights free accommodation during the high season , to which he told her to " bugger off " .
Evidence tendered to the SAT says the woman was upset Chimes advertised on the internet as " adults - only " and " it does not appear ( the woman ) actually wanted to stay at Chimes Spa Retreat " .
The matter then went to mediation and Chimes applied for an exemption to the Act so it could advertise as " adults - only " .
Mr Randle - who said he advertised Chimes as adults - only to also adhere to advertising standards - argued that the retreat was unsuitable for children and tried to use the Occupational Health and Safety provisions of the Act to argue his case , saying the retreat , with high balconies and a large pond , among other things , was unsafe for children .
But he was knocked back by the SAT recently , with senior member Jill Toohey ruling that she could not accept Mr Randle and wife Michelle " should be allowed to determine their market and act accordingly " .
" Anti-discrimination legislation is by its nature restrictive , " she ruled .
" It would render much of the Act ineffective if a person could establish or operate a business inconsistent with the objects of the Act and then obtain an exemption on the basis of their commercial interests alone . "
Just for a laugh I tried to join a kids gym after this , but I was told I was too old .
The ruling was welcomed by Equal Opportunity Commissioner Yvonne Henderson , who said the " growing proliferation of adults - only venues was of concern to parents with children wishing to access these facilities " .
But it has infuriated and puzzled Mr Randle , who said it was " positive discrimination " .
" We tried to get the tribunal to recognise we cater for a segment of the hospitality market .
We cater for that demand , " he said .
" We tried to get them to recognise that there 's this ( adults - only ) sector out there .
I mean , most of the people who stay with us have kids .
" Parenting is stressful .
They need a break from it .
If we were a bungy jumping company or something , ( the SAT ) would be quite happy to give us that exemption , so why can't they just accept this .
" Quite honestly , the law has good intent , but it 's there to protect against negative discrimination .
What we 're doing is positive discrimination but they 've dragged it out to ridiculous politically correct lengths . "
In her ruling , Ms Toohey said Chimes ' desire to cater for adults only was " understandable " .
" They are clearly not alone .
A quick search of the internet shows numerous places advertising themselves for adults - only and it is reasonable to infer that they also decline to accept children .
" However ... it is not the role of the ( Equal Opportunity ) Commissioner or the Tribunal to monitor compliance with the Act or to prosecute apparent breaches . "
Mr Randle said he wanted tourism authorities to take up the fight : " They 're government bodies and they should go to the people who write these laws and get them changed " .
" Just for a laugh I tried to join a kids gym after this , but I was told I was too old .
Then I tried the Boy Scouts .
Then I tried the CWA .
I did n't get anywhere .
What can I say .
That 's the law . "
Ms Henderson said advertisers needed to beware breaching the Act by publishing advertisements contrary to it .
Loading Chimes , where " the best room in the house " is available for $ 390 a night , is also for sale , with an asking price of $ 3.8 million .
Have you met Gators Girl yet ?
She was featured prominently in our Florida Gator Girls Gallery , however not prominently enough for my tastes .
Let me tell you a bit about her .
Her name is Heidi , she likes Tim Tebow , she ’ll be rooting for the Florida Gators tomorrow , and these are her pictures .
Yep , that is about all I know .
Enough for yah ?
If you want to buy some of these photos , I believe she sells them on flickr , but I do n’t really know how that crap works .
Probably not the low resolution garbage you see here , but some nice big photos that you could hang on your wall , or above your bed .
She has tons more photos on her Flickr account , so go give the girl some money , and hopefully she ’ll keep making photos .
Sabrina :
Why are you vixens doubting yourselves ?
Do you not understand that you still have true beauty inside you ?

LOS ANGELES -- Calling it a " great day in Los Angeles , " former President Bill Clinton joined Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa on Monday in unveiling what is billed as the largest effort by a U.S. city to reduce pollution by retrofitting incandescent street lights with more efficient LEDs or light emitting diodes .
Over a five - year period starting in July , the city will retrofit 140,000 of its residential street lights with LEDs , officials said during City Hall news conference .
The project is expected to reduce carbon emissions by 40,500 tons and save $ 10 million annually .
" This is the best place in the world -- in the U.S. at least -- to lead this , " Clinton said , citing the city 's ongoing environmental efforts .
" This is like taking 6,000 cars off the road .
" If every major city followed your lead , we could eliminate 2 1/2 coal - fired power plants . "
Villaraigosa hailed the effort , saying it would help make Los Angeles the " cleanest , greenest big city in the U.S .
We are building a bridge to a sustainable future . "
As the two men spoke , they were flanked by video displays showing workers installing the LEDs as part of a pilot project in the San Fernando Valley .
Nearby charts illustrated how the city 's energy usage would fall from 197 million kilowatt - hours to 132 million kilowatt - hours over the next 10 years .
Clinton said money from the $ 787 billion federal stimulus package President Obama plans to sign Tuesday includes funds for environmental efforts similar to the Los Angeles street light program .
" If we help you to live green , " Clinton said , there could be a time when " every major city could be without a landfill . "
The ex-president began the Clinton Climate Initiative in August 2006 to help fight global warming .
It is a partnership with the C40 Large Cities Climate Leadership Group , an association of large cities worldwide , including Los Angeles , that have pledged to accelerate their effort to reduce greenhouse emissions .
" The solution to the climate crisis is n't far off in the future -- it's in the buildings we inhabit , our civic infrastructure and the way we organize our lives , " Clinton said at the 2007 Greenbuild International Conference in Chicago .
Clinton 's visit to Los Angeles comes a day after the C - SPAN 2009 Historians Presidential Leadership Survey ranked him 15th among the 42 men who have served as president , up six spots from a year ago .
Clinton was ranked third in economic management and fourth in pursing equal justice for all , but 37th in moral authority .
Poland now looks set to become the latest shoe to drop in the ongoing crisis which is steadily extending its reach from one country top another , right across the whole of Central and Eastern Europe – the latest and possibly the last in the sense that if Poland does role belly side up this will probably be the one which finally does turn the apple cart well and truly over .
Italy ’s UniCredit , the biggest lender in emerging Europe , said on Wednesday there was a clear risk of the global credit crunch gripping the region and it was up to international banks to help to avert it .
UniCredit board member Erich Hampel said in a presentation at the Euromoney conference in Vienna that the bank was committed to fund its subsidiaries in those countries and would continue to lend to consumers and companies .
It called on other banks active in the region , the European Union , the International Monetary Fund , other institutions and the countries concerned to launch a joint plan to stem the threat that funds could stop flowing and choke economic growth .
“ The international financial crisis is questioning future developments and the risk of a credit crunch is clear , ” said Hampel , who steers most of UniCredit ’s emerging European units as head of its Bank Austria arm .
“ A number of interested parties are involved and the support to the region should come from all of them together , ” Hampel said .
“ Coordination is essential and a ‘ Plan for CEE ’ should be designed . ”
Eastern Europe is – as Unicredit ’s Eric Hempel argues in the extended quote above – quite simply falling headlong into a very severe credit crunch , as funding for bank lending steadily dries up .
And , unfortunately , as the evidence mounts that Poland is caught in the teeth of this crunch , its real economy falls deeper and deeper into the dreaded pit with each passing day .
FT Alphaville ’s Izabella Kaminska has the forex loan story here ( see also see here last Friday ) .
Basically all I have to add are some charts ( and some real economy analysis ) to add a bit more weight to the point and illustrate more explicitly the speed with which things are now moving forward .
How Important Are Forex Loans In Poland ?
Polandâ€™s exposure as to foreign - currency lending has already been extensively documented and analysed on this blog , but just in case there is still anyone out there who holds defiantly onto the view that the extent of such lending in Poland is simply too small and too recent to have any sort of severe impact on the economy , let ’s take a look at the recent progress in such lending , at least as far as household behaviour goes .
As can be seen in the first chart below , since the middle of 2007 , the rate of growth in zloty loans has slumped steadily , while forex borrowing has gone up and up , until ….. until last November , when the whole thing turned .
It now pretty clear that something quite important happened to the Polish banking system back in October – as I attempted to analyse in this post which was written at the time .
The extent of the transition can also be seen from the monthly chart for outstanding household loans , where again zloty loans can be seen to have have virtually stagnated , while forex ones went shooting up and up , till they seem to have hit a something akin to a “ dead stop ” .
Nor does the loan “ revaluation ” argument help us here , since during the period under consideration the zloty has been falling ( see chart below ) and hence the book value of the capital stock of forex loans should rise , not fall .
( I mean , unfortunately , and from a large number of comments I have received on my blogs over the last 18 months , I have to say that this is the part of the story that many of those who have taken out unhedged forex loans in Eastern Europe simply do not “ get ” , it is n’t so much the payment stream you need to look at ( influenced by the relative interest rates in the two currencies being compared ) but at what happens to the capital value – that is what happens to the outstanding sum you owe , as measured in your own local currency , or at least in the currency in which you are paid .
And for those who are interested in how domestic monetary policy works these days ( ie how effective central bank interest rate policy is at containing lending in a small or medium sized open economy with access to global finance ) it should not come as a surprise to find in the chart below that the uptick in enthusiasm for forex loans really started to gain momentum after the Polish central bank started to raise interest rates , as the short term interest rate differential with Swiss Franc loans simply grew and grew under the impact of monetary tightening .
Systematic Slowdown
In Industrial Activity
This application of standard monetary policy by the Polish central bank did have one result , however , and that was that the value of the zloty shot up ( in particular here when compared with the euro , which is what really matters for exports ) , and with it the relative cost of Polish industrial products .
And what did this lead to ?
Well , a steady deterioration in the trade deficit for one thing .
And , of course , an ongoing contraction in industrial output for another .
Poland ’s industrial output continued to fall in December , with statistics office data showing today ( Tuesday ) that output fell 4.4 percent year - on - year , after dropping 9.2 percent in November .
In month - on - month terms , industrial output also fell 3.7 percent , ( following a whopping 15.4 % drop in November over October ) while seasonally adjusted output fell 7.4 percent year - on - year , showing business conditions are quickly deteriorating .
Wage and employment data for December on Monday also suggested companies , in response to falling demand for their products , were starting to lay people off .
The pace of wage growth in December was the lowest since 2006 .
Business confidence in Poland ’s industrial sector fell in December to its lowest level since surveys began in June 1998 as plummeting new orders depressed output and employment , according to the latest 300 industrial company survey prepared by Markit Economics for ABN AMRO .
The survey also found that the Polish manufacturing purchasing managers index dropped for the seventh consecutive month – to 38.8 from 40.5 in November .
The new business indicators dropped at the fastest rate in survey history , and the new orders index fell to 32.2 in December from 35.6 in November , with new export orders decreasing to 31.4 from 40.1 .
So we can obviously expect the January result to be even worse .
Previously , as can be see in this chart for the EU Economic Sentiment index , Poland had been faring rather better than some of its Central European neighbours ( like Hungary and the Czech Republic ) .
But the downward movement is now evident and pronounced .
This slowdown in industrial output has also been accompanied by a levelling off in construction activity , which has been trending down in year on year terms since the late summer , but which even fell back month on month in November ( by 1 % over October ) for the first time in many months .
In fact if we look at the actual index , rather than the year on year growth numbers , we will see that activity levels have been pretty stagnant for six months or so now .
After the sub - prime crisis banks became more restrictive in their lending policies .
It is hard for real estate companies to get loans for their projects .
Developers have to delay significant part of their pipeline projects , in most cases till an unspecified date in the future .
The significantly tightened lending policies for households will worsen already weak demand for housing .
Additionally , the already anemic investment activity should deteriorate further .
It should be more and more difficult for real estate developers to sell their projects in the market and this source of money is also drying up .

Retail sales levels have also flattened out recently , although they have continued to rise slightly in recent months .
November 2008 retail sales grewth by just 2.7 % year on year confirmed a fast slowdown in domestic consumption following 7.9 % growth in October and 11.6 % growth in September .
While the Penkon consumer confidence indicator is now showing its lowest readings since 2005 .
It is most likely that the good times for the retail industry are over .
The drivers that fuelled sales and margins of Polish retail companies â€ “ rising consumer vdemand and strong Zloty , have disappeared and we do not expect them to return within foreseeable future .

The Credit Noose Tightens
The core of the East Europe problem is that savings in many parts of the region are not sufficient to underpin growing loan books , thus the banks in the region – which are largely foreign owned – have needed to draw on their parent companies to bolster their balance sheets .
When many of the parent banks entered into their own refinancing problems last year as the global financial crisis spiralled out of control , this channel of funding was transformed from being a source of strength into being a source of weakness .
In addition , at the start of last summer the Polish currency soared to record highs against the euro , and many Polish companies took out hedging contracts , effectively betting on further zloty appreciation .
Now , as the currency has weakened and weakened , many of these very same companies have found themselves with substantial losses .
The Polish financial watchdog estimated last month that local banks may need to take out as much as $ 284 million in provisions to cover for client losses on currency options , which currently amount to 155 million zlotys ( $ 49.33 million ) among Warsaw - listed companies .
And that figure could obviously grow if the zloty continues to weaken .
The zloty is currently at its lowest level since the end of 2004 – around 4.306 to the euro .
Furthermore , it seems the governmentâ€™s promise of accelerating the process of euro- adoption – which helped calm the zlotyâ€™s decline back in October – is failing to reassure markets .
In fact most analysts seem to think that at this point having a 2012 entry target is as good ashaving no target at all .
Euro / PLN Cross – Please Click On Image For Better Viewing
Izabella Kaminska quotes the view of RBC capital , who basically argue that there is no way that the assigned date was ever going to be achievable :
On top of all this , there is no guarantee that Poland will meet the five Maastricht convergence criteria .
Holding the PLN stable within the ERM2 bands for two years may prove to be a tall order while the budget deficit , which has been squeezed lower purely as a result of recent strong economic growth , will widen sharply as the economy slows , breeching ( SIC ) the 3%/ GDP limit and disqualifying Poland from Euro entry .
As Izabella says there is a sort of catch - 22 at work here : the only way Polish zloty can be saved from further weakening is Eurozone membership , but Eurozone membership becomes ever more distant as the zloty weakens due to the Maastricht criteria .
Yet if we look at what has been happening to competitiveness in Poland in recent years ( see REER comparison chart with Germany below ) , it is clear that due to the combined effect of wage inflation and a rising currency , there is some correction still to be made ( not comparable with the Baltics or Hungary , but still ) if Poland is recover its lost export prowess .
And here ’s another chart from Citi Poland showing how unit labour costs have steadily risen , and productivity has steadily fallen .
The critical crossover point seems to have been somewhere towards the start of 2007 .
This pattern has been repeated in one CEE country after another , and really lies at the heart of the current economic crisis in the region .
In an attempt to boost liquidity in short - term Swiss franc money markets the National Bank of Poland has set up a currency swap agreement with its Swiss counterpart and the European Central Bank .
The agreement will now last until at least the end of April .
But while this agreement is obviously providing some relief it is clearly far from solving the problem .
â€ œToday , the SNB , the ECB and the NBP are jointly announcing that they will continue these one - week euro / Swiss franc foreign - exchange swap operations at least until the end of April to support further improvements in the short - term Swiss france money markets , â€ according to the Polish central bank statement earlier this week .
UniCredit Under Threat ?
At the heart of the forex lending ( and exposure ) in the East lie a small number of major banks whose head offices are to be found in large cities in the core countries of the EU ( Western ) old guard .
Among these , indeed in pride of place here , comes Italy ’s Unicredit .
( See my longer post on Unicredit here ) .
Now it is true to say that Unicredit ’s Polish subsidiary – Bank Pekao – is relatively immune to the forex lending problem , since it refused to offer mortgages in foreign currencies , and its loan - to - deposit ratio at about 90 percent ( compared with an average of about 110 percent for Polish banks generally ) is fairly healthy .
These features and a capital adequacy ratio of around 11 percent should offer Pekao a reasonable buffer going into the slowdown , but this is not the same thing as an absence of risk , since any serious deterioration in operating conditions inside Poland will affect PLN loan default rates as well as Fx ones , although evidently the banks with fx loan exposure are much worse positioned .
Concern about the position of the entire Unicredit group has been mounting steadily of late , as witness be the latest research report from Moodyâ€™s Market Implied Ratings group , which highlighting nagging doubts many observers have over the degree of the bankâ€™s exposure to Central and Eastern Europe .
The note , written by analyst Lisa Hintz , suggests UniCreditâ€™s CDS - implied rating of A1 may well be â€œan overly optimistic signal of the bankâ€™s level of credit riskâ€ .
UniCredit largely avoided the proprietary trading and structured product problems suffered by the other large European banks .
However , the financial problems arising from the economic downturn , such as imbalances , could cause deterioration in UniCreditâ€™s loan portfolio , and we do not believe this is reflected in the trading levels of its credit default swaps .
UniCreditâ€™s CDS - implied rating is A1 , down three notches from a recent high of Aa1 and one notch below its senior unsecured rating of Aa3 .
We still see this as an overly optimistic signal of the bankâ€™s level of credit risk , in that it doesnâ€™t capture UniCreditâ€™s comparatively thin level of capitalization and heavy exposure to Central and Eastern Europe .
This exposure came after a rapid expansion which has left the bank with an unseasoned loan portfolio .
Loans to Central and Eastern European clients made up 13 % of UniCreditâ€™s assets at the end of 2007 .
These made up an even greater portion of its revenueâ € ” 21 % in the third quarter , and at the top of the list in both cases – see charts below – comes Poland .
Fortunately no one is suggesting that the level of loan defaults might be anything like the 60 % anticipated in Ukraine ( or Russia ? ? , both of which fortunately make up a much smaller part of their portfolio ) .
This CEE activity means UniCredit leads its rivals Austria ’s Erste Group Bank and Raiffeisen International , France ’s Societe Generale , Belgium ’s KBC and Hungary ’s OTP in terms of both emerging European assets and exposure .
Indeed , UniCredit fell again in Milan today , after the Italian central bank warned yesterday that bank lending is declining and interbank liquidity is insufficient .
UniCredit dropped as much 6.5 percent to 1.26 euros , the lowest intraday price since May 13 , 1997 , and traded at 1.29 euros as of 9:55 a.m. local time .
UniCredit shares have now fallen 77 percent since January 2008 .
The Bank of Italy said yesterday there has been a â€œsignificant deteriorationâ€ in the general economic scenario and that â€œlending growth continues to decelerateâ€ because of the high cost of funding for banks .
â€
œThe situation just seems to keep spiraling in a negative way and if confidence in and among banks doesnâ€™t return thereâ€™s no easy way out , â€ said Giulio Baresani Varini , head of investments at Banca MB SpA in Milan .
Meanwhile UniCredit Bank Austria AG , Austriaâ€™s biggest bank , plans to decide whether it will ask for Austrian state aid as part of the national bank bailout programme by the end of March .
â€ œWe plan to make a decision by the end of the first quarter , â€ Chief Executive Officer Erich Hampel told journalists in Vienna today .
Hampel said in December that Unicredit Bank Austria would need â€œabout 2 billion eurosâ€ to increase its
Tier 1 ratio , a measure of financial strength , to 9 percent from 7.6 percent at the end of Sept. 30 .
But of course it is n’t only Unicredit and its subsidiaries who are affected .
BRE Bank SA fell to a three - month low on the Warsaw stock exchange this morning , leading Polish banks lower , as loan provisions and losses on derivatives cut into fourth - quarter earnings .
The bank – which is a subsidiary of Commerzbank AG – slumped as much as 16.3 zloty , or 10 percent , to hit 146.9 zloty before recovering to 147 zloty at 10:32 a.m. in Warsaw , the lowest level since Oct. 27 .
The benchmark WIG20 Index was down 3.2 percent and has fallen 8 percent so far this year .
The index slumped 48 percent last year , posting its biggest annual decline since its creation in 1994 .
Despite 2008 being the worst year in a relatively short history of Polish equity market , with WIG20 down 48 % we are not looking for a turnaround in 2009 .
The performance of the Polish market should still be strongly influenced by global markets which are likely to take some time to recover given the scale of a global macro slowdown not seen since 1945 .
The illness appears to be very serious and you simply need time to properly recover .
We expect the WIG20 index to be down this year by some - 10 % to - 15 % ( driven largely by expected weak performance of the banking sector ) .
Polish Equity Market Monitor – Citi Poland – January 2009
So Just What Are The Chances Of A Polish GDP Contraction In 2009 ?
Well the chances of a contraction of some order in Poland in 2009 are non negligible in my opinion .
We are evidently not talking here of something of the order of the Baltics , Romania and Ukraine , or even of the order of Hungary , but still the extent of the slowdown in Poland ( or the Czech Republic ) should not be underestimated .
Average corporate wages rose at their slowest pace in since November 2006 last month , suggesting economic growth is slowing more sharply in the wake of the global financial crisis than many seem to think .
The latest central bank forecast suggested that Polandâ€™s economic growth will slow to 3.7 percent this year from about 5 percent in 2008 , but this is very optimistic , and far from everyone agrees .
Citi Poland come in with a much lower forecast , and in my opinion a much more reasonable one .
The Polish economy is not immune from global disruptions and an incoming and unavoidable slowdown is already visible .
The question is when we will see the recovery .
The answer is not easy as so far we have not yet seen the weak GDP numbers which are just around the corner .
Looking back at the most recent slowdown during 2000 - 2003 period we observed 10 consecutive quarters GDP numbers below 2.5 % and within that 5 sequential quarters when GDP growth came below 1 % .
However , this time the most recent 3Q08 GDP number came in at 4.8 % so we see a lot of bad macro news ahead of us .
In 2009 we expect GDP growth slowing to 1.4 % , driven predominately by deterioration in investment growth as banks started to be very restrictive in lending while corporates are looking for savings and are rather rapidly scaling down investment programs .

I would go somewhat further .
I think it is perfectly possible to see a recession in Poland at some point in 2009 , not necessarily a strong one , but a recession just the same .

Slight changes in climate may trigger major abrupt ecosystem responses that are not easily reversible .
Some of these responses , including insect outbreaks , wildfire , and forest dieback , may adversely affect people as well as ecosystems and their plants and animals .
The U.S. Geological Survey led a new assessment of the implications of a warming world on " ecological thresholds " in North America .
The report , which was commissioned by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program and authored by a team of federal and academic climate scientists , is based on a synthesis of published scientific literature and addresses what research and steps are needed to help mitigate resulting effects .
An ecological threshold is the point at which there is an abrupt change in an ecosystem that produces large , persistent and potentially irreversible changes .
" One of our biggest concerns is that once an ecological threshold is crossed , the ecosystem in question will most likely not return to its previous state , " said USGS Associate Director for Biology Susan Haseltine .
" The existence of thresholds should be a key concern of scientists and natural resource managers . "
The team also emphasized that human actions may increase an ecosystem 's potential for crossing ecological thresholds .
For example , additional human use of water in a watershed experiencing drought could trigger basic changes in aquatic life that may not be reversible .
Researchers and decision makers need to develop the tools necessary to predict the effects of specific ecological disturbances and to understand early warning signals of impending ecological thresholds .
The report also concludes that although not enough is known about ecological thresholds , researchers do already know that ecosystems will differ significantly in their respective thresholds .
More vulnerable ecosystems , such as those that already face stressors other than climate change , will almost certainly reach their threshold for abrupt change sooner .
The Environmental Protection Agency , U.S. Forest Service , Department of Energy , National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , and National Science Foundation contributed to this report .

Fraudsters are using Google 's Calendar service as a means to develop a new strain of phishing scam .
The ruse appears in the guise of a Google Calendar email notification .
Would - be marks are told their accounts will be deleted unless they submit their Google username , password and date of birth .
But rather than coming from Google 's “ Customer Varifaction ” ( sic ) department the bogus emails come from fraudsters looking to extract login information .
Phishing fraudsters set up a Gmail accounts in order to set up the scam , which is slightly more credible than many because unwary punters are invited to submit information to Google 's website .
In addition , Google inserts the real name of the recipient in email invitations , further boosting their credibility of the fraudulent approach .
On the other hand the fact that scam emails appear to come from an address in the form customerserviceXXXX@gmail.com ( where XXXX is a four digit number ) exposes the dodgy provenance of the emails .
The tactic first appeared in the summer before reappearing again last week .
A full write - up of the scam - including copies of the fraudulent emails - can be found in a blog entry by Graham Cluley of Sophos here . ®

Debt Drought Kills Consumerism
Venturing out each day into this land of strip malls , freeways , office parks , and McHousing pods , one can’t help but be impressed at how America looks the same as it did a few years ago , while seemingly overnight we have become another country .
All the old mechanisms that enabled our way of life are broken , especially endless revolving credit , at every level , from household to business to the banks to the US Treasury .
Peak energy has combined with the diminishing returns of over - investments in complexity to pull the “ kill switch ” on our vaunted “ way of life ” — the set of arrangements that we wo n’t apologize for or negotiate .
So , the big question before the nation is : do we try to re-start the whole smoking , creaking hopeless , futureless machine ?
Or do we start behaving differently ?
The attempted re-start of revolving debt consumerism is an exercise in futility .
We ’ve reached the limit of being able to create additional debt at any level without causing further damage , additional distortions , and new perversities of economy ( and of society , too ) .
We ca n’t raise credit card ceilings for people with no ability make monthly payments .
We ca n’t promote more mortgages for people with no income .
We ca n’t crank up a home - building industry with our massive inventory of unsold , and over - priced houses built in the wrong places .
We ca n’t ramp back up the blue light special shopping fiesta .
We ca n’t return to the heyday of Happy Motoring , no matter how many bridges we fix or how many additional ring highways we build around our already - overblown and over - sprawled metroplexes .
Mostly , we ca n’t return to the now - complete “ growth ” cycle of “ economic expansion . ”
We ’re done with all that .
History is done with our doing that , for now .
So far — after two weeks in office — the Obama team seems bent on a campaign to sustain the unsustainable at all costs , to attempt to do all the impossible things listed above .
Mr. Obama is not the only one , of course , who is invoking the quest for renewed “ growth . ”
This is a tragic error in collective thinking .
What we really face is a comprehensive contraction in our activities , especially the scale of our activities , and the pressing need to readjust the systems of everyday life to a level of decreased complexity .
For instance , the myth that we can become “ energy independent ” and yet remain car - dependent is absurd .
In terms of liquid fuels , we ’re simply trapped .
We import two - thirds of the oil we use and there is absolutely no chance that drill - drill - drilling ( or any other scheme ) will change that .
The public and our leaders cannot face the reality of this .
The great wish for “ alternative ” liquid fuels ( bio fuels , algae excreta ) will never be anything more than a wish at the scales required , and the parallel wish to keep all our cars running by other means — hydrogen fuel cells , electric motors — is equally idle and foolish .
We cannot face the mandate of reality , which is to do everything possible to make our living places walkable , and connect them with public transit .
The stimulus bills in congress clearly illustrate our failure to understand the situation .
The attempt to restart “ consumerism ” will be equally disappointing .
It was a manifestation of the short peak energy decades of history , and now that we ’re past peak energy , it ’s over .
That seventy percent of the economy is over , especially the part that allowed people to buy stuff with no money .
From now on people will have to buy stuff with money they earn and save , and they will be buying a lot less stuff .
For a while , a lot of stuff will circulate through the yard sales and Craigslist , and some resourceful people will get busy fixing broken stuff that still has value .
But the other infrastructure of shopping is toast , especially the malls , the strip malls , the real estate investment trusts that own it all , many of the banks that lent money to the REITs , the chain - stores and chain eateries , of course , and , alas , the non-chain mom-and - pop boutiques in these highway - oriented venues .
Washington is evidently seized by panic right now .
I do n’t know anyone who works in the White House , but I must suppose that they have learned in two weeks that these systems are absolutely tanking , that the previous way of life that everybody was so set on not apologizing for has reached the end of the line .
We seem to be learning a new and interesting lesson : that even a team that promises change is actually petrified of too much change , especially change that they can’t really control .
The argument about “ change ” during the election was sufficiently vague that no one was really challenged to articulate a future that was n’t , materially , more - of - the - same .
I suppose the Obama team may have thought they would only administer it differently than the Bush team — but basically life in the USA would continue being about all those trips to the mall , and the cubicle jobs to support that , and the family safaris to visit Grandma in Lansing , and the vacations at Sea World , and Skipper ’s $ 20,000 college loan , and Dad ’s yearly junket to Las Vegas , and refinancing the house , and rolling over this loan and that loan … and that has all led to a very dead end in a dark place .
If this nation wants to survive without an intense political convulsion , there ’s a lot we can do , but none of it is being voiced in any corner of Washington at this time .
We have to get off of petro-agriculture and grow our food locally , at a smaller scale , with more people working on it and fewer machines .
This is an enormous project , which implies change in everything from property allocation to farming methods to new social relations .
But if we do n’t focus on it right away , a lot of Americans will end up starving , and rather soon .
We have to rebuild the railroad system in the US , and electrify it , and make it every bit as good as the system we once had that was the envy of the world .
If we do n’t get started on this right away , we ’re screwed .
We will have tremendous trouble moving people and goods around this continent - sized nation .
We have to reactivate our small towns and cities because the metroplexes are going to fail at their current scale of operation .
We have to prepare for manufacturing at a much smaller ( and local ) scale than the scale represented by General Motors .
The political theater of the moment in Washington is not focused on any of this , but on the illusion that we can find new ways of keeping the old ways going .
Many observers have noted lately how passive the American public is in the face of their dreadful accelerating losses .
It ’s a tragic mistake to tell them that they can have it all back again .
We ’ll see a striking illustration of “ phase change ” as the public mood goes from cow - like incomprehension to grizzly bear - like rage .
Not only will they discover the impossibility of getting back to where they were , but they will see the panicked actions of Washington drive what remains of our capital resources down a rat hole .
A consensus is firming up on each side of the “ stimulus ” question , largely along party lines — simply those who are for it and those who are against it , mostly by degrees .
Nobody in either party — including supposed independents such as Bernie Sanders or John McCain , not to mention President Obama — has a position for directing public resources and effort at any of the things I mentioned above : future food security , future travel - and - transport security , or the future security of livable , walkable dwelling places based on local networks of economic interdependency .
This striking poverty of imagination may lead to change that will tear the nation to pieces .

Reid to Meet With Burris as Showdown Looms Majority leader seeks to head off Blago appointee 's attempt to take Senate seat .
Jan. 3 , 2008 -- Arrangements are under way for a Wednesday meeting between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , and Roland Burris , the Democrat tapped by Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich to succeed President - elect Barack Obama in the U.S. Senate , ABC News has learned .
Burris confidant and business partner Fred Lebed of Chicago tells ABC News that , despite the opposition of Senate leaders , Burris is on track to arrive in Washington Monday , and on Capitol Hill , Tuesday .
" He intends to be sworn in and seated in the U.S. Senate , " said Lebed , who added that Burris and his " staff " are " looking forward to get sworn in , seated , and to roll up our sleeves . "
When Burris arrives at the doors of the U.S. Senate next week , says Lebed , " he will have a few close friends and supporters with him .
he is very careful and has cautioned me to make sure this is not a spectacle . "
The Senate sergeant at arms , Chief Terry Gainer , expressed confidence that a confrontation on the Hill can be avoided , according to a Democratic Senate aide .
The aide said the Senate majority whip , Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois , is working behind the scenes to set up the meeting between Burris and Reid .
Reid released a Dec. 30 statement saying that Burris would not be seated .
" It is truly regrettable that despite requests from all 50 Democratic Senators and public officials throughout Illinois , Gov. Blagojevich would take the imprudent step of appointing someone to the United States Senate who would serve under a shadow and be plagued by questions of impropriety , " the statement said .
" We say this without prejudice toward Roland Burris ' ability , and we respect his years of public service .
But this is not about Mr. Burris ; it is about the integrity of a governor accused of attempting to sell this United States Senate seat .
Under these circumstances , anyone appointed by Gov. Blagojevich cannot be an effective representative of the people of Illinois and , as we have said , will not be seated by the Democratic Caucus . "
Blagojevich was arrested Dec. 9 on conspiracy charges connected to his alleged solicitation of political favors or campaign contributions in exchange for the Senate appointment .
Shortly after his arrest the governor convened a press conference denying culpability and vowing not to give up his post .
Senate Democratic leaders promise to use procedural obstacles to prevent Burris from taking the seat .
They believe that corruption charges against Blagojevich nullify the Burris appointment .
And they assert that they are exercising their rights under the Constitution , Article 1 , Section 5 , which states : " Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections , Returns and Qualifications of its own Members . "
" There is no precedent to allow [ Burris ] on the floor " without credentials , the aide said .
A report in the Chicago Sun-Times Saturday indicated that Reid had been closely involved in the appointment process before Blagojevich 's indictment .
The majority leader reportedly asked Blagojevich not to appoint Illinois Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. to the seat over concerns about Jackson 's political viability and whether he would lose to a Republican challenger in a future election .
This is a remarkable book .
Epidemiologist Leigh A. Henderson , as a consultant to the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) and NIDA Project Officer William J. Glass started with the government ’s own survey data , worked with the authors of a new , individual and community - level ethnographic study , analyzed and interpreted these half - dozen data sets very conservatively , and ended up concluding that LSD is relatively safe and the laws far too severe .
Some would say that these conclusions are still too conservative .
Perhaps that ’s the point :
Even a conservative reading of government data will not support today ’s absolutist attitudes and draconian laws .
The authors Henderson and Glass seem somewhat embarrassed by their conclusions .
After all , the government looks at the same National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) and NIDA data and concludes that LSD is very dangerous and severe laws are justified .
Henderson and Glass , employed by or closely associated with NIDA and near the peaks of their careers , have nonetheless directly contradicted NIDA policy .
In choosing to publish anyway ( even without any direct references to the authors ’ NIDA employment on the dust jacket or promotional literature – only in later conversations with this reviewer was the NIDA connection mentioned ) they have chosen bravery over fear , and facts over shouts in a courageous contribution to rational , data - based policy making .
The book is really Henderson ’s baby ; she is the author of four of its seven chapters and co-author of the Introduction and the “ Summary and Implications ” chapter .
“ I started out not knowing anything about LSD , except its public reputation , ” she said in our recent telephone conversation .
“ As my research proceeded , I became fascinated by the facts .
It ’s clear that policy on LSD is out of line with the data . ”
Henderson shares authorship with Glass and law enforcement and health researchers , yet the book retains a strong unity of theme : triangulating in on the truth about LSD use .
The result is a methodologically innovative integration of quantitative and qualitative data – of emergency room admission statistics and a profile of a twenty - something LSD ring leader ; of “ national lifetime usage ” data and quotes from interviews with experienced adolescents and hand - wringing parents .
The case studies
In Chapter 1 , “ What is a Trip – and Why Take One ? ” anthropologists James MacDonald and Michael Agar describe data they gathered through in - depth , ethnographic interviews with six adolescent LSD users and their parents in a community that had recently uncovered a major LSD distribution ring .
( It ’s a shame that MacDonald and Agar ’s excellent chapter does not include the authors ’ biographies or institutional affiliations . )
Parental attitudes of concern contrast strikingly with the teens ’ knowing discussions of their good and bad experiences with LSD .
Even though these interviews ring true , they are still a biased sample – all of the kids interviewed were enrolled in a drug rehabilitation program ; all claimed that frequent ingestion can lead to social and personal disintegration .
The history of LSD
In Chapter 2 , “ About LSD , ” Henderson provides an excellent , data - based , and quite favorable review of the history , pharmacology , and clinical and therapeutic research , concluding with a factual review of the manufacturing and marketing of LSD .
It is refreshing that Henderson allocates only three sentences to “ the ‘ 60s ; ” rather , her focus is on safety , efficacy , and policy .
Henderson continues her review in Chapter 3 , at this point focusing on the literature on “ Adverse Reactions to LSD . ”
She finds them real , but rare and spends 20 pages adroitly separating myth from fact .
Analyzing the government ’s data
In Chapter 4 , “ LSD Use and LSD Users : Questions and Answers About LSD , ” Henderson analyzes the wide panoply of government survey data .
Unfortunately , these data are generally derived from the tragic negative consequences of drug abuse – emergency room admissions or arrest statistics and the like – or are biased by the requirement to self - report illegal behavior , which is much more likely among those in treatment than “ successful ” users .
Even by these biased standards , LSD emerges here as a remarkably safe “ drug of abuse ” that in no way can be called “ epidemic . ”
A middle class drug ring
In a fascinating inside account of a middle - class drug distribution ring , clinical psychologist and forensic examiner Cynthia Favret ’s “ An LSD Distribution Network ” ( Chapter 5 ) takes us back to the community discussed in Chapter 1 , this time , through interviews with an undercover narcotics investigator familiar with the exposed network and its 22 - year old head .
In addition to a very close rendering of the mind set of its protagonist , this chapter provides poignant quotes from friends and family that drive home the brutal reality of the government ’s legal position on LSD .
Favret ’s treatment is especially effective coming after the relatively benign picture that emerges from Henderson ’s chapters on the research and usage data .
Detection and the law
Chapter 6 , “ Legal Issues , ” discusses detection , possession , and distribution issues in light of the debate over mandatory sentencing for drug offenders .
Henderson discusses developments in detection technology since the 1970s , when inaccurate and expensive fluorescent spectroscopy and high - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) detection tests were developed , and describes inexpensive and effective radioimmunoassay ( RIA ) tests that have recently become commercially available .
Henderson also lists and discusses the wide range of federal and state ( all 50 are listed ) penalties for possession and sale of LSD , and in a devastatingly matter - of - fact way , compares these penalties with those governing similar doses of cocaine or heroin .
The key findings
Chapter 7 , “ Summary and Implications , ” attempts to bring together all of the data sets described in the previous chapters and draw conclusions for policy on LSD for the 1990s .
There is also a spectacular 258 - item reference list containing within it the classic evidence – the bulwark of the logical argument – for the safety of LSD and , perhaps , for its efficacy as a psychiatric tool .
Is the use of LSD increasing ?
What are the major issues with which a logical , fact - based LSD policy should be concerned ?
Marshalling all their logic and data together , Henderson , Glass , and Favret conclude :
LSD use is relatively uncommon in comparison with use of alcohol , marijuana , or cocaine and misuse of prescription drugs .
Long - term trends in LSD use show stability over the last fifteen years in both proportion ( roughly 5 % annually ) and age ( generally , 16 - 23 ) of users .

LSD is primarily used by suburban white males in their late teens and early 20s .
A shift in use from the upper level of this band to the lower level could contribute to the perception that use has increased among young adolescents .

Black market LSD remains generally unadulterated , although manufacturing by - products do appear .
In the 1960s , doses were reported to have ranged from 200 to 1000 micrograms ; in the 1970 ’s , street samples ranged from 30 to 300 mcg ; in the mid-1980s , the average was about 100 to 125 mcg ; in the 1990s it is 20 to 80 mcg .
Lower doses generally mean fewer bad trips .
Why LSD ?
The authors point out the reasons why people like LSD : the perceptual intensity without a clouding of consciousness ; the “ compelling immediacy ; ” the “ intensification of mood and emotions . ”
Others enjoy the group aspect of the drug ; still others view LSD as an “ emotional fitness test . ”
These motivations have n’t changed since the 1960s , according to studies cited by Henderson in Chapter 2 .
Adolescents are also attracted to LSD because it is physically easy to deal with – colorless , odorless , small and easy to conceal , inexpensive , until recently , hard to detect in blood or urine .
LSD is also viewed as semi-natural and users tend to look down on users of “ dangerous ” drugs , such as cocaine and heroin .
Who takes LSD ?
The LSD user differs from the typical opiate user “ in that LSD appeals to individuals who are often socio- economically advantaged , who have the opportunity for higher education and successful careers , yet who choose – at least for a time – not to follow societal norms . ”
The authors associate a number of traits – low self - esteem , rebelliousness , depression , aggressiveness , for example – with the use of LSD , but stress that they precede , rather than result from the use of drugs .
Adolescent users indicated that they used LSD because it was fun and because they were bored .
“ As a drug that tends to promote introspection and to heighten the senses , it has more to offer those in the relatively safe and pleasant surroundings [ of the middle - class ] than those in the more dangerous and unpleasant inner-city environment .
In fact , the suburban youths interviewed seemed to take LSD as a controlled means of losing control .
Riding a roller coaster may be an appropriate analogy ; the ride is safe , but contains enough sense of danger to be thrilling . ”
According to the authors , LSD “ seems to appeal to a limited group of adolescents and an even smaller group of older persons who may still seek to identify with a particular subculture . ”
One major problem with the data used to support Henderson and Glass ’ conclusions is their representativeness – did the sample that responded to the various surveys actually reflect the entire population ?
It is important to note that the divinity graduate student using a low dose to meditate or the quiet , 45 - year old systems analyst using LSD “ to think ” are likely to be significantly underrepresented subsets of the data .
In fact , the authors ’ observation of a “ maturing out ” of LSD use might just as easily been interpreted as a “ shrinking away ” from the rigors of aggressive introspection .
The negatives
According to Henderson , the literature shows that the factors contributing to higher risk of a bad reaction to LSD are “ a preexisting psychiatric disorder , and the use [ of LSD ] in conjunction with other drugs . ”
Under these circumstances “ LSD may precipitate a more prolonged or severe psychotic reaction . ”
While the authors aptly point out that we do not know the precise mechanism of LSD ’s action , they also state outright that the research thus far clearly shows that LSD does not cause “ organic damage , chromosomal damage , cancer , or birth defects .
It is not particularly toxic … ”
The authors conclude that , “ viewed strictly in the context of traditional drug - induced health consequences ( measured in injury and death ) , LSD is less dangerous than most other illegal drugs . ”
Use by adolescents , they point out , “ carries additional risks to psychologic maturation and academic performance much the same as do marijuana and other drugs typically used at this stage of life . ”
( The authors do note that “ among younger students , inhalation of potentially lethal substances such as solvents and butane exceeds LSD use . ” )
That the authors do not build on the data and their own analysis and conclude here that teen use of psychoactive drugs may reflect a non-pathological desire for rites of passage , should not detract from the value of their work in the current cultural context .
One day , such a conclusion may guide government policy , but given the fragility of the support for today ’s renewed research with psychedelics , the authors may have put together just the right book for the times .
“ We wanted to write a boring book about LSD , if that ’s possible , ” said Henderson , “ we wanted to review the evidence , but not necessarily come down on any side of the issue .
The facts speak loudly for themselves . ”
The data sets
Even so , the fact base must be valid to be useful .
Particularly in Chapter 4 , Henderson and colleagues rely on a set of much - debated , yet much - cited government surveys of drug abuse .
While it is beyond the scope of this review , to analyze in detail the validity of each data source used by the authors , we can review the major sources of bias ( most of which are identified by the authors themselves ) in the government data sets that were analyzed .
The National Household Survey of Drug Abuse ( NHSDA ) is a series of surveys designed to measure the use of alcohol , tobacco , and other drugs in the U.S. over time .
Periodically conducted by NIDA since 1974 , the survey was recently turned over to the newly - created Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ( SAMHSA ) .
Lead author Leigh Henderson , provided secondary analysis of these and other data sets under contract to NIDA and , after 1992 , to SAMHSA .
In the NHSDA , information on illicit drug use is collected in the user ’s home and so , despite an elaborate anonymity procedure , respondents may not tell the whole truth .
At home data collection also under - represents the homeless , prison populations , people in nursing homes and treatment facilities , and the military , groups that might raise the statistics on use .
As the book points out , with drugs that are less frequently used , such as LSD , this systematic under counting is even more likely .
The Monitoring the Future ( High School Senior Survey ) is designed to characterize use , trends , attitudes and beliefs among high school seniors .
Since 1975 , it has been conducted annually by the University of Michigan for NIDA .
The survey does not include school dropouts ( or truants on the day of the survey ) and so likely underestimates school - age drug use .
The Drug Abuse Warning Network ( DAWN ) is sponsored by SAMHSA ( previously by NIDA ) and collects data from coroners , medical examiners and emergency room admissions , primarily to identify drug dangers and emerging trends .
The DAWN statistics are controversial and Henderson systematically lays out the major threats to the validity of the data .
For example , suicide attempts are included in DAWN statistics , but alcohol ( without the presence of other drugs ) is not .
Mention of a particular drug does not mean the episode was caused by that drug .
In fact , since half of the drug - related emergency room visits entail more than one drug , cause and effect generally cannot be established by DAWN data .
The Drug Use Forecasting ( DUF ) project , sponsored by the National Institute of Justice , tracks drug use among arrestees in 21 ( non-representative ) U.S. cities .
DUF data are not meant to be normative .
For example , male arrestees for drug offenses are under - counted in order to provide a broader sample of ( drug use during the commission of ) a wider range of offenses .
Females are included regardless of the crime .
Henderson points out that these data are nonetheless “ frequently reported in the substance abuse literature , although [ the full ] reports are not published . ”
The Community Epidemiology Work Group ( CEWG ) was established by NIDA in 1976 to track rapidly changing patterns of drug use .
The CEWG meets twice a year and publishes the proceedings .
The CEWG uses a wide range of data sources and focuses “ primarily on the harmful effects of drug use . ”
Overall , the data sets upon which the government ’s “ war on drugs ” is built come off here as woefully inadequate – subject to political agendas and thus miscontructed and misdirected from the start .
The sense here is of researchers groping in a vast blackness by the light of a flickering match – not much is illuminated , but there is still enough heat to burn the fingertips of the unwary .
Conclusion
Other than the quality of the government ’s data , there is little to detract from this dogged book .
( Only Chapter 4 relies heavily on government statistics and Henderson spends much of this chapter teasing the truest interpretations out of the data . )
Some may wish the authors had gone further in detailing the positive implications of the data .
Yet , the book is likely to have even more impact precisely because it was authored “ from within the belly of the beast ” and , even without going that last 10 % of the way , still draws sharply different conclusions from those of NIDA .
It was irksome that , beside Henderson and Glass , there were no biographies for the excellent co-contributors , James MacDonald , Michael Agar and Cynthia Favret .
Were they separately hired by Henderson and Glass to gather qualitative data ?
Were they NIDA employees who could n’t list their employer ?
– we are not told .
( But they turn out to be academic colleagues working under sub-contract to Henderson and Glass and the omission a simple oversight . )
However , these complaints are minor .
Henderson ’s accomplishment with , LSD : Still With Us After All These Years , is , as a de facto representative of NIDA , to give us back the facts , the truth .
She shines the light of 45 years of laboratory and clinical research onto a half - dozen venerable government surveys of dubious validity and finds the outlines of reality .
Henderson then triangulates on this devil ’s hybrid of lab research and survey data , by breathing life into it through real - world , contemporaneous interviews with those most affected by LSD use : the users , the dealers , and their families .
We need more such analyses of government data , not mere condemnation of their flaws , and we need more government researchers like Leigh Henderson and her “ let - the - chips - fall - where - they - may ” colleagues .

For what may arguably be the first time in its history , the Catholic Church has anticipated a new technology , rather than lagging a few centuries behind , as is more traditional .
Last year , PopeBenedict XVI announced the addition of seven new deadly sins to the old list of seven deadly sins ( which , frankly , I believe is flawed to begin with ) .
On the new list is genetic engineering , which th Vatican defines broadly to include anything which changes DNA .
Eleven months later , researchers announced a major breakthrough in fighting HIV : a therapy that extracts the patient 's cells , genetically alters them to make them resistant to the AIDS virus , and then re-introduces them into the patient 's body .
The circle is now complete , as Darth Vader says .
For the first time , with the newly updated list of deadly sins , the Catholic Church has a complete , end - to - end policy on HIV :
It 's wrong to wear condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS , and it 's wrong to use gene therapy to treat AIDS .
Like many other religions , the Catholic Church has long viewed HIV as a behavioral problem , and felt that rigorous control of sexual expression , rather than condom use or research , are the ideal solution .
They do n't go quite as far as to say that HIV is a punishment from God , but approaching HIV as a behavioral problem rather than a n epidemiological one still falls flat to me .
Folks who think that HIV is a consequence of an immoral lifestyle or a punishment for wickedness would do well to consider the case of a man who called in to the Playboy Radio talk show I was a guest on several months ago ; he was HIV positive not because he'd had wild , deviant unprotected sex , but because he witnessed a car accident .
One of the accident victims was thrown through the windshield and badly lacerated .
In his efforts to save her life , he cut his hand on the glass and was exposed to her blood .
She was HIV positive ; now he is , too .
Frankly , and I want to be very clear on this point : any omnipotent , merciful , benevolent god who is OK with that cankiss my ass .
If there is a god who would be fine with that , I think such an entity is manifestly and plainly not worthy of adoration .
But I digress .
Sin lies only in hurting other people unnecessarily .
All other " sin " is invented nonsense .
The idea of criminalizing lifesaving research by holding that certain forms of medicine are inherently sinful -- and not just sinful , butsins -- that 's a level of wrong I can't quite even find the words for .
Save for stuff that matters .
If you ’re excited about it , we ’re here for it .
Save and earn toward as many goals as you can dream up .
Former Gregg staffer caught up in corruption probe Ron Brynaert
Published : Wednesday February 4 , 2009
Print This Email This Senator Judd Gregg ( Rep - NH ) , Obama 's nominee to become Commerce Secretary , may have a few skeletons in his closet related to convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
Or at least a couple of his former aides do .
" A former congressional aide to Commerce Secretary - nominee Judd Gregg has been caught up in a long - running investigation into a Capitol Hill lobbying scandal , " the Associated Press reports .
Excerpts from AP story :
A person familiar with the case confirmed Wednesday that " Staffer F " in court documents is Kevin Koonce , who worked as legislative director in Gregg 's Senate office from 2002 - 04 .
The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the case is still under investigation .
Staffer F was cited in a guilty plea last week by Todd Boulanger , a former deputy to disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
In federal court , Boulanger admitted he plied the staffer with front - row tickets to a hockey game , meals and drinks and other tickets to a baseball game , and in exchange received favors in spending legislation .
The total value of the gifts Staffer F took from Boulanger exceeded $ 10,000 , court papers said .
The AP adds , " Abramoff , once a top GOP lobbyist , is now in prison and has cooperated with the Justice Department to help convict more than a dozen people , including former Rep. Bob Ney , R - Ohio , former Deputy Interior Secretary J. Steven Griles , and a number of former lobbyists and Capitol Hill aides . "
A follow - up AP report noted that the White House was downplaying the news about Gregg 's former aide .
" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs says Gregg himself is not a target or subject of any investigation about the employee , " the AP reports .
" Gibbs pointed out that the staffer has n't worked for Gregg since 2004 . "
Gregg 's former chief of staff , Joel Maioli , was reported to have been involved in another Abramoff - related shenanigan .
New Hamphire author and journalist Jack McEnany reported that " former Republican State Committee executive director , and convicted phone jammer , Chuck McGee , has claimed under oath that Sen.
Judd Greggs chief of staff , Joel Maiola , personally delivered checks totaling $ 15,000 from the Mississippi Choctaw and Agua Calienti tribes to the NH Republican State Committee office a week before the 2002 election . "
McEnany notes that " this was the exact amount paid by the NH GOP to the now - defunct Republican Marketplace to affect the phone jamming scheme .
The tribes were clients of convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff . "
Excerpts from Dec. 21 , 2006 Union leader article :
New Hampshire 's Union Leader had reported , " While questioning McGee in an Aug. 30 deposition in the now - settled phone - jamming civil suit , Democratic attorney Paul Twomey said , " But you were aware that somebody working for Senator Gregg , either his office or his campaign , hand - delivered those checks to the Republican State Committee . ' "
McGee responded , " I believe that 's correct . "
Former state GOP office manager Kristy Stuart gave similar testimony .
Joel Maiola , Gregg 's chief of staff , did not dispute that , but said , " We've had no involvement in this ( phone - jamming ) matter and any suggestion otherwise is totally baseless and without merit . "
Former Democratic State Committee chair Kathy Sullivan was quoted as asking , " What was Senator Gregg 's relationship with Jack Abramoff ? "
After 27 years of working with Gregg , Maiola left a year ago to start his own consulting firm .
In January of 2006 , the Associated Press reported , " A spokesman for Sen . Judd Gregg said Wednesday the senator has never had any contact with lobbyist Jack Abramoff , who pleaded guilty to fraud , corruption and tax - evasion charges and has agreed to tell the FBI about alleged bribes to lawmakers . "
" But Gregg spokesman Joel Maiola said records show donations came from two Indian tribes represented by Abramoff 's firm in 2002 and 2004 , totaling $ 12,000 , which will be given to a New Hampshire - based charity , " the AP reported .
At Talking Points Memo , Paul Kiel wrote that " Todd Boulanger , a lobbyist in Abramoff 's shop , gave the two checks to a staffer for Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - NH ) to pass along , because , the staffer says , Boulanger ' wanted to help out . '
Gregg was n't running that year , mind you , but Abramoff did n't see that as a reason to stop passing money around . "
" So was that money meant to pay for the jamming ? " Kiel asked .
" The Democrats say no .
Paul Twomey , lawyer for the New Hampshire Democrats , told The New Hampshire Union - Leader , that 'he is quite sure there is no Gregg connection to phone - jamming . ' "
" There you have it : Sometimes a contribution is just a contribution -- or as much as that could be the case when Jack Abramoff is involved , " Kiel concluded .

The 20 Worst Foods in America 2009 [ Men 's Health via NYT / Bitten blog ]
Former Federal Opposition leader Brendan Nelson has announced he will not be contesting the next election .
Dr Nelson took over the Coalition leadership after the 2007 election loss , but was dumped for Malcolm Turnbull in a leadership spill in September last year .
Last night he told a Liberal Party function in Sydney that he will stand down from his seat of Bradfield at the next election .
Dr Nelson told Sky News he thought long and hard about his decision to quit politics .
" I 've spent a lot of time thinking about it and talking to my wife about it , " he said .
" One thing I 'll never be is some sort of seat warmer . "
Dr Nelson says he is not intending to try to make a move to state or local politics .
" I have had my opportunities and I 've had great opportunities bestowed on me by my party and by my electorate and by Australia , and it 's time now for someone else to have a go , " he said .
He thought it was appropriate to announce his resignation from parliament well before the next election .
" It has been an enormous honour to serve Australia through what is now 13 years in the parliament , but I think it is hard to know when it 's time to go , " he said .
" I think the time has come , it 's time for renewal and I thought it was appropriate to announce this now rather than leave it further into the electoral cycle . "
Dr Nelson 's announcement follows Monday 's Coalition frontbench reshuffle .
Opposition frontbencher Julie Bishop stepped down as treasury spokeswoman but will keep her job as deputy opposition leader and take up the foreign affairs portfolio , previously held by Senator Helen Coonan .
Joe Hockey will head up the treasury portfolio , with Senator Coonan taking up Mr Hockey 's former role in the finance portfolio .
Frontbencher Christopher Pyne will now take the role of manager of Opposition business from Mr Hockey .
Dr Nelson was the education minister in the Howard government between 2001 and 2006 and defence minister from 2006 until the election loss a year later .
Shortly after Chappelle went crazy and moved to Africa , I worked on a movie with Charlie Murphy .
I like to think we became acquainted to the point of facial recognition - not name , but I was confident if he ever saw me at a Trader Joes or in a prison lineup he ’d vaguely remember me .
One day , I was sitting at the Crack Bean , on Sunset and La Brea , when a dark figure with a large white smile walked in .
He was rockin some sort of hybrid coat , red alligator and suede with a napped finish , that had to be comprised of at least 5 dead animals ( Baller ! ) .
I walked behind him , grabbed him firmly on the shoulder , and trying not to sound too Caucasian said , “ Hey Charlie , what is up brother ? ”
When the figure turned around I realized I had just made an enormous mistake .
The man standing before me was none other than his majesty , the real king of comedy , the raw diggity : Eddie Murphy !
He paused for a second , looked into my eyes , and said , “ that ’s a first . ”
As we stood there , glaring at each other in awkward silence like an old couple dining at a Ponderosa , my brain was on overhaul , brimming with rejoinders :
1 ) Coming to America is my favorite movie .
2 ) Despite this faux pas , I do n’t really think all black people look alike .
3 ) I never saw Norbit , but I wanted to .
4 ) I voted for Obama .
5 ) You should have won the Oscar for Dream Girls 6 ) I wish Scary Spice was my baby 's Momma .
Thankfully , before I embarrassed myself further , he broke the eternal silence , “ You really know Charlie ? ” “ Yea , ” I replied confidently .
“ Well then , you probably talk to him more than I do , so tell him I said , hi . ” I do n’t know if this was a casual insult or a careful instruction , but frankly it did n’t matter .
I had just conversed with one of my boyhood idols , the idol who taught me how to say " fuck " and wear gaudy clothing for attention .
Then he shot me one of those ultra cool glances from Bowfinger , I mean Boomerang , walked out of the Crack Bean and got into a cream colored Nissan Altima with the hottest chick , with the largest deltoids I had ever seen ( I ’m pretty sure it was a she , but evidently he 's been mistaken before ) .

It seemed only fair .
Kurt Denke of Blue Jeans Cable speaks out on the Monster Mini Golf Situation .
As the classic film Frankenstein teaches us , much can be accomplished by an angry band of villagers wielding torches and pitchforks -- at least , when there is a monster on the loose .
As those who have followed the story of Monster Mini Golf will already be well aware , there is a Monster in the audio / video cable industry 's midst , and it , like the monsters of the big screen , requires a mass response .
Well , okay , not one involving torches and pitchforks as such , but a mass response nonetheless .
Monster Mini Golf , a small franchise business owned by Christina Vitagliano of Providence , Rhode Island , has been sued in United States District Court by Monster Cable of Brisbane , California .
The basis of the suit is that Monster Cable asserts that the use of the term " Monster " in Monster Mini Golf 's trade name and marks infringes Monster Cable 's various registered marks .
There has been so much editorializing on the merits -- or lack of merits -- of this suit that there is really very little more to say .
Suffice it to say that we believe that Monster Mini Golf will , and must , win this suit .
As we all know , regardless of the merits of a lawsuit , the burdens of litigation can be harsh .
I personally spent a couple of decades in the practice of federal litigation , and it can be long , hard and costly ; and I , like Ms. Vitagliano , have been threatened with meritless litigation by Monster Cable ( for details , see Blue Jeans Cable Strikes Back ) .
We at Blue Jeans Cable , though having no business affiliation of any kind with Monster Mini Golf , feel a deep sense of kinship and common cause with Ms. Vitagliano and her struggle to protect her business from predation .
Torches and pitchforks , however , will not do the job in this particular case .
The battle here must be done by lawyers , and that costs money .
To date , Ms. Vitagliano has incurred a legal bill running into six figures , and she can use all the help she can get to carry on the fight .
We are working to aid the Monster Mini Golf defense in two ways .
First , Blue Jeans Cable will match contributions to Monster Mini Golf 's defense fund , up to a total of one thousand dollars , made through > this page on our site <
Second , we are placing several products on a special Torches and Pitchforks " Promotion .
We will donate , without limit , ten percent of our gross revenue from this promotion to Monster Mini Golf 's legal defense .
This promotion runs through December 15 ; if you need cables , have a look .
I have spoken at length with Ms. Vitagliano and she is a real fighter .
I believe that if she can stay the course and fight the good fight , Monster Cable will lose this lawsuit .
That loss will not only bring relief to Monster Mini Golf , but will put a powerful precedent in the hand of every owner of a trade name containing the word " Monster " to fight back against meritless trademark litigation .
Too many people cave in to these threats ; let 's do what we can to encourage Ms. Vitagliano to carry on .

A terrified woman wrote a would - be rapist a £ 20,000 cheque to leave her alone .
The frightened victim had the brainwave after a sex attacker barged into her home , pinned her against a wall and ordered her to get undressed .
As Martin Cartwright , 49 , began undoing his trousers , the woman offered him the money .
Cartwright took the cheque and left but warned her : " If you say anything , even in a thousand years , I 'll kill you . "
Prosecutor Tim Forster told a court : " He paid the money into his bank account .
He told cashiers he had won the lottery . "
When police caught up with Cartwright , he claimed he had heard voices from Jesus " saying I should rape someone " .
Cartwright , from Guildford , Surrey , was ordered to be held in a secure psychiatric unit indefinitely after admitting attempted rape , sexual assault , and attempted robbery during a three - month crime spree last year .
It included an attempted rape in South West London when he barged into a woman 's house armed with a knife .
But after grabbing her breast , he flipped and yelled : " Open the door .
Let me out . "
A month later , he threatened to beat up a shop assistant in Surrey after demanding money from the till .
But he fled after being told police were on their way .
Guildford crown court heard Cartwright did not have any previous convictions .
But he was having a " psychotic episode " when he offended .
Judge Christopher Critchlow said Cartwright still posed a " serious risk to women " .
He is considered so dangerous he can only ever be released by the Secretary of State for Health .
He told the cashier he had won the lottery PROSECUTOR TIM FORSTER
In this week ’s The Times Magazine of The NY Times , Daniel Bergner has a piece on women ’s sexuality and research that ’s already in preprint causing a bit of controversy as well as a convulsion of 1950s era humor in the online response .
The title , ‘ What do women want ? ’ , that nugget of Freudian wonder , no doubt will raise the readership , as will the pictures of models simulating states of arousal ( Greg Mitchell is in a bit of snit about them in , Coming Attraction : Preview of ‘ NYT Magazine ’ With Semi-Shocking Sex Images on Sunday .
‘ Semi-Shocking ’?
I can imagine how that goes …
‘ Are you SHOCKED by these photos ? ’
‘ Well , I ’m at least SEMI - shocked , yes ! ’ ) .
In particular , Bergner gives us thumbnail portraits of women engaged in sex research : Meredith Chivers of Queens University ( Kingston , Ontario ) , Lisa Diamond of the University of Utah , and Marta Meana from UNLV , although there ’s also commentary from Julia Heiman , the Director of the Kinsey Institute , and others .
As with so much of contemporary science writing , we get researchers as characters , with quirky personal descriptions and accounts of meeting the author , each one standing in for a particular perspective in current scientific debates .
Chivers is portrayed as arguing that women are existentially divided ‘ between two truly separate , if inscrutably overlapping , systems , the physiological and the subjective , ’ Diamond is made to stand in for the ‘ female desire may be dictated … by intimacy , by emotional connection , ’ and Meana stands in for the argument that women are narcissists desiring to submit .
Whether or not these are accurate portrayals — and they might be — the model is prevalent in science writing : get characters to represent lines of thinking , even though many of us are not so clearly signed on with a single theoretical team .
Here , we know the score : Diamond arguing women want intimacy , Meana that they want a real man to take them , and Chivers that women want it all , even if they do n’t realize it and contradict themselves .
The irony is that , with such a tangle , the conclusion is foreordained : women will seem enigmatic , inconsistent , and irremediably opaque .
As I ’ll suggest in this , I think that the conclusion is built into the way the question is being asked .
If a similar question were asked about nearly any group , in nearly any domain of complex human behaviour , and then a simple single answer were demanded , the questioner would face nearly identical frustration .
I must admit that , although I found the article readable , even enjoyable , the last paragraph confused me , so I ca n’t be entirely certain of my analysis .
I ’ve read the last paragraph at least four times and am still not sure I understand .
I ’m going to quote it just so you do n’t think I ’m crazy , but I ’m willing to read to anyone ’s comment if you think you know what it means .
Bergner was watching Dr. Chivers scrub her data of outlying data points ( I remember being shocked by my girlfriend when I found her doing the same thing in her psychology research before finding it was common practice – more on this in another post . ) .
Chivers spent hours with a graph of ‘ arousal ’ reported by measuring vaginal blood flow , trying to smooth a red line on a computer screen to make sense of which video images were most arousing .
Bergner writes in conclusion :
It was possible to imagine , then , that a scientist blinded by staring at red lines on her computer screen , or blinded by peering at any accumulation of data — a scientist contemplating , in darkness , the paradoxes of female desire — would see just as well .
‘ It was possible to imagine … a scientist blinded … would see just as well …’
Huh ?
What I ’m getting at is not just to make sport of some tortured prose , but rather to suggest that Bergner , after reporting scads of findings highlighting a whole range of interesting phenomena connected to women ’s sexuality and sexual desire , on a number of analytical levels , still wants to reach out for the brass ring , the one thing that ‘ women want . ’
He has to conclude that women ’s desire is paradoxical , a ‘ giant forest … too complex for comprehension , ’ because there ’s no simple answer .
One can imagine an article with the title , ‘ What do diners want ? ’ , which bemoaned the fickleness and impenetrable complexity of culinary preferences :
Sometimes they want steak , and sometimes just a salad .
Sometimes they put extra salt on the meal , and sometimes they ask for ketchup .
One orders fish , another chicken , another ham and eggs .
One day a guy ordered tuna fish salad on rye , and the next , the same guy ordered a tandoori chicken wrap , hold the onions !
My God , man , they ’re insane !
Who can ever come up with a unified theory of food preferences ?!
Food preferences are a giant forest , too complex for comprehension .
What do diners want ?!
You get my drift .
The line of questioning is rhetorically time - tested ( can we say clichéd even ? ) but objectively and empirically nonsensical .
So many of these experiments seem to be testing a series of different , related , but ultimately distinct questions :
With whom do women mate ?
With whom do women have sex ?
With whom do women say they would have sex ?
What causes women ’s bodies ’ automatic arousal responses ( and under what conditions ) ?
What type of guys do women like in soft porn stories ?
What type of guys do women like in photographs ?
Do certain women get aroused by a particular type of porn movies ?
Does a particular woman realize or acknowledge that she is getting aroused by a particular stimulus ?
What affects women ’s self - reported sense of sexual identity as it changes over time in women who say they are lesbian , bisexual or not sure ?
They ’re all good questions , some better than others , and they ’re all about ‘ sex , ’ but they are testing a whole range of different things .
Can they all be glossed as , ‘ What do women want ? ’
Yeah , sort of , but you ’re going to get a hopeless answer .
Sometimes I feel like the research makes sense in context , but once it ’s sampled , sound - bited , mixed and matched into a single article with the title , ‘ What do women want ? ’ , the simplification tragically robs all the individual studies of any of the insight they could have offered in the first place .
Here , synthesis makes understanding impossible because the heterogeneity of what is being studied is ignored , as if all these research projects had the same research question .
The reason the article is a fun read in the first place is that the research that the people being interviewed are doing is intriguing ; the reason the conclusion is hopeless is that everyone is asked ( or is treated as if asked ) to extend their findings to cover all women in all situations .
For example , questions about women ’s reactions to visual images of sex and nudity are intriguing on a number of levels .
Dr. Chivers showed women videos of ‘ heterosexual sex , male and female homosexual sex , a man masturbating , a woman masturbating , a chiseled man walking naked on a beach and a well - toned woman doing calisthenics in the nude , ’ even a clip of bonobos mating .
She sexed up the last one by adding hoots and screeching , because the female ’s pleased ‘ chirping ’ sounds were n’t hot enough .
Chivers found at the University of Toronto that straight male subjects ’ genitals ( presumably college aged , by the way ) responded to heterosexual and lesbian sex , female masturbation and nude callisthenics , but were less moved by male - on - male action or the ‘ chiseled ’ gent ’s ocean side walk .
Gay men were just the opposite .
Neither group got aroused by hot monkey love ( even with dubbed - in hooting and screeching ) .
The women in the study , in contrast , had increased blood flow vaginally when any sort of sex was on screen — except the bonobos .
They also were aroused by the naked workout but not by the man strolling nude on the beach , and pretty much liked any footage with people in it .
Except for the naked man , oddly enough .
When Chivers asked the subjects to rate how stimulating each bit of footage was , she found that women ’s reports of arousal did not coincide with their vaginal blood flow spikes whereas men pretty much reported what the plethysmographs on their penises were saying .
These results , to me , are fascinating .
Not only have they caused me to swear off beachcombing au naturel , at least until I find out it ’s the ‘ chiseled ’ quality that turned off some subjects .
They also spark a whole series of questions :
Is it the phenomenology of male arousal that helps men to be more aware of physiological arousal ?
Do women report something different as ‘ arousal ’ when asked ( that is , the research instruction was probably not , ‘ push this button when your vagina swells ’ ) ?
Are all women everywhere equally unaware of physiological arousal ?
Are men and women trained differently through exposure to different sorts of visual sexual images ?
Are women unaware they are aroused if having an intimate conversation with an attractive potential partner ?
Are women aroused by any images of human sexually aroused ( after all , beachcomber guy presumably was n’t sporting a serious chubby , although I could be wrong ) ?
Why are both heterosexual men and women aroused by naked women doing callisthenics when gay men are not ?
And , perhaps most importantly , does n’t someone find bonobos getting it on sexy ?
In other words , I think Chivers research is fascinating , but when it ’s paired with the question , ‘ What do women want ? ’ , it prematurely leads to some simplistic conclusions .
The logic goes sort of like : ‘ A number of things turn women on ; therefore , we do n’t know the one thing that women want .
Damn , women are inscrutable . ’
Uh , no , actually , we have pretty clear results on the video arousal tests , it ’s just not a simple one - line sound - bite answer ( nor , for that matter , does it necessarily tell us about what women desire sexually ; it tells us about a certain group ’s response to videos ) .
The gap between measured arousal and reported arousal is interesting , but it ’s hardly big news that people do n’t know exactly what is happening in their own perceptions or bodies .
We ’ve been down this road before at Neuroanthropology .
net ( for example , at How well do we know our brains ? ) , but the bottom line is that there are lots of areas of life where self - reported state is out - of - step with objectively measurable physiological or neurological conditions .
For example , we have very little conscious access to motor - perceptual information about our own movement and object tracking ; we can move things around in people ’s visual fields and they are often lousy at noticing it .
This does n’t mean we throw up our hands and say , ‘ People are confused and inscrutable because they do n’t even know when objects have moved . ’
This is the reason that , although it ’s great to hear that sexologists studying female arousal are carving out some important research results , I kept seeing some very tired old interpretive frameworks being prematurely introduced .
For example , a couple of times Bergner threw in the gratuitous ‘ evolutionary ’ explanation that men are ‘ programmed ’ by evolution one way , women another ( although this tendency was not NEARLY so bad as some of the other research on human sexuality we ’ve discussed , and for that we ’re grateful ; see Chicks dig jerks ? : Evolutionary psych on sex # 1 ) .
At another point , we got the ‘ female narcissism ’ explanation for the fact that some women seem to be stimulated by the sense that they are desired more than a desirable object itself .
Fair enough , we can bring it whatever interpretation fits the data , but it seems to me that if women ’s desire is really a ‘ giant forest ’ that is poorly understood , and if the data is multiple and contradictory , it ’s likely that any blanket statement ( ‘ Women just want to be desired . ’
‘ Women only feel desire after they feel intimacy . ’
‘ Women just want money . ’
‘ Women use sex to get love .’) will always be inadequate .
Some of the older models of an essential female sexual identity contain a partial truth , or they would n’t even seem plausible , but they are n’t the simple answer to the simplistic question , ‘ What do women want ? ’
At times in the article , I was reminded of discussions of ‘ My Type ’ in high school and college .
I ’m sure you ’ve heard these discussions as well , with someone going on ad nauseam about what sort of person they find arousing .
Then you show up at the five year reunion , and the guy who said he liked tall , bronzed , blonde beach girls is with a short , perky , darked - haired sexologist wearing high boots and fashionable rectangular glasses ( apologies to Bergner ) .
Turns out that ‘ desire ’ is a more slippery term , and that our sexual arousal and sexual behaviour are in more complex relations than just desire - leads - to - arousal - leads - to - sex .
If it were only that easy …
Often , when I read studies of ‘ attractive faces , ’ I get the same response .
The research projects ask students to rate how faces in photographs look , and then make conclusions about desirable mates .
But the research is really asking about attractive faces in photographs , not peering into the actual sorting mechanism that produces our mating behaviour .
Thank God people do n’t pick mates on the basis of their headshots , or I for one likely never would have gotten married .
And I ’m sure that the research subjects in these experiments would strenuously object if the researchers said that they had to pick a mate on the basis of a photo of a face only , even if they thought symmetrical , feminine faces looked good in pictures .
So often , even when we ’re dealing with these research papers , we ’re still only seeing a statistical majority or even less when someone is making statements about men and women ( for another case , see Girls gone guilty : Evolutionary psych on sex # 2 ) .
Dr. Meana points this out in her interview with Bergner when she suggests that ‘ the variability within genders may be greater than the differences between genders ’ in arousal and desire .
Although I was pleased to read this , it was immediately followed with some blanket statements about female desire and contrasts with male arousal .
The section with Meana was one of the most interesting in the whole article , with some provocative statements about women ’s narcissism , the effect of female nudity , the problem of desire in committed relationships , and even sexual fantasies of submission .
Do n’t get me wrong — it ’s well worth reading .
But prefaced by this statement about variability within and difference between ‘ genders , ’ it sort of contains its own critique .
One of the wisest books I ever read about sex was Passionate Marriage by David Schnarch .
One of the thing he points out is that the reason sexuality in marriage is a challenge is because so many psychological issues , so much of our own individual , idiosyncratic life experience , can be brought into intimacy for resolution and healing .
In fact , other areas of our life are not that different .
People make eating and food about all sorts of things , as they do shopping , sports , and so on .
That is , the idea that a person desires some one thing in sexuality is part of the problem for understanding sexuality .
I suspect that the sexologists Bergner was interviewing are well aware of this , and it ’s only this journalistic framing that makes it seem so simple that the question becomes unanswerable : ‘ What do women want ? ’
( For a subtle discussion of the complex experience of desire for drugs , see Daniel ’s piece , Wanting to Craving : Understanding Compulsive Involvement with Drugs . )
To go out on a limb , I would argue that most women , like most men , probably desire a number of things , some of which are more likely to be found in sex than others .
Not all societies encourage us to seek out the same satisfactions in our relationships , nor do they all saddle us with the same psychological issues to contend with in our sexual relationships .
Even within a single society , different people bring different issues to the bedroom ( or wherever they deal with sex ) , whether they are straight , gay , bi- or other .
Moreover , once we satisfy one set of desires , that hardly means we are finished with desiring , and we might seek something else in sex .
Same activity , but looking for ‘ something else ’ within it .
I ’m not convinced that what men want is all that much less complicated than what women want in sex ; perhaps , men ’s constellation of desires in sex seem more internally consistent because they conflict less with each other , but that does n’t mean men only want one thing ( just that getting many needs met at once might be easier ) .
We ’ve seen a change in women ’s desires and how they might be met in Western society over the past half century ( and longer ) , and I suspect that these will continue to change .
In other words , sex is a field for interaction , and arousal is a physiological phenomenon that both influences how those interactions play out , and is influenced by these interactions .
Arousal does n’t determine sexual behaviour .
Every time we get aroused , we do n’t have sex ; every time we have sex , we may not be aroused , although , again , the interaction might end up affecting our physiological state ( for better or worse ) .
One of the things that makes humans human is that layers of other considerations can override or modify basic physiological processes like fear , arousal , anger , and panic .
Stripping back or ignoring these other factors like inhibition , enculturation , and socialization does n’t get us to ‘ human nature , ’ it erases so much of what makes humans distinctive .
What do women want ?
Lots .
Just like men .
And , just like men , as soon as they get what they want , women are liable to want something else .
If you fine that inscrutable , or ‘ semi- shocking ’ , you need to hang out with humans more often .

When you go outside of your home and walk around the property do you fear the limbs that are overhead ?
Perhaps you have really tall trees that have overgrown limbs and they pose a threat to the safety of your family and home ?
While you may be tempted to go outside and start cutting , it is not recommended by true experts .
Every year countless people are injured or killed while trying to cut down limbs and trees .
It is truly a job that should be left to the professionals .
However , you may be unsure how to find the best tree trimming professionals in your area .
That is exactly what we are going to discus today after chatting with an Jim , a manager of a Wilmington tree service provider located in the coastal North Carolina which was recently hit by a nasty hurricane Florence .
If you follow his three simple tips you will be able to find the best tree contractor in your hometown today whether you ’re in need of casual trimming or emergency services .
One of the first things you are going to want to look for in a tree service is a certification .
When a tree service offers a certified arborist on their staff it truly means that they are dedicated not only to the safety of your home but their crew as well .
There is a huge difference in hiring a “ dude with a chainsaw ” and a certified arborist .
A certified arborist has been trained how to safely remove limbs to ensure the continued survival of the tree in addition to the safety of the property and its occupants .
One of the next important issues with hiring the right tree service is to ensure they have the right type of equipment to work on your trees .
If you only want your trees trimmed and pruned , never allow an individual to go climbing with spiked shoes , as this has the potential to truly harm your tree .
There are other ways of trimming a tree than with spiked shoes .
If the company is not willing to invest in new tools and techniques , you more than likely do not need them working on your tree .
Finally , one of the last steps in finding the best tree company in your area is going to involve asking questions and looking to see proof .
Anyone can offer a tree service .
In fact , many people start off with a truck , ladder , and a chainsaw .
However , this is not what it entails to be the best .
You want to take the time to ask specific questions and make sure they have the ability to offer you clear and concise answers .
In addition , you also want to see proof of their insurance and certification as this is the main way you are going to stay protected .
If they are unwilling to show you physical proof , tell them you are not interested in their services and move on .
As you can see , there are a few things you will need to do in order to find a tree trimming service that is going to be able to solve your problems .
However , if you follow these simple guidelines , you should have no problems finding the best service in your area .

" Rule of thumb :
Be skeptical of things you learned before you could read .
E.g. , religion . "
-- Ben Casnocha
Looking down on others is fun , and if there 's one group we adults can all enjoy looking down on , it 's children .
At least I assume this is one of the driving forces behind the incredible disregard for ... but do n't get me started .
Inconveniently , though , most of us were children at one point or another during our lives .
Furthermore , many of us , as adults , still believe or choose certain things that we happened to believe or choose as children .
This fact is incongruent with the general fun of condescension - it means that your life is being run by a child , even if that particular child happens to be your own past self .
I suspect that most of us therefore underestimate the degree to which our youths were formative - because to admit that your youth was formative is to admit that the course of your life was not all steered by Incredibly Deep Wisdom and uncaused free will .
To give a concrete example , suppose you asked me , " Eliezer , where does your altruism originally come from ?
What was the very first step in the chain that made you amenable to helping others ? "
Then my best guess would be " Watching He-Man and similar TV shows as a very young and impressionable child , then failing to compartmentalize the way my contemporaries did . "
( Same reason my Jewish education did n't take ; I either genuinely believed something , or did n't believe it at all .
( Not that I 'm saying that I believed He - Man was fact ; just that the altruistic behavior I picked up was n't compartmentalized off into some safely harmless area of my brain , then or later . ) )
It 's my understanding that most people would be reluctant to admit this sort of historical fact , because it makes them sound childish - in the sense that they 're still being governed by the causal history of a child .
But I find myself skeptical that others are governed by their childhood causal histories so much less than myself - especially when there 's a simple alternative explanation : they 're too embarrassed to admit it .
A lovely excuse , of course , is that we at first ended up in a certain place for childish reasons , and then we went back and redid the calculations as adults , and what do you know , it magically ended up with the same bottom line .
Well - of course that can happen .
If you ask me why I 'm out to save the world , then there 's a sense in which I can defend that as a sober utilitarian calculation , " Shut up and multiply " , that has nothing to do with spending my childhood reading science fiction about protagonists who saved the world .
But if you ask me why I listen to that sober utilitarian calculation , why it actually has the capacity to move me - then yes , the fact that the first " grownup " book I read was Dragonflight may have played a role .
It 's what F'lar and Lessa would do .
Why not really start over from scratch - throw away our childhoods and redo everything ?
For epistemic beliefs that might be sorta - possible , which is why I did n't name an epistemic belief that I think I inherited from the chaos of childhood .
That would n't be tolerable , and when I look back , I really have rejected a lot of what I once believed epistemically .
But matters of taste ?
Of personality ?
Of deeply held ideals and values ?
Well , yes , I reformulated my whole metaethics at a certain point and that had a definite influence on my values ... but despite that , I think you could draw an obvious line back from where I am now , to factors like reading Dragonlance at age nine and vowing never to end up like Raistlin Majere .
( Bitter genius archetype . )
If you can't look back and draw a line between your current adult self and factors like that , I have to wonder if your self - history is really accurate .
In particular , I have to wonder if you 're thinking right now of a deceptively obvious - seeming line that someone else might be tempted to draw , but which of course is n't the real reason why you still ...
PS : Of course I do n't directly justify any of my decisions , these days , by saying " That 's what the Thundercats did , therefore it is right . "
The question is more like whether I ended up finding developed altruistic philosophies more appealing as an adult because , sometime back in my youth , I was bombarded with altruistic messages .
If there are many different stores selling developed philosophies , then which store you walk into to buy your sophisticated adult judgments might depend on a factor like that .
PPS : Several commenters asked why I focused on fiction .
I could point to several real - life events in my childhood that I still remember and that seem promisingly characteristic of " me " - for example , the only time I remember my kindergarten classmates ever praising me or liking me was the time I used wooden blocks to build a complicated track that they could " ski " along .
Making something clever = peer approval , says this memory .
But because this was a one - off event , I doubt it would have quite as much influence as messages repeated over and over , through many different TV shows with similar themes , or many different books written by science - fiction authors who influenced one another .
I could n't recite the plot of even a single episode of He - Man , but I have some memory of what the opening theme song was , because it was recurring .
That 's the power of a fictional corpus , relative to any single moment of real life no matter how significant it seems - fictions can repeat the same message over and over .
My childhood universe was very much a universe of books .
The nonfiction I read ( like the Childcraft books ) might have been formative in a sense - but factual beliefs you really can recheck and redo .
Hence my citation of fiction as a lingering influence on values and personality .
WEST POINT , N.Y . —
It is called “ the gloom period , ” when the pewter skies seem to mirror the gray fortresslike buildings on campus , and cadets hustle from class to class to avoid the cold winds whipping off the Hudson River .
But this winter , the somber mood at the United States Military Academy has been deepened by two recent suicides among the 4,400 cadets — the first since 1999 — as well as two suicide attempts last month .
Those followed two suicides last summer by staff members , and come as the Army is grappling with a record number of suicides among its members , many of whom have endured long deployments to war zones .
Last week , the academy — where the Army trains its future leaders and admission is highly prized — began a “ stand down , ” 30 - day suicide - prevention program with an Army - wide training session that includes a new interactive video .
It depicts a suicidal soldier and choices he confronts as he spirals downward :
One set of choices leads to improved mental health , the other to tragedy .
For example , the soldier struggles with suicidal thoughts after receiving a “ Dear John ” e-mail message from his pregnant fiancée , who later tells him that the father is the soldier ’s high school friend , who has also raided his bank account .
The soldier debates whether to seek help , worrying that he will appear weak or invite ridicule .

Girl , 11 , becomes Pakistani celebrity after taking on the Taliban ... with protest poetry
Inspiration : Tuba Sahaab , 11 , writes poetry that protests the suffering endured living under the strict control of hardcore Islamists
An 11 - year - old girl is taking on the Taliban by writing poems that protest the suffering endured living under the strict control of hardcore Islamists .
Tuba Sahaab says she will fight to bring peace to her nation - and that she is willing to die for it .
' I will do anything , ' she said .
' If my life goes I do n't worry , I just want to do something . '
The young writer dreams of equality for all - and of becoming an astronaut who will later lead Pakistan .
She sees Barack Obama as a symbol of hope .
Her poetry covers topical issues including the banning of girls from schools and the misery such restrictions cause .
Tuba lives in a suburb of Islamabad , Pakistan , less than two hours away from the former tourist destination of Swat Valley where the Taliban now has total control .
Her work is regularly published in newspapers and she has appeared on local radio stations to further her fearless message .
' This is very shocking to hear that girls can't go to school , they are taking us back to the Stone Age , ' she told CNN .
' I want to give peace to my nation .
I will fight for it .'
The powerful and shocking imagery of Tuba 's words prove she is wise beyond her years .
Hard at work :
The Islamabad schoolgirl pens another biting piece of social commentary
A stanza of one of her poems reads : ' Tiny drops of tears , their faces like angels / Washed with blood , they sleep forever with anger ' .
Her inspiration was heightened by the recent election of U.S. President Barack Obama , who she sees as a symbol of hope for a peaceful world .
Tuba prayed for his election last November and would love to travel to America to meet Mr Obama one day .
She said : ' I want to go the White Palace and show him my poems , show him what is happening and ask him to come to Pakistan and control it because he is a super power . '

WASHINGTON --
As he leaves office , President Bush is passing on to his successor two wars and a growing economic debacle .
What a way to go !
Because of Bush 's policies , the U.S. also is complicit in the Israeli attack on the Palestinians on the Gaza Strip by providing a " made - in - America " high - tech arsenal for the assault and blocking a ceasefire for nearly two weeks , a move intended to help the Israelis consolidate their hold .
Not to worry , Bush says he is n't concerned about how history will view his militant eight years in the White House , telling ABC News that he " wo n't be around to read it . "
Well , they say that journalism is the first draft of history .
So I am going to predict that those future historians will not deal kindly with the Bush presidency .
It 's true -- as Bush and company point at their proudest achievement -- there have been no new terrorist attacks on the U.S. since Sept. 11 , 2001 .
But they fail to acknowledge administration mistakes before and after that fateful day , starting with the fact that White House and security officials ignored significant early warnings of an imminent strike against the U.S .
The second half of the double 9/11 mistake was the trampling of our constitutional system and American values by the administration 's infamous torture policies , illegal interrogation practices , including water boarding ( simulated drowning ) , secret prisons abroad and U.S. run jails at Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere .
Post - 9/11
Bush strategy also nurtured a climate of fear that enabled the self - styled " decider " to lead the country into a senseless war against Iraq , a calamity still underway as he leaves office almost six years after the invasion .
Add the administration 's pathetic response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and you have basis to dub Bush 's eight White House years as the " Bush error . "
He was to be the great " unifier " but instead he became a great polarizer .
While he remained stubbornly steadfast to his core social convictions , he did a 180 - degree turn when it came to the role of government in the economy when he bailed out the collapsed giants of Wall Street .
He told CNN : " I 've abandoned free market principles to save the free market systems . "
So much for all the anti-government rant of Republican conservatives .
After the 9/11 attacks , Vice President Dick Cheney and then - national security advisor Condoleezza Rice drummed up the fiction that Iraq was linked to the al Qaida attacks and sold that fable to a naive Congress and jittery American people .
During the first crisis meeting after the 9/11 attack , neo-con advisor Paul Wolfowitz , said : " Let 's bomb Iraq . "
SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Never Miss a Beat .
Get our best delivered to your inbox .
There were no Iraqis involved in the attack and no evidence that Saddam Hussein had any role in planning or executing it .
Other falsehoods that these officials peddled included the tale that Iraq 's Saddam Hussein had an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction .
Cheney told his Sunday television audiences , " We know where they are . "
Official inspectors found none .
The non-existent weapons were used to justify the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March 2003 .
Bush is not about to admit that his costly inhumane attack on Iraq was a mistake .
How could he tell grieving families of more than 4,000 American service members that their loved ones had died because of his error ?
In addition to the flawed decision to attack Iraq , Bush and Co. used the aftermath of 9/11 to take wholesale swipes at our civil liberties , including warrantless wiretapping .
So those future historians will have a clear view of the 43rd president as they look back on the early years of the 21st century .
A list of Bush 's accomplishments also should include his efforts to pay more money and political support into helping victims of AIDS and malaria in Africa .
And he is proud of his controversial program " No Child Left Behind " to upgrade public school students by imposing national standards on an education system that had none .
Those future historians should also take note that Bush was hailed for his " likeability " when he came into office and was dubbed the guy you would like to share a beer with .
However , a CNN poll last year suggested that Bush had become the most unpopular president in modern American history .
That CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey indicated that 71 percent of the American public disapproved of how Bush was handling his job as president .
Bush must have a sense of relief in giving up the presidential burdens .
He is confident that those future historians will vindicate him and his presidency .
But no one is expecting him to wind up on Mount Rushmore .
U.S. House Passes Three Important Bills , With Veto - Proof Majorities , That May Begin Unwinding Bush - Era Madness ...
Brad Friedman Byon 1/7/2009 , 5:30 pm PT
[ UPDATE 1/8/09 : Oops !
The article discussed below is indeed from Wednesday , but from a Wednesday in 2007 !
March 14th to be precise .
I 'll not out the colleague who sent it to me , who similarly thought it was published yesterday .
But I 'll thank the commenter who finally noticed the date on the Reuters article , re-remind myself of the the dangers of " road blogging " too quickly , and otherwise make myself feel better by noting that my originally expressed caution about getting too optimistic at this point was apparently well placed .
As another commenter then noted , the original bill in question was later blocked in the Senate by an unknown , likely - Republican , Senator .
Let 's hope the Ds now have enough votes and control of the Senate to avoid the same fate for these bills that need to be passed now in the new Congress .
And my apologies for the false - positive alarm .

We 'll look forward to getting back to bashing Pelosi and Hoyer and Reid soon enough ( Are they really still in charge of Congress ?
And is that really " change we can believe in " ? )
But for now , today 's action in the House is certainly praiseworthy , and --- if we 're lucky --- a sign of things to come ?
( There we go again , being all optimistic and stuff . )
Read on for some good news , for a change , via Reuters ...
Brushing aside a veto threat , the House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to overturn a 2001 order by President George W. Bush that lets former presidents keep their papers secret indefinitely .
The measure , which drew bipartisan support and passed by a veto - busting 333-93 margin , was among White House - opposed bills the House passed that would widen access to government information and protect government whistleblowers .
" Today , Congress took an important step toward restoring openness and transparency in government , " House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Henry Waxman said .
The presidential papers bill nullifies a November 2001 order , criticized by historians , in which Bush allowed the White House or a former president to block release of a former president 's papers and put the onus on researchers to show a " specific need " for many types of records .
Among beneficiaries of the Bush order was Bush 's father , George H.W. Bush , a former vice president and president .
The order gave former vice presidents the right to stop the release of their papers through an executive privilege that previously only presidents could use .
And it extended to deceased presidents ' designees rights to keep their papers secret indefinitely .
The House bill would give current and former presidents 40 business days to object to requests to view their papers , allow a sitting president to override a former president 's claim of executive privilege and strip former vice presidents and the designees of deceased presidents of the power to use executive privilege to block access to their historical documents .
And , as if that 's not encouraging enough to hear , the article adds that two other long overdue bills were passed as well :
Also passed by the House by a 331 - 94 margin , despite another veto threat , was a bill aimed at bolstering protections of government whistleblowers who report wrongdoing , especially those with private contractors and national security and scientific agencies .
A third bill , which passed 308 - 117 , was aimed at speeding requests for government information made under the Freedom of Information Act .
The White House stopped short of threatening to veto it but said it could not support the bill .
Are we seeing the beginning of a return to transparency and sanity ?
We 'll not get too excited just yet , but today was very encouraging ...

( OrganicJar ) A major new finding shows moderate alcohol intake is associated with higher levels of omega - 3 fatty acids in plasma and red blood cells .
The alcohol acts like a ' trigger ' , boosting the amount of omega - 3 fatty acids in our body .
It does this by influencing the metabolism of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids , as omega - 3 .
The study concluded that wine does a better job than other alcoholic drinks due to its polyphenols .
These are naturally occurring compounds contained in a different variety of food and beverages , such as wine .
Due to their strong antioxidant activity , they are able to reduce oxidation processes caused by free radicals .
Omega - 3 fatty acids , mainly derived from fish , are considered as protective against coronary heart disease and sudden cardiac death , thus their high blood concentration is definitely good for our health .
Moderate drinking is defined by one drink a day for women and two for men .

Decades later , I 'm still waiting for jetpack technology to get off the ground .

The jetpack may have failed to fulfill its promise , but it was n't for lack of trying .

stunning array of technological innovations has been woven into the day - to - day fabric of early - 21st - century life : clothing made from recycled plastic Coke bottles ; phones that run on high - frequency microwave radiation ; snack - food science capable of containing such unruly forms as s'mores and peanut butter and jelly within the confines of a toaster pastry .
Yet for some of us , such marvels are slim compensation for the unrealized possibilities of another device , one promised throughout childhood and never delivered .
Where are our jetpacks ?
The iconography of the jetpack -- a rocket - powered backpack offering its user the power of solo flight -- stretches back to Buck Rogers comic strips of the late 1920's and recurs in Walt Disney 's 1950 's Tomorrowland , James Bond 's gadget - filled films and the skyways of the city where the Jetsons make their home .
By the early 1960's , the jetpack was such a familiar pop-culture image that it had become interchangeable with the very idea of the future -- to mention one was to invoke the other .
Yet still we find ourselves , in the year 2000 , traveling by conveyances of the last century rather than soaring happily above the treetops .
What happened ?
Where are our jetpacks ?
The United States Army called them small rocket lift devices and began financing their development in the 1950's , intending to use them for amphibious troop landings , reconnaissance missions and passage over hazardous terrain .
Early versions were ballyhooed , including Thiokol 's Jump Belt and Aerojet - General 's Aeropak , but the first major success was achieved in 1961 , at Bell Aerosystems in Buffalo .
The Rocket Belt , designed by engineer Wendell F. Moore , was a kind of hard - frame backpack powered by two hydrogen - peroxide fuel tanks ( with long exhaust pipes trailing off on either side of the wearer ) and controlled with motorcycle - like handgrips .
Flying in a standing position , with knees slightly bent , users could achieve speeds of up to 60 miles an hour .
One test pilot described the experience as " having a giant pick you up by the arms . "
But it was n't very practical for wartime use : the pack was heavy ; in flight it made a loud screeching noise ; and fuel capacity limited the flight time to just over 20 seconds .
So after demonstrating it for the military , Bell started flogging it at state fairs , Disneyland , the Paris Air Show and numerous international exhibitions , ultimately hiring it out for the opening sequence of " Thunderball , " a commercial for P. F. Flyers sneakers and episodes of " Lost in Space " and " Bewitched . "
Further refinements yielded the Flying Chair ( 1965 ) , which mounted a Rocket Belt apparatus on one of Eero Saarinen 's stylish Tulip chairs , and the Pogo ( 1968 ) , which put the device on a flying platform .
In 1968 Bell , in collaboration with the Michigan - based contractor Williams Research Corporation , unveiled the Jet Belt , which used a miniature kerosene - powered jet engine .
This device could accelerate to 70 m.p.h. from a hovering position in three seconds and was capable of sustained flight for 10 minutes .
A test pilot told Popular Science magazine that the Jet Belt made him " feel safer than I do driving the family car in traffic . "
Of course , the jet engine was tremendously heavy and nearly deafening , but hopes for it were high .
A year later , however , Wendell Moore , still the device 's chief engineer , died of a heart attack .
Subsequently the military declined to commission mass production of the Jet Belt , and in early 1970 , Bell Aerosystems sold all related patents to Williams .
At Williams , the Jet Belt 's engine became the centerpiece of the WASP , or Williams Aerial Systems Platform .
Developed in two stages over the next 15 years , the WASP II was a 250 - pound cylindrical tub resembling a flying garbage can .
Hard as it is to believe , it could fly at speeds up to 60 m.p.h. for as long as 30 minutes .
The WASP II was featured in Jane 's All the World 's Aircraft as late as the 1984 -1985 edition , but again the army , which had financed its development , lost interest .
Further attempts by Williams to market it under the name X - Jet failed , and then . . . nothing .
No more test flights , and a subsequent abandonment of individual flight systems .
Today the company is curiously reticent on the subject : though jetpack fanatics continue to call with inquiries on a regular basis , a spokesman for Williams dismisses the issue as something from " the very old past . "
Several years ago , Derwin M. Beushausen , an enthusiast from the Midwest , distributed a videotape of short films made by Bell that documented test flights of the Rocket Belt , Flying Chair , Pogo and Jet Belt .
Like people Jet Skiing through the sky , Bell 's implacable fliers slalom effortlessly through and over trees , zoom across whitecapped river rapids , whip alongside steep cliffs , float above warehouse roofs and hover over a lawn , turning slow rotations for a group of military observers .
They are among the most thrilling , and also heartbreaking , images I 've ever seen .
I sit watching the tape and think only : Why ?
Why can't I fly one of those things ?
" Jetpacks ? " asks Frank Winter , curator of rocketry at the National Air and Space Museum .
" I think here we call them Personal Lifting Devices , " he says .
The museum owns the Bell Aerosystems Rocket Belt No. 2 , which is slated for display at the Dulles Center , in conjunction with the Smithsonian , scheduled to open in the year 2003 .
" People still call me about them every so often , but you know it was a commercial failure .
It was n't a practical reconnaissance device . "
Winter must sense how crestfallen I am .
" It really was ingenious , " he adds .
" I 'm not knocking it .
You know , it 's too bad that it was n't picked up . "
These days , the only new jetpacks are the ones worn by astronauts .
NASA calls them M.M.U.'s , or manned maneuvering units : worn in a backpack configuration similar to the Rocket Belt , they use nitrogen fuel to propel and guide movement during spacewalk activity .
In the earth 's gravity , however , M.M.U.'s would be far too weak to function .
Rocket Belts , with their 20 - second flight duration , are still used for show - business purposes ; memorably , in 1984 , millions watching the opening ceremonies of the summer Olympic Games witnessed a former Bell pilot , Bill Suitor , descending into the Los Angeles Coliseum , trailing clouds of white exhaust behind him .
But all of the subsequent research and development has seemingly been for naught .
A note sent to me by Williams tersely explains that testing of the X - Jet was stopped when they concluded that " in order to make feasible more useful applications , [ it ] would require substantially improved performance from its turbofan engine . "
Winter agrees : " Even 30 minutes of flight time would be too limited for commercial purposes .
If you 're a park ranger , fighting a fire , what if you need 35 minutes , or two hours ? "
Still , he concedes that " if the right entrepreneur came along , it could be a neat attraction .
We may not be looking at the last chapter with this sort of device . "
So where are our jetpacks ?
Might they still be part of a future to come ?
The last line of my final communication from Williams holds out a sliver of hope .
" Year by year , " it says , " we are continuing to advance our turbofan technology . "
But if somehow , miraculously , we were to get them , would they prove to be more nightmare than dream -- as in the current television commercial for Budget Rent - a - Car , in which a jetpack user becomes hopelessly entangled in power lines ?
Were these devices easy to use and readily available , would our urban skies mirror the jammed rush - hour streets and freeways below ?
Though it saddens me to think so , maybe the answer is that jetpacks no longer exist in the future but behind us , receding into the past : a device for memory instead of flight .

Intelligence adviser James Rickards outlines four financial scenarios that threaten national security .
Four really , really bad scenarios
What ’s the worst that could happen ?
That ’s a question that James Rickards spends a lot of time pondering these days , as he sifts through the national security implications of the financial crisis facing the United States .
Advertisement
Rickards will lay out his worst case scenarios in a lecture sponsored by the Navy and the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Policy tonight .
And his forecasts are n’t for the faint of heart .
Rickards calls it the “ A to Z ” problem :
What are the threats that could make the U.S. economy look less like America and more like Zimbabwe ?
He sees them everywhere – in the Chinese ownership of vast amounts of American debt , in Russia ’s increased centralization of its economy , in Al Qaeda ’s long - established fascination with damaging the U.S. economy .
In many ways , Rickards is the ultimate bear .
He ’s not just thinking about whether the stock market will decline , but whether or not the stock market will survive .
All that puts Rickards decidedly outside mainstream economic and political thinking in America .
But he does have an influential audience : the United States intelligence and defense communities .
Rickards is a regular adviser on financial issues to the director of national intelligence 's office , and he lends his financial advice to the national security community .
His lecture comes as part of an annual “ Rethinking Seminar ” produced by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory .
Rickards argues that government is not doing nearly enough to prepare for the worst .
“ Here ’s the policy problem for the United States , ” he said in an interview .
“ We have experts in defense and intelligence , and huge depth in capital markets experience at the Fed and at Treasury .
But they ’re separated by the Potomac River .
And they ’re not talking to each other . ”
Rickards came by his economic experience the hard way .
He was the general counsel at Long Term Capital Management , the hedge fund that collapsed in spectacular fashion in the late 1990s and nearly took the global economy along with it .
That near - economic death experience gave him a healthy appreciation for risk .
Today , he ’s the senior managing director for research at Omnis , an applied research firm .
Four of the scenarios keep him up at night :
The Bait Effect
Terrorists , and al Qaeda in particular , are fascinated with the idea of destroying the U.S. economy .
Rickards worries that the economic meltdown in the United States could serve as bait of sorts for a terrorist attack , as plotters calculate that a strike now could have a “ force multiplier ” effect because of the already skittish U.S. stock market .
The China Syndrome
The Chinese own more than $ 500 billion worth of U.S. Treasury bonds , and billons more in the debt of other U.S. entities such as those held by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae .
And a general sense of mutually assured financial destruction keeps them from wielding that debt like a weapon : if the Chinese dumped U.S. debt on the global market , their own holdings of U.S. debt would decline in value , the U.S. economy would be damaged , ultimately harming the Chinese economy by reducing American ability to buy more Chinese goods .
They ’d have to be crazy to try it .
But Rickards points out that governments do n’t always do the rational thing .
And in the meantime , their holdings give the Chinese incredible power over American decision making .
“ It gives the Chinese de facto veto power over certain U.S. interest rate and exchange rate decisions , ” Rickards explained .
“ For example , there ’s a limit to how much dollar depreciation the Chinese would tolerate . ”
That potentially closes off one American economic strategy : allowing the dollar to decline in value in order to help boost U.S. exporters .
And China ’s leverage is only growing as each federal bailout adds to the U.S. deficit .
The Existential Crash
A pessimist by nature , Rickards believes that many economic forecasters are wrong , and the recession will get far worse than predicted .
He sees an epic disaster scenario in which the U.S. gross domestic product declines by a staggering 35 percent over the next six to seven years .
Crippling deflation could take hold .
Unemployment , he says , could approach 15 percent .
That ’s a calamitous rate , but it would not be an all - time high : unemployment hit 25 percent during the Great Depression .
“ The national security community needs to be conversant with this , ” Rickards said .
“ In defense , intelligence , and national security , you earn your money by preparing for things that may be remote , but pose an existential threat if they come to pass . ”
In this scenario , the possibilities for global unrest increase dramatically as a staggering United States retreats from foreign aid and global diplomacy and the list of dangerous failed states grows sharply .
The Alternate - Dollar Nightmare
“ The Number One vulnerability is the dollar itself , ” Rickards concluded .
“ We ’re printing them and shoving them out the door , and the Fed is basically out of bullets .
So why has n’t the dollar collapsed ?
The short answer is , global investors do n’t have any other choice . ”
That is , there simply are n’t enough Euro - or Yen - backed securities for investors to shift their money out of dollars and into some other currency .
But what if some kind of global coalition – say a trillion - dollar sovereign wealth fund allied with several countries around the world – banded together to create a gold - backed alternative to the dollar ?
Rickards says investors – many of whom already resent that they have no alternative to the dollar – would sell American currency in huge numbers to take advantage of the new opportunity .
“ If that happens , that ’s the end of the dollar , ” Rickards said .
“ You ’d have high unemployment , deflation , and interest rates would go up .
It would take what already looks like a strong recession and make it a Great Depression or worse . ”
Still , even Rickards sees a silver lining to all this .
He looks around the world to the problems facing other countries such as Russia , China , Iran , and those in the Middle East .
“ There are vulnerabilities for the United States , but also opportunities , ” he said .
“ I ’d rather be the United States than any of these other countries . ”
Grabing a screenshot from Window Media Player is not so easy as it seems .
Yesterday I tried to use the extremely useful screen capture by ‘ Print Screen Key ’ to try to capture a wmv running file on my Windows media player classic V10 .
But whenever I tried to use the print screen , a blank image was captured from the windows media player .
Windows Media Player Screenshots
Then I thought maybe the running video was posing a problem with capturing a frame .
So I paused the movie and tried the print screen technique .
But still got a blank screen .
Then I tried to capture paused and running movies in full screen ( Full screen shortcut – using Alt + Enter ) .
But again no luck .
So I decided to tweak some advanced options of Window media player .
After lot of different combinations of tweaks , still had no luck .
Looking to buy a professional multimedia software to do the job ?
There are several shareware and paid professional image capture software available which can do the job .
But why should I pay when I should try to get a freeware or get a tweak to fix it myself .
I tried to see how professional paid software ’s for this worked , but I was disappointed the moment I captured the screenshot .
It had a big logo on every image it captured .
Of course it was shareware and you needed to pay to remove the text messages .
