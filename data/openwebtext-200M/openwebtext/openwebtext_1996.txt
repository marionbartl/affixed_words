ネットの上の 「 小さくとも確実な幸福感が得られる場所」
梅田 まつもとさんにとって の 「 幸せ」って何ですか。
まつもと ご飯が食べられる範囲で，好きなことを日がな一日やっていられれば幸せですね(笑 ) 。
梅田 「 ご飯が食べられる」の定義もいろいろありますよね。今日飯を食えればいいとか，蓄えがないといけないとか。
まつもと 蓄えはあったほうがいいですね。生活に不安がない程度に。
梅田 若い人たちと話すと，こんな豊かな国で，不安だ不安だというんですよね。「生活に不安がない」と言うときの定義もいろいろで，一生食っていけるだけの蓄えがないと不安だとか，未来もずっと見通せてないと不安だとか贅沢なことを言い続けるのであれば，永遠に幸福は訪れない。
まつもとさんがおっしゃる 「 不安がない」というのは。
まつもと 僕が事故で入院しても，とうぶんは子供 が「おなかすいたよお」って泣かないですむことですね。数カ月分の貯金があれば。
梅田 オープンソースで成功しているリーダーの人たちって，そういう「幸せがぶれない」という共通点があるのかな。
まつもと 確か にLinusが 「 お金持ちになりたい」って言うのは聞いたことがないですね。
梅田 僕は，そういうオープンソースのリーダーたちの価値観，「
お金より，やりたいことをやることが大切」というぶれない価値観の持ち主がすごく大きなことを成し遂げだした，そのことを勝手に拡大解釈してみたいっていう気持ちがあるんですよ。それがこの本(「ウェブ時代をゆく」[ちくま新書]）を書くモチベーションの一つになりました。
そのことをこれからの世界における先駆者的象徴と見たい。そういったことがオープンソース以外の違う分野にもこれから起きていくんじゃないか。ソフトウエアをみんなで開発するというのと同じように，違うタイプのものづくりであったり，あるいは作らなくても，たまり場みたいなコミュニティ，師と弟子が出会う学校のような場所だとか，小さくても確実な幸福感が得られるような場所が，よりよく生きたいと思っている人たちの数だけ，ネットの上にできたらいいなと。「小確幸」(小さくても確実な幸せ)っていうのは村上春樹さんの言葉なんだけど，僕はそんなことが実現できるネット上の世界を夢想します。
そうしてそれが社会的貢献度の高い，意味のあるコミュニティになったら，まつもとさんのような「飯の食い方」ができるような人が増えてくるんじゃないか。そういう未来っていうのを思いたい，っていう気持ちが強いんですね。
Hot on the heels of 6 - year - old Natalie Shea being caught and fined for chalking up her sidewalk , a second chalker has been nabbed !
This one , Ellis Gallagher , is older -- so his punishment was a bit more serious .
Seriously !
For chalk !
The dusty , porous sedimentary rock that leaves markings which wash away in the rain .
The Brooklyn Paper reports :
The city ’s crackdown on sidewalk chalk “ vandals ” is officially out of control !
It was bad enough when the Sanitation Department threatened the parents of a 6 - year - old Park Slope girl with a $ 300 fine if they did not remove the offensive " graffiti ” — her sidewalk chalk drawings on their own front stoop .
But after we ran our front - page story about Natalie Shea and her chalk “ vandalism , ” a Cobble Hill chalk artist who had never been arrested before suddenly found himself in handcuffs and spending a night in the lockup .
Coincidence ?
Not likely , considering that the artist , Ellis Gallagher , had been quoted in the original Brooklyn Paper piece — a story that the desk sergeant just happened to be reading when Gallagher was brought in .
Gallagher , whose previous markings you can check out on Flickr , said that in the past cops would let it go when they saw he was only using chalk .
However , on October 17th while creating a chalk marking for PBS 's " New York Voices " program , they changed their tune .
We can't think of anything more temporary than outlining shadows in chalk , but the cops ultimately charged him with making graffiti , possession of graffiti-making materials and criminal mischief .
Maybe they should go to the source next time ... and bring Crayola down !

vWith authorities promising tighter borders , some farmers who rely on immigrant labor are eyeing an emerging generation of fruit - picking robots and high - tech tractors to do everything from pluck premium wine grapes to clean and core lettuce .
Such machines , now in various stages of development , could become essential for harvesting delicate fruits and vegetables that are still picked by hand .
“ If we want to maintain our current agriculture here in California , that ’s where mechanization comes in , ” said Jack King , national affairs manager for the California Farm Bureau .
California harvests about half the nation ’s fruits , nuts and vegetables , according to the state Food and Agriculture Department .
The California Farm Bureau Federation estimates that the job requires about 225,000 workers year - round and double that during the peak summer season .
More than half of all farm workers in the country are illegal immigrants , according to U.S. Department of Labor statistics .
Last year , amid heightened immigration enforcement , California ’s seasonal migration was marked by spot worker shortages , and some fruit was left to rot in the fields .
{snip}
Mechanized picking would n’t be new for some California crops such as canning tomatoes , low - grade wine grapes and nuts .
But the fresh produce that dominates the state ’s agricultural output and that consumers expect to find unblemished in supermarkets is too fragile to be picked by the machines now in use .
The new pickers rely on advances in computing power and hydraulics that can make robotic limbs and digits operate with near - human sensitivity .
Modern imaging technology also enables the machines to recognize and sort fruits and vegetables of varying qualities .
{snip}
The process involves sending a mechanized scanning unit into orchards and orange groves .
Equipped with digital - imaging technology , it creates a three - dimensional map displaying the location , ripeness and quality of fruit .
A robotic picker then follows the maps , using its long mechanical arms to carefully pluck the ripe produce .
{snip}
A set of scanning and harvesting units will likely cost about $ 500,000 when the equipment reaches market , Morikawa said .
Elsewhere , a team led by wine specialists at California State University , Fresno , is working on an automated picker to further mechanize the wine - grape business .
{snip}
The new technology includes a device called a near - infrared spectrometer , which measures the sugar levels and chemical content of grape samples before they are picked , Wample said .
The data is then plotted to a global positioning system map , which a mechanical harvester uses to navigate the vineyards and pluck specific bunches at ideal ripeness .
The system has been under development for the past four years and is being tested in vineyards .
The approximate cost of the two components is $ 230,000 .
{snip}
The company is nearing completion on a new model that picks , cleans , cores and packs lettuce and other greens , chief executive Frank Maconachy said .
It will likely cost between $ 250,000 and $ 400,000 , he said .
{snip}
Philip Martin , an agricultural economist at the University of California , Davis , said it was still unclear if heightened immigration enforcement would drive away enough workers to justify huge expenditures by growers on new machinery .
And the number of variables involved makes it difficult to determine how much , if anything , growers could save by switching to automated systems .
{snip}
So reports The Washington Post .
It is worth reviewing ( my interpretation of ) Milton Friedman :
1. Attempts to stabilize nominal exchange rates , as the Chinese are doing , can in fact be destabilizing , since the eventual adjustment will often come suddenly rather than gradually .
2 . Accelerating that adjustment by passing laws aimed at foreign countries is unlikely to be a good idea .
The laws encourage a sudden adjustment now , become a focus on rampant speculation , and the target of the laws is unlikely to react with good grace or feel gratitude .
3 . In the long run a country can peg its nominal exchange rate but not its real exchange rate .
In other words , if the Chinese lower the value of the yuan sooner or later Chinese prices will rise to restore the appropriate terms of trade .
Sterilization of flows ( e.g. , soaking up Chinese money supply by selling bonds ) can succeed for only so long and eventually the problem will cure itself .
4 . We might have to actually apply the punitive tariffs .
In other words , this development is really bad news .
The Bush administration ’s newly aggressive effort to help people facing foreclosure and shore up the troubled mortgage industry was sparked by growing concerns of an election - year recession , and the political damage that would cause , analysts said Tuesday .
Indeed , a new Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll found that 71 % of Americans now believe that a recession is likely .
A majority also think that mortgage companies should be required to freeze lending rates to sub - prime borrowers who are at risk of default .
That public sentiment underscores the growing political pressure on the White House to engage more directly in the mortgage crisis , which is taking a rising toll on the broader economy .
“ They ’re increasingly nervous about the election process , ” Mark Zandi , chief economist with Moody ’s Economy.com , said of administration decision - makers .
“ I think they ’re getting a lot of pressure from Republicans who are saying we do n’t want to be running in the middle of a recession . ”
Amid escalating loan defaults and foreclosures , the Bush administration had until recently said lenders and borrowers should work out new loan terms on their own and not expect the government to step in .
But that changed abruptly last week as Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson convened lenders , investors and others to discuss freezing interest rates for some borrowers in hopes of staving off foreclosures .
Details of the plan are expected to be announced this week .
As recently as Oct. 10 , Paulson told reporters that he opposed the idea of modifying loans by broad category .
The administration had held steadfast to this view , despite complaints by consumer activists that many borrowers had signed for loans that were doomed to fail when they reset at higher rates in the future .
The previous posture was consistent with the administration ’s strong free - market views and general wariness toward government intervention in the private economy .
But recent developments transformed the picture , observers said , suggesting that fallout from the mortgage markets was spreading .
Lenders are making fewer loans , further cooling the housing market .
That in turn is weakening consumer spending and is expected to cut into job growth .
The mounting damage helped spur a sharp Nov. 26 sell - off on Wall Street , moving the major stock market indexes into “ correction ” territory before beginning a rebound the next day .
“ I think the capital - markets issue hit them in a way that the problems of individual homeowners and community devastation did not , ” said Ellen Seidman , former director of both the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , who now heads a New America Foundation financial education project .
In a news conference Tuesday , President Bush acknowledged the problems affecting borrowers who could lose their homes .
“ That ’s of concern to me and our administration , ” he said .
“ That ’s why we ’re taking the action we ’re taking . ”
The president described the mortgage - related woes as “ a head wind ” affecting economic growth , but at the same time he sought to paint an upbeat picture of the economy : “ The basic underpinnings of the economy are strong . ”
All agree the health of the economy will have increasing political importance as a presidential election year unfolds -- and the outcome of the mortgage problems may have far - reaching effects .
Voters typically identify the president as the economy ’s chief steward , giving the Bush administration even further reason to solve the sub - prime debacle .
Already , many congressional Republicans have tried to show voters that they were responding to lending problems :
When the House last month considered a Democratic - sponsored bill to overhaul lending standards , 64 Republicans joined the Democratic majority in approving it .
“ If the economy goes south due to a housing crisis , that will be the closing argument for Democrats -- because it ’s the Republicans who own the economy , for better or worse , ” said Howard Glaser , a mortgage industry analyst and former official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development .
Reports of rising claims for unemployment , falling home prices and concerns that Wall Street firms have not yet cleared away their problems with sub - prime mortgages only add to the challenges facing the economy -- and the pressure on the administration to find a path away from recession .
Administration economic officials are now laboring under a widespread perception that they failed to respond promptly enough to the warning signs that mortgage problems were spreading more broadly .
“ Earlier this year , a lot of people -- in the administration , the Federal Reserve and the Treasury -- did not realize the potential scope of this problem and the adverse impact it could have on the economy , ” said Wright H. Andrews Jr. , a veteran lobbyist on financial policy issues .
“ I think this is nothing short of a move to prevent a recession , ” he said of the Paulson initiative .
For years , a Democratic - oriented alliance of community groups and consumer activists has warned that predatory lending practices increasingly were locking borrowers into costly loans that were headed for trouble and would ultimately hurt not only borrowers but entire neighborhoods .
Complaints rose in 2006 and earlier this year , amid reports that lenders were approving a great many nontraditional mortgages , typically with low “ teaser rates ” designed to expire -- and soar -- after resets scheduled for the future .
Others , however , including many Republicans , contended that it was not the job of government to rescue borrowers or lenders from unwise transactions , and that many of the borrowers were not pitiful victims but rather had fully realized the risks of the loans that have become controversial .
But a chorus of troubling news from the financial world has elevated the issue in recent weeks , amid rising losses from Wall Street investment banks including Merrill Lynch & Co. , Citigroup Inc. and others from loan defaults .
Total losses to banks that provided loan capital , and investors who bought mortgage - backed securities , could approach $ 500 billion by at least one estimate .
“ Obviously , when big banks like Citi come up with big hits , that had people looking , ” Andrews said .
“ The financial system is incredibly unsettled , ” said Zandi of Moody’s .
“ The economy continues to weaken .
And things are getting worse -- not better . ”

The National Institute of Standards and Technology building in Boulder , Colorado , houses lasers and quantum physics that unlock far more than the passage of time .
NIST shares the building with the Telecommunications and Information Administration . *
Photo : Quinn Norton * View Slideshow BOULDER , Colorado –
The best timepiece in the world lives deep in a ' 60s - style concrete government building , where it resembles nothing so much as a teenager 's science - fair project : a jumble of polished lenses and mirrors converging on a gleaming silver cylinder , all protected by a tent of clear plastic nailed to a frame of two - by - fours .
Called the NIST - F1 , this atomic clock is more accurate for prolonged periods than any other clock – an order of magnitude better than the one it replaced in 1999 .
When the F2 down the hall goes online next year , it will similarly dwarf the F1 .
" We basically have a Moore 's Law in clocks , " says Tom O'Brian , chief of the Time and Frequency Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology , or NIST .
" They improve by a factor of 10 every decade . "
But that precision has brought the science of time to an existential crisis .
Since 1904 , when NIST purchased a pendulum clock from a German clockmaker , the institute has been America 's official timekeeper , caring for the most accurate time - interval standards in the world .
It still serves that role .
But the latest generation of atomic clocks here , and at time labs around the world , has reached a level of precision well beyond such parochial applications , and much of the clocks ' accuracy is wasted .
As a result , the institute is changing .
No longer merely concerned with making sure America knows what time it is , the 400 scientists , engineers and staff at NIST 's Time and Frequency Division are increasingly interested in what they can do with a clock .
They 're working to shrink atomic clocks to the size of a grain of rice , and testing new breeds of clocks precise enough to detect relativistic fluctuations in gravity and magnetic fields .
Within a decade their work could have a significant impact on areas as diverse as medical imaging and geological survey .
" There 's a lot of room here to ( do more than ) just make better and better clocks , " says O'Brian .
How the World 's Best Clock Works
" The laser comes in from the next room , " says Tom Parker , supervisory physicist for NIST 's Atomic Standards Group , gesturing upward toward piping on the ceiling .
A visitor to the lab housing the NIST - F1 might be forgiven for casting an appreciative glance at a sleek refrigerator in the corner of the room , instead of the jumble of mirrors and lenses powering the F1 .
But like all modern atomic clocks , the NIST - F1 relies on laser light to coax precise time from elements – in this case cesium 133 .
Once the focused light leaves its piping , it 's split into six lasers , all directed into the cylindrical cesium fountain that rises to nearly meet the ceiling .
Inside the vacuum of the fountain , the lasers focus on a gas containing around a million cesium atoms , gently slowing them to near motionlessness and gathering them into a very loose ball .
Two of the lasers are oriented vertically , and they toss the ball up through the tube , then let gravity take it down again – a process that takes about a second .
During that second , a microwave signal bombards the cesium ball .
When the ball reaches the bottom of the cylinder , a laser and detector examine the state of the atoms .
The closer the microwave signal comes to the cesium 's resonance frequency , the more the atoms will increase in fluorescence .
That allows the machine to continuously adjust its microwave signal to approximate , though never reach , the precise 9,192,631,770 cycles per second of the cesium - 133 atoms .
Continued on page 2
With its fading beige walls and checkered linoleum floors , NIST 's Time and Frequency Division hardly invites a sense of precision .
Distracted - looking scientists in slightly rumpled button - downs roam the halls , occasionally sparing a quizzical look for outsiders .
Graduate students wander in funny T - shirts , passing offices and labs crammed with manila folders and well - used tools , while cables and pipes zigzag across the ceiling .
But NIST 's clocks have long been indispensable to the United States .
Invisible to most of us , precision time is the heartbeat of today 's digital world .
Atomic clocks installed in every cellphone site manage the handoff from one tower to the next .
Space - based clocks tell your car 's dashboard GPS where you are .
Lesser clocks keep your radio tuned , and when stability - control technology on your car kicks in , they keep you on the road and out of accidents .
Those clocks are all set – through several layers of indirection – by the cesium clocks ticking in NIST 's inner sanctum .
That 's the present .
Leo Hollberg , supervisory physicist of the Optical Frequency Measurements Group , is more concerned with the future of time .
He leads the way through darkened labs glowing with laser lights that wander paths of mirrors and lenses from room to room .
These rooms are where NIST is testing a new way of tapping the precision time built into elements like calcium and ytterbium .
Cesium clocks like NIST - F1 use lasers to slow a cloud of cesium atoms to a measurable state , then tune a microwave signal as close as possible to the cesium 's resonant frequency of 9,192,631,770 cycles per second ( See sidebar : How the World 's Best Clock Works ) .
In this manner , the F1 achieves a precision topping 10 - 15 parts per second .
At least , in theory .
To tap the F1's full accuracy , scientists have to know their precise relative position to the clock , and account for weather , altitude and other externalities .
An optical cable that links the F1 to a lab at the University of Colorado , for example , can vary in length as much as 10 mm on a hot day – something that researchers need to continually track and take into account .
At F1 's level of precision , even general relativity introduces problems ; when technicians recently moved F1 from the third floor to the second , they had to re-tune the system to compensate for the 11 - and - a - half foot drop in altitude .
Cesium , though , is a grandfather clock compared to the 456 trillion cycles per second of calcium , or the 518 trillion provided by an atom of ytterbium .
Hollberg 's group is dedicated to tuning into these particles , which hold the key to a scary level of precision .
Microwaves are too slow for this job – imagine trying to merge onto the Autobahn in a Model T – so Hollberg 's clocks use colored lasers instead .
" Each atom has its own spectral signature , " says Hollberg .
Calcium resonates to red , ytterbium to purple .
At their most ambitious , NIST scientists hope to wring 10 - 18 out of a single trapped mercury ion with a chartreuse light – slicing a second of time into a quadrillion pieces .
At that level , clocks will be precise enough that they 'll have to correct for the relativistic effects of the shape of the earth , which changes every day in reaction to environmental factors .
( Some of the research clocks already need to account for changes in the NIST building 's size on a hot day . )
That 's where the work at the Time and Frequency Division begins to overlap with cosmology , astrophysics and space - time .
By looking at the things that upset clocks , it 's possible to map factors like magnetic fields and gravity variation .
" Environmental conditions can make the ticking rate vary slightly , " says O'Brian .
That means passing a precise clock over different landscapes yields different gravity offsets , which could be used to map the presence of oil , liquid magma or water underground .
NIST , in short , is building the first dowsing rod that works .
On a moving ship , such a clock would change rate with the shape of the ocean floor , and even the density of the earth beneath .
On a volcano , it would change with the moving and vibrating of magma within .
Scientists using maps of these variations could differentiate salt and freshwater , and perhaps eventually predict eruptions , earthquakes or other natural events from the variations in gravity under the surface of the planet .
How the World 's Best Clock Works ( continued from page 1 )
The F1 is among the most accurate frequency standards in the world , but it is scheduled to be replaced next year by an even more precise clock .
" The F2 will run at low temperature instead of the ( current ) room temperature of the F1 , " says Parker .
While the atoms of F1 are effectively cooled by the lasers , everything else is somewhere around 60 degrees Fahrenheit , which fouls up the reading in small but important ways .
Even worse , some cesium atoms interact with each other as they fall down the tube – which renders those atoms unusable .
The F2 will cleverly get around this problem with multiple , but less - dense , balls of cesium , in which atoms rarely touch .
NIST researchers have figured out that by offsetting the lasers by 45 degrees , they can throw up multiple balls and get them to land at once , like a juggler finishing a show .
When they land , the laser and detector will have far more good atoms to read – making it more accurate then ever .
Elsewhere in the Time and Frequency Division , scientists are thinking small : working to miniaturize – and commoditize – atomic clocks .
" We 're trying to shrink down ... with the whole thing the size of a sugar cube and able to run on AA batteries , " says O'Brian .
The most obvious application is making GPS receivers much more accurate , but a tiny atomic clock would have other applications as well .
At the University of Pittsburgh last fall , researchers used a NIST - produced atomic clock the size of a grain of rice to map variations in the magnetic field of a mouse 's heartbeat .
They placed the clock 2 mm away from the mouse 's chest , and watched as the mouse 's iron - rich blood threw off the clock 's ticking with every heartbeat .
Since then , NIST has improved the same clock by an order of magnitude .
An array of such clocks , used as magnetometers , could produce completely new kinds of imaging equipment for brains and hearts , packaged as luggable units selling for as little as a few hundred dollars apiece .
The same technique for looking inward works outward too .
Electromagnetic fields are all around us , and change very slightly in response to our movements .
A precise enough clock perturbed by these fields can give data on where things are and what 's moving .
Like the mouse 's heart , a closely synced array could build a real - time continuous picture of the surroundings – an area of research called passive radar .
You could passively visualize pedestrians on a sidewalk , O'Brian says , " from the microwaves of the Doppler shift of someone walking . "
By the time that 's working , O'Brian thinks simple timekeeping will be a small part of what his lab does .
What will NIST be looking at ?
" Probably the interaction of space , time and gravity , " he says .
Cosmologists are paying attention .
Some models of the early universe suggest that the laws of physics may have changed over time – indeed , might still be changing below our ability to detect .
If that 's true , the scientists here hope the ultra - precise clocks might provide the first proof that the fabric of space time is in flux .
For all their advances , the scientists at NIST say they 're no closer to cracking time 's biggest secret , O'Brian explains with a resigned chuckle .
" Time is a total mystery .
What exactly is time ?
I can't tell you , " he says .
" We 're measuring something with extreme accuracy , but who knows what ? "

Fruit flies share some characteristics with humans
It has been thought that the immune system response provoked by even harmless bacteria speeds up the ageing process by using up vital energy .
But a study of fruit flies kept in a bacteria - free environment showed they did not outlive their grubby siblings .
The University of Southern California study appears in Cell Metabolism .
The question is , if it 's not bacteria that limit life span , then what is it ?
Dr John Tower
University of Southern California
The researchers admit their experiment cannot be replicated in higher organisms , which need bacteria for proper digestion and other functions .
But they said the result in flies still may be relevant to human ageing research .
In both flies and humans , the number of bacteria living on the organism increases with age .
The innate immune response to bacteria is similar in flies and humans , and it loses strength with age in both species .
But the study suggests these factors may have nothing to do with ageing .
False assumptions
Lead researcher Dr Steven Finkel said : " I think a lot of people would just assume that if you 're increasing bacterial load in an ageing human , it must be bad .
" It might not just be bad , it just might be .
Prior to this study , I would not have thought that . "
His colleague Dr John Tower said " It 's a surprise .
" Even though the flies were accumulating so much bacteria and a robust immune response to that bacteria , it 's not limiting how long the flies live .
" The question is , if it 's not bacteria that limit life span , then what is it ? "
The researchers compared normal fruit flies to specimens born from eggs washed in antibiotic , raised in an axenic ( bacteria - free ) environment , and given disinfected food throughout their lives .
A third group of flies was raised with bacteria and disinfected in adulthood .
Samples taken from the flies throughout their life confirmed that the axenically - grown flies stayed free from bacteria , while bacteria counts in the normal flies increased dramatically at they got older .
But all the flies lived for approximately three months .
Lorna Layward , of the Help the Aged biomedical Research into Ageing Programme , said the study was interesting .
But she said : " Humans do n't live in a world free of infection - we are bombarded with bacteria every day of our lives .
" We know that the older we become the more vulnerable we are to infection .
" Our immunity declines with age , and with an increasingly ageing society , it is important that we research ways to improve the ability to fight infection . "
Chris
Dodd thanks the netroots for their support and congratulates his colleagues for their help in the fight against retroactive immunity .
" Today we have scored a victory for American civil liberties and sent a message to President Bush that we will not tolerate his abuse of power and veil of secrecy .
The President should not be above the rule of law , nor should the telecom companies who supported his quest to spy on American citizens .
I want to thank the thousands of Americans throughout the country that stood with me to get this done for our country . "
The progressive blogs , who played a huge role in lobbying the Senate to support Dodd 's leadership against retroactive immunity , are joining in the celebration now that the FISA bill has been pulled until next year .
In an email , Athenae of First Draft writes , " Seriously , that was some awesome with awesome sauce and a side of pure , crispy win . "
Crooks & Liars has video of Dodd 's closing remarks this evening .
Jason Rosenbaum at The Seminal writes , " This victory means Dodd 's filibuster has weight .
It also makes it much more likely that he will win round two as he continues to stand up for the Constitution and against telecom immunity . "
Sam Stein at the Huffington Post sets the early narrative - one which I think accurately describes how events evolved over the course of the last few days - in an article titled " Dodd 's Filibuster Threat Persuades Reid . " [..]
Also , thanks to everyone at FireDogLake for all the help driving activism today .
LG today added a new model to its XNOTE line in the form of the E300 - AP75 K , a new version of the company 's 13.3 - inch portable .
The system becomes one of the smallest and lightest ( at 2.9 pounds ) to include a hybrid hard drive and includes a 160 GB disk with 256MB of flash memory to speed boot times and responsiveness without requiring either a space - consuming separate cache or an external USB stick .
This speed emphasis is also reflected in the unusually fast specifications : the stock model is based on a 2.2GHz Core 2 Duo and comes with 2GB of memory , according to LG .
Video on the system is provided by an integrated Radeon X1250 chipset , which also provides HDMI output .
The AP75 K also comes with a 1.3 - megapixel webcam and should be available first in Korea at a price roughly equal to $ 1,715 .
LG has not announced outside launches but has seen some of its systems released in North America through importers

Shaker GayAsXmas , who gets the hat tip , says via email : " [ T ] here are actresses out there who could make credible action heroes ( Angelina Jolie , Jessica Biel , Jennifer Garner , Gina Torres ) but [ are n't given the opportunity ] due to a fundamental lack of imagination from the mostly male Hollywood culture .
Just give Joss Whedon $ 50 million and let him play with it , dammit ! "
Sing it , brotha .
Of course , it 's not just action films that WB is unwilling to make with female leads , but .
Every genre is to be female lead - free — because , evidently , teh bitchez is Hollywood poison !
I know it 's a crazy suggestion , but maybe WB could just try making movies with female leads that people actually want to see before giving up on teh womminz altogether .
And , while you 're at it , perhaps you could try something original .
This precludes endless derivations of Steel Magnolias in which eclectic groups of sassy women are bound by their patronage of the same salon , a book / foodie / quilting club , or magical pants .
It also precludes remakes and / or thinly veiled modernizations of Jane Austen 's stories , especially Sense & Sensibility , Pride & Prejudice , and Emma .
It yet further precludes various bastard children of The Odd Couple and Cagney & Lacey .
All of these things have been done , and often done well .
Do n't try to give us Clarice Starling 2007 .
Give us a whole new goddamned character .
Or open a history book and acquaint yourselves with one of the many women throughout history whose amazing stories would make compelling biopics .
I do n't need one more fucking picture about Queen Elizabeth I , no matter how well it 's done .
On the other hand , give me L. Scott Caldwell as Ida B. Wells and I 'll consider paying your exorbitant ticket price .
The truth is , I 'm just not interesting in paying money to see talented women play hookers , strippers , bimbos , witches , psychos , and second - fiddle to tiny actors with veneered grins .
When Kelly McGillis is the Top Gun , give me a call .
Oh — and one more suggestion .
When you 've got a film with a female lead in the can , try actually marketing it .
I never even heard of The Invasion until it was already out of theaters , but , despite barely watching any network television , I can't seem to escape adverts for the truly stinktastic - looking The Heartbreak Kid , which is Dreamworks not WB , but wev , you get my point .
Invest in female leads like you do male leads — and that includes occasionally casting a woman who 's been seen on film before , instead of constantly casting the ingénue of the month — and I bet you 'll find you get similar returns on that investment .
Just saying .
[ UPDATE : Ginmar and Echidne comment , too . ]
It 's been almost nine months since we first reported on Windows Vista 's inability to copy , delete and move files without stalling indefinitely , and yet the problem continues .
Screenshots relayed this week by two Reg readers say it better than we ever could .
" 48167 Days and 23 hours remaining , " one of them reads .
" 36843 Days and 0 hours remaining , " states the other .
Both are Vista 's best - faith guesses as to how long it will take to copy data from one location to another .
" I have been experiencing slow copying ever since I ' upgraded ' to Vista earlier this year , particularly from USB keys & drives , " writes Adrian Procter , the Reg reader who provides Screenshot 1 ( right ) .
When Procter tried to create a CD with just 168 Mb of pictures , Vista told him it would take more than 131 years to complete the job .
So he canceled the job and used Nero 7 .
The task was completed successfully in a couple minutes .
Both CDs came from the same package and he 's never had an error writing to CDs or DVDs before .
His laptop , by the way , has 1.25 GB of RAM , 15 GB of free hard disk space and runs on a Centrino Pentium M740 .
Vista 's Long Goodbye , as we 've come to call this bug , is one of the more baffling things to come out of Redmond in recent memory .
Copying files to a CD or across a network is not exactly one of the more exotic things a PC user can do , right ?
And yet , the problem continues .
Even stranger , Microsoft has yet to acknowledge the problem , other than to issue this hotfix , which many users say does nothing to remedy the bug .
We kept our fingers crossed that the glitch would be straightened out with Service Pack 1 , but even after the update is installed , many users are confounded to learn that the problem still persists .
Reg reader Tonya is among them .
" I have just installed the pre-release version of SP1 for Windows Vista after their website promised me in glowing terms that the file copying wait would be much reduced , " she wrote .
" Apparently not , as you can plainly see by the enclosed screenshot " ( right ) .
To be fair , some participants on this monster , 478 - post thread on Microsoft 's TechNet site have reported success in eradicating the Vista malady .
Some report SP1 does speed things up .
Others have seen improvements after running through a series of steps that includes disabling Windows search service , tweaking Vista 's user account control settings and setting network interface cards at half duplex or auto negotiate .
But even then , there 's no guarantee the problem will be fixed .
With Microsoft 's buggy code and non-existent communication , we 'll be sitting on the upgrade sidelines for the foreseeable future , thank you very much . ®
White House press secretary admits she did n't know what Cuban Missile Crisis was
History has a way of repeating itself .
White House press secretary Dana Perino has been front and center of the White House 's push to continue to label Iran a rogue state for its pursuit of uranium enrichment technology .
This comes against the backdrop of a new intelligence estimate positing that the Islamic state abandoned its nuclear weapons in 2003 .
Turns out she does n't know quite so much about nuclear weapons as she supposes .
And we 're not talking about Iran .
Appearing on National Public Radio's quiz show , " Wait , Wait ... Do n't Tell Me , " this weekend , Perino admitted a story she 'd previously only shared in private :
When a reporter asked her a question during a White House briefing in which he referred to the Cuban Missile Crisis -- she did n't know what it was .
" I was panicked a bit because I really do n't know about . . . the Cuban Missile Crisis , " said Perino , who at 35 was born about a decade after the 1962 U.S. - Soviet nuclear showdown .
" It had to do with Cuba and missiles , I 'm pretty sure . "
The exchange was first noted in the Washington Post .
" I came home and I asked my husband , " she said on air .
" I said , ' Was n't that like the Bay of Pigs thing ? '
And he said , ' Oh , Dana . ' "
Perino was referring to the White House briefing held on October 26 , when a reporter asked her , " Do you want to address the remarks by President Putin , who said the United States setting up a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe was like the Soviet Union putting missiles in Cuba , setting up a Cuban missile crisis ? "
" Well , I think that the historical comparison is not -- does not exactly work , " Perino had responded .

Claim : Donald Trump left a Buffalo Club waiter a $ 10,000 tip .
FALSE
Example : [ Derober , 2007 ]
Donald Trump tipped a waiter $ 10,000 .
Derober has a copy of the receipt from The Buffalo Club in Santa Monica , CA where the Trump left a hefty tip on a $ 82 bill .
Donald Trump tipped a waiter $ 10,000 .
Derober has a copy of the receipt from The Buffalo Club in Santa Monica , CA where the Trump left a hefty tip on a $ 82 bill .
Here ’s Billy ( the waiter ’s ) story : Donald ordered the pasta and the other guy had the same .
When they were finished , they both ordered cappuccinos .
We ’re sort of famous for our capps !
My co-worker wanted me to ask him for his autograph so he could give it to his dad for Christmas .
Yeah right .
I finally brought them out the check .
Trump grabbed it and actually spoke to me for the first time .
“ What ’s the biggest tip you ever got ? ” “ Jerry Bruckheimer comes in a lot .
He tipped me $ 500 on a $ 1000 check once . ”
Trump nodded his head .
“ You ’re very good at your job . ” “ Thanks . ”
Trump then got up and left .
Billy went to pick up the check and noticed the tip .
He tried to contact Trump to thank him , but has n’t had any luck .
Origins : Tycoon Donald Trump may espouse in his “ Waiter Rule ” that “ how you treat a waiter or a waitress reveals a lot about your character ” so “ do n’t forget to leave a big tip , ” but this December 2007 rumor about his having left a $ 10,000 tip on an $ 82 tab for a waiter at Santa Monica ’s Buffalo Club was pure fabrication .
As the Los Angeles Times described , the Trump Tip account was completely fictional , a hoax made up by the web site Derober.com and propagated by a number of other sites that failed to make any attempt to verify the story :
Everything about the story was false , such as the plausible - looking receipt showing the monster tip and Trump ’s signature , the existence of Billy D ,
a putative waiter at Santa Monica ’s Buffalo Club , as well as the fact that Trump had been in Los Angeles [ that ] week at all .
( Trump told the New York Post ’s Page Six that he was n’t in California that day and that “ this was done by the stupid restaurant to get publicity . ” )

Not quite .
The story , it turns out , was fabricated , soup to nuts , by a 4 - month - old snap - and - gab site called Derober.com .
Derober is run by two brothers from Venice Beach — both professional photographers — and specializes in doing funny things with celebrity - related images .
Reached by phone , Derober ’s John Resig , 29 , spilled the beans and laughingly marveled at the hoax ’s success .
“ How many people get on the front page of Fox News with a story that does n’t contain one single ounce of truth ? ” he wondered in amazement .
Resig supplied screen shots of the Fox News home page , where the story had been displayed for hours with a photo and the headline “ Trump Change . ”
A Foxnews.com representative did not deny that the story had been posted on the site for some time but noted that an update had also had been added noting that the original story was false .
Derober ’s Resig [ said ] not a soul had contacted him or his site to verify any of the evidence — let alone question it .
“ You could drive a Mack truck through the holes in this story , ” said Resig .
“ There was no effort made at due diligence .
Which would ’ve taken , by the way , like two minutes and a cellphone .
Like , really . ”

Romney :
It 's not torture unless you admit it Nick Langewis and David Edwards

This CNN's Wolf Blitzer assails GOP presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney over his lack of a definite opinion on whether the widely debated interrogation method known as " waterboarding " is torture .
Even as competitor and Arizona senator John McCain , along with United States Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell , define " waterboarding " as torture , Romney remains strategically undecided .
" I just do n't think it 's productive for a president of the United States to lay out a list of what is specifically referred to as ' torture , ' " he responds .
Citing " ticking time bomb " scenarios , Romney disagrees with the notion of admitting that a particular practice could violate the Geneva Convention , thereby preventing its utilization by the United States in the event of an urgent need to extract information to , for example , prevent a nuclear attack .
Romney touts the element of surprise , which , in addition to the deliberate creation of a legal grey area on what breaches international treaty , leaves a detainee at a disadvantage when it comes to preparing for what acts one can expect an agent acting on behalf of the United States to perform once one is captured .
Says Romney , " We have found it wise in the past not to describe precisely the techniques of interrogation that are used here in this country -- also , so that people who are captured do n't know what might be used against them . "
The President , Romney concludes , is responsible for orders handed down to an interrogator , but also has the right to determine what is an appropriate interrogation technique to order an agent to perform .
The exchange can be viewed below , as aired on CNN's Late Edition on January 13 , 2008 .
The administration of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney is set on a course that leads directly to a third world war .
And a third world war leads almost inevitably to most of us dying horrible deaths .
And we 're not talking about it .
The White House has made clear it is seriously considering attacking Iran with massive bombing aimed at destroying the nation 's military and changing its government .
Iran will certainly retaliate .
If attacked , and possibly even if not attacked , Israel will join in the fighting .
The resistance in Iraq will intensify dramatically .
Controlling the oil of Iran and Iraq will be out of the question short of thorough genocide .
Anti-American furor will sweep the Muslim world .
The nuclear nation of Pakistan will be a prime target for an Islamic revolution .
If we do n't have a world war on our hands immediately , one will be very hard to avoid .
We will have taught every nation , again , that the only path to safety is acquisition of nuclear weapons .
We will have isolated the United States from most of the world , including many of our traditional allies .
Terrorist attacks against American targets will come , and the United States will retaliate , again , not with law enforcement but with additional aggressive warfare .
If the United States attacks Iran , we will be openly at war with the world in a nuclear age .
If the thought is n't terrifying , something 's wrong with our ability to fear .
Our politics is almost always driven in the wrong direction by fear of the wrong things .
I 'd love for once to see fear knock some sense into us .
The founders of the United States feared these moments for us .
To protect us , they gave Congress the sole power to declare war .
The current Congress , building on the misdeeds of others in recent decades , has given up its power .
In fact , we 've reached the point where Congress cannot easily take it back .
Were Congress to declare with a veto - proof majority that Bush must not bomb Iran , is anyone sure Bush would listen ?
Back at the start of this Congress , eight months ago , some of the new committee chairs from the progressive caucus spoke on a panel organized by the Institute for Policy Studies .
Congressman John Conyers , the new chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , said on this occasion that he would take up the impeachment of Bush and Cheney if they attacked Iran .
Congressman Dennis Kucinich at the time was saying the same thing .
He has since introduced articles of impeachment against Cheney ( H Res 333 ) that include the charge of threatening aggressive war against Iran ( which happens to be a crime ) .
Currently 20 Congress Members support H Res 333 , but none of them with any sense of urgency .
None of them are lobbying their colleagues to sign on or to introduce their own articles of impeachment .
Nobody in Congress , and certainly not the leadership , is pushing hard for impeachment as the means to prevent an attack on Iran .
But impeachment is the only leverage the Congress has over an outlaw executive branch .
Conyers recently said that he opposes impeachment because he carries the Constitution in one hand and a calculator in the other , and he uses the calculator to tell himself he does n't " have the votes " to pass impeachment .
Of course , by that argument , he should take his name off his bill for single - payer health care , his bill for slavery reparations , etc .
But , more importantly , an impeachment effort can serve a purpose short of successfully impeaching anyone .
A serious movement to impeach Gonzales helped show him the door .
A serious movement to impeach Bush and Cheney is the only way Congress can deter an attack on Iran or end the prolonged attack on Iraq .
If articles of impeachment had 100 cosponsors , Bush and Cheney would understand that attacking Iran would move that number to 218 .
Has Bush even told the Congressional leadership of his plans to attack Iran ?
If he has not , will they have the decency to feel indignation ?
And will they do so BEFORE the bombing ?
If he has told them , then Congressional leaders have a duty to the citizens of this nation to immediately expose and oppose such plans .
Congress exists to determine our nation 's course of action , not to be informed of it .
Any member of Congress who has been informed of new plans for illegal war and not spoken out should be tried as an accomplice in war crimes .
As the White House continues to leak news of its likely attack on Iran , our demand must be for impeachment now , not after the slaughter when we have all been made less safe than ever .
And we must not get caught up in the nonsense questions in the media over exactly who lied about exactly how many nuclear facilities in Iran .
If possessing some particular number of nuclear reactors , or for that matter nuclear bombs , justified other nations in launching aggressive war , then any nation would be justified in attacking the United States .
Nothing , in fact , can justify a war of aggression , legally or morally , because such a war is certain to be worse than whatever might be found to try to justify it .
We cannot , of course , be certain at this point that Bush and Cheney will attack Iran .
Whether they do or not , the task of Congress remains the same : impeach these dictators and end the occupation of Iraq .
But if our nation continues on this path of unchecked executive power and military aggression , the path of Afghanistan and Guantanamo and Iraq , then expanded war is inevitable , and that means war that eventually hits the United States .
The clearest I can possibly frame our situation is as a choice between one word and another .
We are unlikely to get neither or both .
We are likely to get one or the other .
Impeach or die .

DADS GET INVOLVED DADS GET INVOLVED
A recent survey by jobs website Monster.com found that working fathers increasingly are trying to balance work and family demands , using benefits that until recently were utilized primarily by mothers : • Dads with a child under age 5 who took paternity leave when it was offered by their employers : 71 % • Dads with school - age children who took paternity leave when offered by employers : 48 % • Dads with toddlers whose employers provided paternity - leave benefits or flexible work schedules : 66 % • Among working men , dads who took advantage of paternity leave when offered : 58 % • Dads who adopted flexible work schedules when offered by employers : 71 % • Dads who viewed companies positively for offering a flex - time benefit : 82 % Source : 2007 Monster.com survey of 1,011 full - time job seekers , including 330 working fathers and 473 working mothers .
Todd Scott , 32 , has two children under age 5 .
Each workday , he leaves his job at Himmelrich Public Relations in Baltimore at 5 p.m. to be with his family — and even then feels guilty he is n't spending enough time with Hunter , 4 , and Anna , 1 .
Scott 's approach to balancing work and family contrasts with that of his boss , Steve Himmelrich , 48 , who has two children and is a more traditional - style dad , spending many long hours , free time and some weekends at the office .
Himmelrich says he supports Scott 's parenting strategy , but both acknowledge it has been a source of tension between them .
" We have monthly conversations , some more tense than others , about our differing attitudes to our roles at home and our responsibilities at work , " says Scott , who says that " being engaged in my family life is more important to me than my career advancement .
My boss … could n't be more opposite . "
Says Himmelrich , " I have a lot of respect for Todd and what he does .
And I have a really great relationship with my kids . "
Their situation reflects the conflicts that are becoming increasingly common in workplaces across the nation , as fathers press for more family time and something other than a traditional career path .
As dads demand paternity leave , flexible work schedules , telecommuting and other new benefits , they 've ignited what workplace specialists are calling the Daddy Wars .
They 've also prompted several Fortune 500 companies to begin pitching such family - friendly benefits to men — and inspired a new wave of workplace discrimination complaints filed by dads .
For years , women who say their employers have discriminated against them because of their care - giving roles have filed complaints with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .
The EEOC has not released precise figures , but it reports that it now is seeing a shift : filings by fathers .
For example , the EEOC says , some employers have wrongly denied male employees ' requests for leave for child care purposes while granting similar requests from female employees .
Under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act , fathers are allowed to take unpaid leave for the birth , adoption or medical illness of a child .
They are allowed up to 12 weeks of leave in a year , although some states grant additional rights for dads .
Meanwhile , a few fathers who have sought additional care - giver benefits and been denied have gone to court , with mixed results .
David Johnson , who worked in the office of the registrar at the University of Iowa , sued the university in 2003 over its policy of letting biological mothers — but not fathers — use accrued sick leave for paid time off after the birth of a child .
Johnson had a daughter and argued that the policy was discriminatory because it allowed biological mothers and adoptive parents to use the accrued sick leave , but not biological fathers .
Johnson lost his case in federal court in 2005 .
The university has n't changed its policy since the lawsuit , spokesman Steve Parrott says .
" The Daddy Wars are definitely there , especially between management and employee , " says J.T. O'Donnell , a workplace consultant in North Hampton , N.H. O'Donnell and other workplace specialists say that in the USA 's evolving workforce , the pressure to redefine men's roles on the job — and at home — will increase as more mothers join the labor force and take on jobs with longer hours and higher work demands .
Fifty - nine percent of women 16 and over are in the labor force , up from 43 % in 1970 .
And the numbers will continue to rise :
In fall 2003 , women accounted for 57 % of the 16.9 million students enrolled in U.S. colleges , according to a 2007 report from the American Council on Education in Washington , D.C.
That 's a dramatic shift from 1965 , when men made up 61 % of college enrollments , and the gender gap on campuses is continuing to widen in favor of women .
Don Winter of the Harrison Group , a marketing and research firm based in Waterbury , Conn. , says what 's happening on campuses now ensures that white - collar employers will have to continue expanding their view of male employees as well as of female workers .
" Mothers are working and making major incomes , so it 's forcing dads to step into the household role , " Winter says .
" There are fewer men going on to college .
Women , for many years to come , are going to be more successful .
So guys are seeing their roles shift .
They 're having to take on more of a domestic role . "
A sense ' that careers will suffer '
A survey this year by job website Monster.com ( MNST ) found that most working fathers , like Scott , want to be more involved in family life .
Nearly 70 % of fathers surveyed by Monster said they would consider being a stay - at - home parent if money were no object .
The survey also found that working dads are increasingly tapping into benefits that until just a few years ago were used almost exclusively by mothers : 71 % of fathers with a child under age 5 took paternity leave when it was offered by their employer .
In part , O'Donnell and other analysts say , the figures reflect how today 's fathers in their 20s and 30s do n't typically adhere to the philosophies or career tracks followed by previous generations .
For generations , " Fathers have defined success as big cars , big salaries , big homes .
But dads now define success as a good relationship with their children and spouse , " says Armin Brott of Fathers At Work , an Oakland - based business that specializes in helping men find a balance between work and family .
" It 's really a generational change , but it 's hard , " Brott says .
" There 's tension , and there 's this sense out there that careers will suffer . "
Fifty - six percent of working men say they share equal responsibility with their spouse for scheduling household appointments and activities , according to 2007 data compiled by the Harrison Group .
Another 19 % of working men say they have most or sole responsibility for such duties .
Data from a recent book , Changing Rhythms of American Family Life , indicate that married fathers ' child care time increased from three hours a week in 1985 to nearly seven in 2000 .
Married fathers ' child care activities almost tripled over the period , with most of the change happening after 1985 .
Women , however , still shoulder more of the burden when it comes to child care .
Even so , " Fathers are taking on more of the traditional mother 's role in the households , and they are more emotionally tied to the families today , " says Winter of the Harrison Group .
" What 's happening is also a reaction to working mothers and how they 've changed , too . "
Amit Ringshia , 31 , took paternity leave and used to take some Thursdays off to be with his son , Nitai , 2 .
Despite such involvement , the technical manager at KPMG in Maywood , N.J. , still feels a twinge of guilt that he can't do more with Nitai .
" There is always a guilty feeling as a father that you 're not paying enough attention , " Ringshia says , echoing a sentiment long expressed by working mothers .
His wife , Rushali , is a dentist .
But Ringshia says the time he has spent with Nitai " helps me feel connected , that I 'm an involved father . "
Employers focus on dads KPMG is among several major employers who have begun reaching out to fathers as part of efforts to retain and recruit them as workers .
With only 24 % of its global 14,000 - employee workforce in the USA made up of women , Texas Instruments has made working fathers a focus of a range of family - friendly programs .
( That percentage of female employees is reflective of the tech industry as a whole . )
Fathers at Texas Instruments are offered flexible work arrangements , two weeks paid paternity leave and adoption leave .
Managers let employees vary their schedules so they can attend soccer games and school events .
Other efforts the company is making include providing information on topics such as kids ' summer camps and e-mail groups for parents .
Ernst &
Young , the professional services giant with about 27,000 employees in the USA , has changed its benefits plans in recent years to help working dads .
Programs include up to six weeks of paid paternity leave and flexible work arrangements ; about 15 % of those using such flexible work programs are men , the company says .
When Ernst & Young began letting fathers take parental leave in 2001 , dads made up 46 % of those taking it .
Today , slightly more than 50 % of those who take such leave are men .
When parental leave began for dads at Ernst & Young , the maximum leave was two weeks , but since 2006 , men have been able to take up to six weeks of leave it they are a child 's primary care - giver during that time .
John O'Connor , 42 , a senior manager at Ernst & Young in Philadelphia , took six weeks of paid leave after the birth of his daughter , Caitlin , now about 8 months .
His son , Christian , is 2 .
He also is able to leave work when necessary for family events .
" We have the ability to do the things we want with the kids and still be productive at work , " says O'Connor , whose wife , Staci , 30 , also is a manager at Ernst & Young .
She took 12 weeks of maternity leave .
" Other fathers I work with have no problem leaving early for a school function .
You 're not working less but just at different times .
It 's more frowned upon if you do n't spend time with your kids . "
Sun Microsystems ( JAVAD ) now has a program that lets employees work anywhere , anytime , so working fathers can take time off as needed for children 's functions without having to punch a clock or worry about face time with their bosses .
The flexibility has become evident throughout the 37,000 - employee company .
Mike Dillon ,
Sun 's general counsel , logs on from home before taking his son to school in the morning .
Sun also has a work - and - family consultation and referral program that provides advice on child care , adoption , elder care , education , working and parenting issues and seminars dealing with personal and business issues .
Sun has partnered with child care centers to provide employees with primary , backup and school - age child care options .
Rob Englander , 47 , of New York , is a senior staff engineer at Sun who primarily works at home so he can be with his 15 - year - old daughter , Jessica .
He is a single parent .
" Last year , there was a problem in a math class .
I contacted the school , and the principal said , ' Come in and talk to me , ' " Englander recalls .
" If I had to take time off , it would have had a huge impact .
It took me five minutes to get to school and meet with her principal .
This kind of flexible work environment ( is ) … critical . "
The flexibility also is crucial for Scott , who credits his boss , Himmelrich , for allowing him to take time when needed for family , even though the dads have different approaches to time at the office .
" He 's been very flexible .
That 's to his credit , " Scott says of his boss , Himmelrich .
" It helps assuage my guilt .
For one thing , I commute a long way .
If I had to stay till 6:30 p.m. , I would n't see the kids before they go to bed . "

Comic timing
September 26 , 2007 3:04:19 PM
Well before the appointed hour , exactly 2:38 pm on September 23 , nearly a thousand people had gathered at tiny Reverend Thomas J. Williams Park in North Cambridge , waiting for . . . well , no one really knew .
But with 20 seconds to go , they started counting down .
“ Redonkulous , ” is how 19 - year - old Olin College sophomore Katherine Elliott explained it .
Bound by a spirit of adventure that drew them from Arlington , Cleveland , Calgary , Moscow , and elsewhere , fans of xkcd — which bills itself as “ a webcomic of romance , sarcasm , math , and language ” ; the letters “ xkcd ” meaning nothing in particular — came to this place , at this time , to see what exactly would happen .
“ Something ’s already happened , ” said 28 - year - old Jesse Raymond , who ’d traveled from upstate New York .
“ We ’re all here . ”
Fans of xkcd ( go to xkcd.com ) , which is drawn in simple stick - figure form , are your romantic brand of geek , who see a challenge both in sorting through lines of code and in affairs of the heart .
“ [ xkcd is about ] computers , physics , mathematics , and what it ’s like trying to be someone having relationships with people while being good at all those things , ” said 53 - year - old David Bass , a North Cambridge resident who brought his wife and three kids — all fans — to the gathering .
Around him , people wore T - shirts sporting equations , traded in - jokes about velociraptors , engaged in spontaneous foam - sword duels , and hauled a mattress to the top of a jungle gym they had overtaken .
Randall Munroe , the 22 - year - old creator of the comic , moved to the area in June .
A former NASA scientist with a degree in physics , he can appeal to his fans ’ unique sense of humor .
And they thank him for it .
“ One of my friends characterized it very well as , ‘ Oh my God , there ’s someone in my head reading my thoughts and making a webcomic about them , ’ ” said John Ostwald , a 27 - year - old software developer from Newton .
The meet - up was prompted by a March comic entitled “ Dream Girl , ” in which Munroe ’s stick - figure narrator recounts meeting a girl in a dream who urgently whispered a date and time and the mapping coordinates — 42.39561 , - 71.13051 — of Williams Park in his ear .
The narrator goes there at the appointed moment but , as he sadly concludes , “ It turns out wanting something does n’t make it real . ”
But hundreds of people decided to make it just that .
“ Dream Girl ” was enough to bring Alex Norris here all the way from England .
“ I saw that , and I got my credit card out and booked the plane ticket , ” said the 34 - year - old IT - support technician , who participated in a tape - measure length competition during the gathering .
“ I think it ’s really amazing because there was absolutely no planning that went into this , ” said Claire Bailey , an 18 - year - old student at MIT .
“ It was all just people acting independently and coming together as one . ”
So at 2:38 pm , the crowd cheered and applauded . . . and waited .
Then Munroe appeared .
“ Dream Girl ” had been enlarged onto giant white boards and affixed to a fence , with blank boards hung alongside .
“ Maybe wanting something does make it real , ” Munroe told the assembled fandom .
“ Clearly , the comic needs to be corrected . ”
With that , Sharpies were distributed and the fans took their turn with the pen .
Among the comments scribbled on the new last “ panel ” of the comic were “ xkcd is made of people , ” “ First post ? ! , ” and “ I came all the way from NYC to have my dream come true . ”
Later , Munroe was 10 - deep in a throng of geeks , autographing everything from a Rubix cube to an exposed breast to a picture of two buffalo mating .
“ The comic said that no one was going to show up , ” said Munroe , an unassuming - looking guy in a striped green T - shirt .
“ On the other hand , you draw the comic and other people get the same idea and maybe that is how things do happen . ”
Adrian Sud , a 21 - year - old UMass - Amherst student , says it was a happy ending .
“ All the fans , if nothing had happened , we would have been perfectly content .
But something happened , and that just makes the world for us . ”
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama on Thursday criticized a recent vote by Democratic presidential rival Sen. Hillary Clinton as helping to give President Bush a " blank check " to take military action against Iran .
Sen. Barack Obama says Sen. Hillary Clinton has shown " flawed " judgment .
" We know in the past that the president has used some of the flimsiest excuses to try to move his agenda regardless of what Congress says , " Obama said in an interview with CNN 's Wolf Blitzer .
Last month , Clinton voted to support a resolution declaring Iran 's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , an elite part of the Iranian military , a foreign terrorist group .
( The nonbinding amendment to the Defense Authorization Act passed by a 76 - 22 vote . )
Obama said he would have voted against the measure but did n't because he was campaigning in New Hampshire at the time .
He said it was impossible to know when votes will be scheduled in the Senate .
" This is a problem " related to running for president , he said .
Obama said Clinton also had shown " flawed " judgment during the vote to authorize the Iraq war five years ago .
" We know that there was embodied in this legislation , or this resolution sent to the Senate , language that would say our Iraqi troop structures should in part be determined by our desire to deal with Iran , " Obama said .
" Now if you know that in the past the president has taken a blank check and cashed it , we do n't want to repeat that mistake . "
Clinton on Thursday defended her vote on the resolution during an interview on New Hampshire Public Radio , saying " what I voted on was a nonbinding resolution .
It 's not an amendment .
It 's not a law . "
While Clinton was campaigning Sunday in New Hampton , Iowa , an audience member at a town hall - style meeting pressed her on why she voted for the Iran measure and asked why she had n't learned from past " mistakes . "
Calling " the premise of the question " wrong , the senator from New York argued the resolution calls for the terrorist label so that sanctions can be imposed .
The sanctions , Clinton said , will in turn " send a clear message to the leadership " and lead to stronger diplomatic efforts .
Earlier this month , Clinton also co-sponsored legislation with Sen. Jim Webb , D - Virginia , that would prohibit military operations against Iran without congressional approval .
Obama 's comments came on the fifth anniversary of the 77 - 23 Senate vote that authorized the president to use force against Iraq .
Obama , then an Illinois state senator , spoke out against the resolution authorizing force at the time .
Clinton 's 2002 vote shows a clear difference in judgment between the two of them , Obama said .
Watch as Obama questions Clinton 's judgment »
" I do n't think it disqualified her , but I think it speaks to her judgment and it speaks to my judgment , " Obama said .
" It speaks to how we will make decisions going forward .
" I think her judgment was flawed on this issue . "
Obama said he also will step up efforts to clarify his differences with Clinton , whom many political observers view as the front - runner for the Democratic nomination .
" There 's no doubt we are moving into a different phase of the campaign , " Obama said .
" The first part of a campaign is to offer some biography and give people a sense of where I 've been and what I am about .
" In this next phase , we want to make sure that voters understand that on big issues , like the decision to go into the war in Iraq , I had real differences with the other candidates , and that reflects on my judgment . "
Another leading Democratic candidate , John Edwards , also voted in 2002 to authorize force in Iraq while he was then a senator from North Carolina .
He later called his vote a mistake .
In a veiled swipe at Clinton , Obama also suggested he could better unite the country and offer " something new , as opposed to looking backward and simply duplicating some of the politics that we 've become so accustomed to , that frankly the American people are sick of . "
Obama would not say whether he would consider Clinton as his running mate should he become the Democratic Party 's nominee .
" I think Sen. Clinton is a very capable person , " he said .
" Right now , my goal is to make sure I am the nominee , and she is still the senator from New York . "

All About Barack Obama • Iraq War • Hillary Clinton
Having vaulted into the front ranks of the Republican presidential contenders , Mike Huckabee is now more than an amiable curiosity — and his decade as governor of Arkansas will be scrutinized carefully for clues to his character and temperament .
He has established an admirable persona as an evangelical conservative who displays none of the rancor that permeates the religious right .
But when he says that his faith defines his life and that there can be no separation of religion from government , what does that mean in practice ?
It is n’t clear how Huckabee ’s Baptist outlook influenced his decisions on taxes , education or transportation , but his record in granting clemency and pardons demonstrates the dangers of religious zealotry in power .
The most infamous case of Huckabee ’s misplaced mercy involves a rapist and murderer named Wayne Dumond , now deceased , who originally went to prison in Arkansas for raping a distant cousin of Bill Clinton ’s .
Eventually that case developed into an obsession among President Clinton ’s enemies on the right , who spread the notion that Dumond had been imprisoned unjustly and brutalized by the “ Clinton machine ” and should be released .
When Huckabee became governor , he supported and evidently engineered a parole for Dumond , winning applause from the Republican right — and indirectly causing the death of a young woman whom the former prisoner later raped and killed in Missouri .
Dumond died in prison , under suspicion that he had murdered at least one other woman after his release , and Huckabee has sought to shift the blame for that bad outcome onto others .
To rebut critics of the Dumond fiasco and prove he is tough on crime , Huckabee notes that he signed off on 16 executions as governor .
But he also used his authority to grant clemency to others found guilty of equally heinous crimes .
Indeed , he granted more commutations and pardons than any governor in the previous 40 years .
While many of those decisions were surely wise and just , especially when they meant reducing excessive penalties under the drug laws , some of his pardons have raised considerable controversy in Arkansas .
Influenced by his fellow pastors , as well as by friends and relatives of inmates , Huckabee appears to have practiced what might be called “ Christian cronyism . ”
The worst example of that syndrome , chronicled in detail by the crusading journalists at Arkansas ’
The Leader newspaper , concerned a killer named Glen Green , sentenced to prison for life after confessing to the savage rape and murder of a teenage girl .
An Air Force sergeant , Green had bludgeoned the woman with nunchucks , violated her almost lifeless body , run over her with his car and dumped her in a bayou .
A preacher friend of Huckabee ’s convinced him that the girl ’s murder had been an “ accident ” and that the convict had repented , come to Jesus and therefore should be freed .
Huckabee seems to have known very little about the horrifying case beyond what his preacher pal told him .
He did n’t bother to seek the opinions of the prosecutor or the victim ’s family , and he ignored the dissent of his own parole board .
But after the governor announced that Green would be released , a furious public eventually forced him to reverse his decision .
Still , he insisted on releasing a number of murderers and other violent criminals despite protests from prosecutors .
Aside from the manifest stupidity of releasing Green , Arkansas citizen groups and newspapers criticized the secrecy of Huckabee ’s deliberations .
He even refused to disclose his reasons for granting clemencies , supposedly because he did n’t want prisoners to figure out how to win his sympathy .
But as The Leader sardonically observed , “ Huckabee may not have realized it , but every prisoner knew how to get on the governor ’s good side .
Call it Huckabee ’s religion test .
It ’s a sure ticket to freedom :
Tell him you ’ve found religion . ”
Or get a friendly pastor to tell him .
Other prisoners likewise seemed to have a special claim on Huckabee ’s attention , including those who labored as trusty servants at the governor ’s mansion , relatives of Huckabee ’s friends and employees and , in at least one case , a drunk driver who happened to be a wealthy real estate developer .
( In 2003 , he began serving a six - year sentence for repeated drunk driving offenses , but Huckabee let the man go after about six months .
In 2006 , he nearly killed a police officer in yet another drunk driving incident . )
Mercy is a wonderful quality , whether religious or secular .
What seems far less wonderful is the dispensation of political favors disguised as religiosity — and that is exactly what the nation ’s Founders meant to forbid .

Mariah Carey left organisers of an awards ceremony fuming yesterday ( 23.03.05 ) after turning up 90 minutes late because she broke a fingernail .
According to reports , the sexy singer threw a tantrum after snapping the nail and ordered her entourage to fix the problem before she would attend the Capital Radio Awards , in London .
Despite being accompanied by a team stylists , make - up artists and hairdressers on her trip Carey was unable to locate a manicurist .
Eventually staff managed to find a nail specialist to come to the lavish Bagloni hotel , where she is staying , to repair the damage and get Mariah to the ceremony where she caused more outrage by arriving with 11 bodyguards and demanded they watch over her as she ate .
A source told Britain 's Daily Mail : " Mariah swept in looking every inch the star , but it was a little over the top .
She had kept everyone waiting over an hour for her grand entrance and her excuse that it was all down to a broken fingernail simply did n't help those fumbling over her tardiness . "
Earlier this week , Mariah confirmed her diva status by getting staff at the same hotel to roll out a red carpet accompanied by lit candles for her arrival at 2 am .

Climate warming is naturally caused and shows no human influence :
Climate scientists at the University of Rochester , the University of Alabama , and the University of Virginia report that observed patterns of temperature changes ( ‘ fingerprints ’ ) over the last thirty years are not in accord with what greenhouse models predict and can better be explained by natural factors , such as solar variability .
Therefore , climate change is ‘ unstoppable ’ and cannot be affected or modified by controlling the emission of greenhouse gases , such as CO2 , as is proposed in current legislation .
These results are in conflict with the conclusions of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and also with some recent research publications based on essentially the same data .
However , they are supported by the results of the US - sponsored Climate Change Science Program ( CCSP ) .
The report is published in the December 2007 issue of the International Journal of Climatology of the Royal Meteorological Society [ DOI : 10.1002/joc.1651 ] .
The authors are Prof. David H. Douglass ( Univ. of Rochester ) , Prof. John R. Christy ( Univ. of Alabama ) , Benjamin D. Pearson ( graduate student ) , and Prof. S. Fred Singer ( Univ. of Virginia ) .
The fundamental question is whether the observed warming is natural or anthropogenic ( human- caused ) .
Lead author David Douglass said : “ The observed pattern of warming , comparing surface and atmospheric temperature trends , does not show the characteristic fingerprint associated with greenhouse warming .
The inescapable conclusion is that the human contribution is not significant and that observed increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases make only a negligible contribution to climate warming . ”
Co-author John Christy said : “ Satellite data and independent balloon data agree that atmospheric warming trends do not exceed those of the surface .
Greenhouse models , on the other hand , demand that atmospheric trend values be 2 - 3 times greater .
We have good reason , therefore , to believe that current climate models greatly overestimate the effects of greenhouse gases .
Satellite observations suggest that GH models ignore negative feedbacks , produced by clouds and by water vapor , that diminish the warming effects of carbon dioxide . ”
Co-author S. Fred Singer said : “ The current warming trend is simply part of a natural cycle of climate warming and cooling that has been seen in ice cores , deep - sea sediments , stalagmites , etc. , and published in hundreds of papers in peer - reviewed journals .
The mechanism for producing such cyclical climate changes is still under discussion ; but they are most likely caused by variations in the solar wind and associated magnetic fields that affect the flux of cosmic rays incident on the earth ’s atmosphere .
In turn , such cosmic rays are believed to influence cloudiness and thereby control the amount of sunlight reaching the earth ’s surface and thus the climate . ”
Our research demonstrates that the ongoing rise of atmospheric CO2 has only a minor influence on climate change .
We must conclude , therefore , that attempts to control CO2 emissions are ineffective and pointless .
– but very costly .

A reader reminds me of Rudy Giuliani 's utter disgust at the notion proffered by Ron Paul in a Republican debate that 9/11 may have had some explanatory roots in the foreign policy of the US for the past fifty years .
So how does Giuliani stand and proudly accept the endorsement of a man who said that Americans were actually responsible for 9/11 - because of their alleged immorality ?
If you were appalled by Ron Paul 's explicatory analysis , would n't you be even more enraged by Robertson 's causal analysis ?
Especially since that would also apply to Giuliani himself ?
Does Rudy believe that he helped cause 9/11 ?
If he does n't , why did he just accept the endorsement of a man who does ?
One possible silver lining : those American Jews leaning toward Giuliani may be a little more leery now that he has been endorsed by an anti-Semite like Robertson .

I do n't see any difference in the look of the OS between windows 95 up to ME .
XP looked different but even then you could get the " old " look back if you wanted to .
Mac OS made slow but steady progress from 7.5.3 to 8 , adding color and texture , support for 16 and 32 bit color , etc. OS 9 was n't so much of a leap , but it did add sticky folders along the bottom , which was sort of a precursor to the dock .
I had 9.2 on my blue and white g3 tower , and it ran like lightning .
When I upgraded to OSX it was a whole other story .
That thing was slow as molasses .
Things are just now getting back up to the speeds they should have been at all along .
Ever since windows came out it 's been buggy and crashy and unpleasant .
I can't really blame it though , it was written to be able to use just about anything you plugged into it in some form or another .
My biggest observation about the 2 OS 's is in the search command .
Apple has always had a simple , intuitive search command that would just find the file you were looking for .
Windows did n't , and AFAIK , still does n't .
If you rely on google desktop to search files on your computer , then that 's as sure a sign as any that your OS sucks .
Apple - F worked wonderfully , Sherlock was pretty good , and now spotlight is wonderful even if you do n't have indexing turned on .
I get tired of waiting for an hour in windows for it not to find my file , and I really want to shoot that damn dog in the face .

These funny conversations took place between air traffic controllers , pilots and air crew around the world .
Many of these air traffic control quotes and piloting stories - especially those submitted direct to this website - are absolutely true stories and factual ; others have perhaps been embellished a little .
These ' ATC ' ( Air Traffic Control ) stories and quotes are included here because they are very funny , and also because the collection provides examples of confused and somewhat ineffective communications and relationships between ' customers and suppliers ' , and other similar situations .
These ATC quotes and stories therefore offer excellent quotes , stories , analogies and examples for training , speaking , presentations , writing , etc. , about achieving quality of customer service and service delivery - and communications in the workplace generally .
There is certainly justification for fun , humour , firmness , and ' banter ' in organizational communications , although good teamwork and relationships and quality can be undermined if messages / responses cause upset or confusion .
Organizational culture , leadership , attitudes , service , reputation , etc. , are all weakened if communications are offensive , or rude , or could be perceived as such by the listener / reader ( staff member , customer , supplier , whatever ) .
Discrimination , prejudice , xenophobia , arrogance , bullying , racism , sexism , ageism , etc. , should not be permitted or tolerated or encouraged in organizational communications - whether in messages between staff , or from staff to consumers / customers .
These communications examples provide a wealth of material also for for students of transactional analysis and effective rapport - building .

From Zany Afandi ( Aug 2017 )
One evening during the Month of Ramathan ( Ramazan ) where most Muslims fast during the day , I was about to start eating and drinking .
We were eager for dinner as we had not eaten during the day .
Meanwhile , a Turkish airline pilot contacted our tower and said , " GOOD EVENING Suli Tower " .
Unfortunately , because I was very busy eating and the food was extremely hot , I became very distracted , and after hearing the call I replied to the pilot unintentionally " GOOD MORNING SIR " .
It was about 7:30 pm local time .
After a brief pause he replied , " Good bye captain , and have a nice flight " .
He thought I was in the air !
From J Patterson ( Oct 2016 ) :
I was in the RAF during the early 1960s , stationed at Changi , Singapore .
( Seletar was the nearby civilian airport . )
I was working as a technician in the local ATC when an American aircraft took off , did a circuit of the airfield , and then called Changi tower ..
The somewhat relaxed pilot asked , “ Say buddy am I pointing in the right direction for Seletar ?... "
From R Hankin ( Jun 2016 ) :
During my National Service ( 1959 - 61 )
I spent the majority of it in the tower at RAF Debden , an airfield steeped in WW2 history , but by the time I arrived there it was a lot quieter in operational terms .
Occasionally pilots posted into Debden for a ' ground ' tour ( ie , not flying ) would like to get into the air .
They did this by flying an old plane based at Debden - a twin piston - engined Avro Anson ' tail dragger ' ( ie , two main undercarriage wheels and a non-retractable tail wheel ) .
One such pilot , returning from a leisurely trip above the East Anglian countryside on a sunny afternoon , aborted an approach to land because he was seeing only two cockpit lights as an indication that the undercarriage was down and locked .
With rising panic in his voice , he requested a low pass over the tower so that a visual inspection could be made of the perceived problem with his nose gear ( wheel ) .
It was only after an exasperated sigh from the controller that realisation dawned on the pilot that he did n't have one ...
From S Dee ( 14 Nov 2011 ) :
a lesson in making assumptions ..
I overheard this amusing exchange while waiting for passengers to board my island - hopper , July 2010 , Penzance field , UK ..
Visiting light aircraft ( in a posh English accent ) : " Penzance tower , Cessna Light G123 request approach instruction and landing ? "
Penzance tower ( in a broad Scottish accent ) : " G123 , Penzance tower welcome to my airspace , sadly we are not accepting your class , divert on heading and contact approach on Lands End . "
Visiting light aircraft : " Penzance tower , negative , request approach instructions , my landing approved earlier , I 'm with my partner and will be landing for the day . "
Penzance tower , " G123 , that is still a negative .
Penzance field is a heliport .
I strongly suggest diverting to Lands End airfield . "
Visiting Aircraft , " Penzance tower , please confirm heading to Lands End . . "
( The above story is a lesson in making wrong assumptions - especially where an immovable obstacle is misinterpreted to be movable - in this case producing acute embarrassment as the stance was motivated by a wish to impress a girlfriend .
For a similar lesson about wrong assumptions and immovable obstacles see the very funny naval stand - off story in the storiessection . )
From R Brown ( 19 Apr 2011 ) :
A few years ago at our Air Traffic Centre we received warning that an undisclosed number of US Air Force B2 Bombers would be crossing our FIR [ Flight Information Region ] at a particular time on a particular day .
They would check in with us as they entered our airspace and check out again as they left .
They gave us the callsign to expect , and the route was known , so it was logical to assume that they would contact us at a certain time at a certain place .
The callsign and reporting points have been changed to protect the innocent .
Being the then famous new ' Stealth ' bombers we would know little about it but they would pay us the courtesy of letting us know they were there .
Eric , a very capable controller with a keen sense of humour was on position , and heard , " UAE Area , this is USAFB2 .
This is a courtesy call advising that we are about to enter your airspace . "
Eric replied , " USAFB2 , welcome to UAE Airspace , we have you on radar 200 miles out over LOTUS , hope you enjoy your visit . "
Without thinking the Stealth Bomber replied , " Thank you UAE , it a pleasure to be ...
Wait - you got us on Radar ? 200 miles out ?
You shittin ' me ? "
" That 's affirmative USAFB2 , " said Eric , " I 'm shittin ' you .
Enjoy your visit . "
Also from R Brown :
I worked at an international airport in the Middle East a few years ago .
A local hero there and an all round good egg , Tom , in the tower one day received a call from the electrical guys on their way to do their daily checks .
" Tower , Electric One .
Request clearance to cross the runway at Yankee . "
" Electric One , Tower .
Hold . "
A few seconds later Tom receives another call , " Tower , Electric One .
Request clearance to cross the runway at Yankee . "
Tom replies " Electric One , Tower .
Hold . "
A few seconds later , the same call again , " Tower , Electric One .
Request clearance to cross the runway at Yankee . "
Tom replies , " Electric One - If you look to your right you will see a Garuda 747 about to land .
If you ’ve got the balls you 've got the permission . "
After a couple of seconds , " Electric One - Holding . "
And also from R Brown :
It was the protocol to practically close down the airport when the ruling Sheikh , affectionately known by expats in the UAE as Big Zed , was traveling .
Tom a keen poker player , was sat in front of the screen .
The airport was temporarily closed to traffic and aircraft are holding , waiting for it to open in a few minutes , when Tom received a call , " Abu Dhabi , this is XYZ12 , we request permission to land immediately . "
Tom advises , " XYZ12 hold for the moment , the runway will be available in 10 minutes , as previously advised . "
The same request repeatedly persisted for several minutes , culminating in XYZ12 attempting to play his trump card .
" This is XYZ12 ; we have a VIP on board , and he insists that we be allowed to land immediately . "
" XYZ 12 , " says Tom , " I 'll see your VIP and raise you a VVIP , and he insists that you wo n't " " Big Zed ? " asks XYZ12 .
" Affirmative , " says Tom , at which the reply is heard , " This is XYZ 12 please advise when the runway is available . "
From Hal ( 19 Apr 2011 ) :
When instructing ( as a young lieutenant in the US Navy in 1967 ) at NAS Beeville , Texas , we were tasked to add three night bombing flights to the air - to - ground syllabus , which had previously been day only .
l took the first flight of four out the target that was located about 80 miles away from Beeville between Alice and Laredo .
On arrival , we found the target completely obscured in fog and had to return home .
Our ops officer decided that we needed to provide simple weather observation training to the range people , so a wx guy [ weather specialist - wx is morse code for weather ] drove down and gave the crew a two or three hour short course on how to report the weather .
Th next time I had a flight there , I called the range up and asked them what the weather was .
The range guy says , " Sir , the weather is clear , visibility 1/16 of a mile . "
I could n't figure out what that meant , so I asked him what was the restriction to visibility .
He replied , " Why , sir , it is dark ... "
And also from Hal :
This was in 1990 when I was a 727 instructor for Delta Airlines in Georgia .
On a 727 trainer working in Augusta , we were hammering landings in the VFR pattern when the tower told us to extend upwind to follow a US Air Fokker on a straight - in .
I called back and told the tower I would take interval and that I had the Messerschmidt in sight .
The keyed mike laughter lasted until I turned base ..
( Hal also added - You will have heard the old joke about the old fighter pilot telling a high school class about dogfighting with German fighters in WWII .
The pilot went on and on about fighting the Fokkers when the teacher interrupted and told the class that the Fokker was a model of German fighter .
The pilot said , " Yes , but these fokkers were Messerschmidts . . "
From Jim ( Aug 2010 ) :
In 1978 I was a trainee Air Traffic Controller under supervision at Collage Station Texas , Easterwood Tower .
This is a true story of a radio discussion one afternoon :
Unknown Aircraft : " Hello ?.. "
Easterwood Tower ( me ) : " Please say again . "
UA : " What ? "
ET : " Who is this ? "
UA : " This is Joe "
ET : " This is Easterwood Tower , where are you ? "
UA : " I 'm in the plane ! "
( I looked down the flight line , checking if someone was sitting in a parked plane playing with the radio .
I did n't see anything , and the senior controller was becoming more interested in my handling of the situation . )
ET : " Joe , where is the pilot ? "
UA : " He got out when the engine quit . . "
( I could only imagine a bizarre scenario in which the pilot had jumped from the plane . )
ET : " Joe , what does your airspeed indicator read ? "
UA : ( Long pause ) " Zero ? "
( So the plane was now in a stall I thought . )
ET : " Joe , whatever you have in front of you - a stick or a steering wheel - push it forward - you need to get airspeed over your wings ! "
UA : " Are you sure ? "
ET : " Yes Joe you need to push it forward ... ( pause ) ...
What does your airspeed indicator read now ? "
UA : " It 's still zero . "
( I thought , oh my god , Joe 's plane was in a falling leaf spin .
I could n't help him .
Joe was going to die .
I did not know what to do .
I looked to the senior controller .
He said , " Ask him where his plane is . " )
ET : " Joe , where is your plane ? "
UA : " We are parked down at the end of the runway , the pilot got out when the engine quit and walked back to the hanger . . "
ET : " Joe , get off the radio . "
From Sue ( July 2010 ) :
I overheard this over the radio while on my cross-country flight today .
I 'm not giving the aircraft call - sign because the trainee is in enough trouble already ..
Controller : I 've got you on radar , state your intentions .
Pilot : Can I fly around in circles Sir ?
Controller : Negative , you are in a busy airspace right now .
Pilot :
Ok then , I 'll fly around in straight lines .
From Dr P Rutherford ( May 2010 ) :
This occurred while I was serving in Vietnam .
As our unit had particularly strong radio equipment we were often tasked to listen in on different networks in order to back up the ground or air crews experiencing communications difficulties due to any number of reasons .
One particular conversation had me in stitches for hours afterwards .
I can't recall the callsigns so I 'll just call them A and B .
Callsign A ( ground crew ) : " Callsign B .
What is your location ?
Over . "
Callsign B ( Birddog aircraft ) : " I am in the Hat Dich area .
Over . "
Callsign A : " Say again your location .
Over . "
Callsign B : " I am in the Hat Dich area , I say again , Hat Dich area .
Over . "
Callsign A : " Sorry .
Say again location .
Over "
Callsign B : " I am in the Hat - as in head - Dich - as in head , area .
Over . "
Callsign A : " Roger out . "
From AW ( Mar 2010 ) :
I met an SR - 71 pilot a few years ago .
( SR - 71 was the USAAF advanced ' stealth ' reconnaissance aircraft known as the Blackbird ) .
He told me this story from his first flight with a new co-pilot :
An SR - 71 and crew were flying over Southern California when a bug smasher came on the airwaves in a dorky voice : Cessna 152 : Ground Control , What 's my airspeed ?
Ground Control : 100 at FL 100 .
A few moments later a cocky voice came on : Mooney M20 : Ground Control , What 's MY airspeed ?
Ground Control : 240 at FL 240 .
By this time the SR pilot was seething , but since communications were the duty of his new co-pilot , he remained silent .
A few moments of radio silence passed , and in the calmest voice imaginable the co-pilot keyed in : SR - 71 : Ground Control , What 's our airspeed ?
Ground Control : 1875 at FL 800 .
There were no more speed checks called in that afternoon , and the pilot knew that he had a cool partner in the back seat .
From Dave ( Mar 2010 ) :
I was told this story by an air traffic controller from his time at a joint military / civilian airport .
An F - 4 ( USAAF fighter jet ) pilot requested clearance to take off , but due to the amount of civilian traffic the ATC told him he'd have to hold .
After a repeated impatient request by the F - 4 to take - off the ATC suggested that if the pilot could reach 14,000 ft within half the runway length he could take off ; otherwise he would have to hold .
To the ATC 's surprise the F - 4 pilot acknowledged the tower and began to roll .
At the halfway mark the F - 4 went vertically up until he reached 14,000 ft , then levelled off .
The ATC had no option than to hand the pilot over to departures and wish him a nice day , since he'd met the conditions laid down .
The ATC said it was the darndest thing he ever saw .
From Stewart ( Mar 2010 ) :
Due to take off from JFK New York one morning in our Qantas 707 we were about eighth of fifteen aircraft in line .
From one of the aircraft , presumably experiencing a slight problem , a voice over the radio said , " Fuck ! "
JFK Air Traffic Control ( angrily demanding to know ) : " Who said fuck ? "
First aircraft in the line ( gave callsign ) : " I did not say FUCK . "
Quickly followed by the second in line ( gave callsign ) : " I did not say FUCK . "
Then the third , and then all of us , one by one , giving the same " I did not say FUCK " reply .
Another time , we were about fourth in a long queue waiting to take off in our larger Boeing aircraft .
The JFK ATC allowed a B737 on a local flight to take a short - cut and start his takeoff run by joining the main runway from a taxiway causing us to wait for him to take off and clear .
" How do you like them apples ? " he said on local VHF as he started his takeoff run .
Boeing aircraft had a warning horn for major problems that you can test .
Half - way along the B737's takeoff run , ' someone ' held their cockpit mike to the horn and pressed it as they tested it .
The B737 abruptly stopped takeoff with full reverse and full braking and shuddered to a halt , tires ( tyres ) smoking .
A few seconds later we heard a voice on our VHF : " How do you like them apples ?.. "
From L Miller ( Jan 2010 ) :
A British Airways 737 touched down at Frankfurt - am - Main .
The tower controller , obviously in frivolous mood , transmitted : " Speedbird 123 .
Nice landing Captain ,
But a little left of the centre - line , I think . "
Quick as a flash , the BA Captain replied in a cool English accent : " Roger Frankfurt Tower .
Perfectly correct .
I am a little to the left of the centre - line .
And my co-pilot is a little to the right of it . "
A KingAir had just rotated ( lifted - off the runway ) at take - off when there was an enormous bang and the starboard engine burst into flames .
After stamping on the rudder to sort out the asymmetric thrust , trying to feather the propeller and going through the engine fire drills with considerable calmness and aplomb , the stress took its toll on the Captain ...
He transmitted to the tower in a level friendly voice : " Ladies and gentleman .
There is no problem at all but we 're just going to land for a nice cup of tea . "
He then switched to cabin intercom and screamed at the passengers : " Mayday .
Mayday .
Mayday .
Engine fire .
Prop wo n't feather .
If I can't hold this asymmetric we 're going in .
Emergency landing .
Get the crash crew out . "
The aircraft landed safely with the passengers ' hair standing on end .
The late Captain Mickey Munn – an all - round fine fellow , highly experienced pilot and , at the time , Sergeant in the Red Devils ( UK Parachute Regiment display team ) - was piloting a Britten Norman Islander to jumping altitude with a full load of hairy - arsed paras crammed into the rear of the aircraft .
With no warning at all , a bang and a flash of flame , the port engine blew itself to pieces .
Mickey 's hands flashed around the cockpit as he brought the aircraft under control .
As soon as the aircraft was straight and level he turned to his passengers and said : " Phew .
I think you chaps should … "
But his words tailed away as he gaped at the empty passenger cabin .
At the first sign of trouble , the paras had leaped from the aircraft and were at that moment floating serenely towards the earth .
Mickey landed safely to tell the tale .
( Thanks L Miller for these three wonderful stories . )
From P de Bromhead , Dec 2009 :
My late father , who was on Fleet Air Arm Buccaneers , told this story involving a pilot operating on an exchange arrangement from an overseas developing country .
My dad was sat waiting for take - off clearance when he heard the exchange pilot , somewhere , request a ' bearing ' from the ATC ( air traffic controller ) .
This was duly given and after a few minutes a second ' bearing ' was requested .
This was the same as the first and after a third and identical ' bearing ' was requested and given , the ATC asked the exchange pilot if he had any visual references .
The pilot replied that he had a haystack to his starboard side , at which point it transpired that he was lost on the taxi-way .
From S Smith , Nov 2009 :
I was working local control for the runway 25's at LAX one afternoon and a pilot reported a ' flock of seagulls ' on final approach .
Without hesitation , I replied , " Was that the band or the birds ? "
I got absolutely no response from the pilot ...
I guess not everyone has a sense of humor !
And in similar vein , from J Douglass , Nov 2009 :
( December 2007 , Seattle Washington )
Pilot : " Boeing Tower , Cessna 761 Uniform Alpha for a Mercer Departure at Alpha Niner with information X - Ray . "
Tower : " Cessna 761 Uniform Alpha cleared for takeoff , runway 13 right , fly the Mercer departure . "
Pilot : " Cessna 761 Uniform Alpha cleared for takeoff , is rolling . "
45 seconds later ...
Co-Pilot : " Boeing tower , please be advised , there is a flock of seagulls near the south end of runway 13 right at 400 ft . "
Tower : ( singing )
" And I ran , I ran so far away ...
I just ran , I ran all night and day ... I had to get away .. "
Pilot : " Cessna 761 Uniform Alpha has humor ... "
Tower : ( hysterical laughter )
( The lyric incidentally is from the chorus of the 1982 hit song ' I ran ' by A Flock of Seagulls . )
From Chris , Jul 2009 :
This happened at the small but busy Sarasota Florida airport in 1975 .
The tower was open from 6 am until 10 pm and most of the traffic was during daylight hours .
There was a National flight in every night about 8:30 pm and often had a joker at the wheel .
On a particular dark night after handoff from Tampa approach the controller hears : " Sarasota tower , National 123 with you ... ( pause ) ... guess where ?. "
The controller promptly turned off all the airport lights - there was no other traffic - and replied : " National 123 - Sarasota tower - guess where ?... "
After a silence of about fifteen seconds the chastened National pilot came back : " Sarasota tower this is National Airlines flight 123 from Tampa and we are exactley 10.3 DME on the 300 degree radial inbound for landing .. "
The controller switched the lights back on and cleared the pilot to land .
And another from Chris :
As a controller at a small busy airport in Florida , my story is about a student pilot talking to ground on an IFR morning ( IFR means Instrument Flight Rules , necessitated by cloudy skies ) .
At the time the transmission was made , there was an 800 foot ceiling ( of cloud ) with 2 miles visability in a light mist .
Here is the communication - Student pilot : Ground , this is N12345 student pilot , and my instructor wants to know what the height of the ceiling is in the tower .
Ground Controller : Cessna 12345 ...it's about eight - and - a - half feet .
There was then a pause in which both an Eastern pilot and a National pilot made similar comments .
The student pilot came back on the radio .
Student pilot : OK .. my mistake .. what is the reported weather ceiling at this time ?
Ground Controller : 800 overcast ..
R Dillon sent the following , Mar 2009 :
A controller at the Nashville , Tennessee airport told me about an incident from several years ago when he cleared a Cessna 172 ( 4 seater small aircraft ) for landing .
As the Cessna turned to final approach , an airliner called in ' over the marker ' ( 5 miles from the airport ) .
The Cessna was about a half mile from the runway , and the controller knew he could land and clear the runway well before the airliner would land , so he cleared the airliner to land as well .
A few seconds later , the Cessna pilot asked the controller , " How far behind me is that 737 ? "
Before the controller could respond , the airline pilot keyed his mike , and in a deep bass voice said , " Do n't look back !... "
P White , Sep 2008 , sent this fine story , in the longer stories section below
J Mears , Aug 2008 , sent this amusing exchange between pilot and engineer via technical fault report forms ...
We received a fault report from the pilot of an HH - 60 Pave Hawk ( combat search and rescue helicopter ) .
The pilot 's fault report stated , " Pilot 's side seat cushion will not cushion . "
The engineer 's corrective action on the reply form stated " Put pilot on fat boy program ... "
From E Haigh , Mar 2008 - I thought I 'd let you know about a time when I was up in the air doing aeros ( aerobatics ) and turning back into circuit as one of my other friends was coming into land ...
On contact with the runway the friend 's plane veered off to the left and crashed , narrowly avoiding a large very deep pond , just to the left of the runway on the taxi hold point .
The pilot still managed to report : " Runway vacated ... "
The airfield had a fit of the giggles , and happily although the plane was a very mangled write - off , no serious injury was sustained .
From DG , Feb 2008 -
At the initial pilot training bases for the military , the landing pattern tends to get packed ( sometimes up to 12 - 15 airplanes for one runway ) and some of those planes are being flown by students solo ( yes , a $ 4 m piece of tax - payer money being hurled around a strip of concrete at speeds of 200 knots by a 23 - year - old kid fresh out of college with less than 30 hours of flying experience ) .
Anyway , I was sitting a watch in the controlling tower for the runway on a particularly busy day , when one of my buddies from my class , who was flying solo at the time , pipped in with a PIREP ( pilot report ) for the pattern :
Solo : " This is Solo 72 , there is some turbulence at point initial . "
Controller : " Thanks for the warning . "
Some instructor also flying in the pattern : " It 's called wake turbulence . "
( The term ' point initial ' refers to about 3 miles away from the runway , used for preparing landing alignment .
The term ' wake turbulence ' refers to air turbulence caused by other aircraft . )
From ' an aircraft mechanic ' , Jan 2008 - My instructer for My A&P ( Airframe and Powerplant ) training told a funny story from the 1980s ...
He had landed in Egypt to refuel the Gulfstream he was flying .
On take - off he noticed a guard standing in what looked like a refrigator box .
With the the guard behind him my instructer goosed the throtles - which sent the guard head over heels for about 20 yards ...
From Rich , November 2007 ( non-atc folk might want to read the technical explanation first ) -
This allegedly did happen although I was n't on duty during the shift , so I can't verify it .
An F - 4 with a Colonel at the stick was entering the tower pattern at Osan AB , Korea , and wanted priority landing because of his rank and position .
The tower controller was extremely busy recovering mission F - 4s and OV - 10s , not to mention the aircraft who were on final approach with approach control .
The controller sequenced the F - 4 and gave him a point at which to report .
The pilot refused stating that , " It was his airport and he wanted to land , " ( it was n't his airport as he would later learn from a 3 - star and a 1 - star ) .
The control said " ( acft call sign ) , since you can't follow ATC instructions , hold 5 miles north of the airport .
Maintain radio silence unless an emergency condition exists .
Report approaching minimum fuel . "
The reply from the aircraft was , " Roger Tower , we 're number 5 and will report a departure end break . "
The controller did n't escape the situation unscathed .
He had to take a pretty severe chewing out , but there were no more problems like that .
Especially when busy .
And another from Rich -
This is one actually happened on my watch .
Brand new trainee in the facility at a base in North Dakota .
He is scanning the runway with binoculars and tells the local controller that he has a ' dog ' on the runway .
The local controller tells a B - 52 on final , " Go around .
Dog on runway . "
I told the trainee that he might want to let me know what the breed of the dog was , since I had never seen a dog with antlers .
The ' dog ' was a 2000 lb , bull moose .
This guy still takes flak over that one , even though he deserved a save for catching it before the rest of us did .
From Bob Andersen , November 2007 - In November 1996 I was in a Angel Flight Piper Cub going to Tampa International Airport .
I was in there because I got a call from Tampa General Hospital that a heart would be ready for me .
Angel Flight planes are volunteered free of charge to transplant recipients .
The pilot called the tower and told them who we were .
The ATC said we could not land because President Clinton was there and the secret service would not let us land .
( This was just after his California fiasco with his 400 dollar haircut . )
The pilot told the ATC that he would call the press and TV stations and let them know a heart recipient could not land because POTUS ( President Of The United States ) was there .
I think they thought about the bad publicity and said that they would hold him up and let us land , and they would escort us to the hospital .
However we felt that this was not a good idea because of the land traffic wanting to get a glimpse of Clinton , and we so we should use the General Airport instead .
We did so , and I got to the airport and the hospital on time .
As it turned out , the heart was not good , but I waited another few weeks and finally got a heart on Jan 7th .
It was a great heart as you can see I am still alive almost 11 years after the operation .
( My thanks to Bob Andersen - illustrating that persistence , determination , and adaptability can overcome the most daunting obstacles . )
From Dennis Rainwater , October 2007 - I have a ( well , almost ) personal ATC / Pilot conversation I thought I 'd share with you .
I was a weather guy in the USAF during the late 80s - early 90s , and while I was stationed at RAF Woodbridge in England I often hung out with a controller in the tower cab just above our office .
This fellow shared a story with me that he claimed happened to him personally .
I can't vouch 100 % for the authenticity of this tale , but the guy was generally believable ...
Also , a detail or two might be blurred by my own faulty memory over the past 15 - 20 years , but here it goes :
My friend says he was training an ATC rookie - I think he said it was out at Nellis AFB .
Anyway , one day this kid takes a call from an aircraft requesting clearance to FL 800 ( 80,000 feet ) ...
Rookie ( dripping with sarcasm ) : " Okay , hotshot -- if you think you can take her that high , GO FOR IT !! "
Pilot of the SR - 71 on the other end of the radio : " Roger Control ; now DESCENDING from 100,000 feet to FL 800 .... "
From Luke Wray , August 2007 - From NAS
Fallon NV , last week : A recently qualified Clearance Delivery operator was working a moderately busy period when a Navy DC - 9 called , requesting clearance back to NAS Jacksonville , FL .
The controller responded back to the pilot that the flight plan was not in the system .
The controller hammered away at the FDIO with no success .
The next transmission to the DC - 9 was : " VVJV … , clearance , Mam your flight plan is not in the system , would you like to go back to Jax VFR ?
The pilot responded ( while laughing ) " No thanks , we 'll file a flight plan . . "
From Dr Hugh David , June 2007 - Some years ago I was checking the record of simulated air - ground communication in a Real - Time simulation at the Eurocontrol Experimental Centre .
Towards the end of one simulation I came across the following :
French Simulator ' Pilot ' : " AF302 over NTM now . "
German Controller " AF302 Roger .
Report names of stewardesses . "
FSP : " Claudette Colbert and Caroline Chose . "
GC : " Colbert I know , but who is Chose ? "
FSP : " You must know her , she was Alan Delon 's third wife , between Truc and Nimporte ! "
GC : " Ach , these French actors , they marry and unmarry , I cannot keep track ! "
FSP : " Well , at least , the French actors , they marry VIMMEN ! "
... ( long pause ) ...
GC : " AF302 continue descent as planned . "
A story from a friend in BA .
He was overflying Aden , and saw an Aeroflot freighter climbing out .
Heavily accented voice on frequency : " Hey , English , you used to have Aden ? "
BA : " Yes , we did .
Why ? "
HAV : " Ve have had to overnight there , and you can have it back ! "
Light aircraft pilot asked Heathrow for the current cloudbase over Bristol .
London relayed the question to an Air France flight near Bristol and got the reply :
" Ve are at fifteen thousand , in and out the bottom . "
Anonymous voice on frequency : " Vive le sport ! "
Lufhansa Pilot to co-pilot , forgetting that the frequency was open : " We used to come up the Thames , and turn over here for the docks .... "
Voice on frequency : " ACHTUNG SPITFEUR "
Novice female military controller to US bomber leaving radar coverage , forgetting the correct terminology ...
" You are entering my dark area "
USB : " WHOOPEE ! "
Tower Controller : " BA356 , proceed to stand 69 "
BA : " Yes , Sir , Nose in or Nose out ? "
" Mumbai , what number am I in the landing sequence ? "
" By the time you land , sir , you will be number one . "
And ( another ) hoary old chestnut : QANTAS pilot to copilot landing at Sydney , forgetting the cabin intercom was live :
" What I need now is a cold beer and a hot shiela "
Stewardess hurries forward lest worse befall .
Chorus of passengers " Hey , you forgot the beer ! "
( Ack Dr Hugh David for the above )
From Brad White , June 2007 - One to share , from an uncle who was in the USAF until retiring several years ago .
No other attribution unfortunately but here it is .
A near miss occurred outside of Dulles International .
The conversation went along these lines ...
Pilot : " DAMN !
That was close ... "
IAD Tower : " Delta 560 , what seems to be the problem ? "
Pilot ( catching his breath ) , " Near miss - was he ever close ! "
IAD Tower : " Delta 560 , how close was it ? "
Pilot : " Well , I can tell you one thing , it was a white boy flying it . "
From Mitch Reilly , May 2007 - I was listening to the radio , doing a preflight at MSP and heard the following exchange ...
My co-pilot did not hear it and gave me a strange look when I was doubled - over laughing .
' Northwest 605 ' was a DC - 9 .
' Flagship ( Pinnacle ) 5600 ' was a CRJ .
The exchange went like this ...
Northwest 605 : " Northwest 605 request taxi to the active MSP . "
Ground : " Northwest 605 taxi to runway ** , follow the CRJ , you will be number two . "
Northwest 605 : " Roger , we will follow the Smurf - Jet . "
Flagship 5600 : " At least my airplane does not qualify for an AARP membership .. "
( For those who do n't know , AARP is the American Association of Retired Persons , and CRJ stands for Canadair Regional Jet . )
From Andrew Walker , May 2007 - A friend of the family used to fly for US Air , and told us this tale of how one day his plane was one of many trying to land at a busy airport .
One of the controllers came on and reported something happened to cause a further delay and that those planes in a holding pattern would need to stay there .
Almost immediately , one of the pilots responded with , " Bullshit ! "
The controller then said something to the effect of , " Sir , the use of profane language is prohibited on this channel by FAA and FCC regulations .
Please identify yourself . "
After a moment , one of the pilots reported , " This is flight 123 and we are negative on the bullshit . "
A moment after that , another flight reported in , " This is flight 456 and we are also negative on the bullshit . "
One by one , each and every one of the flights reported in as being " negative on the bullshit . "
This from Tom Comeau , April 2007 - My brother is an air traffic controller , and has two favorite conversations he recounts .
One of them I 'm sure is a true story , because I was there when it happened ; the other is completely consistent with his personality .
The first was as a small General Aviation airport in the midwest .
A student doing touch - and - go 's reported flying past some geese on his downwind leg .
The controller responded with " Skipper 3846 Sierra cleared for the option break break attention all aircraft caution watertory migrafowl reported north of the airfield . "
After a pause somebody responded " You mean , like , birds ? "
The controller , without hestitation , replied , " Yes sir ! "
The second was at a commercial airport in Texas .
The controller was trying to deliver a clearance that was mostly " cleared as filed " but with one change at the departure and arrival airport .
After two incorrect readbacks , the frustrated controller blurted out " Okay , that 's enough tries for you .
Let me talk to Beavis . "
( Ack T Comeau )
A huge C - 5 cargo plane was sitting near where a small plane was waiting to take off .
The private pilot got a little nervous because the military plane was closer than normal , and asked the tower to find out the intentions of the C - 5 .
Before the tower could reply , a voice came over the radio as the C - 5's nose cargo doors opened , saying , " I 'm going to eat you . "
( Ack E Scharzmann )
A story from the late 1950's Navy flight training at Corpus Christi , Texas .
Instructors were known to party hard at night , even before a ' hop ' the next morning .
A common ' cure ' was to put on the mask and breathe the pure oxygen while the trainee got the craft airborne .
The SNJ training aircraft had a tandum cockpit with intercom for personal communication between the instructor and the trainee .
These ' private ' communications would be broadcast on air if the intercom switch were accidentally left open .
One such morning following a heavy night for one particular instructor , not long after the flight was aloft , the following was heard over the air : " Boy , am I ever f...ed up this morning . "
After a lengthy pause a young lady air traffic controller demanded : " Aircraft making that last transmission , please identify yourself . "
There was an even lengthier pause , and then a voice said : " Lady , I 'm not that f...ed up . " ( Ack Mike )
In 1958 , I was bouncing down the runway trying to land in a big cross-wind when the instructor said " I trust we will be landing soon , because my medical permit expires next Tuesday . "
The same year , I was flying a Navy SNB ( C - 45 ) and the instructor began laughing as he read the squawk sheet from the previous flight .
It said : " Order heater for co-pilot 's seat . " ( Ack E Pisor )
The Stapleton runways were so close together that aircraft on parallel runways had to see each other and provide visual separation before Control could issue an approach clearance .
Commonly when pilots were asked if had they had traffic in sight they would lazily respond with , " I see some lights , " which , frustratingly , did not meet requirements for approach clearance .
One very busy night a particular crew would not report the traffic in sight .
Finally the pilot said , " I see some lights over there . "
The controller responded in a vexed tone , " Is there an aircraft attached to those lights ? "
Laughing , the pilot responded , " Why I do believe there is .
Thanks we have the aircraft in sight . "
For that crew at least , the point was made .
( Ack P Davied )
United cargo jet ( with female pilot ) : " This is my secondary radio .
Is my transmission still fuzzy ?
Oakland ARTCC controller : " I do n't know .
I 've never seen it . "
( Earned him two weeks on the beach ) ( Ack ' a former ATC ' )
After being informed by a pilot cleared to land in Fayetteville that he now had two light aircraft cleared to land on opposite ends of the same runway , the controller paused and transmitted " Y' all be careful now . "
( Ack ' a former ATC ' - he says this is true , he heard the tape . )
One very stormy morning in BOS , many planes were lined up on taxiways waiting for departure .
A female pilot made a successful landing on a crossing runway after visibly wrestling her Flying Tiger stretched DC - 8 through turbulence and blustery snow squalls , fighting it right down to the runway .
An anonymous voice : " But can you park it ? " ( Ack ' a former ATC ' )
A newly promoted Military Liaison Officer was standing the morning watch at Oakland ARTCC .
His former controller team mates sent an assistant to the front desk , requesting permission from the new MLO to start the ' wind tunnels ' at Moffett NAS ( there were n't any of course ) .
Not wanting to appear ignorant , the MLO granted the request .
After notifying the front desk a short time later that there were reports of severe to extreme turbulence in the vicinity of San Carlos , Palo Alto and San Jose airports , the controllers watched in glee as the rookie supervisor grabbed the ' hot phone ' and bellowed to the watch supervisor at Moffett ( and through the loudspeakers at every other ATC facility in Oakland 's area ) , " This is the Oakland Center Supervisor and I 'm ordering you to immediately shut off that f...ing fan ! "
( Ack ' a former ATC ' )
A young , newly checked out local controller at Logan Airport granted the request of a Trans Portuguese " 707 " to use non-active 15 R ( the longest runway ) for departure and cleared the plane to " taxi into position and hold " .
Seeing what he thought was a short pause coming in crossing operations , he told the crew to " Be ready and spool ' em up ! "
The old " oil burner " sat on the runway with fire walled engines belching clouds of black smoke over nearby neighborhoods for many minutes .
Only when the ground controller announced that airport fire apparatus was responding to a major fire in East Boston did anyone in the tower realize that the rookie ( now stirring his newly poured coffee ) had forgotten the plane and everything from Orient Heights to the Mystic River Bridge had disappeared in his exhaust .
( Ack ' a former ATC ' )
A military pilot had been having difficulty with smooth landings and the crew was required to make note of the exact time the plane landed at different bases .
One particular landing took several bounces before staying on the ground .
The crew reportedly called up to the pilot , " Which landing shall we note for the record , Sir ? " ( Ack A & M Martin )
the ' Fudpucker ' ATC quotes
The earliest reference I have seen for at least some of these quotes in the column below is the seemingly now defunct spoof ' Fudpucker World Airlines ' website dating back to June 1996 ( thanks Scott ) .
Fudpucker World Airlines ( whose business I am not entirely sure of ) and associated merchandise apparently date back to the 1970s ( thanks D Kennedy ) .
When and if I have more detail I will post it here .
If you were a ' Fudpacker passenger ' and can help clarify the history and especially the origins of the funny quotes which appeared on the Fudpucker website , please let me know .
Tower : " Delta 351 , you have traffic at 10 o'clock , 6 miles ! "
Delta 351 : " Give us another hint !
We have digital watches ! "
" TWA 2341 , for noise abatement turn right 45 Degrees . "
" Centre , we are at 35,000 feet .
How much noise can we make up here ? "
" Sir , have you ever heard the noise a 747 makes when it hits a 727 ? "
From an unknown aircraft waiting in a very long takeoff queue : " I'm f...ing bored ! "
Ground Traffic Control : " Last aircraft transmitting , identify yourself immediately ! "
Unknown aircraft : " I said I was f... ing bored , not f...ing stupid ! "
Control tower to a 747 : " United 329 heavy , your traffic is a Fokker , one o'clock , three miles , Eastbound . "
United 239 : " Approach , I 've always wanted to say this ... I 've got the little Fokker in sight . "
A DC - 10 had come in a little hot and thus had an exceedingly long roll out after touching down .
San Jose
Tower noted : " American 751 , make a hard right turn at the end of the runway , if you are able .
If you are not able , take the Guadalupe exit off Highway 101 , make a right at the lights and return to the airport . "
A military pilot called for a priority landing because his single - engine jet fighter was running " a bit peaked . "
Air Traffic
Control told the fighter pilot that he was number two , behind a B - 52 that had one engine shut down .
" Ah , " the fighter pilot remarked , " The dreaded seven - engine approach . "
Allegedly , a Pan Am 727 flight waiting for start clearance in Munich overheard the following :
Lufthansa ( in German ) : " Ground , what is our start clearance time ? "
Ground ( in English ) : " If you want an answer you must speak in English . "
Lufthansa ( in English ) : " I am a German , flying a German airplane , in Germany .
Why must I speak English ? "
Unknown voice from another plane ( in a beautiful British accent ) : " Because you lost the bloody war . "
Tower : " Eastern 702 , cleared for takeoff , contact Departure on frequency 124.7 "
Eastern 702 : " Tower , Eastern 702 switching to Departure .
By the way , after we lifted off we saw some kind of dead animal on the far end of the runway . "
Tower : " Continental 635 , cleared for takeoff behind Eastern 702 , contact Departure on frequency 124.7 .
Did you copy that report from Eastern 702 ? "
Continental 635 : " Continental 635 , cleared for takeoff , roger ; and yes , we copied Eastern ... we 've already notified our caterers . "
One day the pilot of a Cherokee 180 was told by the tower to hold short of the active runway while a DC - 8 landed .
The DC - 8 landed , rolled out , turned around , and taxied back past the Cherokee .
Some quick - witted comedian in the DC - 8 crew got on the radio and said , " What a cute little plane .
Did you make it all by yourself ? "
The Cherokee pilot , not about to let the insult go by , came back with a real zinger : " I made it out of DC - 8 parts .
Another landing like yours and I 'll have enough for another one . "
Allegedly the German air controllers at Frankfurt Airport are renowned as a short - tempered lot .
They , it is alleged , not only expect one to know one 's gate parking location , but how to get there without any assistance from them .
So it was with some amusement that we ( a Pan Am 747 ) listened to the following exchange between Frankfurt ground control and a British Airways 747 , call sign Speedbird 206 .
Speedbird 206 : " Frankfurt , Speedbird 206 clear of active runway . "
Ground : " Speedbird 206 . Taxi to gate Alpha One - Seven . "
The BA 747 pulled onto the main taxiway and slowed to a stop .
Ground : " Speedbird , do you not know where you are going ? "
Speedbird 206 : " Stand by , Ground , I 'm looking up our gate location now . "
Ground ( with quite arrogant impatience ) : " Speedbird 206 , have you not been to Frankfurt before ? "
Speedbird 206 ( coolly ) : " Yes , twice in 1944 , but it was dark , ... and I did n't land . "
Allegedly , while taxiing at London 's Gatwick Airport , the crew of a US Air flight departing for Ft. Lauderdale made a wrong turn and came nose to nose with a United 727 .
An irate female ground controller lashed out at the US Air crew , screaming : " US Air 2771 , where the hell are you going ?!
I told you to turn right onto Charlie taxiway !
You turned right on Delta !
Stop right there .
I know it 's difficult for you to tell the difference between C and D , but get it right ! "
Continuing her rage to the embarrassed crew , she was now shouting hysterically : " God !
Now you 've screwed everything up !
It 'll take forever to sort this out !
You stay right there and do n't move till I tell you to !
You can expect progressive taxi instructions in about half an hour and I want you to go exactly where I tell you , when I tell you , and how I tell you !
You got that , US Air 2771 ? " US Air 2771 : " Yes , ma'am , " the humbled crew responded .
Naturally , the ground control communications frequency fell terribly silent after the verbal bashing of US Air 2771 .
Nobody wanted to chance engaging the irate ground controller in her current state of mind .
Tension in every cockpit out around Gatwick was definitely running high .
Just then an unknown pilot broke the silence and keyed his microphone , asking : " Was n't I married to you once ? "
( Technical explanation background for Rich 's story :
When fighters enter the VFR ( Visual Flight Rules ) Traffic pattern they come in at a higher altitude and are n't flying the traditional rectangular traffic pattern .
There two reporting points : Initial - which is generally a position entering the traffic pattern and lined up with the runway - and Break - which is the point over the approach end of the runway at which the pilot begins a descending 360 - degree turn back to the final approach course .
If a controller needs to space the aircraft out to maintain separation , he / she can specify a position at which the pilot should break .
IE : Break midfield ( the middle of the runway ) or Break Departure End ( the departure end of the runway ) .
The approach end of the runway is the end that is most nearly aligned to the wind direction and indicates the direction of arrival and departure .
The departure end is the opposite end of that runway .
If you ever have any questions about ATC procedure or traffic pattern things , you can google FAAH 7110.65 and look in the pilot - controller glossary or download the entire manual in PDF .

longer atc /aviation stories
The following excellent tale ( thanks P White ) is a longer story than the quick atc quotes above .
It provides the opportunity to invite other similar submissions of air traffic control and aviation stories .
If you have an entertaining or amusing story from the world of flying and air traffic communications , please send it .
From P White , 17 Sep 2008 :
One of my ' older retired ' friends , Andy , used to fly Avro Ansons during the war ...
Shortly after VE day ( Victory in Europe , 8 May 1945 ) he was instructed to fly some high ranking officials , including many officers of Air Commode ( Commodore ) rank , and various other ' shinies ' of brigadier and above , to the KG200 airfield at Gatow ( Berlin ) .
Andy was flying from England , and as fuel was limited to the exact gallon , he made a careful note of the fuel required .
In this case it was a near full tank to get there and would allow for a straight in approach .
So , flight planned , he checked the weather report , which indicated slight change of fog , and set off .
To conserve fuel , careful engine management was vital .
Upon approaching the border of Germany he radioed to the airfield met office and asked for the weather report .
The operator indicated he was covering for the officer in charge , and read out the weather report for the airfield .
As Andy approached Berlin airspace he could see fog but no airfield .
He descended with caution and asked the controller to talk him in .
The instructions were precise .
He wound down the landing gear , deployed landing flaps , and heard the ATC 's last comment , ' good luck ' .
The instructions , however , were not precise enough : he could see the airfield lights away at 10 o'clock position .
Realising the fuel gauges needles were all on empty he slammed the throttle and pulled the Anson round hard .
Under the sudden change of direction
Andy noted the groans from the Anson 's airframe , and also from the Air Commodes in the back .
The aircraft was pulled around - no time to line up - just plant the wheels and line up after .
About ten feet before the wheels touched down the engines cut out .
I saw the entry in his pilot 's log : ' Engines cut on approach - shinies spilled soup on uniform - towed off runway ... "
As soon the aircraft halted , Andy and all the shinies went to the met office , to interrogate the officer in charge .
What they found was an erk covering , who had no knowledge of met operations , and who had n't even looked out of the window to warn aircraft of the fog .
He was reading the weather report from the local newspaper .
No joke , all the comments were clearly detailed in the pilot 's log .
Could have been a very different story of course .
The morale of the tale - always look out the window when reporting the local weather - never use the Berlin Times printed the day before .

aircraft maintenance engineers ' gripe sheets ' or ' squawk reports ' comments
These aircraft maintenance comments are allegedly from ' gripe sheets ' or ' squawk reports ' which contain pilots ' reports of aircraft technical problems and the responses from maintenance engineers .
Various origins are suggested for these funny quotes , most popularly Qantas and the US Air Force , and more specifically Embry - Riddle Aeronautical University ( thanks J Williams ) .
The earliest reference I have seen for at least some of these quotes is the seemingly now defunct spoof ' Fudpucker World Airlines ' , dating back to June 1996 ( thanks Scott ) .
When and if I have more detail I will post it here .
If you were a ' fudpacker passenger ' and can help clarify the history , please let me know .
That said , it is unlikely that all these comments are from a single original source , especially given the mixture of technology featured , and given that some are probably military and others not .
This is not an attempt to present a factually reliable or accurate listing of these alleged quotes , if one ever existed at all - it 's just a list of the funniest examples .
If you know the true origins of any of these - or if you were an original ' Fudpacker passenger ' - please let me know .
These amusing communications illustrate the implications of using vague language , as well as the age - old potential for conflict and confusion between operational departments and functions , and the long - suffering tolerance of service and maintenance staff in support of operational personnel found in all industries .

another amusing gripe sheet story
My thanks to M Savage for this story .
It provides an interesting example of managing a working environment , and notably the expectations / attitudes / habits of others .
The tactic is not necessarily transferable everywhere , but offers the idea that sometimes a bit of humour and creativity can be a very effective intervention in changing behaviour and reconditioning attitudes :
While stationed with the USMC ( United States Marine Corps ) at Cherry Point , North Carolina , back in the the 1960s , I worked in a Headquarters Squadron that had three C - 117s ( a military version of the DC - 3 ) .
One of these aircraft had an unusual radio configuration that incorporated several circuit breakers on the bulkhead behind the pilot 's head .
Why ?
Who knows !
But unfortunately we continually had many flights cancelled because of reports that the radios did n't work .
Well , the radios worked fine but some of the pilots refused to familiarize themselves with the airplane and perform proper pre-flight inspections .
So they never turned on the radio circuit breakers .
After signing off about fifty gripes by saying " no problem found " , I did something one day that cured the problem ..
I signed off the aircraft yellow gripe sheet with the following comment : " Short between the pilot 's headset " .
This was an obvious comment on the deficiency of brain matter in the pilot 's head .
Well , that got me chewed out royally by the squadron maintenance officer , who I was told later had laughed uncontrollably after I left his office .
The problem was solved though , because the negligent pilots were made the butt of so much teasing that nobody again forgot to turn on those circuit breakers .
( Thanks M Savage , former USMC Sergeant and later a long - time commercial pilot and flight instructor - 24 Sep 2010 )

Insiders Remain Greatest Security Threat
Workers and other insiders admit to risky behavior -- such as accessing corporate e-mail from Wi -Fi hotspots -- in a survey by security firm RSA .
The people inside an organization represent its greatest security risk .
That 's according to a report ( pdf ) released on Monday by RSA , the security division of enterprise storage company EMC .
RSA said that the survey was fielded in November and consisted of 126 person - on - the - street interviews ( using questionnaires ) of government and corporate office workers in Boston and Washington , D.C .
" The findings of the survey underscore that the threat posed to data by well - meaning insiders -- employees , contractors , suppliers , partners , visitors , and consultants who have physical and / or logical access to organizational assets -- greatly broadens that posed by malicious insiders who deliberately leak sensitive data for personal financial gain or other criminal purposes , " the report states .
The recent 2007 SANS Top 20 , a list of the year 's most significant security risks , also noted that computer users tended to be the weakest link in the computer security chain .
What sort of risky behavior are office workers engaging in ?
Some 52 % said they sometimes or frequently accessed work - related e-mail via a public computer , such as a might be found at a Internet cafe , hotel , or airport .
And 56 % sometimes or frequently accessed work - related e-mail through a wireless hotspot .
Asked , " Have you ever lost a laptop , smartphone , and / or USB flash drive with corporate information on it ? " , 8 % said they had .
And 63 % of respondents indicated that they sometimes or frequently send corporate documents to a personal e-mail address in order to work on them at home .
While the RSA report suggests that additional security technology can mitigate these risks -- RSA is in the business of selling such things , after all -- it also acknowledges that the blame for users ' disregarding security policies belongs in part with the creators of those policies .
" Organizations can mitigate this risk by developing information - centric policies that acknowledge and align with the needs and realities of the business , " the report says .
" Once such policies are in place , companies should constantly measure actual user behavior against established policy and use what they learn to inform smart policy changes that minimize risk and maximize business productivity .
When security is as convenient as possible for end users , they are less likely to work around security policy . "
And the fact is that for many workers , corporate security policies are either not convenient or are poorly understood .
About 35 % of respondents said that they felt they needed to work around corporate security policies to get their jobs done .
Sam Curry , VP of product management at RSA , said that the survey respondents were " innocent people working hard to do their jobs " and risks arising from their willful or accidental contravention of corporate policy were n't the product of malice .
" Security procedures need to be in touch with the realities of human behavior , " he said .
Curry stressed the need for user education , to make workers aware of the consequences of their actions .
And he also said that organizations needed tools to monitor employee behavior to understand the gaps between policy and worker behavior .
Said Curry , " Organizations need visibility into how people actually behave . "

WASHINGTON — Has America become a mean , ungenerous , cramped and crabby nation , a deeply insecure colossus — one that just might be taking all those Viagra , Apcalis and Cialis commercials a bit too personally ?
Is the country desperate to find scapegoats to blame for a perceived decline in , um , vigor ?
Or is America still a confident land of hope and promise , a place still potent with possibility ?
It ’s watching the Republicans in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail that makes me pose those sweeping questions .
I ’m just suggesting a context for assessing the actions and rhetoric of a party that seems to be in the throes of andropause .
That ’s the popularly accepted term for “ male menopause , ” which medical dictionaries tend to describe as a “ purported ” syndrome rather than an actual clinical diagnosis .
I ’m not qualified to offer an opinion on whether dads go through a Y - chromosome version of what used to be euphemistically called the “ change of life . ”
But I think the “ Daddy Party ” has been presenting clear symptoms .
The latest was the Senate vote Wednesday in which Republicans , supported by a handful of red-state Democrats , narrowly scuttled the Dream Act , a bill that would have provided a path to U.S. citizenship for some young undocumented immigrants — but only those who did everything this country once found worthy and admirable in pursuit of the American Dream .
Under the proposal , men and women who fulfilled several conditions — they had to be under 30 , had to have been brought into the country illegally when they were younger than 16 , had to have been in the United States for at least five years and had to be graduates of U.S. high schools — would have been given conditional legal status .
If they went on to complete two years of college or two years of military service , they would have been eligible for permanent residency .
Let ’s see .
Here was a way to encourage a bunch of kids to go to college rather than melt into the shadows as off - the - books day laborers — or maybe even gang members .
And here was a way to boost enlistment in our overtaxed armed forces .
Are n’t education and global competitiveness supposed to be vital issues ?
Are n’t we fighting open - ended wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ?
The vote against the Dream Act was so irrational , so counterproductive , that it seemed the product of some sort of hormonal imbalance .
“ I do not believe we should reward illegal behavior , ” sniffed Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Ky. , who led the successful fight to kill the measure .
But the potential beneficiaries of the Dream Act did n’t do anything illegal ; it was their parents who made the decision to come here without papers .
The real reason for denying at least 1 million young people the opportunity to make this nation stronger is that illegal immigration is the scourge du jour .
Undocumented immigrants are convenient scapegoats for perceived American decline , convenient targets for the unfocused anger that Republicans seem to believe their constituents feel — the sense that “ they , ” whoever they might be , are taking something away from “ us . ”
George W. Bush ’s veto of the bill reauthorizing the popular State Children ’s Health Insurance Program — an action backed up by loyal House Republicans — had the same defensive , bitter sense of we ’ll - show - them - a - thing - or - two .
The Republican Party has to be aware of the polls showing how concerned Americans are about the health insurance crisis .
They have to be betting that the act of saying no — in what looked like a fit of andropausal pique — would play better with voters , perhaps subliminally .
And just listen to the Republican candidates ’ rhetoric about our great nation ’s place in the world .
With the exception of Ron Paul , every one of them agrees that America is under siege , molested not only by dangerous bands of Islamic terrorists — which is true — but also by sovereign nations such as Iran , China and Russia that have had the temerity to pursue what they see as their own national interests .
Which is a bizarre way of looking at foreign relations .
The solution , according to the Republican presidential hopefuls , is n’t give - and - take negotiation .
It ’s chest - thumping .
It ’s a series of declarations about what we will find “ acceptable ” and what we wo n’t .
Maybe this is calculated ; maybe they ’ve decided that national security is the only issue that gives any of them a chance against any Democrat in 2008 .
But I think they ’re badly misreading the country .
I think this is still fundamentally a hopeful , generous nation , aware of both its challenges and its strengths .

SEE !?

See how he did that !?
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Motors , no stranger to hard times and red ink , still managed to shock Wednesday when it reported an operating loss more than 11 times larger than expected and a $ 39 billion charge that was among the biggest profit hits ever reported .
The nation 's No. 1 automaker , which was hit with a soft U.S. auto market and a two - day strike by the United Auto Workers union during the quarter , lost $ 1.6 billion , or $ 2.80 a share , excluding special items .
GM posted a huge $ 39 billion loss in the third quarter due to accounting charges , even as its global auto operations reported a profit .
Photos GM 's plan to outmaneuver Toyota View photos How General Motors will use its eight U.S. brands to to attack and outflank competitors and take back market share .
That compares to the forecast of a 25 - cent - a - share loss from analysts surveyed by earnings tracker Thomson First Call and earnings per share of $ 497 million , or 88 cents , on that basis in the year - earlier period .
Among the problems hurting GM results was a $ 2.3 billion loss in the home loan business at GMAC due to problems from the meltdown in subprime mortgages .
GM sold a majority of GMAC but still owns 49 percent of the lender .
In addition , GM took a huge charge in the quarter related to the writedown of tax credits for losses over the last three years .
That caused it to post a net loss of $ 39 billion , or $ 68.85 a share , for the third quarter , compared with the net loss of $ 147 million , or 26 cents a share , in the year - earlier period .
Only a gain from the sale of the Allison Transmission unit stopped the loss from being worse .
The report caused shares of Dow component GM ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) to be down 5 percent in midday trading , helping to spark a 200 - point selloff .
To put the size of the charge in context , the total value of all GM shares outstanding was only $ 20.4 billion at the close of trading Tuesday .
In addition , the charge is significantly larger than the $ 12.4 billion net loss posted by GM for all of 2005 and 2006 , when the company was hammered by falling shares and labor costs far in excess of its nonunion rivals .
The company had net income of $ 953 million for the first six months of the year before hitting the problems in the third quarter .
The charge was a non-cash expense due to accounting rules , meaning it wo n't drain resources from the company 's balance sheet .
But the charge , which was revealed late Tuesday , raised concerns among investors that the automaker would n't be able to earn enough money going forward , despite winning a new cost - saving labor deal from the UAW , to fully utilize the tax credits it built up from losses the last three years .
Efraim Levy , equity analyst with Standard & Poor's , cut his recommendation on the stock Wednesday to a " sell " from a " hold . "
" Looking at the near term outlook , there 's more negatives than positives , " said Levy .
" The downgrade is n't because of the writedown .
But I think it does signal a worsening outlook , that the level of profitability and the ability to use these tax benefits wo n't be there in the near term the way they would have liked .
It bodes poorly on the outlook . "
The company 's statement about the charge said that it " does not reflect a change in the company 's view of its long - term automotive financial outlook . "
But it also cautioned " the company faces more challenging near - term automotive market conditions in the U.S. and Germany . "
In a television interview early Wednesday , GM Chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner said he is confident the company is in better position to earn money going forward and utilize the tax credits .
He said it needed to take the writedown at this point to comply with strict accounting rules .
" I would n't read anything into it [ the charge ] for the prospects for the company , " he told CNBC .
But both he and Chief Financial Officer Fritz Henderson admitted that the outlook for U.S. auto sales are sluggish going forward , and Henderson said that he could n't say when the mortgage business would stop losing money .
Henderson cited other problems that continue to dog GM 's financial performance in North America , including the strength of the Canadian dollar , which made importing parts and vehicles from Canada to the United States more expensive , a strong run-up in the price of steel and other metal used in cars and weak U.S. sales industrywide , which he said he now expects to continue into 2008 .
" We like our business but the U.S. business is challenging , " said Henderson .
" We 're not signaling significant weakness from where we 've been , just that it will continue .
At this point you have to say the outlook for the mortgage business is challenging . "
Kevin Tynan , auto analyst with Argus Research , a long - time critic of GM who raised his recommendation to a short - term " buy " from a " sell " after the labor deal , said he 's disappointed in this report but that he 's not going to change his recommendation .
" Every time I do this , when I try to capture some move to the upside , it kicks me in the teeth , " he said .
" But I still think at $ 34 or $ 35 a share , it 's a pretty good bargain . "
But he maintains a long - term sell recommendation on the stock , saying the company has not been making aggressive enough cuts in its capacity to adjust for its weakening market share .
As huge as they were , GM 's charge and loss Wednesday were not the largest in corporate history .
Time Warner ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , then known as AOL Time Warner , lost $ 98.7 billion in 2002 , driven largely by charges related to the writedown in value of the company after a 2001 merger .
CNNMoney.com is a unit of Time Warner .
In 2001 , telecom equipment maker JDS Uniphase ( Charts ) lost $ 56.1 billion , driven mostly by special charges .
GM 's previous company record loss came in 1992 , when a $ 20.8 billion charge resulted in a $ 23.5 billion loss for the year .
Ironically , that earlier charge was related to the company 's accounting for the future cost of retiree health care at that time .
Those health care costs , which have since grown to more than $ 50 billion , are in the process of being shifted to a union - controlled trust fund which was agreed to in a break - through labor agreement reached in the last week of this most recent quarter .
This was supposed to be the point at which GM was turning the corner after more than two years of troubles .
It reported record global automotive sales , and had halted the decline in U.S. market share even as industrywide sales were soft .
GM also reached a new labor agreement with the United Auto Workers , after a two - day strike at its U.S. plants , that should save the company billions of dollars going forward and make it more competitive with nonunion rivals .
GM results showed that worldwide , its automotive operations earned $ 122 million from continuing operations , excluding special items , in the quarter .
That was an improvement from the loss of $ 455 million on that basis in the year - earlier period .
But those auto earnings were from the company 's overseas auto operations .
Its core North American auto unit still lost $ 247 million in the quarter , excluding special items .
That 's an improvement from the $ 660 million it lost on that basis a year earlier , although it 's worse than the narrow profit GM reported in North America in the period .
Revenue from auto sales rose to $ 43.1 billion from $ 39.6 billion a year earlier .
That topped First Call 's revenue forecast of $ 40.3 billion .
The automaker sold a record 2.39 million cars and trucks worldwide in the quarter , enough to edge back in front of Toyota Motor in the race to be the world 's largest automaker in terms of vehicle sold .
Earlier Wednesday , GM rival Toyota Motor ( Charts ) , which had been hit by sluggish sales in its two most important markets , Japan and the United States , nevertheless reported profit rose 11 percent and raised its earnings forecast for the full year .
Ford Motor ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , which lost its long - held title of No. 2 U.S. automaker to Toyota this year , is due to report results Thursday .
It is also forecast to report an operating loss .
AS our anti-democratic president declares himself satisfied with Musharraf 's promises to remove his uniform and allow the January elections he 's suspended to proceed sometime in February , the democratic process in Pakistan is still actively trying to gain ground with Pakistanis continuing to launch protests against their autocratic ruler .
Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People 's Party has continued to protest Musharraf 's imposition of emergency rule and are actively submitting themselves to arrest , even as their leader was ordered under house arrest yesterday for the second time in four days to prevent her from leading protests against the U.S. supported strongman .
The latest order for her detention at home came after Ms. Bhutto came out with an unequivocal call for Musharraf to step down and announced plans for a three - day , cross -country protest convoy .
" I think it 's time for Gen. Musharraf to leave , " Bhutto told NPR .
" Ever since he took power , he has failed to build a democratic base .
He said he would restore true democracy , but all he has done was twice impose martial law . "
Many of her supporters have already begun the banned procession , despite the police barricading of Bhutto 's neighborhood .
The initial excuse from Pakistani authorities for the barricade was that they had obtained intelligence of another assassination attempt on her .
The obvious result of the barricade , however , was the stifling of opposition to Musharraf 's tyranny in arresting and detaining his political opponents and his suspension of the Pakistani press .
Apparently , leaders of the governing party have been allowed to hold rallies , despite the state of emergency , without any similar interference from the government enforcers who have denied Ms. Bhutto her freedom of movement and her ability to organize her opposition .
With Bhutto's open and direct declaration that Musharraf should resign , there is now the prospect that she will align with other opposition groups in challenging his self - imposed rule .
There was earlier speculation that she might join with Musharraf and share power , but , in a statement on Geo TV , Bhutto said , " I could not serve as prime minister with Gen. Musharraf as president . . .
I will not be able to work with Gen.
Musharraf because I simply wo n't be able to believe anything he says to me . "
So , here we are , with our lame - duck imperialist showing no sign of pulling back or even threatening to limit the millions of our tax dollars which support the power - grabbing general in his dictatorship .
Where is the concern from this White House for the democratic process in Pakistan they 've given so much lip service to ?
All of the influence of Bush 's office is invested in maintaining their political ally in power , despite the growing unpopularity of Musharraf in Pakistan and despite his undeniably anti-democratic actions .
There has been no threat of any sanction at all from the administration in protest of Musharraf 's denial of democracy and against his open coup of Pakistan 's democratic institutions .
The most disturbing aspect of Musharraf 's crackdown is his equating of his suppression of protests from his political opposition to a fight against ' Islamic militants ' .
A statement issued by the UN Human Rights Council expressed concern over that linkage .
“ We condemn the retaliation measures , including the abuse of the notion of terrorism , against those who are expressing their dissent against the imposition of the state of emergency , " the statement said .

Thousands of " the detained and the disappeared " were imprisoned in the stadium following the Washington - backed coup by General Pinochet against the democracy of Salvador Allende on September 11 1973 .
For the majority people of Latin America , the abandonados , the infamy and historical lesson of the first " 9/11 " have never been forgotten .
" In the Allende years , we had a hope the human spirit would triumph , " said Roberto .
" But in Latin America those believing they are born to rule behave with such brutality to defend their rights , their property , their hold over society that they approach true fascism .
People who are well - dressed , whose houses are full of food , bang pots in the streets in protest as though they do n't have anything .
This is what we had in Chile 36 years ago .
This is what we see in Venezuela today .
It is as if Chávez is Allende .
It is so evocative for me . "
In making my film The War on Democracy , I sought the help of Chileans like Roberto and his family , and Sara de Witt , who courageously returned with me to the torture chambers at Villa Grimaldi , which she somehow survived .
Together with other Latin Americans who knew the tyrannies , they bear witness to the pattern and meaning of the propaganda and lies now aimed at undermining another epic bid to renew both democracy and freedom on the continent .
The disinformation that helped destroy Allende and give rise to Pinochet 's horrors worked the same in Nicaragua , where the Sandinistas had the temerity to implement modest , popular reforms .
In both countries , the CIA funded the leading opposition media , although they need not have bothered .
In Nicaragua , the fake martyrdom of La Prensa became a cause for North America 's leading liberal journalists , who seriously debated whether a poverty - stricken country of 3 million peasants posed a " threat " to the United States .
Ronald Reagan agreed and declared a state of emergency to combat the monster at the gates .
In Britain , whose Thatcher government " absolutely endorsed " US policy , the standard censorship by omission applied .
In examining 500 articles that dealt with Nicaragua in the early 1980s , the historian Mark Curtis found an almost universal suppression of the achievements of the Sandinista government - " remarkable by any standards " - in favour of the falsehood of " the threat of a communist takeover " .
The similarities in the campaign against the phenomenal rise of popular democratic movements today are striking .
Aimed principally at Venezuela , especially Chávez , the virulence of the attacks suggests that something exciting is taking place ; and it is .
Thousands of poor Venezuelans are seeing a doctor for the first time in their lives , having their children immunised and drinking clean water .
New universities have opened their doors to the poor , breaking the privilege of competitive institutions effectively controlled by a " middle class " in a country where there is no middle .
In barrio La Línea , Beatrice Balazo told me her children were the first generation of the poor to attend a full day 's school .
" I have seen their confidence blossom like flowers , " she said .
One night in barrio La Vega , in a bare room beneath a single lightbulb , I watched Mavis Mendez , aged 94 , learn to write her own name for the first time .
More than 25,000 communal councils have been set up in parallel to the old , corrupt local bureaucracies .
Many are spectacles of raw grassroots democracy .
Spokespeople are elected , yet all decisions , ideas and spending have to be approved by a community assembly .
In towns long controlled by oligarchs and their servile media , this explosion of popular power has begun to change lives in the way Beatrice described .
It is this new confidence of Venezuela 's " invisible people " that has so inflamed those who live in suburbs called country club .
Behind their walls and dogs , they remind me of white South Africans .
Venezuela 's wild west media is mostly theirs ; 80 % of broadcasting and almost all the 118 newspaper companies are privately owned .
Until recently one television shock jock liked to call Chávez , who is mixed race , a " monkey " .
Front pages depict the president as Hitler , or as Stalin ( the connection being that both like babies ) .
Among broadcasters crying censorship loudest are those bankrolled by the National Endowment for Democracy , the CIA in spirit if not name .
" We had a deadly weapon , the media , " said an admiral who was one of the coup plotters in 2002 .
The TV station , RCTV , never prosecuted for its part in the attempt to overthrow the elected government , lost only its terrestrial licence and is still broadcasting on satellite and cable .
Yet , as in Nicaragua , the " treatment " of RCTV is a cause celebre for those in Britain and the US affronted by the sheer audacity and popularity of Chávez , whom they smear as " power crazed " and a " tyrant " .
That he is the authentic product of a popular awakening is suppressed .
Even the description of him as a " radical socialist " , usually in the pejorative , wilfully ignores the fact that he is a nationalist and social democrat , a label many in Britain 's Labour party were once proud to wear .
In Washington , the old Iran - Contra death squad gang , back in power under Bush , fear the economic bridges Chávez is building in the region , such as the use of Venezuela 's oil revenue to end IMF slavery .
That he maintains a neoliberal economy , described by the American Banker as " the envy of the banking world " is seldom raised as valid criticism of his limited reforms .
These days , of course , any true reforms are exotic .
And as liberal elites under Blair and Bush fail to defend their own basic liberties , they watch the very concept of democracy as a liberal preserve challenged on a continent about which Richard Nixon once said " people do n't give a shit " .
However much they play the man , Chávez , their arrogance cannot accept that the seed of Rousseau 's idea of direct popular sovereignty may have been planted among the poorest , yet again , and " the hope of the human spirit " , of which Roberto spoke in the stadium , has returned .
· The War on Democracy , directed by Christopher Martin and John Pilger , will be shown on ITV on Monday at 11 pm .

ADHD and Children Who Are Gifted .
ERIC Digest # 522 .
Howard 's teachers say he just is n't working up to his ability .
He does n't finish his assignments , or just puts down answers without showing his work ; his handwriting and spelling are poor .
He sits and fidgets in class , talks to others , and often disrupts class by interrupting others .
He used to shout out the answers to the teachers ' questions ( they were usually right ) , but now he daydreams a lot and seems distracted .
Does Howard have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) , is he gifted , or both ?
Frequently , bright children have been referred to psychologists or pediatricians because they exhibited certain behaviors ( e.g. , restlessness , inattention , impulsivity , high activity level , day - dreaming ) commonly associated with a diagnosis of ADHD .
Formally , the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM - III - R ) ( American Psychiatric Association ) lists 14 characteristics that may be found in children diagnosed as having ADHD .
At least 8 of these characteristics must be present , the onset must be before age 7 , and they must be present for at least six months .
DSM -III-R DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR ATTENTION -DEFICIT
HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER
Note : DSM - III -R Diagnostic Criteria For Attention - Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder reprinted with permission from the " Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , " Third Edition , Revised , Washington , DC , American Psychiatric Association , 1987 .
1 . Often fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat ( in adolescents may be limited to subjective feelings of restlessness ) .
2 . Has difficulty remaining seated when required to .
3 . Is easily distracted by extraneous stimuli .
4 . Has difficulty awaiting turns in games or group situations .
5 . Often blurts out answers to questions before they have been completed .
6 . Has difficulty following through on instructions from others ( not due to oppositional behavior or failure of comprehension ) .
7 . Has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities .
8 . Often shifts from one uncompleted activity to another .
9 . Has difficulty playing quietly .
10 .
Often talks excessively .
11 . Often interrupts or intrudes on others , e.g. , butts into other people 's games .
12 . Often does not seem to listen to what is being said to him or her .
13 .
Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities at school or at home ( e.g. , toys , pencils , books ) .
14 . Often engages in physically dangerous activities without considering possible consequences ( not for the purpose of thrill - seeking ) , e.g. , runs into street without looking .
Almost all of these behaviors , however , might be found in bright , talented , creative , gifted children .
Until now , little attention has been given to the similarities and differences between the two groups , thus raising the potential for misidentification in both areas -- giftedness and ADHD .
Sometimes , professionals have diagnosed ADHD by simply listening to parent or teacher descriptions of the child 's behaviors along with a brief observation of the child .
Other times , brief screening questionnaires are used , although these questionnaires only quantify the parents ' or teachers ' descriptions of the behaviors ( Parker , 1992 ) .
Children who are fortunate enough to have a thorough physical evaluation ( which includes screening for allergies and other metabolic disorders ) and extensive psychological evaluations , which include assessment of intelligence , achievement , and emotional status , have a better chance of being accurately identified .
A child may be gifted and have ADHD .
Without a thorough professional evaluation , it is difficult to tell .
HOW CAN PARENTS OR TEACHERS DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ADHD AND GIFTEDNESS ?
Seeing the difference between behaviors that are sometimes associated with giftedness but also characteristic of ADHD is not easy , as the following parallel lists show .
BEHAVIORS ASSOCIATED WITH ADHD ( BARKLEY , 1990 )
1. Poorly sustained attention in almost all situations
2. Diminished persistence on tasks not having immediate consequences
3 . Impulsivity , poor delay of gratification
4. Impaired adherence to commands to regulate or inhibit behavior in social contexts
5 . More active , restless than normal children
6. Difficulty adhering to rules and regulations
BEHAVIORS ASSOCIATED WITH GIFTEDNESS ( WEBB , 1993 )
1. Poor attention , boredom , daydreaming in specific situations
2 . Low tolerance for persistence on tasks that seem irrelevant
3. Judgment lags behind development of intellect
4. Intensity may lead to power struggles with authorities
5 . High activity level ; may need less sleep
6. Questions rules , customs and traditions
CONSIDER THE SITUATION AND SETTING
It is important to examine the situations in which a child 's behaviors are problematic .
Gifted children typically do not exhibit problems in all situations .
For example , they may be seen as ADHD - like by one classroom teacher , but not by another ; or they may be seen as ADHD at school , but not by the scout leader or music teacher .
Close examination of the troublesome situation generally reveals other factors which are prompting the problem behaviors .
By contrast , children with ADHD typically exhibit the problem behaviors in virtually all settings " including at home and at school " though the extent of their problem behaviors may fluctuate significantly from setting to setting ( Barkley , 1990 ) , depending largely on the structure of that situation .
That is , the behaviors exist in all settings , but are more of a problem in some settings than in others .
In the classroom , a gifted child 's perceived inability to stay on task is likely to be related to boredom , curriculum , mismatched learning style , or other environmental factors .
Gifted children may spend from one - fourth to one - half of their regular classroom time waiting for others to catch up -- even more if they are in a heterogeneously grouped class .
Their specific level of academic achievement is often two to four grade levels above their actual grade placement .
Such children often respond to non-challenging or slow - moving classroom situations by " off - task " behavior , disruptions , or other attempts at self - amusement .
This use of extra time is often the cause of the referral for an ADHD evaluation .
Hyperactive is a word often used to describe gifted children as well as children with ADHD .
As with attention span , children with ADHD have a high activity level , but this activity level is often found across situations ( Barkley , 1990 ) .
A large proportion of gifted children are highly active too .
As many as one - fourth may require less sleep ; however , their activity is generally focused and directed ( Clark , 1992 ; Webb , Meckstroth , & Tolan , 1982 ) , in contrast to the behavior of children with ADHD .
The intensity of gifted children 's concentration often permits them to spend long periods of time and much energy focusing on whatever truly interests them .
Their specific interests may not coincide , however , with the desires and expectations of teachers or parents .
While the child who is hyperactive has a very brief attention span in virtually every situation ( usually except for television or computer games ) , children who are gifted can concentrate comfortably for long periods on tasks that interest them , and do not require immediate completion of those tasks or immediate consequences .
The activities of children with ADHD tend to be both continual and random ; the gifted child 's activity usually is episodic and directed to specific goals .
While difficulties and adherence to rules and regulations has only begun to be accepted as a sign of ADHD ( Barkley , 1990 ) , gifted children may actively question rules , customs and traditions , sometimes creating complex rules which they expect others to respect or obey .
Some engage in power struggles .
These behaviors can cause discomfort for parents , teachers , and peers .
One characteristic of ADHD that does not have a counterpart in children who are gifted is variability of task performance .
In almost every setting , children with ADHD tend to be highly inconsistent in the quality of their performance ( i.e. , grades , chores ) and the amount of time used to accomplish tasks ( Barkley , 1990 ) .
Children who are gifted routinely maintain consistent efforts and high grades in classes when they like the teacher and are intellectually challenged , although they may resist some aspects of the work , particularly repetition of tasks perceived as dull .
Some gifted children may become intensely focused and determined ( an aspect of their intensity ) to produce a product that meets their self - imposed standards .
WHAT TEACHERS AND PARENTS CAN DO
Determining whether a child has ADHD can be particularly difficult when that child is also gifted .
The use of many instruments , including intelligence tests administered by qualified professionals , achievement and personality tests , as well as parent and teacher rating scales , can help the professional determine the subtle differences between ADHD and giftedness .
Individual evaluation allows the professional to establish maximum rapport with the child to get the best effort on the tests .
Since the test situation is constant , it is possible to make better comparisons among children .
Portions of the intellectual and achievement tests will reveal attention problems or learning disabilities , whereas personality tests are designed to show whether emotional problems ( e.g. , depression or anxiety ) could be causing the problem behaviors .
Evaluation should be followed by appropriate curricular and instructional modifications that account for advanced knowledge , diverse learning styles , and various types of intelligence .
Careful consideration and appropriate professional evaluation are necessary before concluding that bright , creative , intense youngsters like Howard have ADHD .
Consider the characteristics of the gifted / talented child and the child 's situation .
Do not hesitate to raise the possibility of giftedness with any professional who is evaluating the child for ADHD ; however , do not be surprised if the professional has had little training in recognizing the characteristics of gifted / talented children ( Webb , 1993 ) .
It is important to make the correct diagnosis , and parents and teachers may need to provide information to others since giftedness is often neglected in professional development programs .

Washington Post , McGovern writes that although the chances of impeachment are unlikely , the facts most definitely point in that direction : “ Bush and Cheney are clearly guilty of numerous impeachable offenses .
They have repeatedly violated the Constitution .
They have transgressed national and international law .
They have lied to the American people time after time .
Their conduct and their barbaric policies have reduced our beloved country to a historic low in the eyes of people around the world .
These are truly ‘ high crimes and misdemeanors , ’ to use the constitutional standard . ”
Here ’s my question to you :
Why wo n’t Congress impeach President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney ?

Those expecting Kucinich to deliver harsh words about the president were n’t disappointed , as the half - hour campaign speech soon turned to talk of impeachment .
“ On the way over here , I was reading a 50 - page document that relates to Articles of Impeachment for the President of the United States , ” Kucinich said to a standing ovation .
“ And I want you to know that I ’m actually preparing this document for submission to the House . ”
Kucinich said under the current administration , citizen ’s rights to due process and fair trial are in jeopardy .
“ This is a moment when we ’re called upon to reclaim our country , ” he said .
“ You give me your vote , I ’ll give you back your country . ”
( Original Article )
When I hear about something like Wednesday ’s bridge collapse , I immediately wonder whether any of the science I ’ve worked on can be of any help .
Bridge design is one of the classic — almost iconic — successes of traditional mathematical science .
And when I first talked about A New Kind of Science , a not uncommon reaction was precisely , “ But can it help build better bridges ? ”
Well , as a matter of fact , I rather suspect it can .
Bridges have a long history .
Early on , only a few types seem to have been used .
But with the arrival of iron structures in the 1800s there was a kind of “ Cambrian explosion ” of different types of truss bridges :
But what is the very best bridge structure , say from the point of view of robustness ?
There ’s a huge universe of possibilities .
But so far , only a tiny corner has been explored — and that mostly in the 1800s .
It ’s very much the same as in other areas of engineering .
People have come up with particular structures to consider .
Most often they ’re just based on a sequence of identical repeating elements , or sometimes of nested elements .
But what about all the other possible structures ?
Maybe the best structures are n’t so simple - looking .
Well , I now know lots of examples where they ’re not .
Her ’s one example — from “ Sorting Networks ” in the Wolfram Demonstrations Project .
Each of these pictures shows a network that will sort any set of 16 elements into order .
The “ classic ” networks at the top have simple structures .
But it ’s been known for a while that the best networks ( shown at the bottom ) do n’t have that kind of simple structure .
In fact , they almost seem in some ways quite random .
Well , what about bridges ?
I strongly suspect that there are much better truss structures for bridges than the classic ones from the 1800s — but they wo n’t look so simple .
I suspect one can do quite well by using simple rules to generate the structure .
But as we know from NKS , just because the rules to generate something are simple , it does n’t mean the thing itself will look simple at all .
Two students at our NKS Summer School ( Rafal Kicinger and Tom Speller ) have investigated creating practical truss structures this way — and the results seem very promising .
So what should the bridges of the future look like ?
Probably a lot less regular than today .
Because I suspect the most robust structures will end up being ones with quite a lot of apparent randomness .
Those new kinds of bridges being built may be a bit shocking at first .
After all , classic regular bridge structures — and things like the Eiffel Tower — are icons of our modern engineering - based civilization .
And in fact , even biology — with its iterative process of natural selection — probably can’t find structures as good — and irregular — as the ones I expect are out there .
So we ’re going to end up being exposed to something really quite new .
Something that exists in the abstract computational universe , but that we ’re “ mining ” for the very first time to create structures we want .
We ’re using these kinds of “ mining ” methods all the time now to find the best algorithms for Mathematica .
I think bridge structures are a good example of where similar methods can be used for mechanical systems .
So if building better bridges is the test for what kind of science one should be using , I think it ’s going to be a new kind of science that ’s needed …
P.S. I have n’t done any serious analysis of these yet , but here are a few potential new bridge structures I just found in the computational universe …
Climate Change : Time For Some Slightly Mad Ideas ?
By Stephen Leahy
Sep 28 ( IPS ) – Lack of governmental action on climate change is forcing scientists to consider radical climate geo-engineering schemes such as giant vertical pipes in the ocean and growing vast blooms of plankton to try and prevent the worst from happening .
Companies backing some of these schemes hope to profit from the rising public clamour for action and politicians desperate to avoid serious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions .
“ I was n’t in favour of geo - engineering before , but we have n’t done well in reducing emissions , ” said Chris Rapley , director of the Science Museum in London and former head of the British Antarctic Survey .
In fact , the global community continues on the “ business as usual ” path in terms of emissions of greenhouse gases ( GHGs ) , thus increasing the chances of catastrophic climate change , Rapley , a climate change expert , told IPS .
“ Just look at how incredibly quick the Arctic sea ice is melting , ” he said .
This month , the Arctic sea ice shrank 20 percent more than the previous melt record set in 2005 .
Many scientists now believe that the Arctic region will melt completely during the summer months in a few decades — far sooner than previously estimated .
“ The stakes are so high , we ’re going to need extra tools to cope with climate change , ” Rapley said .
Rapley and co-author James Lovelock published a paper on their geo-engineering “ tool ” — giant vertical pipes in the ocean — this week in the prestigious journal Nature .
The idea is to place a series of vertical pipes 10 metres in diameter and 200 metres long in the ocean so that wave motion would pump up water from 200 metres below the surface .
This would encourage algae to bloom and push carbon dioxide back down , said Rapley .
He credits James Lovelock , an independent research scientist affiliated with the University of Oxford , with the original idea .
Lovelock , who first proposed the Gaia Hypothesis that the Earth as a single highly complex organism , believes the climate change tipping point has been reached and drastic measures are needed to avoid the worst .
“ We ’re not sure that pipes will actually work but it looks like it would have low unintended consequences , ” Rapley said , meaning that at least the scheme is unlikely to do more harm than good .
Billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson has reportedly offered to fund research on the idea .
A company called Atmocean in Santa Fe New Mexico has already begun trials of a very similar technology in the past year , Rapley has since learned .
The company says placing three - metre diameter pipes , two kilometres apart in 80 percent of the world ’s oceans would sequester , or trap , two billion tonnes of carbon per year , according to the company ’s website .
Global emissions are currently 8 billion tons annually , up from 6 billion in 2000 .
“ That shows it ’s not a completely mad idea , ” said Rapley .

NEW ORLEANS ( Reuters ) - Actor Brad Pitt said on Monday he wants to build 150 environmentally friendly homes for families displaced by Hurricane Katrina in a hard - hit New Orleans neighborhood
Pitt ’s Make
It Right project aims to revive the Lower Ninth Ward which was almost totally destroyed in the 2005 storm .
“ A hundred and fifty homes is our goal , ” Pitt said near the spot where the Industrial Canal floodwall broke during Katrina and sent a wall of water through the neighborhood .
“ But there is no reason why we ca n’t do 1,000 homes , why we ca n’t do 10,000 homes , why we ca n’t do 100,000 homes , ” he said against an art installation of bright pink rectangles and triangles meant to draw attention to the cause .
Pitt , who with actress Angelina Jolie owns a home in the city ’s historic French Quarter , said the new homes would incorporate energy efficient appliances and “ green ” materials and would be built for an average of $ 150,000 .
He has been a vocal critic of faltering government efforts to rebuild New Orleans and has worked with environmental group Global Green USA on a separate project to construct environmentally friendly homes in the city .
Pitt has pledged up to match up to $ 5 million in donations for the Make It Right project , which he announced at a conference in New York in September .
An international team of 13 architectural firms has submitted designs for the single - family homes , the first of which could be finished by May 2008 .
The new homes will be elevated to withstand future floods .
In a recent talk at MIT , Umesh Vazirani appealed to the famous Birthday Paradox to say that two random subsets of { 1 , … , N} , each of size o( √N ) , probably would n’t intersect each other .
Of course we all understood what he meant , but it occurred to me that Umesh was actually appealing to the Birthday Unparadox : “ If you put three people in a room , chances are no two of them will have the same birthday . ”
Once I realized that , I started seeing unparadoxes everywhere I looked :
The Banach - Tarski Unparadox :
If you cut an orange into five pieces using a standard knife , then put them back together , the result will have exactly the same volume as the original orange .
Braess ’ Unparadox :
If you add an extra lane to a highway , one possible result will be to decrease congestion .
Hempel ’s Unparadox :
If you observe a bunch of ravens and find that all of them are black , this might increase your likelihood for the statement “ All ravens are black . ”
Russell ’s Unparadox :
The set of all sets that contain themselves as a member , might or might not contain itself as a member ( either way is fine ) .
In the spirit of my highly - successful Best Umeshism and Best Anthropicism contests ( remember those ? ) , I now open the floor to you : come up with the best unparadox !
The winner will receive absolutely nothing .

Markos Moulitsas of The Daily Kos and Newsweek joined Keith Olbermann on Friday 's Countdown to talk about the FISA fiasco and the feckless Senate Majority ?
Leader Harry Reid , who is prepared to once again cower to the worst president in American history and give him everything he wants in the new FISA bill , including amnesty for the telecommunications companies .
Markos , like the rest of us , was at a loss as to why the Democratic majority seems to be so afraid to stand up to the minority party and their president .
He also says that the Democrats should n't fold like a cheap card table every time the Republicans threaten a filibuster -- when what they really should be doing is MAKING them actually filibuster so that America can see exactly who is blocking progress in Washington .
Most people know that the Fed performs functions like adjusting the discount rate and federal funds rate , clearing checks , and lending money to banks .
But our nation ’s bank is much more than that , providing services that support communities and help banks stay afloat .
Here you ’ll discover 10 Federal Reserve functions that are n’t often discussed .
Standards in new technology
It ’s common knowledge that the Federal Reserve processes electronic banking and ACH transactions , but did you know that they also create new technologies and set industry standards for banks ?
The St. Louis Fed reports , " one of [ our ] specialties , for example , is to develop new software applications for the U.S.
Treasury , which is increasing its use of electronic receipts and payments to reduce costs and improve services . "
Additionally , " the Fed has helped pioneer some electronic payments systems itself , such as the automated clearing house . "
Once new technologies are implemented , the Federal Reserve works with banks to monitor and standardize in the areas of " system risk , MICR encoding , ACH technology , and digitized image standards and processing . "
Bank examination beyond books and practices
The Fed has to consider events in banking that may affect our economy and act to minimize their risk .
That means that they issue advisories to alert institutions to risks as well as examine these institutions for compliance .
For example , the Fed prepared for Y2 K by establishing benchmarks for compliance and began examining for readiness in June 1998 .
Additionally , the Federal Reserve created contingency scenarios in case of plan failure .
Stress testing Another way the Federal Reserve minimizes risk is through stress testing .
The Fed is expected to plan for the unexpected future in financial markets , and it ’s difficult to know how the market will react until the situation presents itself .
By stress testing , the Federal Reserve attempts to predict scenarios .
In these tests , " historical data from asset price distributions " or other scenarios are used to create a look into financial risks of the future .
Promoting economic education Today , many adults have very little financial literacy , a problem that leaves them vulnerable to predatory lending practices , poor money management , and a lowered understanding of how our economy works .
To combat this , the Fed has established a number of programs that help both students and adults educate themselves about money and the way the Federal Reserve works .
For students , the Federal Reserve offers the " Fed Challenge , " a program that allows groups of high schoolers to create their own mock Federal Reserve .
For teachers , the Fed provides hands - on instructional workshops .
Additionally , the Federal Reserve offers education in the form of exhibits and tours .
Community reinvestment According to the Community Reinvestment
Act of 1977 , banks are required to offer their services to underserved populations and small businesses .
The Federal Reserve , along with government institutions , enforces this requirement by evaluating the CRA performance of individual banks .
A bank ’s performance is considered when the bank applies to " expand , merge or acquire another institution . "
Ratings and evaluations are also made public so that consumers can be informed about how their bank measures up .
This function , unfortunately , has been criticized as a possible cause of the subprime mortgage financial crisis , as it may have pushed banks to lend to customers that were not creditworthy .
Support of minority - owned institutions Supplementing the Federal Reserve ’s commitment to community reinvestment is the support of minority - owned institutions .
Through the Minority - Owned Institutions Program , the Fed supervises and promotes these institutions that are vital to serving historically underserved markets .
In this not - yet - released program , participating institutions are offered proactive training and technical assistance .
Essentially , the program takes participants through the stages of starting up , managing growth , and maintaining the institution .
Consumer rights protection
One of the responsibilities that the Federal Reserve is charged with is the assurance of " safe and sound " banking .
Obviously , this means regulating banks to ensure that they ’re practicing responsible lending , but beyond that , it means that the Fed is a consumer defender .
In this role , the Federal Reserve supervises banks to protect consumers and has the power to create laws to do so .
As part of this responsibility , the Fed is charged with the implementation and enforcement of the Truth in Lending Act , the Electronic Funds Transfer Act , and the Fair Housing Act .
Local economy monitoring and support
As a national figure , the Federal Reserve is often seen as one with a broad view of the economy , but that broad view is made up of a number of very finite views .
Each Federal Reserve bank monitors its local economy for both current events and an understanding of the economy .
They seek out insight on " who ’s hiring , who ’s firing , who ’s investing in new equipment and buildings , whether home sales are going up or down , whether local businesses are expanding and much more . "
Additionally , the Federal Reserve banks assist local institutions in creating more access to capital and credit by " hosting forums and bringing together lenders , government agencies and community development groups . "
Innovating bank protection The Federal Reserve considers issues that concern banks , like retail payment fraud .
This March , the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis held a roundtable discussion with institutions , corporations , service providers , and law enforcement for advisement .
The aim was to balance the costs and benefits of fraud prevention as well as gather insight into how the Federal Reserve can assist the banking industry in mitigating fraud .
Within the next few months , researchers at three medical centers expect to start the first test in patients of one of the most promising  and contentious  ideas about the cause and treatment of cancer .
The idea is to take aim at what some scientists say are cancerous stem cells  aberrant cells that maintain and propagate malignant tumors .
Although many scientists have assumed that cancer cells are immortal  that they divide and grow indefinitely  most can only divide a certain number of times before dying .
The stem - cell hypothesis says that cancers themselves may not die because they are fed by cancerous stem cells , a small and particularly dangerous kind of cell that can renew by dividing even as it spews out more cells that form the bulk of a tumor .
Worse , stem cells may be impervious to most standard cancer therapies .
Not everyone accepts the hypothesis of cancerous stem cells .
Skeptics say proponents are so in love with the idea that they dismiss or ignore evidence against it .
Dr. Scott E. Kern , for instance , a leading pancreatic cancer researcher at Johns Hopkins University , said the hypothesis was more akin to religion than to science .
WHY WAS THE NIE RELEASED ?….
A couple of random thoughts on the newly released NIE concluding that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 :
This NIE was apparently finished a year ago , and its basic parameters were almost certainly common knowledge in the White House well before that .
This means that all the leaks , all the World War III stuff , all the blustering about the IAEA — all of it was approved for public consumption after Cheney / Bush / Rice / etc .
knew perfectly well it was mostly baseless .
Why were the key judgments finally released ?
Cheney did n’t want them released , Bush surely did n’t want them released , and DNI Mike McConnell told Congress a few weeks ago that he did n’t want them released .
So who did ?
All I ’ve got is speculation on the second question , but here it is : it was congressional pressure .
Democratic members of the various intelligence committees saw the NIE ( or a summary or a verbal report or something ) and went ballistic .
Footnotes and dissents are one thing , but withholding a report whose primary conclusion is 180 degrees contrary to years of administration innuendo produced a rebellion .
Somebody who got briefed must have threatened something pretty serious if the NIE did n’t see the light of day .
Like I said , just a guess .
But who else has the clout to force Bush , Cheney , and McConnell to change course ?
By the way , Stephen Hadley will be on TV furiously providing the Bush administration ’s spin on all this at 3:15 Eastern time .
Should be good for some laughs .
I did n’t pay anything to download Radiohead ’s “ In Rainbows ” last Wednesday .
When the checkout page on the band ’s Web site allowed me to type in whatever price I wanted , I put 0.00 , the lowest I could go .
My economist friends say this makes me a rational being .
Apparently not everybody is this lucid , at least not in matters related to their favorite British rock band .
After Radiohead announced it would allow fans to download its album for whatever price they chose , about a third of the first million or so downloads paid nothing , according to a British survey .
But many paid more than $ 20 .
The average price was about $ 8 .
That is , people paid for something they could get for free .
This phenomenon is not new .
It ’s called tipping .
We do it when we go to the restaurant or the barber , or when we ride in a taxi .
Though one could argue there are real tangible reasons for this payment — like not losing an ear the next time we get a haircut — the practice of paying more money than we are legally bound to do is still mystifying in an economic sense .
For instance , why tip a cabdriver you will probably never see again ?
“ Since we economists do n’t understand tipping , we ca n’t really say whether this new scheme will work , ” Greg Mankiw , a Harvard professor of economics , said in an entry on his blog .
He is not the only economist who is fascinated by the phenomenon .
His Harvard colleague , Dani Rodrik , asked his blog readers , “ Has Radiohead gone bonkers ? ”
He concluded , “ Not at all . ” Radiohead will make money .
But those who are paying for the download may truly be nuts .
( Attention : This is a very technical post mostly for Python developerts .
If you are not a programmer you might want to skip this ) .
During a conversation esp. with Ryan Williams ( Which Linden ) from Linden Lab we talked about their own Python libraries eventlet and mulib and how great it would be to have them available as Python Eggs ( eventlet is a co-routines based networking library and mulib is a REST framework build on top of it .
Both are used internally by Linden Lab for the Second Life infrastructure ) .
If you do n’t know what a Python egg is , it ’s simply a way of distributing Python packages , similar to RPM .
There is also an easy method of installing them , using easy_install .
Where do I find Python Eggs ?
You can find Python Eggs on quite a few places on the web , e.g. at a package author ’s website .
The biggest repository of eggs is the Cheeseshop ( or PyPI ) though ) , an index for Python packages .
In order to be able to install eggs you simply need to install easy_install which is easily done by downloading ez_install .py ( you can download it here ) and calling it ( you need to have rights to install components in your python installation of course ) .
Once you have done this you can simply install an egg by calling :
easy_install somepackage.egg
You can also give a URL to an egg and use
easy_install http://somehost.somedomain.com/somepackage.egg
If an egg is not found at that location or in the directory you give , easy_install will automatically query the Cheeseshop for the egg location .
So if you want to install SimpleJSON you simply give
easy_install simplejson
and it will download and install the most recent version .
If you are not running as root and you have Python installed as root you of course need to use something like „ sudo easy_install “ instead ( e.g. on MacOSX ) .
A great additional feature is also that Eggs can define dependencies on other packages which easy_install will then try to automatically download and install aswell .
BTW , the easy_install program is part of the setuptool package by Philip Eby and is based on the distutils package which is part of the standard python distribution .
Creating Python Eggs
Now we know how to install Python Eggs , how can we actually create them ?
There are actually two ways to do that , one is more manual and the other directly creates a skeleton for you to work with which might be handy for projects you start from scratch .
As an example we will use the above mentioned eventlet package ( you can find the SVN repository here ) .
The directory structure right now looks like this :
README eventlet examples setup.py
So as we can see it already has a setup.py which is part of the distutils package and makes it easy to install eventlet by simply typing
python setup.py install
This will build and install the library in your Python installation .
You need to make sure you have greenlet installed though .
The setup.py now looks like this :
#!/usr/bin/env python from distutils .
core import setup setup( name= ' eventlet ' , version = ' 0.1 ' , description = ' Coroutine - based networking library ' , author= ' Linden Lab ' , author_email='sldev@lists.secondlife.com ' , url= ' http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Eventlet', packages= [ ' eventlet ' ] )
So we can see some metadata about this package , like name , version , description , author and so on , but also a list of packages to be installed .
In this case it ’s „ eventlet “ and this means that the directory „ eventlet “ on the filesystem will be used as the package to install so you later can say from eventlet import ... .
The directory eventlet will be what will be in your PYTHONPATH .
Now so far it ’s great but we might miss some features of eggs here , namely the ability to package it as one file , to register it with the cheeseshop and to define dependencies .
So to add this we have to do just a few changes to setup.py .
The first one is to import not from distutils but from setuptools instead :
from setuptools import setup
And then we need to extend the amount of data mostly by further metadata we need for the cheeseshop , such as license and categories :
setup ( name= ' eventlet ' , version = ' 0.1 ' , description = ' Coroutine - based networking library ' , author= ' Linden Lab ' , author_email='sldev@lists.secondlife.com ' , url= ' http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Eventlet', packages= [ ' eventlet ' ] , long_description= " " " \ eventlet is a coroutines - based network library for python ... " " " , classifiers = [ " License :: OSI Approved :: GNU General Public License ( GPL ) " , " Programming Language :: Python " , " Development Status :: 4 - Beta " , " Intended Audience :: Developers " , " Topic :: Internet " , ] , keywords = ' networking eventlet nonblocking internet ' , license= ' GPL ' , install_requires= [ ' setuptools ' , ' greenlet ' , ] , )
( actually I have n’t checked the license of eventlet / mublib so this might be wrong but you can change this accordingly ) .
So we added those classifiers to put it into the right categories on Cheeseshop and most importantly we added the requirement „ greenlet “ .
If you then install the egg setuptools will automatically install greenlet as well .
Once you have this you can create an egg out of this by calling
python setup.py bdist_egg
This will create an egg distribution file which you can find in dist / eventlet - 0.1 - py2.4.egg ( if you used Python 2.4 )
You can check the contents by calling unzip -t eventlet - 0.1 - py2.4.egg and as you can see it ’s basically the contents of the eventlet directory plus an EGG_INFO directory with metadata .
Also included are the .pyc files as it ’s a binary distribution .
The resulting .egg file can now be distributed by whatever means and installed by the above easy_install command .
Starting from scratch with Python Paste
If you just want to start your project there is an easier way to create the initial structure .
You simply use Python Paste and a template .
What we are interested in is especially paste .
script which is some sort of template based automation system .
So here is what you do to install the right packages :
easy_install - U ZopeSkel
You can alternatively just do
easy_install - U PasteScript
but ZopeSkel will install PasteScript as well and offers additionally templates which might be of use to you .
Now that PasteScript is installed you can list the available templates :
$ paster create -- list - templates Available templates : archetype : A Plone project that uses Archetypes basic_namespace :
A project with a namespace package basic_package : A basic setuptools - enabled package basic_zope : A Zope project nested_namespace : A project with two nested namespaces .
paste_deploy : A web application deployed through paste . deploy plone : A Plone project plone2.5 _buildout : A buildout for Plone 2.5 projects plone2.5 _theme : A Theme for Plone 2.5 plone2 _theme : A Theme Product for Plone 2.1 & Plone 2.5 plone3_buildout : A buildout for Plone 3 projects plone3_portlet : A Plone 3 portlet plone3 _theme : A Theme for Plone 3.0 plone_app : A Plone App project plone_hosting : Plone hosting : buildout with ZEO and any Plone version tgbase : tg base template tgbig :
For more complex projects tgwidget : TurboGears widget projects turbogears : web framework
( I have Turbogears installed as well which is why here are more templates listed than you have )
The interesting ones for Python are basic_package and basic_namespace .
We will use basic_package for now as it creates a package ready for egg distribution .
So we can call it like this :
paster create -t basic_package
and it will ask us a lot of questions , basically all the metadata we have to put into the setup .py file .
After it ’s finished you should have a new directory with a basic egg supporting structure .
Now you just need to code your actuall component but that ’s left as an exercise for the reader !

This computer mod is one of the craziest I have seen .
It is shaped like a large bin ( trash can ) and has all you need to use it as a PC in your home .
If you flip open the lid you will see a number of components squeezed in there such as the PSU , motherboard , cables , CD drive etc .
Around the back are the connections to hook up a keyboard , mouse , monitor and all your USB devices .
No details on the specs though although with a bit of effort , anything could be put in to the can .

CBS : Is the military easier on gay soldiers in wartime ?
Nick Langewis and David Edwards
Published : Thursday December 13 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This ( via PageOneQ ) -- This upcoming Sunday , CBS will feature a soldier that says he has been allowed to continue to serve in the United States Army despite being openly gay , in contradiction of 10 USC 654 , more commonly known as the Don't Ask , Do n't Tell policy .
Do n't
Ask serves to bar any openly gay individual from being accepted into military service , and discharge an active member who is revealed to be gay .
Servicemembers Legal Defense Network ( SLDN ) client and Army Sergeant Darren Manzella , currently serving in Kuwait after a tour in Iraq , tells Lesley Stahl of CBS ' 60 Minutes that he has been well supported by soldiers and bosses alike since coming out last year .
Stories like Manzella 's suggest a climate of indifference to openly gay soldiers , especially in overseas combat .
An SLDN survey suggests that members stationed overseas are less likely than those serving stateside to be discharged under Do n't Ask ; less than 25 % of 2005 's discharges were revealed to be from units in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" Sergeant Manzella 's story illustrates the arbitrary and uneven enforcement of ' Do n't Ask , Don't Tell , ' " says SLDN Executive Director Aubrey Sarvis .
" Many commands , like Manzella 's , recognize that their lesbian and gay troops are instrumental in the work of defending our country . "
Continues Sarvis , " Those commanders , who want to do the right thing and retain good troops , should not have their hands tied by this unfair law .
Our nation 's commitment to fairness and civil liberties demands an end to this law , and our national security interests are best served by repealing it . "
Since its enactment in 1993 , Do n't Ask has resulted in the discharge of over 12,000 servicemembers , at an average of two every day .
Medical professionals like Sgt. Manzella , along with " mission - critical " personnel such as 58 Arabic translators , are included in those ranks .
" It is perhaps only once in a lifetime , " says Sgt. Manzella , " that we are given the opportunity to do something of paramount importance , and I am honored to be able to use my voice to speak out on behalf of the countless lesbian and gay Americans currently serving in our armed forces . "
" More and more of us are serving openly  and proudly  in our nation 's military , " continues Manzella .
" It is important that Americans hear our stories , see our commitment to our nation and understand the harm ' Do n't Ask , Don't Tell ' unnecessarily inflicts on our military and our troops .
I am grateful to Lesley Stahl and 60 Minutes for the opportunity to share my story , and grateful to SLDN for their fight on my behalf during my time in the Army . "
Manzella , along with SLDN board member Cholene Espinoza , will be featured this upcoming Sunday , December 16 , 2007 , on CBS ' 60 Minutes , airing at 7/6 c .
More information on Sgt. Manzella , and the ongoing effort to repeal Do n't Ask , Don't Tell , is available at Servicemembers Legal Defense Network .

Reporter , Crossing Continents
Sold into prostitution aged nine , condemned by an Iranian judge to hang at 18 , Leila was saved by a group of human rights activists .
Leila was illiterate but she is now learning to read " I was nine years old when my mother started selling me .
I did not understand what was happening . "
Today Leila is a young woman of 22 .
For the past two years she has been cared for by a private home for destitute young women in Tehran , Omid E Mehr , which means Hope .
" My mother would say : ' Let 's go out to buy things , like chocolates ' .
She would actually trick me .
I was a tiny girl .
She just took me to places . "
Leila still finds it difficult to talk about the past .
But we know that the " places " she speaks of are where she was sold for sex and raped .
Leila became the main source of income for a family of five .
The lawyer who eventually saved Leila 's life , Shadi Sadr , is a controversial figure in Iran .
Although she was imprisoned earlier this year for taking part in human rights demonstrations , she is widely respected and frequently quoted in the press .
A girl is considered one of the first commodities or properties that can be traded or sold in the eyes of a parent who is poor in Iran
Shadi Sadr
Lawyer Ms Sadr says Leila 's story is not unique .
" A girl is considered one of the first commodities or properties that can be traded or sold in the eyes of a parent who is poor in Iran , " she says .
Ms Sadr says that , in practice in Iran , under the Islamic penal code a father has enormous power over his own children .
" If a father decides to kill his own child he will not be sentenced to death , he will only be sent to prison for a couple of years . "
Temporary wife Leila lived in Arak , a small town four hours drive south of Tehran - notorious for criminal behaviour and illegal drugs .
Most of Leila 's earnings went on illegal narcotics for her family .
According to the United Nations three quarters of the world 's opium seizures take place in Iran and the authorities acknowledge addiction is a serious problem .
Human rights lawyers say Leila 's case is not unique
But there are no such statistics on prostitution .
The Director of the Omid E Mehr centre in Tehran says it is a growing problem .
" I have entered many homes in the south of Tehran where young girls had to go out and sell their bodies to provide for their father 's drug habits , " says Eshrat Gholipour .
I have also seen several cases of families chaining their own daughter to the homes to stop them from running away . "
I am going to tell you something but please do not be upset .
You are going to be hanged
Prison warder Leila 's husband began selling her for sex to as many as 15 men each night .
Two months into the marriage , police raided the house and arrested everyone .
The husband was sentenced to five years in jail for providing a house for illegal sex .
During the course of the criminal investigation , Leila 's brothers had confessed to raping her .
They were flogged .
For this Leila was accused of incest .
A crime punishable by death .
Leila was in a women 's prison when she heard about her own sentence from the warder : " I am going to tell you something but please do not be upset .
You are going to be hanged . "
Ms Sadr says the judicial system is deeply conservative and unfair .
" These male judges have not had any training about sexual charges .
They all have a chauvinistic point of view and they see the woman as guilty , " she says .
Leila 's brothers later retracted their confessions .
Ms Sadr took Leila 's case to appeal and won .
Death sentence Earlier this year Ms Sadr defended and won the case of 19 - year - old Nazanine , sentenced to death for killing a man who tried to rape her .
Today she too is a free woman .
There will be so many protests ... from the human rights activists that the judges are under pressure not to issue a death sentence "
Shadi Sadr
Lawyer According to Amnesty International , 177 people were executed in Iran last year , of these four were women - this year the number is up to five .
The real figures could be higher as executions are not always reported .
But Ms Sadr and other Iranian lawyers say that constant human - rights campaigning and publicity is making Iran 's judges more sensitive to public opinion .
" There will be so many protests or so much complaints from the human rights activists that the judges are under pressure not to issue a death sentence , " she says .
Tender hope Today Leila lives in a small flat with a full - time carer paid for by Ms Sadr and the Omid E Mehr day centre .
When Leila arrived she was illiterate and needed to be taught the basics of life .
Leila is rebuilding her life and learning to be independent " She did not know anything , " says Marjaneh Halati , the founder of Omid E Mehr , " to the point that she did not know that you wear a pad when you get a period . "
Today Leila is learning to read and earning money as a seamstress .
But Ms Halati also knows that by helping girls like Leila - by boosting their self - esteem and encouraging independence - the centre is treading a fine line .
" We live in Iran and there are certain rules we have to abide by , but it does not mean we cannot tell the girls that they are no different to men .
They are individuals , " she says .
Today Leila is free and attitudes may slowly be changing .
Iran passed its first child protection laws five years ago .
This spring a new bill drafted by human rights lawyers , is expected to go before Parliament to make prosecutions in child abuse cases easier .
Crossing Continents : Leila 's Story Crossing Continents on BBC Radio 4 tells Leila 's story on Thursday , November 29 at 1100 GMT , her story will also be told on the World Service programme Assignment on Wednesday , December 5 at 0900 GMT .
Leila 's interview was recorded by the Iranian filmmaker , Hamid Rahmanian for a film about the Omid e Mehr .

DACONO — A councilwoman who posted an e-mail on a local website that said being a Democrat is worse than “ being a black disabled one - armed drug addicted Jewish queer ” who has a “ Mexican boyfriend ” resigned Thursday .
But 61 - year - old Sandra Tucker said she quit only to avoid putting this town of 4,000 in southwestern Weld County in a harsh light .
Otherwise , she has no regrets about the posting .
“ I ’m sick and tired of all of this political correctness , ” Tucker said .
“ I ’m not going to apologize if you do n’t have a sense of humor . ”
Mayor Wade Carlson — who quickly asked that Tri-Town.com take down Tucker ’s missive — said he was stunned at its content .
“ It was unbelievable , ” Carlson said .
“ It just hurts me and it hurts the city .
“ The city of Dacono does not believe in this kind of garbage , ” he added .
“ We are not racist ; we are not discriminatory . ”
Carlson said he learned about Tucker ’s e-mail through another council member Wednesday .
He found it on the website — a community forum and advertising platform for local businesses — and called Tucker to ask her to remove her posting .
She refused , Carlson said , so he called the owner of the website and asked for its removal .
Carlson said he fielded several angry e-mails and phone calls about Tucker ’s offering .
“ The people in the tri-town area are incensed , and so am I , ” he said .
Tucker was elected to her second term on the council in November .
Someone sent her the e-mail , titled “ Truly a Fate Worse Than Death , ” which she said she found hilarious and posted .
“ Listen , I ’m 4 - foot - 11 and I ’m blond , so I ’ve heard all the jokes about that and I ’m not offended , ” Tucker said .
“ People just do n’t laugh anymore .
They are afraid . ”
The e-mail describes how someone wakes up to discover he is a “ Negro , ” in a wheelchair , Jewish , a drug addict and HIV - positive .
But the worst happens when the subject discovers that his choice for president is either Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama .
“ PLEASE do n’t tell me I ’m a DEMOCRAT , ” the e-mail said .
Tucker said that she ’s been heavily involved in cleaning up Dacono ’s image and that she ’s not racist .
But she understands it ’s probably impossible now to do her job on the council .
“ What else can I do ? ” Tucker said .
“ I ca n’t bring any more shame to the council . ”

The use of red light ticket cameras has spread to almost 300 cities across the United States .
The ticket camera promoters publicly proclaim that these cameras improve traffic safety .
Privately they tout the cameras ’ revenue generating potential to state and local officials .
By masquerading as a public interest organization named “ Stop Red Light Running ” the ticket camera merchants attend trade shows and put on “ dog and pony ” events complete with victims , ( courtesy of the MADD playbook ) and local officials who tout the wonders of red light ticket cameras .
On the public podium its all about safety , in the backrooms the name of the game is how much revenue can be generated .
Where ’s the press ?
Why is n’t it pointed out that the “ Stop Red Light Running ” organization is nothing more than a public relations / lobbying organization funded by ticket camera companies ?
There are numerous independent studies that document the fact that red light ticket cameras increase accidents , injuries and property damage , but the average news article tells readers just the opposite and regurgitates the self - serving claims of ticket camera merchants and the cities that use this equipment .
One exception to this “ asleep at the switch ” pattern was the Washington Post ’s review and analysis of Washington D.C ’s camera enforcement program .
The city proclaimed great safety benefits through the use of ticket cameras and , by the way , raked in tens of millions of dollars .
However , when Washington Post reporters dug into the actual records they found traffic safety had declined in general and specifically at camera enforced locations .
When cameras took North Carolina by storm the press dutifully parroted the safety motivations for installing red light cameras .
But , when the cameras were shut off because the cities could n’t keep the fine money ( constitutional requirement that fines must go to local school districts ) no media sage was asking “ why are n’t the cameras kept on for safety purposes ? ”
The obvious answer is there was no safety purpose , the red light cameras were / are just a politically expedient way to rip off motorists .
The overwhelming majority of red light violations can be traced to poorly designed , improperly maintained , and incompetently operated traffic signal systems .
To exploit these correctable shortcomings to raise revenue is unethical if not criminal .

Next time the baby shoots you a dirty look , it might not be gas .
Instead , the baby might be really disgusted by your behavior .
Interpersonal interaction is a major survival feature of the human species and so it's not surprising that we come hard - wired with the mental power to track relationships .
The big news is that we also start very early to track how others play out those rules , even when the interaction has nothing to do with us .
Babies have far more social smarts than we give them credit for .
For instance , research on babies has shown for years that they recognize and prefer a human face .
Put a Picasso face arrangement — with eyes where the nose should be — in their line of vision and babies look away in disgust .
But present them with a real face or a picture of a real face , and they are captivated .
Also , as early as 3 weeks of age , a baby can tell the difference between an object and a person , and they prefer the person .
Babies are also adept social butterflies , born with the rules of engagement etched on their brains .
Pediatrician T. Barry Brazleton has shown that there is a certain set rhythm to the social interactions of mothers and babies .
They engage ( what we often call " play " ) , then the baby cuts out and has down time , and then they start up again .
The baby is designed to participate in this inter-personal tango ( and so are adults ) , and mothers quickly know that something is wrong if the baby does n't connect with her .
Experiments years ago by Jeffery Cohn and Edward Tronick of Children 's Hospital in Boston also showed that babies have a natural distrust of even their most trusted caretakers when the social rules are not followed .
Mothers were instructed to not respond when the baby reached to get her attention for a little one - on - one interaction .
Instead , mothers looked back at the baby with a blank face and did n’t move .
Aghast , the babies kept trying for a while and then gave up , went limp and turned away .
More startlingly , when the mothers were told to engage again , the babies refused , at first , to pay attention .
They just did n’t trust someone who ignored the rules of engagement , even for a minute .
Psychologist J. Kiley Hamlin and colleagues of Yale University recently showed 6 - to 10 - month old babies various social situations using triangles , squares and circles that play acted helping or hindering each other .
The babies clearly disliked the objects that did n't help out .
The psychologists concluded that babies are good judges of character , even when they 're not directly involved in the action .
This research is a surprise because no one thought babies were paying that much attention to the acts of others .
And no one realized baby judgments were so harsh .
Apparently , we were fooled into thinking babies were social dunces by their sneaky ways .
Human babies , with their wobbly heads and unfocused stares , look like they are n't paying attention to much of anything .
So remember , the baby is watching .
That spaced - out look on her face might not be the start of a nap but the very moment in which she is deciding if you , in particular , are trustworthy .

Research reported December 11 in the journal Advanced Materials describes a potentially promising strategy for encouraging the regeneration of damaged central nervous system cells known as neurons .
The technique would use a biodegradable polymer containing a chemical group that mimics the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to spur the growth of neurites , which are projections that form the connections among neurons and between neurons and other cells .
The biomimetic polymers would then guide the growth of the regenerating nerve .
There is currently no treatment for recovering human nerve function after injury to the brain or spinal cord because central nervous system neurons have a very limited capability of self - repair and regeneration .
“ Regeneration in the central nervous system requires neural activity , not just neuronal growth factors alone , so we thought a neurotransmitter might send the necessary signals , ” said Yadong Wang , assistant professor in the Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University , and principal investigator of the study .
The research was supported by Georgia Tech , the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering ( NIBIB ) .
Chemical neurotransmitters relay , amplify and modulate signals between a neuron and another cell .
This new study shows that integrating neurotransmitters into biodegradable polymers results in a biomaterial that successfully promotes neurite growth , which is necessary for victims of central nervous system injury , stroke or certain neurodegenerative diseases to recover sensory , motor , cognitive or autonomic functions .
Wang and graduate student Christiane Gumera developed novel biodegradable polymers with a flexible backbone that allowed neurotransmitters to be easily added as a side chain .
In its current form , the polymer would be implanted via surgery to repair damaged central nerves .
“ One of our ultimate goals is to create a conduit for nerve regeneration that guides the neurons to regenerate , but gradually degrades as the neurons regenerate so that it wo n’t constrict the nerves permanently , ” explained Wang .
For the experiments , the researchers tested polymers with different concentrations of the acetylcholine - mimicking groups .
Acetylcholine was chosen because it is known to induce neurite outgrowth and promote the formation and strengthening of synapses , or connections between neurons .
They isolated ganglia nervous tissue samples , placed them on the polymers and observed new neurites extend from the ganglia .
Since these neuron extensions must traverse a growth inhibiting material in the body , Wang and Gumera tested the ability of the biomaterial to enhance the extension of sprouted neurites .
More specifically , they assessed whether the ganglia sprouted at least 20 neurites and then measured neurite length and neurite length distribution with an inverted phase contrast microscope .
“ We found that adding 70 percent acetylcholine to the polymer induced regenerative responses similar to laminin , a benchmark material for nerve culture , ” said Wang .
Seventy percent acetylcholine also led to a neurite growth rate of up to 0.7 millimeters per day , or approximately half the thickness of a compact disc .
Laminin is a natural protein present in the nervous tissues , but it dissolves in water , making it difficult to incorporate into a conduit that needs to support nerves for months .
A synthetic polymer with acetylcholine functional groups , on the other hand , can be designed to be insoluble in water , according to Wang .
Since functional restoration after nerve injury requires synapse formation , the researchers also searched for the presence of synaptic vesicle proteins on the newly formed neurites .
With fluorescence imaging , they found that neurons cultured on these acetylcholine polymers expressed an established neuronal marker called synaptophysin .
To provide insights to new approaches in functional nerve regeneration , the researchers are currently investigating the mechanisms by which the neurons interact with these polymers .
Since neurons that remain intact after severe injury have only a limited capacity to penetrate the scar tissue , these new findings in nerve regeneration could help compensate for the lost connections .
“ This polymer and approach are n’t limited to nerve regeneration though , they can probably be used for other neurodegenerative disorders as well , ” added Wang .

ニコニコ動画の開発に初期段階から携わり、現在のシステムの基礎を築いたドワンゴ 研究開発部 技術支援セクションの戀塚（こいづか）昭彦氏。1990年代にネットワークゲーム開発者集団「Bio_100％」の一員として活躍し、さまざまなソフトを個人でも開発、提供してきた経験を持つ凄腕プログラマーだ。
CNET Japanでは戀塚氏にニコニコ動画の誕生にまつわる開発秘話や、ネットコミュニティと良い関係を築く運営ノウハウなどについて話を聞くことができた。その模様を前編、後編に分けて紹介する。なお、前半は開発秘話、後編は運営ノウハウを中心にまとめている。
――プロトタイプを開発した経緯を聞かせてください。
もともとは、弊社の中野（ドワンゴ ニコニコ事業部第一セクション セクションマネージャーの中野真氏）が最初のプロトタイプを作ったんです。これは動画とコメントを同時に処理することが技術的に可能かを実験するためのものでした。コメントを動画の下にタイミングを合わせて表示するだけで、動画上に重なっているというものではなかったんです。
もうちょっと企画としておもしろい見せ方ができるということで、ユビキタスエンターテインメントの布留川（英一）さんが動画の上にコメントを流して表示した。それを実際に当社としてサービスをするということで、私に声がかかりました。
動いている物を見せてもらって、「こういうのがやりたい、すぐに欲しい」という話だったので3営業日で作りました。
――プロトタイプを見たときには、どう思いましたか。
実は何年か前に社内で 「未来リビング」という研究プロジェクトがあり、結果としては結構似たコンセプトのことをやっていたんです。実装は違うんですが、２ちゃんねるの実況スレッドと、放映されているテレビ番組を重ねて表示する仕組みを、社内の別の人間がやっていました。そのディスカッションに参加した関係で動画に対するアノテーション（関連情報をメタデータとして付与すること）は多少チェックしていましたので、その話が進化して戻ってきたという感じがしました。
――いくつかの技術を組み合わせればできる、という感覚があったと聞きました。
材料がすでにあるという感覚はありました。話を聞く直前に、必要な要素技術がちょうどそろったところだったんです。
まず、ウェブサーバを構築するためのPHPについては、直前にちょうどノウハウができたところでした。その直前にやった社内プロジェクトで初めてPHPに触ったので。
コメントサーバについては、もっと前のいくつかのプロジェクトでやったものが使えると感じました。2つくらい前の社内プロジェクトでActionScript（動画プレーヤーに採用したFlashで、ユーザーがコメントを書き込めるようにするためのスクリプト）に対応したパケット定義機能をちょうど追加したところだった。
Flashでのパケット定義システムがそろっていて、通信サーバもあって、PHPのノウハウもできて、と要素がちょうどそろった、ぴったりのタイミングでニコニコ動画の話が来たんです。覚えたばかりのことはすぐ使えるのでその場で作っちゃった、という感じですね。
― ―3営業日で完成させた、というのはかなりのスピードではないですか。
本当にタイミング良かった。その時点で必要な技術の知識がまだ記憶にある状態だったのですぐ使えたというのはありますね。もう少し時間がたっていたら思い出すのに時間がかかっていたと思います。
開発作業自体は、ウェブサーバ用のActionScriptとPHP、コメントサーバ用のC++の3つの言語を使って1人で同時に進めたので、フル回転でしたから、まぁ、やっぱりかなり会心の仕事だったというところはありますね。
サービスを立ち上げるときは、小さく始めるというのが成功の秘訣だといわれています。ニコニコ動画に関してはリリースの段階で機能を絞りこんで、できることを「動画上にコメントを載せる」ということ一本に絞ったんですね。ユーザー側も「それ以外に何もできないのであれば、それをすればいいんだ」と感じてくれたようで、うまく取り込めたようです。
その上、サービスの予告をしなかったので、サイトに来た人はかなりめざとい人だけで、かつ少人数でしたから、いろんな新しい使い方を模索してくれました。それを見ながら、どんな機能を付けていけばいいか、より楽しく見せるためにどうすればいいかを考えて改良していきました。
Dictionary.com defines overkill as " an excess of what is required or suitable , as because of zeal or misjudgment . "
We prefer a more visual definition , though .
To that end , overkill is ...
1 . Threatening to kill anyone who hits a dog YOU let run into the street .
2 . Having eight doorbells when it appears no one 's visiting anyway .
Dual_EC_DRBG
Added to Windows Vista
Microsoft has added the random - number generator Dual_EC - DRBG to Windows Vista , as part of SP1 .
Yes , this is the same RNG that could have an NSA backdoor .
It ’s not enabled by default , and my advice is to never enable it .
Ever .
EDITED TO ADD ( 12/18 ) : I should make this clear that the algorithm is available as a program call .
It is not something that the user can enable or disable .

In a double whammy of " OH , COME ON ! " inducing Nintendo news , it 's been confirmed that Metroid Prime 3 will not feature online multiplayer , and Super Smash Bros .
Brawl will not be featuring in a playable form at E3 .
Wired 's Game|Life is reporting that Nintendo will not be showing Super Smash Bros .
Brawl among this year 's E3 Wii line - up , instead focusing on never - before - seen software .
This is great and all , and with the smaller scale of this year 's E3 , I can see why they 'd do this .
Let 's hope those never - before - seen titles are n't five or six mini - game collections and a new Brain Age .
In other Wii news , Retro Studio's CEO and President Michael Kelbeugh has confirmed to GamePro that Metroid Prime 3 : Corruption will not feature online multiplayer .
Kelbeugh insists that resources were allocated towards making the single - player experience as solid as possible , and that 's certainly admirable .
But fans of the extremely solid Metroid Prime Hunters Wi - fi play are somewhere crying right now .
I hope you 're happy , Michael .
How Regexes Work
Mark - Jason Dominus
Copyright © 1998 The Perl Journal .
Reprinted with permission .
This is n't an article about how to use regexes ; you 've probably seen plenty of those already .
It 's about how you would write a regex package from scratch , in a language like C that does n't already have regexes .
I 'll demonstrate a new module , Regex.pm , which implements regexes from nothing , in Perl .
This will give you an idea of how regex matching is possible , although the details differ rather substantially from what Perl actually does .
Here 's the basic strategy :
We 'll see a simple kind of `machine ' that reads a input , one character at a time , and then , depending on what 's in the input and on the various wheels and gears in the machine , either says `yes ' or `no ' .
The machines are simple , and it turns out that if we have a regex , it 's not hard to construct a machine that says `yes ' for exactly those strings that match the regex , and `no ' for other strings .
When our program wants to see if S matched / R / , it 'll do something like this :
Look at R .
Construct the machine that corresponds to R .
Feed S into the machine .
If the machine says `yes ' , then S matched / R /.
Otherwise , it did n't .
Maybe this sounds bizarre , but bizarre or not , it 's what Perl does .
If you can follow what we do in this article , you 'll know what Perl is really up to when it does a regex match .
Machines
We 're on a tight budget here , so our machines will be made of circles and arrows instead of wheels and gears , which are expensive .
Here 's a machine :
Let 's see if this machine says `yes ' to the string " abaa " .
How do we do that ?
We start by putting a penny down on the M circle , because the M circle is the start circle .
We can tell that M is the start circle because it has that arrow pointing to it that says `start here ' .
The letter ` M ' could have been anything ; it 's not actually part of the machine .
I just put it on so that you would know which circle I meant .
Now the machine will read the first character in the string ; that 's " a " .
There 's an arrow leading out of the M circle that 's labeled " a " , so we move the penny along the arrow from M to J .
Next the machine will read the " b " .
The penny moves back to M .
Then the machine reads another " a " , and the penny moves back once more to J.
Finally , the machine reads the last " a " , and the penny follows the " a " arrow that leads from J back to J .
The penny is finally on circle J. We 're done .
So , how do we tell if the machine said `yes ' ?
The rule is this :
Some circles , like J , are double circles .
These are called final circles .
At the end of the input , if there are any pennies on final circles , the machine says `yes ' .
If no pennies are on final circles , the machine says `no ' .
In this case , there 's a penny on J , so the machine says `yes ' .
Now , that 's not so hard to do , and it 's easy to see that this machine will say `yes ' to some strings and `no ' to others .
It actually happens that it says yes to any string that is matched by the regex /^( b* a + ) ( b+a+ ) *$ / , and `no ' to all the strings that are not matched .
We say that the machine is equivalent to the regex .
Soon we 'll see how to make machines that are equivalent to any regexes we like .
First , though , we 'll add a couple of features to the machines that will make it easier to do this .
Blank Arrows
So far every arrow we 've seen has been labeled with a letter .
But some machines have unlabeled arrows , like this :
The instant a penny arrives in a circle that has a blank arrow leading out of it , we place another penny on the circle at the far end of the blank arrow .
Let 's look at the machine above .
Let 's see what it says about " ab " .
The start circle is V , so we start out by putting a penny there .
And then , because there 's a blank arrow from V to W , We immediately put a second penny on W .
Now the machine is ready to read input .
It reads the " a " .
the penny on V moves along the arrow to V , and the penny on W moves along the arrow to X , so we now have pennies on V and X .
Now , because there 's a blank arrow leading from X to Y , we place a third penny on Y , and because there 's a blank arrow from V to W , we place a fourth penny on W .
Next the machine reads " b " .
The penny on Y moves to Z .
But what happens to the pennies on V , W , and X ?
There 's a special rule for this :
Pennies that have nowhere to go must leave .
We take away the pennies on V , W , and X .
Only the penny on Z remains .
Now the machine is done reading the input .
There 's a penny on Z , which is a final circle , so the machine says `yes ' .
Sometimes a machine will have two arrows from the same circle that also have the same label :
The penny here starts on V .
What happens when this machine reads the string " b " ?
There 's a " b " arrow from V to W and also from V to X .
What happens ?
The rule here is simple :
The penny clones itself , and one clone goes one way and the other goes the other way ; we end up with pennies on both W and X .
You 'll notice blank arrows from X to Y and from X to Z ; as soon as the penny arrives at X , we put new pennies on Y and Z also .
Then , because a penny just arrived at Z , we put one on U as well .
Rules Again
Before we see how to turn a regex into a machine , let 's re-cap the rules for moving pennies :
To start , put a penny on the circle labeled `start here ' .
If there is a blank arrow leading from X to Y , then whenever a penny arrives at X , put another penny at Y also .
Whenever the machine reads an input character c , move all the pennies .
If a penny is on a circle that has an outgoing arrow labeled c , move the penny along the arrow , and then follow rule 2 if appropriate .
If there is more than one such arrow , the penny clones itself and one clone follows each arrow .
If a penny is on a circle with no arrow labeled c , remove that penny .
When all the input is read , the machine says `yes ' if any penny is on a final circle , and `no ' otherwise .
Perhaps you can imagine that it might no be hard to write a program to carry out these four simple rules , to keep track of where the pennies are , and to yield the final `yes ' or `no ' .
And in fact that 's exactly how regexes work .
Perl turns the regex into a machine , then simulates the positions of the pennies , and at the end of the input , reports on whether any pennies are on final circles .
Now the only question left is :
How can we turn a regex into a machine ?
How to Turn a Regex into a Penny Machine
First , we 're going to assume that all our regexes are anchored at the front and the back .
That is , we 're only going to deal with regexes that look like / ^P$ / , where P might be complicated .
It turns out that this does n't give anything away , because if /Q / is some regex that is n't anchored , then / ^.* Q.*$/ is a completely equivalent regex that matches the same strings , which is anchored .
If someone wanted us to make a machine for / Q/ , we could make one for / ^.* Q.*$/ instead , and they 'd never be the wiser .
From now on I 'm going to leave out the ^ and the $ , because it makes the examples simpler to read .
Now , there are two kinds of regexes .
Regexes are either very simple things like / x/ , or they 're built up from simpler regexes .
For example , if P is a regex , then P * is also a regex .
That means we 're going to have to do two things :
We 'll have to see how to build simple machines for the simple regexes , and we 'll have to see how to build up those simple machines into more complicated machines .
Here 's the machine for the regex /a/ :
Stare at it a while to convince yourself that it really says `yes ' only for the string " a " and not for any other string .
What does it say about " " ?
What about " b " ? " aa " ?
And here 's an even simpler machine ; it 's equivalent to the regex // .
( Remember that I left out ^ and $ , so // really matches only the empty string , " " , and the equivalent machine will say `yes ' only for the empty string . )
Now let 's suppose we already have machines for / P / and / Q/ , and let 's try to figure out how to make a machine for / P|Q / .
That 's also pretty easy :
The penny starts on the left , and immediately clones move to the circles that used to be the start circles for P and for Q .
For the machine to say `yes ' , the ` P ' penny must make its way to what used to be P 's final circle , or the ` Q ' penny must make its way to what used to be Q 's final circle ; if either of those things happen , the penny will clone itself to the real final circle on the far right .
If neither of those things happens , no penny will escape from either machine P or machine Q .
Any string that ` P ' would have matched will get a penny through P to the final circle , and any string that ` Q ' would have matched will get a penny through Q to the final circle , and so this machine says `yes ' for any string that either ` P ' or ` Q ' would have said `yes ' to , and not to any other strings .
That 's exactly what we wanted .
How about if we have machines for / P / and / Q / , and we want to make a machine for / PQ /?
We can do it like this :
It 's easy to see that we can chain together as many machines as we want this way .
For example , here is a machine that is equivalent to the regex / perl /:
Now let 's tackle P + , which turns out to be just a little easier than P * .
After the penny makes it through P , it clones itself ; one clone moves to the final circle right away , and one moves back to the beginning of P to try again , in case there are more P's coming up .
Now that we 've seen this , P * is easy too ; we just short - circuit the beginning to the end , so that the penny does n't have to go through P even once :
Oh , now we 're done .
What Do You Mean , Done ?
Well , we left out character classes .
But [ abc ] is just the same as ( a|b|c ) , so we can handle that all right by pretending that the user wrote it that way .
We left out \d , \s , and all those things .
But those are just character classes .
. is also a character class if we do n't mind writing it as ( \000 | \001 | ... | \ 255 ) .
That makes the machine big and inefficient , but hey , just so long as it works .
We 'll see later on how to make it better .
We left out ? .
But P ? is just the same as ( P | ) , so it 's really there too .
And we left out { n } .
But P {3} is just the same as PPP , so we really do n't need { n } . { m , } and { m , n } are similar .
We left out the `non - greedy ' quantifiers .
But those do n't change whether the regexes will match , so they do n't affect our program ; we can ignore them .
We left out ^ and $ , but they 're in there by default ; if you want to take them away you can attach .* at the beginning or the end or both .
We left out zero - width assertions like \b and ( ?:...) and ( ?!...) .
But this is an introductory article and I made a command decision to leave them out .
We also left out backreferences , but I 'll show how to put them in later , just to prove I 'm not a slacker .
That about covers it , right ?
( Leafing through perlre man page ....)
Yes , I was right .
We 're done .
By the way , this construction for turning regexes into machines was invented in 1968 by Ken Thompson .
You may have heard of Thompson already : He and Dennis Ritchie invented Unix around the same time .
The Module
The module has three parts .
It has a part for turning strings into regexes , a part for turning regexes into machines , and a part for shuffling the pennies around .
Here 's a program that looks to see if the pattern / ^ab +$ / matches the string " abbbbb " :
use Regex ; $ regex = Regex -> parse ( 'ab + ' ) ; #
Parse the string $ machine = NFA -> compile ( $ regex ) ; # Build the machine $ result = NFA_Exec -> match ( $ machine , ' abbbbb ' ) ; # Pennies print " It " , ( $result ?
" did " : " did not " ) , " match .
" ;
The output , as we would hope , is
It did match .
Now you can go try it yourself .
It lives at http://perl.plover.com/Regex/Regex.pm.
There 's a sample program at http://perl.plover.com/Regex/grep.
Implications for Perl
Is this really what Perl does ?
Pretty much , except Perl 's regexes are written in C , while Regex.pm is written in Perl .
Perl parses the regex string into an internal format , and then it turns the internal format into a machine .
Perl 's machine works a little differently from the ones I showed , but in principle it 's the same .
Constructing the machine for a certain regex can take a relatively long time , but once it 's constructed , running an input through it is very fast , and you can runs lots of different inputs through it without reconstructing it .
That is just what Perl does do ; at the time you first run your program , it turns all your regexes into machines and saves the machines for later .
Then it can do fast pattern - matching with any of them because the machines are already on the shelf waiting to be used .
Actually , I lied ;
Perl can't always build the machines as soon as you run your program .
Consider this program , which reads an input , and prints out each line if it happens to contain its own line number ( $. is the line number of the current line of input ) :
while ( <>) { print if /$./ ; }
Perl can't possibly build the machine for /$./ as soon as your program is run , because /$./ changes from line to line .
Perl has to build a new machine every time through the loop .
That makes this a slow program .
Let 's consider a slightly different program .
This one is like the Unix grep command : you give it a pattern as the command - line argument , and it prints all the lines from its input that match that pattern :
my $ pat = shift ; while ( <> ) { print if / $ pat / ; }
Again ,
Perl rebuilds the machine every time through the loop .
It does this because it it afraid that $ pat might have changed since last time , and it is too dumb to see that actually $ pat never changes .
If only there were a way to tell Perl that $ pat never changes !
There is a way to tell Perl that $ pat never changes :
my $ pat = shift ; while ( <> ) { print if / $ pat /o ; }
The /o tells
Perl that $ pat never changes .
Normally ,
Perl likes to build the machine when it compiles the rest of your program .
For regexes with variables in them , it rebuilds the machine every time it uses the regex --- unless you put in /o .
If you put in /o , Perl builds the machine for the regex exactly once ( o is for `once ' ) , the first time it uses the regex , and puts it on the shelf for later .
After the first time , it assumes that the variables are always the same , and it uses the machine from the shelf instead of making a new one every time .
Beginners are always writing slow program like this :
my @pats = ( ' fo * ' , ' ba . ' , ' w+3 ' ) ; while ( <> ) { foreach $ pat ( @pats ) { print if / $ pat / ; } }
Here , again , Perl has to build a new machine every time $ pat changes .
You can make this program much faster by writing it like this :
my @pats = ( ' fo * ' , ' ba . ' , ' w+3 ' ) ; my $ pat = join ( '| ' , @pats ) ; while ( <> ) { print if / $ pat /o ; }
By arranging to have only one pattern that never changes , instead of three patterns that are used alternately , we can tell Perl to build a regex machine exactly once instead of three times for every line of input .
What About Backreferences ?
I promised to show you how to do this to prove I was n't a slacker .
You can skip this section if you do n't care how to do backreferences , as long as you agree first that I 'm not a slacker .
Just to make things a little easier to discuss , we 'll pretend that you can have only one backreference in each regex .
\ 1 will work , and \ 2 , \ 3 , etc. wo n't .
After you see how we can make \ 1 work , it 'll be easy to see how to make the rest work too .
To do backreferences , we need to add a tape recorder to each penny .
If the tape recorder is on , it records the input that the machine is receiving .
We also add three new kinds of circles : A `record ' circle ; a `stop ' circle , and `replay ' circle .
When the penny enters a `record ' circle , its tape recorder starts recording .
When the penny enters a ` stop ' circle , it stops recording .
The `replay ' circle is a little different .
It has exactly one outgoing arrow .
When the penny enters the `replay ' circle , it stops and rewinds the tape .
Then it waits on the replay circle while the machine reads more input , and it compares the input to what 's on the tape .
If the input does n't match what 's on the tape , or if the input runs out before the tape does , the penny dies .
But if the input does match the tape , the penny immediately moves off the `replay ' circle along the outgoing arrow , and then it continues moving normally .
If P is a regex , here 's how we build the machine for /( P ) / ; it 's just like / P / except it also records the input that matched P :
/ \1 /
/(a+ ) \1 /
Let 's see what happens when this machines reads the string " aaaa " .
We put a penny on S1 , the start circle , and the penny immediately begins recording on its tape recorder .
The penny clones itself and its tape recorder , and clones move to U and to V .
Now , every time the machine reads an " a " , a penny gets through to W with an additional " a " written on its tape .
This penny moves through to E1 , which shuts off the tape recorder .
The first such penny has just " a " on is tape ; it arrives at R1 ; when the machine reads the second " a " it moves to Z , and then on the third " a " it dies .
But the second penny to come out at X has two " a " s on its tape ; it gets out of R1 just after the machine reads the third and fourth " a " s , and it gets to Z just in time for the end of the input .
The penny on Z at the end of the input signals an `accept ' , and the " aa " on its tape means that $ 1 is " aa " .
There were two other pennies that came out at X , one with " aaa " and one with " aaaa " no its tape .
But these pennies stayed stuck in R1 waiting for the machine to read more " a " s .
Now , if you want to have more backreferences , you just add more tape recorders to each penny .
And you have one kind of `record ' , `stop ' , and `replay ' circle for every backreference .
/ \3 / becomes a circle that says `replay tape 3 ' , and the fifth ( in a regex becomes a circle that says `start recording on tape 5 ' .
Internals
NFA :: compile transforms a regex into a machine , following pretty much the same steps that we did in the article .
It starts with the sub - expressions , and then combines smaller machines into one large machine .
The structure for a machine is so simple that I 'll just give an example :
Has the following representation :
{ A => { '' =>
B , # Unlabeled arrow from A to B 'x ' =>
C , # Arrow labeled `x ' from A to C } , B => { } , # No arrows from B C => { ' q ' =>
B } , # Arrow labeled `q ' from C to B Symbols => [ A , B ] , # These are the start and final circles .
}
This is convenient because it 's easy to look up where a given penny should move to when the machine reads a certain character in the input .
The best way to see what the module is really doing is to run the test program under the debugger and ask it to print out the data structures .
Once you know about the machines and the pennies , the whole thing should be almost transparent .
( Warning :
The circle names are generated automatically , so they all have names like Saa01 . )
The module does a very ordinary simulation of where the pennies are after each character in the input .
Here 's a simple example :
When the input has run out , the simulator just looks to see if there is a penny on the final circle , something like this :
foreach $s ( $ self->circles_with_pennies ) { if ( $ self ->{machine}->is_final_circle ( $s ) ) { # Aha !
We win ! return 1 ; } } #
No penny was on a final circle ; pattern match fails .
return 0 ;
The real code uses technical jargon , but the code is identical except for the jargon .
You can find it in the function NFA_Exec : : final_state .
Lies
Perl does n't really do it exactly the way I showed you .
It 's close , and the principle is the same , but there 's one big difference .
The difference is that Perl never moves more than one penny at a time .
Whenever a penny clones itself , Perl makes a choice about which one to move , and saves the locations of the others .
If the penny that Perl is moving dies , it backtracks to one of the other pennies , and picks up where it left off .
This has a number of benefits .
If the penny Perl happens to be moving ends on the final circle at the end of the input , then Perl knows that the input matched , even though it did n't move the other pennies , so it was able to save time .
Alternatively , if the programmer asks for a second match , Perl just has to go back and try some more pennies until it finds a second one that wins ; the path that the second penny took is the second match .
When you move all the pennies at once , you get all the matches at once too , and there 's no good way to make use of all the information you get .
When a penny clones itself , Perl has to make a choice about which penny to follow and which one to save for later .
By making the decision one way , it gets the greedy operators * , + , and ?
; by choosing the other penny in each case , the operators become the non-greedy versions , *? , +? , and ?? .
The one - penny - at - a - time system that Perl uses is also more convenient for handling backreferences .
Instead of having to associate a set of tape recordings with each penny , Perl only needs to have one set of tape recordings for the single current penny , and some saved tape recordings for the pennies it might have to backtrack to .
However , the one - penny - at - a - time system also has a terrible drawback :
For some patterns , the number of saved pennies can get huge , and Perl can spend literally hours returning to one saved penny after another .
For example , here 's one such pattern : /^( \d+ ) *$ / .
For a complete discussion of a similarly rotten expression , see Jeffrey Friedl 's article in TPJ # 2 .
Here 's the short summary :
Any idiot can see that a string like 1234567890 : wo n't match because of the : on the end .
But Perl wastes a lot of time trying pointless backtracking .
Perl sees the * , and it needs to decide how many times to repeat the preceding expression , the ( \d + ) .
This means it gets to use as many \d+ 's as it wants to .
First it lets \d+ match 1234567890 , using only one \d+ , but that does n't work , because of the : , so Perl backs off and lets \d + match just 123456789 , and it uses a second \d + to match the 0 , but that does n't work either .
So it backs off some more and lets the first \d + match 012345678 , and the second match 90 .
That fails , so it tries making the second \d + match only the 9 , and uses a third instance of \d+ for the 0 .
That fails too , so it shortens the first \d+ again to match only the 01234567 ...
Oh , dear .
What a disaster .
The many - pennies - at - once approach can score a huge win here .
The machine does n't have very many circles , at most two for every symbol in the regular expression , and so there need never be very many pennies .
Suppose two pennies happen to move onto the same circle .
The one - at - a - time approach would have dealt with them separately , at different times .
But the many - pennies - at - once approach can replace these two pennies with one penny .
( FOOTNOTE : Only if we 're ignoring backreferences .
We can't join pennies if we 're saving backreferences , because the two pennies probably have different recordings on their tapes . )
The result : Fewer pennies get moved , and there 's no backtracking , and the regular expression finishes quickly instead of slowly .
The program at http://perl.plover.com/Regex/demo.pl demonstrates this :
It builds and runs the equivalent Regex . pm penny machine first , and that takes less than two seconds , even on a bitty box .
Then it tries using Perl 's built - in regular expressions , and that takes hours , even on a speedy computer .
Other Directions
For an easy project , try adding the . symbol .
You 'll have to modify the parser a little , and machines will need to have a new kind of arrow that indicates a transition on any input at all .
From there it's only a small step to adding general character classes .
OMAR might enjoy adding backreferences to the Regex module .
Probably the most difficult part will be fixing the string - to - regex parser , which is a terrible hack ; the rest of the code is much more flexible .
If you 're interested in the details of how Perl 's internal machines work , you might enjoy running
perl - Dr -ne ' print if / SOMETHING /';
to see what happens .
- Dr asks
Perl to display the details of its regular expression machinery , both at the times that the machines are constructed and at the times they 're used .
Be prepared for surprises !
For example , The * in /x */ is different from the * in /( xy ) */ .
The former is a real * , but Perl treats the latter as if you had written /( xy ) {0,32767} / instead .

A devoted father turned into a gambling addict and ran up £ 90,000 in debts after doctors prescribed him a drug to treat his Parkinson 's disease .
Paul McGarvey was 34 when he was diagnosed with the progressive and incurable neurological condition 18 years ago .
In 1997 as his condition worsened , doctors prescribed Pergolide - when , he claims , " a switch flicked in his head " turning him from a responsible family man into a compulsive gambler .
Scroll down for more ...
He had never placed a bet in his life before taking the drug , but quickly became obsessed with gambling and lost up to £ 250 a day in his six years on the prescription .
Mr McGarvey , 52 , a father of three from Kirkby , Merseyside , said : " I just changed overnight .
I started taking the tablets and started going into the betting shop at the same time .
" I never even had a bet on the Grand National before - I was hard - working and always regarded gambling as a mug 's game .
" Then I got prescribed this drug and I turned into someone else .
It was like having a switch turned on and I became driven to gamble .
" I ran up debts on credit cards and took out bank loans .
I borrowed off friends and family and lied and cheated to make sure I could gamble . "
Rita , his wife of 30 years , said : " I found slips from when things had been pawned .
Then we started getting hundreds of pounds in bank charges every month because there were direct debits coming out that there was no money to pay - now we 've got about £ 90,000 of debt . "
Mr McGarvey , a former tiler who had been earning more than £ 50,000 a year , was paying just £ 57 a month towards his mortgage and was due to pay it off this year .
Now the couple have consolidated their debts and have a mortgage of £ 500 a month until 2023 .
When he was taken off Pergolide after six years , his gambling addiction disappeared and he made the connection .
Mr McGarvey said : " Now they have warnings on the bottle explaining that a side - effect can be addictive behaviour .
" Doctors told me that they had banned the drug in the United States .
It 's scandalous that it was being prescribed here . "
The manufacturer , Lilly , agreed to withdraw the drug from the U.S. market last year after several published studies revealed a link between the drug and increased rates of heart problems .
Mr McGarvey is taking legal action against Lilly and wants to contact others who suffered similar reactions .
Pergolide is thought to over - stimulate receptors in the brain which can lead to gambling addiction .
Other patients can become sex addicts .
Lilly says that pathological gambling is a known but very rare side - effect of taking Pergolide .
Dr Kieron Breen , from the Parkinson 's Disease Society , said : " It is estimated that up to 14 per cent of people who take this class of drug will have some form of compulsive behaviour . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States has a sharply higher rate of women dying during or just after pregnancy than European countries , even some relatively poor countries such as Macedonia and Bosnia , according to the first estimates in five years on maternal deaths worldwide .

The report released by various United Nations agencies and the World Bank on Friday shows that Ireland has the lowest rate of deaths , while several African countries have the worst .
The United States has a far higher death rate than the European average , the report shows , with one in 4,800 U.S. women dying from complications of pregnancy or childbirth , the same as Belarus and just slightly better than Serbia ’s rate of one in 4,500 .
Just one out of 47,600 women in Ireland die during or just after childbirth , the report found .
Bosnia had the second - lowest rate , with 1 in 29,000 women dying during pregnancy and childbirth .
“ Among the ten top - ranked European and other industrialized countries , where women are guaranteed good - quality health and family planning services that minimize their lifetime risk , fewer than one in 16,400 will die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth , ” the United Nations , which issued the report along with the World Bank , said in a statement .
“ At the other end of the scale are ten countries where high fertility and shattered health care systems raise women ’s lifetime risk so that more than one in every 15 women will die of pregnancy - related causes , ” it said .
The report , published in the Lancet medical journal , places the United States 41st among 171 countries .
The four lowest - ranked countries in the report are Chad , with 1 in 11 women dying in pregnancy or childbirth , Afghanistan and Sierra Leone with one in eight , and Niger losing one in seven mothers .
“ Americans tend to be complacent about pregnancy and childbirth .
Most believe it is now more or less routine and no longer the deadly risk it was for their grandmothers .
This is true for most U.S. women , but by no means for all , ” the U.N. - led group said in a statement .
The group includes U.N. agencies such as the World Health Organization and UNICEF , the World Bank and Family Care International .
According to the U.S. National center for Health Statistics , about 6 million U.S. women get pregnant every year .
Four million children are born , about 1 million pregnancies end in miscarriages and another 1 million in induced abortion .
The major direct causes of U.S. pregnancy - related deaths are blood clots , hemorrhage , complications of medical conditions , and eclampsia and pre-eclampsia , which are marked by dangerously high blood pressure .
The death rate among U.S. black women was nearly four times the rate found among non-Hispanic white women -- 34.7 deaths per 100,000 live births for blacks versus 9.3 per 100,000 live births for whites , the report said .
NYT : Documents reveal foreign fighters in Iraq are tied to US allies RAW STORY
Published : Thursday November 22 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Documents uncovered after a raid reveal that foreign fighters in Iraq are tied to countries that the United States calls allies , according to a front page story in Thursday 's New York Times .
" Saudi Arabia and Libya , both considered allies by the United States in its fight against terrorism , were the source of about 60 percent of the foreign fighters who came to Iraq in the past year to serve as suicide bombers or to facilitate other attacks , according to senior American military officials , " Richard A. Oppel reports for the paper .
The article continues , " The data come largely from a trove of documents and computers discovered in September , when American forces raided a tent camp in the desert near Sinjar , close to the Syrian border .
The raids target was an insurgent cell believed to be responsible for smuggling the vast majority of foreign fighters into Iraq . "
Excerpts from article : #
The most significant discovery was a collection of biographical sketches that listed hometowns and other details for more than 700 fighters brought into Iraq since August 2006 .
The records also underscore how the insurgency in Iraq remains both overwhelmingly Iraqi and Sunni .
American officials now estimate that the flow of foreign fighters was 80 to 110 per month during the first half of this year and about 60 per month during the summer .
The numbers fell sharply in October to no more than 40 , partly as a result of the Sinjar raid , the American officials say .
Saudis accounted for the largest number of fighters listed on the records by far  305 , or 41 percent  American intelligence officers found as they combed through documents and computers in the weeks after the raid .
The data show that despite increased efforts by Saudi Arabia to clamp down on would - be terrorists since Sept. 11 , 2001 , when 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi , some Saudi fighters are still getting through .
Libyans accounted for 137 foreign fighters , or 18 percent of the total , the senior American military officials said .
They discussed the raid with the stipulation that they not be named because of the delicate nature of the issue .

Julia Sweeney says she was a “ happy Catholic girl ” when , one day , she walked into church and signed up for a Bible - study course .
“ What an eye opener that was ! ” she says .
“ Next thing you know , I was on a quest for something I could really believe in .
I traveled to places like Bhutan , Ecuador , and my local Starbucks looking for answers .
Would I embrace Buddhism ?
New Age pseudo - science ?
Was I a freak for feeling the way I did , or were there other people out there just like me ?
I was grappling with serious questions .
But , somehow , a lot of the things that were happening to me seemed , well , funny . ”
Equally comedic and insightful , Letting Go of God is Sweeney ’s brilliant one - woman show about her struggle with her faith .
Grappling with the seeming contradictions in Adam and Eve , Noah , the Ten Commandments , and even the teachings of Jesus - and trying to understand the Bible ’s messages about morality , family values , and human suffering while faced with door - knocking Mormons and wise - cracking priests - Sweeney takes listeners on her very personal journey from God to “ not - God ” .

The music labels ' case against Jeffrey and Pamela Howell has taken on mythic dimensions over the last few weeks after the Washington Post went a little nuts and implied that the labels were suing the couple for making personal rips of their CDs ( it later corrected the story ) .
The truth is that Howells are being sued for having those rips in a shared KaZaA folder .
But lost in the controversy over the RIAA 's refusal to say that personal CD ripping is legal is the fact that the Howells are n't being sued for swapping songs with thousands of people around the world ; instead , they are charged with making songs " available " for download .
In a new amicus brief ( PDF ) , the EFF argues that there 's no such thing as " attempted copyright infringement . "
Yet .
The labels allege that 11 specific tracks were shared by the Howells , though the only evidence of such sharing was the fact that the files were in a shared folder and were also downloaded by the RIAA 's investigative arm , MediaSentry ( now SafeNet ) .
According to the EFF , though , this simply is not evidence of actual copyright infringement .
The group takes no position on whether the Howells are guilty or not , but it does want to challenge this particular method of attack .
Because the law specifically gives copyright owners the ability to control copies distributed " to the public , " the music labels need to show that such distribution took place .
The EFF points out that the copyright holder itself can hardly be considered " the public , " and goes on to claim that " an authorized agent acting on behalf of the copyright owner also cannot infringe any rights held by that owner . "
Their conclusion is therefore that " where the only evidence of infringing distribution consists of distributions to authorized agents of the copyright owner , that evidence cannot , by itself , establish that other , unauthorized distributions have taken place . "
The music labels appear to be claiming , in essence , that because MediaSentry was able to download the files , it 's pretty darn likely that at least one member of the public did so — but they do n't actually offer evidence that this happened .
The EFF , turning to mathematics to defend its argument , points out that 2.2 million KaZaA users were online back when MediaSentry grabbed the files in question .
Because the songs in question were from hit records and not niche indie bands , the EFF says that " it is highly unlikely that , among the millions of KaZaA users who are likely to be sharing them at any time , these 11 songs would have been downloaded from Defendants ' computer . "
The EFF wants to put the brakes on the labels ' " making available " theory and force the labels to show actual distribution to members of the public .
The ramifications extend far beyond this particular case and even beyond the music industry 's lawsuits in general , and could affect everything from satellite radio to search engines .
Although attempted copyright infringement is n't yet illegal , it could be in the future .
Rep. Steve Chabot ( R - OH ) introduced the Intellectual Property Enhanced Criminal Enforcement Act of 2007 last summer .
The bill , which was backed by the Justice Department , would allow some prosecutions for " attempted infringement . "
That bill , fortunately , has gone nowhere .
Yet .
Pentagon wants to create space vehicle to fire missiles anywhere on Earth John Byrne
Published : Monday November 12 , 2007

Print This Email This $ 100 million from sub-missile program Buried in the 621 - page House - Senate conference report on the Defense Department appropriations bill -- and page A19 of Monday 's Washington Post , is a $ 100 million request to enhance space warfare .
As if it did n't already have enough work in Iraq , the Pentagon plans to divert funds from an appropriation to improve submarine - launched Trident missiles to develop a " global strike " program which would allow the US to target and dispatch a " precision - guided " warhead anywhere in the world within two hours .
" The new program , dubbed Falcon , for ' Force Application and Launch from CONUS , ' centers on a small - launch - vehicle concept of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , " veteran intelligence reporter Walter Pincus reveals in today 's paper .
" The agency describes Falcon as a 'a reusable Hypersonic Cruise Vehicle ( HCV ) capable of delivering 12,000 pounds of payload at a distance of 9,000 nautical miles from [ the continental United States ] in less than two hours . ' "
" The vehicle would be launched into space on a rocket , fly on its own to a target , deliver its payload and return to Earth , " he adds .
" In the short term , a small launch rocket is being developed as part of Falcon .
It eventually would be able to boost the hypersonic vehicle into space .
But in the interim , it will be used to launch small satellites within 48 hours ' notice at a cost of less than $ 5 million a shot . "
Falcon is part of the $ 459 billion military bill before Congress .
Pincus says the House and Senate also added $ 100 million beyond Bush 's request for " space situational awareness , " legal jargon for protecting US satellites in space and being able to attack " the enemy 's satellites . "
" Enhancing these capabilities is critical , particularly following the Chinese anti-satellite - weapons demonstration last January , " the House - Senate conferees wrote in thereport , referring to a January incident in which the Chinese targeted and destroyed a weather satellite in orbit .
An earlier iteration of this story characterized the space vehicle as a satellite , which it is not under a strict definition of the word .
Israel , without the United States , would probably not exist .
The country came perilously close to extinction during the October 1973 war when Egypt , trained and backed by the Soviet Union , crossed the Suez and the Syrians poured in over the Golan Heights .
Huge American military transport planes came to the rescue .
They began landing every half - hour to refit the battered Israeli army , which had lost most of its heavy armor .
By the time the war was over , the United States had given Israel $ 2.2 billion in emergency military aid .
The intervention , which enraged the Arab world , triggered the OPEC oil embargo that for a time wreaked havoc on Western economies .
This was perhaps the most dramatic example of the sustained life - support system the United States has provided to the Jewish state .
Israel was born at midnight May 14 , 1948 .
The U.S. recognized the new state 11 minutes later .
The two countries have been locked in a deadly embrace ever since .
Washington , at the beginning of the relationship , was able to be a moderating influence .
An incensed President Eisenhower demanded and got Israel ’s withdrawal after the Israelis occupied Gaza in 1956 .
During the Six - Day War in 1967 , Israeli warplanes bombed the USS Liberty .
The ship , flying the U.S. flag and stationed 15 miles off the Israeli coast , was intercepting tactical and strategic communications from both sides .
The Israeli strikes killed 34 U.S. sailors and wounded 171 .
The deliberate attack froze , for a while , Washington ’s enthusiasm for Israel .
But ruptures like this one proved to be only bumps , soon smoothed out by an increasingly sophisticated and well - financed Israel lobby that set out to merge Israeli and American foreign policy in the Middle East .
Israel has reaped tremendous rewards from this alliance .
It has been given more than $ 140 billion in U.S. direct economic and military assistance .
It receives about $ 3 billion in direct assistance annually , roughly one - fifth of the U.S. foreign aid budget .
Although most American foreign aid packages stipulate that related military purchases have to be made in the United States , Israel is allowed to use about 25 percent of the money to subsidize its own growing and profitable defense industry .
It is exempt , unlike other nations , from accounting for how it spends the aid money .
And funds are routinely siphoned off to build new Jewish settlements , bolster the Israeli occupation in the Palestinian territories and construct the security barrier , which costs an estimated $ 1 million a mile .
The barrier weaves its way through the West Bank , creating isolated pockets of impoverished Palestinians in ringed ghettos .
By the time the barrier is finished it will probably in effect seize up to 40 percent of Palestinian land .
This is the largest land grab by Israel since the 1967 war .
And although the United States officially opposes settlement expansion and the barrier , it also funds them .
The U.S. has provided Israel with nearly $ 3 billion to develop weapons systems and given Israel access to some of the most sophisticated items in its own military arsenal , including Blackhawk attack helicopters and F - 16 fighter jets .
The United States also gives Israel access to intelligence it denies to its NATO allies .
And when Israel refused to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , the United States stood by without a word of protest as the Israelis built the region ’s first nuclear weapons program .
U.S. foreign policy , especially under the current Bush administration , has become little more than an extension of Israeli foreign policy .
The United States since 1982 has vetoed 32 Security Council resolutions critical of Israel , more than the total number of vetoes cast by all the other Security Council members .
It refuses to enforce the Security Council resolutions it claims to support .
These resolutions call on Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories .
There is now volcanic anger and revulsion by Arabs at this blatant favoritism .
Few in the Middle East see any distinction between Israeli and American policies , nor should they .
And when the Islamic radicals speak of U.S. support of Israel as a prime reason for their hatred of the United States , we should listen .
The consequences of this one - sided relationship are being played out in the disastrous war in Iraq , growing tension with Iran , and the humanitarian and political crisis in Gaza .
It is being played out in Lebanon , where Hezbollah is gearing up for another war with Israel , one most Middle East analysts say is inevitable .
The U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East is unraveling .
And it is doing so because of this special relationship .
The eruption of a regional conflict would usher in a nightmare of catastrophic proportions .
There were many in the American foreign policy establishment and State Department who saw this situation coming .
The decision to throw our lot in with Israel in the Middle East was not initially a popular one with an array of foreign policy experts , including President Harry Truman ’s secretary of state , Gen. George Marshall .
They warned there would be a backlash .
They knew the cost the United States would pay in the oil - rich region for this decision , which they feared would be one of the greatest strategic blunders of the postwar era .
And they were right .
The decision has jeopardized American and Israeli security and created the kindling for a regional conflagration .
The alliance , which makes no sense in geopolitical terms , does makes sense when seen through the lens of domestic politics .
The Israel lobby has become a potent force in the American political system .
No major candidate , Democrat or Republican , dares to challenge it .
The lobby successfully purged the State Department of Arab experts who challenged the notion that Israeli and American interests were identical .
Backers of Israel have doled out hundreds of millions of dollars to support U.S. political candidates deemed favorable to Israel .
They have brutally punished those who strayed , including the first President Bush , who they said was not vigorous enough in his defense of Israeli interests .
This was a lesson the next Bush White House did not forget .
George W. Bush did not want to be a one - term president like his father .
Israel advocated removing Saddam Hussein from power and currently advocates striking Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons .
Direct Israeli involvement in American military operations in the Middle East is impossible .
It would reignite a war between Arab states and Israel .
The United States , which during the Cold War avoided direct military involvement in the region , now does the direct bidding of Israel while Israel watches from the sidelines .
During the 1991 Gulf War , Israel was a spectator , just as it is in the war with Iraq .
President Bush , facing dwindling support for the war in Iraq , publicly holds Israel up as a model for what he would like Iraq to become .
Imagine how this idea plays out on the Arab street , which views Israel as the Algerians viewed the French colonizers during the war of liberation .
“ In Israel , ” Bush said recently , “ terrorists have taken innocent human life for years in suicide attacks .
The difference is that Israel is a functioning democracy and it ’s not prevented from carrying out its responsibilities .
And that ’s a good indicator of success that we ’re looking for in Iraq . ”
Americans are increasingly isolated and reviled in the world .
They remain blissfully ignorant of their own culpability for this isolation .
U.S. “ spin ” paints the rest of the world as unreasonable , but Israel , Americans are assured , will always be on our side .
Israel is reaping economic as well as political rewards from its lock - down apartheid state .
In the “ gated community ” market it has begun to sell systems and techniques that allow the nation to cope with terrorism .
Israel , in 2006 , exported $ 3.4 billion in defense products — well over a billion dollars more than it received in American military aid .
Israel has grown into the fourth largest arms dealer in the world .
Most of this growth has come in the so - called homeland security sector .
” The key products and services , ” as Naomi Klein wrote in The Nation , “ are hi-tech fences , unmanned drones , biometric IDs , video and audio surveillance gear , air passenger profiling and prisoner interrogation systems — precisely the tools and technologies Israel has used to lock in the occupied territories .
And that is why the chaos in Gaza and the rest of the region does n’t threaten the bottom line in Tel Aviv , and may actually boost it .
Israel has learned to turn endless war into a brand asset , pitching its uprooting , occupation and containment of the Palestinian people as a half - century head start in the ‘ global war on terror . ’ “
The United States , at least officially , does not support the occupation and calls for a viable Palestinian state .
It is a global player , with interests that stretch well beyond the boundaries of the Middle East , and the equation that Israel ’s enemies are our enemies is not that simple .
“ Terrorism is not a single adversary , ” John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt wrote in The London Review of Books , “ but a tactic employed by a wide array of political groups .
The terrorist organizations that threaten Israel do not threaten the United States , except when it intervenes against them ( as in Lebanon in 1982 ) .
Moreover , Palestinian terrorism is not random violence directed against Israel or ‘ the West ’ ; it is largely a response to Israel ’s prolonged campaign to colonize the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
More important , saying that Israel and the US are united by a shared terrorist threat has the causal relationship backwards : the US has a terrorism problem in good part because it is so closely allied with Israel , not the other way around . ”
Middle Eastern policy is shaped in the United States by those with very close ties to the Israel lobby .
Those who attempt to counter the virulent Israeli position , such as former Secretary of State Colin Powell , are ruthlessly slapped down .
This alliance was true also during the Clinton administration , with its array of Israel - first Middle East experts , including special Middle East coordinator Dennis Ross and Martin Indyk , the former deputy director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , AIPAC , one of the most powerful Israel lobbying groups in Washington .
But at least people like Indyk and Ross are sane , willing to consider a Palestinian state , however unviable , as long as it is palatable to Israel .
The Bush administration turned to the far - right wing of the Israel lobby , those who have not a shred of compassion for the Palestinians or a word of criticism for Israel .
These new Middle East experts include Elliott Abrams , John Bolton , Douglas Feith , the disgraced I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , Richard Perle , Paul Wolfowitz and David Wurmser .
Washington was once willing to stay Israel ’s hand .
It intervened to thwart some of its most extreme violations of human rights .
This administration , however , has signed on for every disastrous Israeli blunder , from building the security barrier in the West Bank , to sealing off Gaza and triggering a humanitarian crisis , to the ruinous invasion and saturation bombing of Lebanon .
The few tepid attempts by the Bush White House to criticize Israeli actions have all ended in hasty and humiliating retreats in the face of Israeli pressure .
When the Israel Defense Forces in April 2002 reoccupied the West Bank , President Bush called on then - Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to “ halt the incursions and begin withdrawal . ”
It never happened .
After a week of heavy pressure from the Israel lobby and Israel ’s allies in Congress , meaning just about everyone in Congress , the president gave up , calling Sharon “ a man of peace . ”
It was a humiliating moment for the United States , a clear sign of who pulled the strings .
There were several reasons for the war in Iraq .
The desire for American control of oil , the belief that Washington could build puppet states in the region , and a real , if misplaced , fear of Saddam Hussein played a part in the current disaster .
But it was also strongly shaped by the notion that what is good for Israel is good for the United States .
Israel wanted Iraq neutralized .
Israeli intelligence , in the lead - up to the war , gave faulty information to the U.S. about Iraq ’s alleged arsenal of weapons of mass destruction .
And when Baghdad was taken in April 2003 , the Israeli government immediately began to push for an attack on Syria .
The lust for this attack has waned , in no small part because the Americans do n’t have enough troops to hang on in Iraq , much less launch a new occupation .
Israel is currently lobbying the United States to launch aerial strikes on Iran , despite the debacle in Lebanon .
Israel ’s iron determination to forcibly prevent a nuclear Iran makes it probable that before the end of the Bush administration an attack on Iran will take place .
The efforts to halt nuclear development through diplomatic means have failed .
It does not matter that Iran poses no threat to the United States .
It does not matter that it does not even pose a threat to Israel , which has several hundred nuclear weapons in its arsenal .
It matters only that Israel demands total military domination of the Middle East .
The alliance between Israel and the United States has culminated after 50 years in direct U.S. military involvement in the Middle East .
This involvement , which is not furthering American interests , is unleashing a geopolitical nightmare .
American soldiers and Marines are dying in droves in a useless war .
The impotence of the United States in the face of Israeli pressure is complete .
The White House and the Congress have become , for perhaps the first time , a direct extension of Israeli interests .
There is no longer any debate within the United States .
This is evidenced by the obsequious nods to Israel by all the current presidential candidates with the exception of Dennis Kucinich .
The political cost for those who challenge Israel is too high .
This means there will be no peaceful resolution of the Palestinian - Israeli conflict .
It means the incidents of Islamic terrorism against the U.S. and Israel will grow .
It means that American power and prestige are on a steep , irreversible decline .
And I fear it also means the ultimate end of the Jewish experiment in the Middle East .
The weakening of the United States , economically and militarily , is giving rise to new centers of power .
The U.S. economy , mismanaged and drained by the Iraq war , is increasingly dependent on Chinese trade imports and on Chinese holdings of U.S. Treasury securities .
China holds dollar reserves worth $ 825 billion .
If Beijing decides to abandon the U.S. bond market , even in part , it would cause a free fall by the dollar .
It would lead to the collapse of the $ 7 - trillion U.S. real estate market .
There would be a wave of U.S. bank failures and huge unemployment .
The growing dependence on China has been accompanied by aggressive work by the Chinese to build alliances with many of the world ’s major exporters of oil , such as Iran , Nigeria , Sudan and Venezuela .
The Chinese are preparing for the looming worldwide clash over dwindling resources .
The future is ominous .
Not only do Israel ’s foreign policy objectives not coincide with American interests , they actively hurt them .
The growing belligerence in the Middle East , the calls for an attack against Iran , the collapse of the imperial project in Iraq have all given an opening , where there was none before , to America ’s rivals .
It is not in Israel ’s interests to ignite a regional conflict .
It is not in ours .
But those who have their hands on the wheel seem determined , in the name of freedom and democracy , to keep the American ship of state headed at breakneck speed into the cliffs before us .

OK , you would have thought that after all the heat that the Pentagon took for its inconsistent violence numbers they would have been very careful about the latest data that they issued in their September report to Congress .
But they were n’t .
There are significant inconsistencies between the numbers General Petraeus showed to Congress regarding civilian casualties and the numbers in the Pentagon ’s latest reports .
Again , Petraeus ’s numbers seem to make the period before the surge look worse and the numbers after the surge look much better .
I graphed the Pentgon ’s data on civilian casualties from its latest report ( Pg 20 ) .
The data is for daily casualties , which includes both wounded and killed ( I only included Iraqi civilians , which is the green bar ) .
I converted the numbers to monthly casualties and compared it to the civilian death numbers on Page 3 of General Petraeus ’s presentation to Congress .
I do n’t know if the data comes from the same source .
Although , to be clear the Pentagon report data comes from the database that Petraeus himself stated was the best source of information and was verified by two U.S. intel agencies .
Petraeus ’s data comes from “ Coalition and Host Nation Reporting . ”
I graphed everything based on eyeballing the data so the numbers are not exact .
Still , you ’d expect the Iraqi civilian death numbers to track the Iraqi dead and wounded numbers and obviously civilian dead should be lower than wounded and dead combined .
Unfortunately that is simply not the case .
Three observations :
According to the MNC - I data there has been no improvement since either December ( The numbers Petraeus and the Administration often cite ) or February ( when the surge actually began ) .
Why was n’t Congress shown these numbers in the presentation by General Petraeus ?
Why only the good news numbers ?
Why the lack of clarity on Petraeus ’s sourcing ?
Especially since he himself acknowledged that the best numbers come from the MNC - I database .
In terms of actual anomalies
Anomaly A : Somehow in December , the month that is always cited by the Pentagon and the Administration , Petraeus ’s Iraqi dead is actually greater than the MNC - I Iraqi Dead +
Wounded .
That makes absolutely no sense .
You ca n’t have more dead than dead and wounded combined .
Anomaly B : In the months after the surge begins Petraeus ’s Iraqi dead numbers are significantly lower than the dead + wounded numbers in the Pentagon report .
This is inconsistent with the entire history of the previous year , where the numbers track closely .
The only explanation would be a dramatic increase in the wounded to dead ratio .
Perhaps there were more car bombings that injured people but did n’t kill them , as opposed to close range executions where victims do not survive .
Or maybe there is another explanation .
Still it seems inconsistent to see this major split just as the surge begins ..
I ’ve also graphed what the wounded numbers should look like based on this data ( i.e. you can take the total civilian casualty numbers and subtract civilian deaths to find wounded ) .
Notice how in December 2006 and January 2007 the numbers are actually negative , which makes no sense at all .
By far the three highest months of wounded are March 2007 , April 2007 and August 2007 – after the surge has started .
Overall , the numbers used by Petraeus have the same effect as all the other inconsistencies .
They make the numbers right before the surge look extremely bad and the numbers during the surge look much better .
Maybe that ’s just a coincidence .
But it does raise more questions .
MIAMI ( Reuters ) - The U.S. military ’s operating manual for the Guantanamo prison camp has been posted on the Internet , providing a glimpse of the broad rules and tiniest minutia for detaining suspected terrorists .

The 238 - page manual , “ Standard Operating Procedures for Camp Delta , ” is dated March 27 , 2003 , and signed by Army Maj.
Gen. Geoffrey Miller , who was then the commander of the prison that still holds about 300 al Qaeda and Taliban suspects .
It appears to be an authentic copy of the rules as they existed at the time at the U.S. naval base in Cuba , a spokesman for the Guantanamo detention operation , Lt. Col .
Ed Bush , said on Wednesday .
It says incoming prisoners are to be held in near - isolation for the first two weeks to foster dependence on interrogators and “ enhance and exploit the disorientation and disorganization felt by a newly arrived detainee in the interrogation process . ”
Styrofoam cups must be confiscated if prisoners have written on them , apparently because prisoners have used cups to pass notes to other captives .
“ If the cup is damaged or destroyed , the detainee will be disciplined for destruction of government property , ” the rules say .
The manual was posted last week on the Wikileaks.org Web site , which invites whistle - blowers around the world to anonymously publish state documents containing evidence of government corruption and injustice .
The Guantanamo manual is stamped “ unclassified , ” and “ for official use only , ” meaning it was not secret but was never intended for mass distribution either .
The manual also indicates some prisoners were designated as off limits to visitors from the International Committee of the Red Cross , something the military has repeatedly denied .
Some rules seem obvious .
One advises troops : “ In the event that dumpsters become full before scheduled pick up , utilize another dumpster within the camp . ”
Another notes that “ Detainees are not allowed to color their hair . ”
Allegations of abuse at Guantanamo have been lodged for years by prisoners , their lawyers , human rights monitors and a few military or government employees who worked at Guantanamo .
The manual clearly mandates humane treatment and advises that “ Abuse , or any form of corporal punishment is prohibited . ”
INSTRUCTIONS ONLY MILITARY COULD WRITE
It contains instructions as only the military can write them , such as how to use pepper spray on unruly prisoners .
“ Aim at the eyes , nose and mouth when possible .
Use a 1 / 2 to 1 second burst from a distance of 36 to 72 inches away . ”
When prisoners are forcibly removed from their cells , the role of each member of the five - member “ Immediate Reaction Force team ” is clearly defined -- “ The number three man is responsible for securing the detainee ’s left arm ... ”
The manual spells out in minute detail how captives should be shackled , searched and moved and how the chains should be collected afterward .
Four pages are devoted to describing how new arrivals should be taken off the plane and ferried across Guantanamo Bay to the prison camp on the main portion of the base -- with one sniper and two spotters atop the ferry .
Prisoners are to be checked for scars , markings and tattoos , which are to be photographed for FBI records , and a linguist should be present to explain what is happening when body cavity searches are conducted , the rule book says .
Bush , the Guantanamo spokesman , said there have been three changes in command since 2003 and the rules “ have evolved significantly . ”
He said the camp holds dangerous terrorists and would not comment on specific rules for security reasons .
CLARKSBURG , W.Va . —
The FBI is embarking on a $ 1 billion effort to build the world ’s largest computer database of people ’s physical characteristics , a project that would give the government unprecedented abilities to identify people in the United States and abroad .
Images of faces , fingerprints and palm patterns are flowing into FBI systems in a climate - controlled , secure basement in Clarksburg .
Next month , the FBI will award a 10 - year contract that would significantly expand the amount and kinds of biometric information it receives .
And in the coming years , law - enforcement authorities worldwide will be able to rely on iris patterns , face - shape data , scars , and perhaps even the unique ways people walk and talk to solve crimes and identify criminals and terrorists .
The FBI also will retain , upon request by employers , fingerprints of employees who have undergone criminal - background checks so the employers can be notified if employees have brushes with the law .
“ Bigger .
Faster .
Better .
That ’s the bottom line , ” said Thomas E. Bush III , assistant director of the FBI ’s Criminal Justice Information Services Division , which operates the database from its headquarters in the Appalachian foothills .
The increasing use of biometrics is raising questions about how Americans can avoid unwanted scrutiny .
Biometrics criticized
It is drawing criticism from those who worry that people ’s bodies will become de facto national identification cards .
Critics say that such initiatives should not proceed without proof that the technology — which has raised doubts in a German study — really can pick a criminal out of a crowd .
In 2004 , the Electronic Privacy Information Center objected to the FBI ’s exemption of the National Crime Information Center database from a Privacy Act requirement that records be accurate .
The group noted that the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2001 found the system was “ not fully reliable ” and that files “ may be incomplete or inaccurate . ”
FBI officials justified that exemption by noting that it is “ impossible to determine in advance what ( law enforcement ) information is accurate , relevant , timely and complete . ”
Privacy advocates worry about the ability of people to correct false information .
“ Unlike say , a credit - card number , biometric data is forever , ” said Paul Saffo , a Silicon Valley technology forecaster .
He said he feared that the FBI , whose computer technology record has been marred by expensive failures , could not guarantee the data ’s security .
“ If someone steals and spoofs your iris image , you ca n’t just get a new eyeball , ” Saffo said .
The use of biometric data is increasing throughout the government .
For two years , the Defense Department has been storing images of fingerprints , irises and faces of more than 1.5 million Iraqi and Afghan detainees , Iraqi citizens and foreigners who need access to U.S. military bases .
The Pentagon also collects DNA samples from some Iraqi detainees .
Airports using iris scans
The Department of Homeland Security has been using iris scans at some airports to verify the identity of travelers who have passed background checks and who want to move through lines quickly .
In an underground facility the size of two football fields , a request reaches an FBI server every second from somewhere within the United States or Canada , comparing a set of digital fingerprints against the FBI ’s database of 55 million sets of electronic fingerprints .
A possible match is made or ruled out as many as 100,000 times a day .
In the first large - scale , scientific study on face recognition , the German government this year found that the technology , while promising , was not effective enough for use by police .
The technology was able to match travelers ’ faces against a database of volunteers more than 60 percent of the time during the day , when the lighting was best .
But the rate fell to 10 to 20 percent at night .
Bislang sind die Daten nur vorläufig , doch der Verdacht allein ist schon schrecklich : Laut einer Studie der Uni Köln haben Privatpatienten größere Chancen als gesetzlich Versicherte , ein lebensrettendes Spenderorgan zu erhalten .
Bei der Transplantation von Organen kommen Privatpatienten einer Studie zufolge deutlich häufiger zum Zug als gesetzliche Versicherte .
Das geht aus einer Untersuchung des Instituts für Gesundheitsökonomie der Universität Köln hervor .
Erfasst wurden die Berichte der 46 deutschen Transplantationszentren aus den Jahren 2004 und 2005 .
Der Anteil der Privatpatienten an der Gesamtbevölkerung lag 2005 bei 10,25 Prozent , sie erhielten aber 16,38 Prozent der im selben Jahr transplantierten Organe .
Laut dem SPD - Gesundheitsexperten und Direktor des Kölner Instituts , Karl Lauterbach , besteht der Verdacht , dass finanzielle Gründe hinter diesem Trend steckten .
Privatversicherte werden laut Erhebung überdurchschnittlich häufig mit Dringlichkeitsstatus in die Wartelisten aufgenommen : " Sie werden dreimal so häufig als besonders dringliche Fälle eingestuft wie gesetzlich Versicherte - und mir fehlt die Fantasie , um dafür einen medizinischen Grund zu finden " , sagte Lauterbach .
Es handele sich um vorläufige Zahlen , da die Daten einiger Transplantationszentren fehlerhaft , unvollständig und von " inakzeptabler Qualität " seien - und damit nicht auswertbar .
" Schon das alleine ist Grund zur Sorge , denn die Zentren sind zur genauen Dokumentation verpflichtet . "
Auch bei der Betrachtung von einzelnen Organbereichen zeigten sich deutliche Ungleichheiten zugunsten von Privatpatienten :
Sie hatten auf den Wartelisten für Herzen nur einen Anteil von 10 Prozent , erhielten aber 21,5 Prozent der 2005 transplantierten Herzen .
Ähnlich war das ermittelte Bild bei Nieren , Lungen und Leber .
2005 waren den Angaben zufolge insgesamt 3943 Transplantationen vorgenommen worden , davon 3297 bei gesetzlich Versicherten und 646 bei Privatversicherten ( 16,38 Prozent ) .
Die zuständigen Behörden und das Gesundheitsministerium müssten dies weiter prüfen , verlangte der SPD - Politiker .
Bei der Kölner Studie handele es sich um die erste , die die Tätigkeitsberichte der Zentren ausgewertet habe .
The bus is carrying a wide age range of passengers
The 15,000 mile trip Down Under has 39 intrepid passengers on board .
The one - way trip has been organised by travel company Ozbus .
The company ruled out conventional long haul aeroplane flights in favour of the bus route , which takes in 20 countries , with one short flight at the end .
Among the inaugural passengers is a 66 - year - old grandmother who is planning to return via container ship .
Ozbus Operations director , Australian Andrew Kelliher , said the company has been amazed by the popularity of the trip , which it believes to be the first ever regular overland coach service to Australia .
The journey will take in four ferries and has been made possible due to improved roads in Indonesia , explained Mr Kelliher .
" Some people have made it to Australia before using overland trucks , but previously the dirt tracks in Indonesia meant you could not take a bus , " he told the BBC News website .
People are so used to flying the whole way to Australia and never seeing any of it
Andrew Kelliher , Ozbus
Together with company founder Mark Creasey , he has worked for the last 12 months sorting out the journey ready for Sunday 's inaugural trip in the bus , a Belgian coach kitted out for longer travel .
The £ 3,750 one - way trip will stop every night for camping or hotel resting points and will take in Nepal , China , Malaysia and Indonesia among other places .
" People are so used to flying the whole way to Australia and never seeing any of it - this way you get to stop and look at it .
It 's pretty ground - breaking , " said Mr Kelliher .
The journey also aims to please those concerned about carbon emissions - the only time passengers will take a flight is from East Timor across to Australia at the end .

Facebook BUDAPEST , Hungary ( AP )  Yu Nakajima of Japan won the main event at the 2007 Rubik 's Cube world championship Sunday .
Nakajima , 16 , was able to solve the classic 3x3 cube — which has six sides of a different color with nine tiles each on each side — in an average time of 12.46 seconds over five attempts .
He earned the top award of $ 7,000 , from total prize money of $ 28,000 distributed at the three - day , which began Friday .
Andrew Kang of the United States was second and Mitsuki Gunji of Japan third .
Kang set the best time for a single attempt at the championship — 10.88 seconds .
The world record is 9.86 seconds , held since May by Thibaut Jacquinot of France .
More than 250 competitors from 33 countries took part in the event , the fourth world championship overall and the first to be held in Hungary — where the game was invented by Erno Rubik in 1974 — since competition began in 1982 .
Others showed their skill at solving the cube blindfolded , with one hand or with their feet .
Finland 's Anssi Vanhala was fastest with his feet at 49.33 seconds , although his favorite cube — which players customize with everything from silicon lubricants to talcum powder — was stolen during the competition .
" I am very happy with the victory because I had set myself a target of 50 seconds , which I bettered , " said Vanhala , 15 , who also was a finalist in the 3x3 category won by Nakajima .
Ryan Patricio , 18 , a high school senior from Temecula , California , defended his world title in the one - hand category with a new world record , averaging 21.13 seconds in five attempts .
" Definitely there is room improvement and I expect a sub - 20 ( second ) average at the next world championship in two years , " said Patricio , who competed in an anorak .
Hungary 's Matyas Kuti was fastest solving the 4x4 and 5x5 cubes and also won several of the blindfold events , which seemed to draw the biggest respect from his peers .
Blindfold contestants try to solve the game by memorizing the position of key cubes before covering their eyes .
Kuti's best blindfolded time for the 3x3 cube was just over 1 minute , 7 seconds .
Electronic timers were used and players solved the cubes set to a certain position — which varied by category and were determined with the help of computers .
Rubik , an engineer who developed several other mechanical games after the cube , made a rare public appearance at the medal ceremony , helping to hand out the main awards .
" I 'm glad the cube is reaching new generations , who face it with fresh wonder , curiosity and enthusiasm , " the game 's creator said .
World championships were also held in Canada in 2003 and in the United States in 2005 .

CNN : Seymour Hersh ' vindicated ' by new Iran intel estimate David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday December 5 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Reporter believes Cheney ' kept his foot on the neck of ' report A new National Intelligence Estimate released on Monday indicates that 16 US intelligence agencies have concluded with a high level of confidence that Iran has not had an active nuclear weapons program since 2003 and that even if it resumed weapons development , it would be unlikely to obtain a nuclear bomb in less than 5 to 10 years .
The NIE apparently came as a surprise to President Bush , who insisted at a news conference the next day that " I was made aware of the NIE last week .
In August , I think it was , John  Mike McConnell  came in and said , ' We have some new information . '
He did n't tell me what the information was .
He did tell me it was going to take a while to analyze . "
However , the NIE was no surprise to veteran investigative reporter Seymour Hersh , who has been writing about it since November 2006 .
Hersh told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday that he believes the White House deliberately kept the NIE bottled up for over a year because the vice president was dissatisfied with its conclusions .
" At the time I wrote that , there was a tremendous fight about it because Cheney ... did not want to hear this , " Hersh recalled .
" I think the vice - president has kept his foot on the neck of that report .
...
The intelligence we learned about yesterday has been circulating inside this government at the highest levels for the last year -- and probably longer . "
As early as July 2006 , Hersh had reported that the US military was resisting administration pressure for a bombing campaign in Iran , because " American and European intelligence agencies have not found specific evidence of clandestine activities or hidden facilities . "
By November 2006 , Hersh 's sources had told him of " a highly classified draft assessment by the C.I.A. , " which concluded that satellite monitoring and sophisticated radiation - detection devices planted near Iranian facilities had turned up absolutely no evidence of a nuclear weapons program .
However , Bush and Cheney were expected to try to keep those conclusions out of the forthcoming NIE on Iran 's nuclear capabilities .
As Hersh explained to Wolf Blitzer at the time , the White House was attempting to counter the CIA assessment with an Israeli claim , based on a " reliable agent , " that Iran was working on a trigger for a nuclear device .
" The CIA is nt getting a good look at the Israeli intelligence . "
Hersh explained .
" It s the old word , stovepiping .
It s the President and the Vice President , its pretty much being kept in the White House . "
RAW STORY 's Larisa Alexandrovna further reported in January 2007 that the NIE on Iran was intended to be released later that month , but that John Negroponte 's was being replaced as Director of National Intelligence because he had refused to tailor the NIE to Vice President Cheney 's specificiations .
Despite feeling vindicated by the latest developments , Hersh warned Blitzer that the White House push for war with Iran is " still not over .
...
There 's always Israel . "
He explained that " the Israelis were very upset about the report .
They think we 're naive . "
However , Hersh was confident that there was very little chance the NIE could be mistaken , because " It 's been four years since we 've had any positive evidence of a parallel secret program to build a bomb -- and we 've been all over the country . "
Hersh and Blitzer then recalled Hersh 's past appearances on CNN -- including several long interviews discussing the Abu Ghraib scandal -- and how the White House would regularly accuse him of using " anonymous sorces " or just " throwing crap against the wall . "
Hersh concluded by emphasizing what a serious problem the NIE poses for Bush .
" It 's a lose - lose for them , " he stated .
" The fight I 'm talking about began last year .
...
This is going to pose a serious credibility problem .
...
That 's not what we pay the guy to do . "
However , Hersh 's sources tell him that despite the NIE , Bush 's negotiating position is still that the Iranians " have to stop everything ... destroy it .
...
Inspectors have to come in that we pick .
...
He 's not saying that publicly , but that 's the private standard . "

Police in China 's capital said they will start patrolling the web using animated beat officers that pop up on a user 's browser and walk , bike or drive across the screen warning them to stay away from illegal internet content .
Starting September 1 , the cartoon alerts will appear every half hour on 13 of China 's top portals , including Sohu and Sina , and by the end of the year will appear on all websites registered with Beijing servers , the Beijing Public Security Ministry said in a statement today .
China stringently polices the internet for material and content that the ruling Communist Party finds politically or morally threatening .
In the February 2008 edition of Natural History Magazine ( article not available online ) , you can learn where tigers still live in the wild .
At the beginning of the 20th century , there were 100,000 tigers living in the wild .
Today , there are only 5000 in the wild .
Tigers now inhabit only 7 % of their original territory , which has shrunk by 41 % in the past 10 years .
Those relatively few tigers that remain in the wild hunt wild cattle , deer and pigs in isolated pockets of forested land in India , Sumatra , Eastern Russia in southern China .
Tigers are hunted illegally for pelts and for tiger parts that are used in medicines ( such as tiger penis soups ) .
But did you know how many tigers live in United States ?
7,000 to 15,000 tigers live
in private roadside zoos , circuses , sanctuaries , farms and backyards in the US .
Owners are often deluded into thinking that they contain the creatures , treating them like house cats , perhaps attracted by the challenge .
Yet even house cats , which have been domesticated for thousands of years will reach out and swat their human companions .
What happens when a six month old sixty - pound beast with claws and slicing incisors takes a swipe ?
Are these privately owned tigers allowed to run in large open areas and kept in good health ?
Not likely .
Many tigers are kept in cages much too small for them and they are “ fed insufficient or inappropriate food , such as canned dog food . ”
The Natural History article indicates that tigers are illegal to import , but they reproduce easily in captivity .
Therefore , it is easy to make more tigers , even though many of them are inbred .
Although federal law bans the interstate shipment of endangered species for the pet trade , there are many loopholes in the law .
State laws are inconsistent , and some of them do n’t even require exotic animals to be registered .
Tigers are surprisingly cheap too .
“ The price tag of a tiger cub - between $ 300 and $ 900 - is comparable to that of a poodle puppy registered with the American kennel club . ”
Tigers are sometimes given away ( when the owner realizes the enormous difficulty of keeping a tiger ) .
The article notes a one newsletter ad posted by a seller in Texas : “ Free - two male tigers and a half years old , likes women ; one female tiger , six years old , likes men and women ; cages with cats . ”
Imagine if we had taken a snapshot of the tiger population 100 years ago and we could easily compare it to the tiger population now .
I suppose that is what I am doing with this post .
Imagine the headline :
Tens of thousands of wild tigers no longer exist !
Thousands of abused tigers living desperate lonely lives trapped in tiny cages across America !
If we saw that headline dramatically comparing the tiger populations of two arrows 100 years apart , would we do something about the situation ?
Maybe and maybe not , but it ’s much more likely that we would do something if we could more easily see the situation changing .
When change is incremental and therefore not easily noticeable , it is much less likely that we will do anything about a deteriorating situation .
This human difficulty of tracking slow change presents a great danger to human populations .
Incrementalism makes critically important changes invisible , unless we are in unusually patient sort of person who takes the time to carefully track the slow changes of things that do n’t seem to need tracking .
I have a close friend who was in a highly strained marriage .
He happened to keep a journal over the years .
His wife was an alcoholic .
His wife did not become an alcoholic overnight .
He did not notice this disturbing change in her during any particular week or month .
One day , he forced himself to sit down and read ten years of his journal entries at one time .
This allowed him to see , finally , the slow and consistent deterioration of that relationship ( and the fact that things were not getting any better for the past few years ) .
This tracking of events through journal entries allowed him to dramatically see the deterioration of the relationship .
He filed for divorce after coming to this realization , even though he had been there every day throughout this changing situation , not fully appreciating the decline .
Here ’s another example .
How did it happen that the United States has a critical shortage of water in many locations ?
For instance , my youngest sister lives in Raleigh Durham , North Carolina , where the metropolitan area typically has only a 50 - day supply of water available .
Atlanta has a similar problem .
Along the same lines , check out this shocking image of Lake Mead .
Put your cursor over the top picture to see the difference in the water level in only three years .
Did these changes happen overnight ?
Absolutely not .
Numerous decisions have been made over the years to over - allocate the water supply .
Another incredibly distressing example is the lack of fish in the North Atlantic Ocean , formerly an abundant source of food for millions of people .
Humans are simply not easily able to track subtle changes over long periods of time without conscious effort and rigorous analysis .
This means that the numerous highly distractible humans up today are flying blind with regard to some of the most important changes around them .
Carefully watching and listening to one ’s local surroundings is no protection from long - term dangers .
Here ’s a corollary : merely making short - term decisions to satisfy one ’s immediate needs will not necessarily bring about a benevolent invisible hand .
The benevolent invisible hand has an evil brother who that squeezes people unmercifully , and often destroys them .
Thus my impatience with the many Pollyannas out there who think we can merely live our happy - go - lucky local existences and everything long - term will simply take care of itself .
Have they taken the time to track all of the long - term changes brought about by our short - term decisions ?
If they had , they would be distressed at many of the of the long - term changes wrought by their alleged good buddy , the invisible hand .
To what other critically important long - term changes are we oblivious ?
They are too numerous to list .
Here ’s one to consider .
Perhaps the most important change to occur in America during the 21st century was the mass migration of African - Americans from the rural South to the urban North .
It happened gradually over many years , so it did not make any headlines like the wars , the misdeeds of celebrities and the periodic natural disasters .
As far as impacting American history , however , this human migration cannot be underrated .
If only human beings had a constant craving to take the time and effort to sift through longitudinal data and to do the necessary analysis to conduct A/B comparisons .
If we did , we would see how dramatically life is changing over the decades and we would better appreciate what we are doing to ourselves and what we are doing to our planet .
Here ’s another dramatic example .
Think about the implications for the gradual increase in obesity among Americans .
If you have n’t noticed people getting fatter , it ’s because it ’s been so gradual over the past couple of decades .
Take a look at these maps , however , and you ’ll see that the change is as dramatic as it is dangerous to the health of Americans .
Those of us who have been around for a few decades as adults know that political campaigning has changed dramatically .
Young adults might not appreciate that Swift Boating is a nefarious art that has developed over the years .
It ’s not that political candidates have not lied about each other in the past , but they have never done so with the boldness and calculation evident in today ’s campaigns ( even the Clintons are getting into it ) .
In fact , this relatively new ruthless method of fabricating and then attacking character is all the more reason that many otherwise qualified people would never consider running for office .
What else has been happening gradually , so gradually that it takes number - crunching to notice it ?
How about the substantial increase in the number of female college students and the significant decline in the number of male college students ?
If that change occurred in one year , it would make huge headlines , but that is not the case .
What are the consequences for this changing demographic ?
If we do n’t notice the change , we wo n’t be able to ask the right questions .
If we do n’t ask the right questions , we wo n’t address the underlying problems .
There was no national headlines that the United States would begin implementing a policy to torture its prisoners over the past five years .
If there had been such a headline , there would have been a huge uproar ( or is this wishful thinking ? ) .
As it is , the revelations were sporadic ( although sometimes dramatic ) and smothered with official denials over many months .
Nonetheless , it is now clear that the Bush administration believes strongly in torture and that many Americans have become complacent about the use of torture , despite overwhelming evidence that we should be feeling great shame as a nation .
Not all gradual changes are bad , however .
Over the past 25 years , the computer has become a standard appliance in most households and businesses .
It has become a key method of providing and receiving information .
This dramatic increase in the use of computers has been a gradual change that has received very few headlines , despite the huge impact played in our lives by the use of computers and the Internet .
In an earlier post , I commented on how different the practice of law was when I started as a lawyer “ only ” 25 years ago .
What is acceptable as moral behavior often changes gradually and imperceptibly .
Imagine the outrage that would result if one broadcasted some of today ’s television shows one or two generations ago !
The violence and the sexual references would probably have had numerous people marching in the streets .
Speaking of sex , I do realize how I myself have changed with regard to my attitude toward gays .
When I moved into my urban neighborhood 20 years ago , I knew very few gay people and I did n’t know any of them well .
In fact , I remember feeling a bit awkward around two gay neighbors when I first moved in .
Fast forward 20 years .
Today , I rarely think it to be a significant fact that someone is gay or not .
What brought about the change were the numerous occasions where I talked with , shared meals with and worked with people who happened to be gay ( as opposed to “ gay people ” ) .
Somewhere , the fact that someone was gay became very small my radar .
I did n’t realize I was changing in this regard over the decades , but I do now , given my focus on the issue .
When things change slowly , we do n’t notice them changing and we forget that things used to be different than they now are .
The resulting obliviousness to slow change sets the stage for a faux sense of logic and therefore justification .
Many people feel that something is justified simply because “ it has always been done that way . ”
In fact , this principle of doing things the way they ’ve always been done has been elevated into the strange legal principle of stare decisis .
It is a strange principle and that it is an amoral principal at heart , as I ’ve argued before .
Why should something be justified simply because it ’s been done that way before ?
It is a principle that can justify anything , it even dangerous changes that have occurred over a decade or two , a gradual enough change that people have n’t really noticed the change .
Humans are creatures of limited attention and we need to remind ourselves of this vulnerability repeatedly .
If we do n’t remind ourselves of this susceptibility , we are at risk for drifting and deteriorating in ways which we would never tolerate had we been more capable of noticing such slow trends .
Things that come to my mind are the virulent forms of religious and political fundamentalism that are widely tolerated in America .
If we do n’t stay vigilant , the things that we value about our lives can and will deteriorate .
Unless we take more care than we currently are taking , the things that we value are at risk of going the way of the tiger .
[ Note on the photos : I photographed these tigers at the St. Louis Zoo , which is a terrific place to view well - treated animals ] .
Hillary Clinton Supporters Sue the Nevada Caucas
The Nevada Culinary Union has endorsed Barack Obama .
That would seem to be nothing out of the ordinary , a union endorsing a Democrat .
There is only one problem , the Democrat they endorsed was not Mrs. Clinton .
Now the Nevada ’s teacher ’s union and some of Hillary ’s supporters are suing to make it harder for the culinary union members to vote .
“ This could shut down those precincts in the casinos and keep culinary members from voting , ” said Jon Ralston , a political pundit with The Las Vegas Sun , who broke the story on his blog .
Mr. Ralston said it is unclear whether there are ties between the lawsuit and the Clinton campaign but , he predicted , “ Even if they ’re Hillary supporters , the campaign ’s going to say they had nothing to do with it .
It is unclear when the court will hear the matter .
So much for free and open elections , huh ?
Nothing is an accident with regards to the Clinton’s .
There is no way this group decided on their own to sue without getting the approval of the Clinton ’s .
And even if they did , it just shows us the insecurity of the Clinton supporters .
In a time when Bush bashers are telling us that he has trampled the constitution , pissed on our freedoms , and turned the United States into a dictatorship ( just read the far left blogs if you think I am overstating this ) , we see this example of the left trying to oppress a number of voters who may not be voting for the candidate they want to win , I ask you , which party has the real potential for implementing a dictatorship ?
Read the source material here .
Belgium is rapidly unraveling .
Following the June 10th Belgian general elections , won by Flemish - secessionist parties , the Belgian parties seem unable to form a government coalition .
Belgium is a multinational state , the model for the European Union ’s efforts to turn Europe into a single multinational state .
Belgium is made up of 60 % Dutch - speaking , free - market oriented Flemings and 40 % French - speaking , predominantly Socialist Walloons .
The Belgian Constitution stipulates that the government should consist of 50 % Flemings and 50 % Walloons .
Belgian governments always have to rely on a majority in both Flanders and Wallonia , since major decisions need the support of both parts of the country .
In practice this means that 20 % of the population ( i.e. half of the Walloons ) can veto every decision .
This has made the Parti Socialiste ( PS ) , the Walloon Socialist Party , the power broker in the country .
The refusal of the PS to reform the welfare state system has caused growing Flemish frustration , and turned what used to be a linguistic conflict into a dispute about economic and welfare policies .
While Flanders pays most of Belgium ’s taxes the bulk of the money flows to Wallonia .
There a welfare - receiving electorate votes for parties which for over three decades have been blocking any attempts at reforming the collapsing welfare system .
Since the 1970s Flemish parties have radicalized , demanding larger autonomy over welfare issues .
Apart from welfare reform the next Belgian government also has to reach an agreement over Brussels .
The city , which is historically Dutch , is a bilingual enclave surrounded by the Halle - Vilvoorde district of the Flemish province of Brabant .
At present Brussels - Halle - Vilvoorde ( BHV ) is one large , single electoral constituency .
Flanders wants to assume full autonomy over Halle and Vilvoorde , and demands that these two Flemish towns and the surrounding Flemish villages are split off from bilingual Brussels .
This is also being vetoed by the Walloon parties , although four years ago the Constitutional Court of Belgium , with 50 % French - speaking judges , ruled that the present situation is unconstitutional and that BHV should be split by July 2007 .
The Belgian politicians are unable to solve the BHV problem , and any new elections are unconstitutional as long as the BHV constituency has not been divided into one bilingual constituency Brussels and one Flemish constituency Halle - Vilvoorde .
Politically Belgium is now in a catch - 22 situation :
The Belgian parties are unable to form a government because they cannot agree about splitting up BHV and new elections cannot be held as long as BHV has not been split up .
Last week , Prof. Em. Robert Senelle , one of Belgium ’s most prominent constitutionalists , a Flemish Socialist and formerly a teacher of the Belgian Crown Prince , advised the Flemings to annul the Belgian Constitution and solemnly declare Flemish sovereignty .
Following this advice Filip Dewinter , the leader of the secessionist Vlaams Belang party , the largest party in the Flemish Regional Parliament , called upon the Flemish Parliament to convene and declare Flanders an independent country .
Yesterday another Flemish constitutionalist , Prof. Paul Van Orshoven said that “ intelligent people ” should consider a Flemish secession from Belgium .
“ Because the situation cannot go on where a minority denies the majority its legitimate and democratic aspirations . ”
Prof. Van Orshoven said that if Flanders secedes this obviously violates the Belgian Constitution , which requires that the Walloons approve of such a decision .
He referred , however , to the historical precedent of the Tennis Court Oath .
The Tennis Court Oath refers to 20 June 1789 , when the representatives of France ’s third estate [ the bourgeoisie ] declared themselves to be the true representatives of the nation .
“ In the spirit of the Tennis Court Oath it is permitted that , even if it violates the Belgian constitutional rules , a simple majority of the Dutch - speakers in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives and the Senate declare to secede . ”
Apart from the media in Belgium and the neighbouring Netherlands , the international papers and broadcasters have hardly reported about the disintegration of the EU ’s host country .
On Tuesday a survey of the Dutch [ Netherlandish ] television network RTL4 showed that 77 % of the inhabitants of the Netherlands are in favour of the Netherlands and Flanders merging into one country .
In Belgium , an internet poll of Flanders ’ largest newspaper , Het Laatste Nieuws , showed 50.9 % in favour of reuniting Flanders and the Netherlands .
The Flemish provinces were part of the Netherlands until 1831 , when the international powers established the Kingdom of Belgium .

TO : Content Staff FROM : John Skipper DATE : 12/03/2007
SUBJECT : September ' 07 Town Meetings Q&A Follow - Up
Below are the answers to questions we could not answer or did not get to in the September Town Meetings .
Thanks to the various department heads who provided the answers .
Q : Could Facilities post an artist 's depiction of what the cafeteria and the connector will look like when it 's completed ?
A lot of people are interested and someplace in the cafeteria would be great .
A : We will look to do so as part of our augmented internal Communications efforts .
For cost and ease of display purposes , we would like to place these on line , so look for more information on our construction projects and other company initiatives in that space .
Q : Can you look into having the people at the cafeteria speed up preparing orders ?
It is one thing at " lunch " time , 12:00 p - 1:30 p , when the cafeteria is busy , but for those who take lunch at a non-traditional time , ( 2:00 p onward ) , it 's really frustrating to wait 10 - 15 minutes when there are only 2 - 3 people in line .
A : As part of our service agreement , FLIK continuously monitors the volume of customers to minimize waiting time and will deploy additional staff when necessary .
We share this goal , and our Facilities group will follow up with the FLIK management staff to ensure they continue to monitor waiting times and minimize them as much as possible .

Q : I work in Building B , located next to the new satellite dish farm .
What are the health risks associated with being in such close vicinity of so many satellite dishes ?
A : There are no known health risks associated with being in close proximity to the satellite dishes .
ESPN has designed the teleport to meet all state and federal mandates for transmission and has placed the antenna such that no transmit antenna has the ability to rotate toward our buildings .
Q : Any chance we will see a repeat of the financial seminars , given earlier this year by the Human Resources Department ?
A : Yes , the financial seminars are part of our work / life offerings and will be provided again .

Q : Are there any plans for Disney to extend medical plans for retired employees ?
A : There are no plans by The Walt Disney Company to extend medical plans for retired employees at this time .
Q : Why does n't SAP have a 40 hour sheet in place for hourly wage workers ?
If one misses filling in their hours , they do n't get paid .
With hours put in as a default , this would n't happen .
A : It is a legal requirement for non-exempt employees to record their time .
Accordingly , ESPN non-exempt employees are required to enter in their work hours into SAP .
Among other things , this ensures their regular and overtime pay will be accurate and generated as scheduled .
If employees are unable to enter their time on schedule in SAP , they have the following options :
* Each department has an assigned SAP Time Processor who can enter an employee 's time into SAP if someone is unable to enter their own time due to travel , illness , etc .
Advertisement
* Employees can enter their work time remotely , via a personal computer , with approved access .
* ESPN's Human Resources
Department can enter an employee 's work and absence time in SAP , if requested , due to an emergency .

Q : Why are there suddenly security cameras in virtually every hallway / stairwell on campus ?
Do you feel the need to let employees know about this sudden change ?
A : Maintaining an environment that is safe and secure for our employees and our guests is very important to us .
Enhancement of those efforts , through camera installations in our common areas , has been an ongoing project since 2003 .
Q : Is it possible to install exit / entrance gates in other areas of campus fencing ?
This can be swipe card areas , in order to keep security , but can also aid in the convenience of walking off campus .
A : One of the basic principles of security for a campus of our size is to have a manageable number of entry points , allowing for proper flow and appropriate security measures .
We believe we have achieved that but will continue to monitor this .

Q : Can we use another method for a car pass rather than the huge bar code that all of Bristol can see ?
A : The bar code will be replaced shortly with another vehicle identifier which will be smaller in size and go onto the windshield .
Q : ESPN does not rate as one of the top 10 broadcasting companies for Women in Cable Television , ( WICT ) .
Do you feel it 's worth addressing or resolving ?
A : Since 2003 , ESPN has participated annually in the WICT PAR Survey , and fared well in 2007 .
We participate to benchmark our progress against the industry and we give significant review to its recommendations .
In 2005 , ESPN was named one of the top 5 companies for Pay Equity by WICT and we are pleased that once again ESPN made the top 5 list for Pay Equity in 2007 .
We are proud of the progress that we have made and will continue to strengthen our diversity initiative as we look to enhance the work experience for all ESPN employees .

Q : Will we see side - by - side commercials in NASCAR ?
Is it successful in Indy Racing ?
A : We are exploring creative formatting for our NASCAR races next year , including commercial free race segments and side - by - side coverage .
We are working to balance giving the fans as much live race action as possible with our need to deliver value to our sponsors and advertisers .
While research does not demonstrate that our IndyCar side - by - side coverage has had a material impact on our ratings , we believe it is a great service to our fans to show as much green - flag racing as possible .

Q : How about re-establishing the company stock plan to all employees like the old Cap Cities plan ?
A : In order to remain competitive , The Walt Disney World Company evaluates its rewards programs regularly .
At this time , there are no plans to establish a discounted Employee Stock Purchase Plan .
However , the Disney Employee Stock Purchase Plan gives eligible employees the opportunity to purchase Disney stock through payroll deductions .
Under the plan , you can contribute from one ( 1 ) to twenty ( 20 ) percent of your bi-weekly pay , which includes your base pay plus overtime , holiday , vacation and sick pay with the company offsetting administrative expenses for employees and commissions on purchases from payroll deductions .
The details of this program may be found at : https://enterpriseportal.disney.com/gopublish/sitemedia/DocumentFile/ESPPBrochureII.pdf on the ESPN Enterprise Portal .
Q : What have you identified as the reason for your minority retention problem ?
A : Inclusion and retention are key areas of focus for ESPN and issues that are important to our entire workforce .
As a primary component of our business strategy , we value the competitive advantage that having a diverse employee base creates and we continuously look at ways to better understand and address why employees choose to work elsewhere .
Among other things , we constantly review our rewards programs , look for ways to improve the work environment and culture , seek to expand learning and development opportunities and provide every employee with a compelling work - experience .

Q : What does ESPN do with all of their computers , televisions and office equipment ?
Does ESPN donate them ?
Would it be possible to sell these items at a discount to employees or an event to the public ?
A : ESPN Corporate Outreach currently manages the " old furniture " and equipment , ( computers , TVs , etc. ) , donations .
Some items are disposed of and others are donated to valid 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organizations within the community .
ESPN is not an equipment reseller .
Q : Can the PowerPoint presentation be placed on the ESPN Intranet ?
A : After much consideration , we would prefer not to post with respect to 1 ) confidentiality of company information , and 2 ) competitive reasons .

Q : Will we ever be able to use flex scheduling for Monday Night Football ?
A : Given the issues surrounding logistics , stadium availability , and competitive concerns with moving a game from Sunday to Monday night on relatively short notice , flexible scheduling appears to be a remote possibility for Monday Night Football .
Q : We called back our INDY 500 SportsCenter coverage this past May and part of that deal with the IRL , from my understanding , was to broadcast more IRL races in HD .
However , the remaining season was in SD .
What happened ?
A : In our continuing effort to serve Indy 500 fans we worked with IndyCar to televise the race in HD .
At the same time , we determined having SportsCenter on site was not essential to covering the race thoroughly from a news perspective .
The 2008 IndyCar regular season and 2008 Indy 500 will be produced in HD .

Q : Why are we so under staffed in Studio Production ?
What is being done about this ?
A : Recently , we have experienced some turnover in studio production , ( mainly production assistants and associate producers ) .
We are currently filling all of the open positions and expect to be fully staffed soon through a combination of promotions from within and outside hires .
Q : We are encouraged to apply to positions online , but we never get any feedback after applying .
A : Our process is designed to include a response to all candidates who apply for a position when they have been removed from consideration or when the position is closed in the system .
There is an e-mail notification sent to the address provided during the application process .
You are encouraged to contact Recruiting or your Human Resources Business Partner if you are unsure of the state of your application .

Q : What is Dolby 5.1 ?
A : Dolby 5.1 " is the digital surround sound format designed for film and HD television .
It is commonly referred to as " Dolby Digital " or " DD " .
The 5.1 references the 6 channels of audio being recognized as the left front speaker , the right front speaker , the center dialog speaker , the left rear speaker and the right rear speaker .
The " .1 " is intended for very low frequency , ( explosions and dramatic thunderous sounds ) , intended for film and not used for sports television production .
The 5 main surround channels plus the ' .1 ' total 6 channels .
Q : Is what we do on Monday Night Football and other big events a variation of this ?
A : Yes .
The SRS Circle Surround system we utilize delivers a robust , dynamic and effective surround sound for our events and our studio programming .
It is easy to use , sets up quickly and as an added bonus allows the SD viewer to experience the same surround sound of a down converted telecast if they have surround systems not associated with HD viewing .
Advertisement
Q : Why ca n't we do individual 5.1 channels for all of our shows ?
A : All remote events are produced using the same SRS encoding techniques that we do for MNF .
SportsCenter and our other in - house studio shows are mixed in stereo only .
Currently , there are no production elements that would benefit a 5.1 mix .
But , should production decide to augment their shows with additional rear channel information , we can certainly entertain that option .
Q : Often times there is a break down in communications between the control room and the studio , ( studio not being told about live - to - tapes , pre-production , etc. in a timely manner ) .
What can be done ?
A : We strive to make sure all parties - Editorial , Operations , Engineering , Studio Directing , Transmission , etc. have a clear plan as to what is happening every hour of every day within our facilities .
That is done through a series of long and short range planning meetings and followed up by daily meetings .
Also , on a daily basis , each show unit defines their needs based on the news of the day and / or a change in programming or production schedule .
Daily changes are communicated through Coordinating Producers , Directors and Stage Managers to both the control room and studio .
While we strive to keep this information as timely as possible , it is sometimes dictated by breaking news which shortens the window of notification .
We are aware that sometimes there is not timely communication with regard to all the productions being assigned to a studio in a given day .
When there are communication concerns , please bring them to the attention of a Studio Supervisor so there is follow - up to ensure the process is refined .
Q : Are the grade levels a detriment to employees ?
It seems promotions are being affected in a negative way .
I recently received a promotion , which used to be a standard 14 % , ( 10 % for promotion and 4 % merit ) .
My last promotion was half of that - with the reason given that I was making too much money in my level to get a normal promotion .
If this is the case , where is the incentive ?
Why do I want to double my work for a 6 % raise , rather than the 14 % we used to get ?
It 's a huge difference .
A : The ESPN grade levels are not a detriment to employees .
Prior to the implementation of our compensation management system , ( GRADE ) , some areas of the company awarded a " standard " merit and a " standard " promotion .
Now , promotional increases are not tied to a standard percentage ; they are driven by pay ranges defined by the competitive marketplace and ESPN 's pay - for - performance philosophy .
With GRADE , managers are asked to consider a number of factors with promotions and merits which leads to a range of increase award sizes that can at times exceed standard percentages .
This system helps us to maintain salaries that are closely tied to the market pay for that specific job .

Q : ESPN implies that it will promote people from within , then why is it that when someone applies for a position they are denied from interviewing based on their salary grade when the position does not fall under the same group ?
A : ESPN supports internal mobility and growth at all levels .
To be eligible to post for a position , a person should meet the requisite skills for the job and generally be in their current position at least 12 months .
In most cases , an employee is eligible for consideration for a position of up to 2 grades higher than their current salary grade level .
Grade levels are companywide and not differentiated by department or group .
Q : Can we go back to having 2 company picnics so that more employees can attend ?
A : We are not planning on holding two picnics each year .
However , we always attempt to accommodate as many employees and families as possible .
This decision on the date and the hours of operation is made on an annual basis with the primary objective being to maximize attendance and enjoyment by our entire group .
We know that for various reasons not everyone can make it every year , but our hope is that the majority of our Connecticut and NY employees have the opportunity to do so many times in their careers .
Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura arrives at the premier 's official residence in Tokyo September 25 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Toru Hanai
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Yes , UFOs do exist , Japan ’s top government spokesman said Tuesday .
The comment by chief cabinet secretary Nobutaka Machimura drew laughter from reporters at his regular briefing on government policy .
Earlier the cabinet , responding to an opposition lawmaker ’s question , issued a statement saying it could not confirm any cases of unidentified flying objects .
“ This is an issue that the nation is interested in -- it is a defense issue and a confirmation operation needs to take place , ” Ryuji Yamane , a lawmaker from the main opposition Democratic Party who submitted the question to the cabinet , told Reuters .
“ But the government does not even try to collect information necessary for the confirmation . ”
Machimura , asked about the government ’s view on UFOs at a regular press conference , told reporters that the government can only offer a stereotyped response .
“ Personally , I definitely believe they exist , ” he said , apparently tongue in cheek .
But the prime minister stuck to the official view .
“ I have yet to confirm ( that UFOs exist ) , ” Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda told reporters later in the day .
John prefers that we not swear in our posts , so I 'm going to let the links speak for themselves , since if I do any more than that , I 'm liable to unleash a tirade of profanities that would make a sailor blush .
DailyKos :
( A)t least Mark Foley never physically acted on his nefarious impulses .
Former South Dakota State Rep. Ted Klaudt did , however .
On multiple occasions .
Klaudt had to exit the state legislature in 2006 due to term limits , after having a lost a battle for state senate in that same year -- but he sure had a doozie of a time while he was there .
I learned of this particular piece of distasteful debauchery from Howie Klein 's fantastic post on the subject at his blog Down With Tyranny .
As Klein says :
Like so many tightly wound repressed and mentally ill Republicans , Klaudt was preaching the moral superiority of the far right while he was abusing molesting children -- his own foster daughters and 2 state legislative pages !
He " faces a long list of charges : eight counts of rape , two counts of sexual exploitation of a minor , two counts of witness tampering , sexual contact with a person under 16 , and stalking . " emphasis added
Tristero and Digby add their two cents as well .
Do n't neglect to look at the kind of legislation this hypocritical slimebucket backed .
Over the past year , Richard Clayton and I have been tracking phishing websites .
For this work , we are indebted to PhishTank , a website where dedicated volunteers submit URLs from suspected phishing websites and vote on whether the submissions are valid .
The idea behind PhishTank is to bring together the expertise and enthusiasm of people across the Internet to fight phishing attacks .
The more people participate , the larger the crowd , the more robust it should be against errors and perhaps even manipulation by attackers .
Not so fast .
We studied the submission and voting records of PhishTank ’s users , and our results are published in a paper appearing at Financial Crypto next month .
It turns out that participation is very skewed .
While PhishTank has several thousand registered users , a small core of around 25 moderators perform the bulk of the work , casting 74 % of the votes we observed .
Both the distributions of votes and submissions follow a power law .
This leaves PhishTank more vulnerable to manipulation than would be the case if every member of the crowd participated to the same extent .
Why ?
If a few of the most active users stopped voting , a backlog of unverified phishing sites might collect .
It also means an attacker could join the system and vote maliciously on a massive scale .
Since 97 % of submissions to PhishTank are verified as phishing URLs , it would be easy for an attacker to build up reputation by voting randomly many times , and then sprinkle in malicious votes protecting the attacker ’s own phishing sites , for example .
Since over half of the phishing sites in PhishTank are duplicate rock - phish domains , a savvy attacker could build reputation by voting for these sites without contributing to PhishTank otherwise .
So crowd - sourcing your security decisions can leave you exposed to manipulation .
But how does PhishTank compare to the feeds maintained by specialist website take - down companies hired by the banks ?
Well , we compared PhishTank ’s feed to a feed from one such company , and found the company ’s feed to be slightly more complete and significantly faster in confirming phishing websites .
This is because companies can afford employees to verify their submissions .
We also found that users who vote less often are more likely to vote incorrectly , and that users who commit many errors tend to have voted on
the same URLs .
Despite these problems , we do not advocate against leveraging user participation in the design of all security mechanisms , nor do we believe that PhishTank should throw in the towel .
Some improvements can be made by automating obvious categorization so that the hard decisions are taken by PhishTank ’s users .
In any case , we implore caution before turning over a security decision to a crowd .
Infosecurity Magazine has written a news article describing this work .
The hypocrisy of the Republican Party is stunning .
For over 12 years they have protected the system of abuse that is flourishing on the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands ( CNMI ) , a US Territory in the Western Pacific just North of Guam .
Tom DeLay used to call the CNMI his " ... perfect petri dish of capitalism " .
For Tom and his ilk , the CNMI was a shinning ideal — a playground of experimentation .
And it was an experiment in unrestricted greed , abuse and exploitation .
What grew in DeLay ’s Petri dish were decades of well documented , detailed and irrefutable cases of sweatshops , forced prostitution , rape , money laundering , gambling , graft , corruption and incompetence .
This growing system of abuse has been reported to Congress multiple times since 1985 .
By 1995 the Pirates of Saipan hired Jack Abramoff to block any reform .
It worked .
The Marianas Islands is infected with a culture of abuse .
It is out of control and still going strong .
John Bowe ’s book illustrates how the CNMI has become the face of Modern Slavery in America .
There are no chains , just the coercion of rigged laws , inequality , neglect and a permanent underclass of workers without rights .
The Marianas Islands have become a place where justice , regulation , integrity , honor and the rule of law have been eaten by the cancer of corruption Mr. DeLay and his Party have nurtured in his perti dish .
It is a corrupt model of exploitation that the Republican Party is bringing to America and the world .
To sell the CNMI " economic model " to gullible Americans , they needed to spend some time there .
One " famous " trip was the Don Young Congressional delegation of February 1999 .
It was this trip that solidified the Republican Leadership in the House to act as a firewall to block reform legislation .
Despite the fact that there were bi-partisan majorities to pass CNMI reform legislation , a vote was never held .
Willie Tan , the patron of the K St. Project and head Pirate of Saipan explained how it was done to an uncover investigator just months after the Young CODEL :
Willie Tan : Sure .
You know what Tom [ DeLay ] told me ?
He said , [ Willie ] , if they elect me as majority whip , I make the schedule of the congress .
And I 'm not going to put it on the schedule .
They got to go through all committee before it come to me .
Even if it come to me , I 'm not going to schedule it .
What , are they going to have a motion to get it from my committee , they will not do that -- who are you ?
So Tom told me , forget it , [ Willie ] , not a chance .
Investigator :
And you 're sure his loyalties are n't going to change ?
Willie Tan :
We very close friend .
And you know what he did , he call those guys .
He call up the guy who is in charge of the committee , his name is Don Young from Alaska .
Investigator : Yeah , I know who he is .
Willie Tan :
And he said Don , nothing wrong with CNMI .
He say , you gotta go there .
If this is slave labor , mistreatment , those kind of thing , go after them .
It 's all not true .
And they change -- what 's the problem ?
You guys are trying to do something right into wrong .
Tom explain to them .
So , Don Young backed off .
So Tom DeLay and Jack Abramoff sent Don Young off to the CNMI to lead the effort to block reform legislation .
It was a 27 person delegation that included Delegates to Congress from other US Territories , staff members and five Members of Congress .
The February 15 , 1999 edition of the Marianas Variety promoted the coming trip ( emphasis added ) :
Headed by the committee chair , US Rep .
Don Young ( R - Alaska ) , the delegation includes US Reps .
Dana Rohrabacher ( R - California ) , John Doolittle ( R - California ) , Collin Peterson ( D - Minnesota ) , Ken Calvert ( R- California ) , Eni Faleomaveaga ( D - American Samoa ) , Robert Underwood ( D - Guam ) and Donna Christensen ( D - Virgin Islands ) .
The lone Democrat on the delegation , with voting rights , Peterson is a member of the US House Agriculture and Veteran Affairs Committees .
For Rohrabacher , it will be his second visit to the CNMI .
During floor discussions last year in the US House of Representatives , he defended the CNMI 's control over its immigration and minimum wage policies .
The delegation arrived on the 18th .
Hundreds of foreign contract workers were waiting to meet with them .
They had hoped that these Representatives of the US Congress were coming to learn .
Instead , the Young delegation ignored them , dismissed them and , in effect , endorsed the abuse .
John Bowe ’s book lays out the details of their lazy exploration of charges of labor abuse and the explains the type of fact - finding that the Young CODEL was really after ( emphasis added ) :
Later that weekend , a group of at least three congress members took their fact - finding mission to a Filipina strip club called Orchids , owned by a local businessman named Benigno Fitial .
The club , was popular with local government officials and visiting VIPs looking for a good time .
Later , the gang moved on to another club , called Russian Roulette , which featured Russian strippers .
According to one source who was professionally obligated to accompany the delegation around the island , " I 've never seen grown men — they were just like kids ! "
He reported that he sat next to one congressman , who was neither drinking nor getting into the action , while the others " were running to the back of the place into these little stalls to get blow jobs .
That 's why they were there . "
I spoke with the congressman he sat next to .
He admitted to being in the club but described it not as a strip club but as a karaoke bar .
He assured me , " There really was n't much going on . "
Neither the congressman nor my source were able to remember the names of the allegedly misbehaving congressmen .
So , there were five Congressmen on the trip .
One was the source .
At least three went club hopping .
At least two US Congressmen were running to the " little stalls " to get blow jobs .
Instead of investigating human trafficking , forced prostitution and labor abuse — these Congressmen were giddy sexual tourists .
To review , it could have been :
Don Young ( AK - AL )
Dana Rohrabacher ( CA - 46 )
John Doolittle ( CA - 04 )
Collin Peterson ( MN - 07 )
Ken Calvert ( CA - 44 )
This should become a National a guessing game :
Who got " serviced " in Saipan ?
For my money , I would say it was Peterson who was the source .
The news reports of the trip had him talking about the abuse of the workers and he was not one of Jack ’s Congressmen .
On the other hand , Young , Doolittle , Calvert and Rohrabacher were firmly on Team Abramoff .
I suspect the club hoppers were in this group .
Of the four , I do n’t see Doolittle heading to the back room for sex ( he was most likely in another back room pocketing a bribe campaign contribution ) .
The most likely suspects are Young , Calvert and Rohrabacher , especially Rohrabacher .
It would be good to push this and have the GOP explain yet another sex scandal .
And while they ’re at it , they could explain their hands - on support for human trafficking , especially because the abuse is still rampant on the CNMI .
Last February , the Senate held a Hearing on Legislation to end the abuse on the CNMI .
One of the speakers was a young woman from the Philippians Kayleen Entena .
Her written statement is chilling and all too familiar for those of us following the long tail of abuse on the CNMI .
She tells of coming to the CNMI to work at a job that vanished when she arrived .
Then she was forced into prostitution .
There are literally hundreds , if not thousands , of these abuse narratives gathered from the " guest workers " to the CNMI over the last 25 years .
Some were described in reports to Congress , and other testified in a Hearing just like Kayleen .
Another young woman , Katrina , told a similar story to Congress in 1998 and by 1999 she was telling her story to ABC News in an episode of 20 /20 broadcasted just months after some US Congressmen went on a sex adventure , participating in the abuse of other young woman in the coerced sex shops of Saipan .
In a flash of hypocrisy , one of those Congressmen was Dana Rohrabacher who helped Abramoff push back on the story of Katrina ’s abuse when it came out in a 1997 Readers Digest Article .
And earlier this month , the Marianas Variety reported that a minor was among those " almost " rescued from forced sexual servitude :
The Moon Night Club was recently raided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Attorney General ’s Office Investigative Unit where a minor was found working as a nude dancer , Variety sources said .
The 17 - year - old was " deported " to the Philippines after the raid , the same sources said .
Did you get that ?
A victim of human trafficking — a 17 year - old — was deported to fall back into the human trafficking networks .
This is the standard MO of the current Government of the CNMI — to deport victims of abuse before they can get justice .
There is an aggressive and active form of ethnic cleansing underway on the CNMI .
The target is any foreign contract worker who might get justice — if reform legislation is passed .
And CNMI reform legislation has been introduced House , H.R. 3079 and in the Senate , S. 1634 .
Both Bills are similar and both share common flaws .
Perhaps the most glaring is that these invited workers in the CNMI — who are there legally and have been there for years and years — do not have any pathway to US Citizenship .
While these Bills have some problems , it is important to remember that the goal of the Pirates of Saipan and their allies is to delay legislation , slow it down and once again kill reform .
We can not let them run that same game plan again .
And it needs to happen quickly .
An active purge is well underway .
Leading that purge is CNMI Governor Benigno Fitial .
And yes , he is the same fellow who ran the strip club where the Congressmen started their night of sexual tourism .
I ’m told he is still in the club business and does n’t consider a deal done until it is " celebrated " at one of the CNMI sex clubs .
Fitial is a sick and twisted puppy .
He is also a pimp ( in every sense of the word ) .
The economic system on the CNMI is vile .
It is an economic failure and an embarrassment .
It is a warning sign of the damage caused when a class of workers is created and denied rights .
Buy a copy of Nobodies : Modern American Slave Labor and the Dark Side of the Global Economy by John Bowe .
This is an important work and I encourage everyone to read it .
This book will challenge you , depress you and provided you a better understanding why slavery is on the rise in our shiny new global economy here at home and around the planet .
( And check out this interview with John on TreeHugger.com ) .
The GOP Saipan sex scandal is not the most appalling thing in the book nor is it the most shocking .
That dubious prize would have to go to the growth of modern slavery in the shadows of globalization and the dark corners of the human heart .
The CNMI is a gateway into this darkness .
I ’ve written a lot about this cesspool of racism , greed , incompetence and immorality also know as the CNMI .
It is a complicated story and the harm falls on both the foreign contract workers and the indigenous Chamorro / Carolinian population .
A distorted reality has been created .
The failed economic system is also destroying the eco-system of the island , the infrastructure and the traditional culture of the local population .
This culture of addiction is artfully explained in Nobodies .
Bowe describes an ugly place masked by myth , prejudice , tropical beauty and a clash of cultures .
The foreign investors , indigenous Chamorro / Carolinian population and relocated US Citizens from the mainland share the obscene and unacknowledged dependence on a permanent underclass of workers .
They can not let go even as the system destroys them .
That is why reform is needed and needed NOW .
For years and years , justice and reform was blocked by Jack Abramoff , Tom DeLay and the Republican Party .
Tom and Jack are otherwise engaged .
If we fail now it will be on our watch .
We can not fail .
Let ’s prove that we can get something done .
Call your Member of Congress and Senators and urge them to Sponsor H.R. 3079 and in the Senate , S. 1634 .
Call you favorite Presidential Candidate ’s campaign .
Urge them to take a stand on H.R. 3079 and S. 1634 .
Most are in the 110th Congress and any of the Senators could lead this fight — easily .
It is way past time for justice .
Let ’s get this done !
Cheers .
The Conspiracy Against Renewable Energy
By John F. Miglio
I hate to use the “ C ” word , but there is no other way to say it .
There is a national conspiracy to prevent renewable energy from becoming the primary energy source in the United States .
And who are the conspirators ?
The usual cast of characters : the fossil fuels industry , which continues to rake in exorbitant profits on oil and gas while it refuses to make any significant investment in renewable energy , even in the face of global warming ; the members of the mainstream news media , too craven to cross their corporate masters by doing any serious coverage on the viability of renewable energy in today ’s market ; and the members of Congress , too addicted to the big bucks they receive from Big Oil and other traditional energy sources to create any sweeping renewable energy legislation for the good of the country .
The truth is , if it were not for this unholy trinity of greed , cowardice , and bribery , all of us would already be living in solar or wind powered homes and driving electric cars to and from work .
Here are the facts :
1 ) According to the U.S. Department of Energy , the amount of solar energy that hits the surface of the earth every hour is greater than the total amount of energy that the entire human population requires in a year .
Another way of looking at it is that roughly 100 square miles of solar panels placed in the southwestern U.S. could power the entire country .
2 ) The Department of Energy also states that all U.S. electrical energy needs could be met by the wind in Texas and the Dakotas alone .
3 ) In 1977 , the Office of Technology Assessment published a nonpartisan report that concluded that if the federal government offered substantial tax credits and incentives to speed up the mass production of renewable energy technologies , these technologies " could be made competitive in markets representing over 40 % of U.S. energy demand by the mid-1980s . "
At that rate , they would be competitive in almost all markets today .
4 ) The technology to produce photovoltaic panels and modern wind turbines has been around for decades , and thousands of Americans already have installed these renewable technologies on their homes and businesses , cutting their energy bills by significant margins .
Recently , a New Jersey resident named Mike Mercurio installed both an array of solar panels on his roof and a wind turbine in his back yard and cut his energy bill from over $ 300 per month to about $ 10 per month .
This immediately begs the question :
If we have the renewable technology at hand and we know it works , why do n’t we use it in place of heavily polluting energy sources like oil , gas or coal ?
And why have so few people installed solar panels or windmills on their homes and in their backyards ?
The primary reason is because the cost of renewable energy is still relatively high compared to fossil fuels , although the gap is closing as the cost of natural gas and oil continues to climb .
For example , the price to install an array of photovoltaic panels on the average home -- notwithstanding some modest tax incentives and rebates from the government -- is anywhere from $ 20,000 to $ 40,000 .
At this price , only those who are well off can afford to have solar panels installed on their homes .
Of course , anyone with half a brain knows that once a product is mass produced , its price per unit plummets .
But in order to facilitate this process and make it happen over a period of years and not decades , the federal government ( with help from the states ) needs to institute a massive , full - scale national renewable energy program , something equivalent to the Marshall Plan , something that would transform our entire society within a decade .
It can begin this process with a four - point plan : 1 ) Mandate tight pollution standards on the fossil fuels industry and stiff penalties for not abiding by them .
This will get the carbon - based boys to start thinking about divesting some of their money into renewable energy .
2 ) Impose high CAFE standards on auto manufacturers and stiff penalties if they do n’t implement them post haste .
This will get the bright boys at GM to start thinking about electric cars in a big way .
3 ) Implement a windfall profits tax on oil companies and remove tax incentives to the entire fossil fuels industry .
This will create billions of dollars that can be used to promote renewable energy .
4 ) Offer generous tax credits and incentives to the renewable energy industry to facilitate mass production of its technology and equally generous tax credits and incentives for homeowners to buy it .
If Congress made this four - point plan a reality , it would literally reverse the brain - dead energy policy that has been in effect for the past 27 years , ever since Ronald Reagan , Big Oil ’s Bad Boy , strutted into office , decimated Jimmy Carter ’s renewable energy program , and created energy bills and tax policies that favored the fossil fuels industry at the expense of renewable technology .

ORME , Tennessee ( CNN ) --
The drought in the Southeastern United States means more than just brown lawns to the folks in Orme , Tennessee .
Water flows from their taps for just three hours each evening .
A 1961 firetruck loads up with water from a hydrant in Alabama to haul back to Orme , Tennessee .

The mountain spring that supplies water to the town usually dries up at the end of summer , but just for a few days .
This year it dried up early , on August 1 , and has n't revived , leaving the town 's 145 residents high and dry and relying on water trucked in from the next state .
Every day at 6 p.m. , Orme Mayor Tony Reames turns a big valve to release water from the town 's tank .
When he turns the crank again at 9 p.m. , taps in the town run dry .
" When they cut it back on we jump for joy , " Orme resident Debbie Cash said .
" And then you only have it for three hours . "
Three hours to do all the laundry , bathing , dishwashing and animal watering that has to be done .
Watch how Cash copes »
The old mining town could be the canary in the coal mine for the rest of the region .
Just 150 miles to the southeast , the 4.5 million people who live in and around Atlanta , Georgia , are nervously watching water levels go down at their major reservoir .
The drought has highlighted an ongoing struggle between Georgia , Alabama and Florida over rights to water from the Chattahoochee River .
" All of these people that are on the river systems better take note , because once your streams and tributaries to the river start drying up , the river is n't far behind , " Reames said .

Volunteers take turns three days a week driving a tanker truck or Orme 's diesel - belching 1961 fire truck to a hydrant near Bridgeport , Alabama , 2½ miles down the road .
Making several round trips , they haul about 25,000 gallons of water back to Orme each day .
Bridgeport , which gets its water from the Tennessee River , does n't charge its neighbor .
Stevenson and New Hope , Alabama , also help out , occasionally bringing trucks full of water to the hydrant , where it 's transferred to the Orme trucks .
See where Orme has to go for water »
But things are looking up in Orme .
A pipeline from Bridgeport is nearly complete , built with the help of a $ 378,000 grant from the federal government .
" With this new water coming in , then we 'll have it made , " Cash said .
" Now we wo n't have to worry about it no more . "
In addition , an Austin , Texas , company called H2O Guard is planning to donate water - saving sink aerators , shower heads and toilet valves to everyone in Orme on November 17 , company spokesman Robert Easter said .
" We think we 're going to get another 90 gallons ' savings per day per household , " Easter said .
" That 'll make that little water tower in that town go from three hours to four hours without any change in anyone 's habits . "
Reames said residents have found creative ways to conserve , flushing toilets with condensation water from air conditioners and undrinkable water from swimming pools that were filled early in the summer .
It 's a lesson for everyone .
" Cherish the water you got and be kind of careful with it , " Cash said , " because you never know if you will be out of water . "

WASHINGTON 
In a setback for the White House , Senate Democrats on Monday put off until at least next month any decision on whether to give legal protection to the phone carriers that helped with the National Security Agency ’s eavesdropping program .
The Bush administration had pushed for immediate passage of legislation to grant immunity to the phone companies as part of a broader expansion of the N.S.A. ’s wiretapping authorities .
But that will not happen now .
After daylong debate in the Senate on the wiretapping issue , Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the majority leader , announced at the end of the day that there would not be time to consider the legislation this week as he had hoped .
With a dozen competing amendments on the issue and an omnibus spending bill separately awaiting consideration , Mr. Reid said he believed it would be difficult to give the wiretapping issue the close consideration that it deserved this week before the Senate leaves for its Christmas recess .
“ Democrats are committed to improving our nation ’s intelligence laws while protecting Americans ’ civil liberties , ” Mr. Reid said .
“ We need to take the time necessary to debate a bill that does just that , rather than rushing one through the legislative process . ”

Think twice before you flush the toilet .
You might be sending evidence straight to the authorities — at least if you 're getting high in Italy or Switzerland .
Scientists there recently did a study in which they tracked narcotic use through municipal sewage systems .
Twice a day , at weekly intervals , wastewater was spirited out of treatment plants in Milan and Lugano , dried with a blast of nitrogen , then injected into a mass spectrometer to detect illicit substances .
They kept tabs on methamphetamine , cocaine , marijuana , heroin , and morphine use for five months .
What did they learn ?
Not surprisingly , meth and cocaine use spiked on Fridays and Saturdays .
Overall , drug consumption was nearly double official estimates , which relied on crime data and interviews .
It seems people are reluctant to disclose weekend binges .
Now they do n't have to .
It 'll all come out in the end .

As I write these words on the morning of Wednesday , Dec. 19 , high - and low - level officials of the Bush administration involved in torture , and the destruction of the torture tapes , are consulting their criminal lawyers as The New York Times reports that highest - level lawyers in the administration had discussed the destruction of the tapes .
I predict there will soon be new stories about more torture tapes that were destroyed and new stories about more high - level officials that were either tainted or corrupted by this scandal , and others who opposed this travesty who will ultimately testify about who they approached to attempt to prevent it .
Washington and America will momentarily ask once again :
What did the president and vice president know , and when did they know it ?
In an administration facing an ocean of scandal on multiple and multiplying fronts , this scandal above all will be the Watergate of our times because it involves extremely probable crimes of torture , extremely probable obstructions of justice , and a steady stream of revelations that will only escalate until the inevitable special prosecutor is named .
Congress should , and I predict ultimately will , take the decisive action of seeking evidence , and if necessary file the great contempt case of the Bush years that will be defined clearly and specifically as follows :
Can executive privilege be claimed to hide acts that would be violations of criminal law ?
I predict the answer of this Supreme Court , and any Supreme Court , will be unequivocally “ no . ”
Even a mass pardon by the president , which I have predicted and predict again here , will not solve their problem , because he would have to name so many recipients of pardons , and so many potential crimes that would be pardoned , that it would be both ridiculous and logistically impossible .
What follows is the column I wrote in The Hill newspaper published on Tuesday , Dec. 18 before this new information came to light , and before new revelations about more destruction of more torture tapes that I predict are coming soon :
In unprecedented congressional testimony Brig .
Gen .
Thomas Hartmann recently refused to say it would be illegal for American POWs to be tortured through waterboarding by our enemies .
He could n’t because a policy claimed to be legal when committed by our government would be equally legal when committed by our enemies against our troops and POWs .
The legal perversion of Gen. Hartmann ’s testimony would outrage American military families .
It dramatizes how alien this torture policy is from two centuries of American military and legal tradition , when an American general cannot defend the time - honored rights of American POWs , and America ’s enemies could use his testimony as their defense for torture against our troops .
From the days of George Washington , every president , every Congress and every Supreme Court has believed that torture is illegal and violates cardinal American values .
From the days of the Continental Army until today , torture has been opposed by virtually every commander of every branch of military service .
President Bush does not speak for any previous president , all of whom unanimously opposed what he does today .
With all of the discredited practices of the Bush years , his playing on the darker impulses of fear to justify what no previous president , no previous Congress and no previous Supreme Court has ever allowed is testimony to the damage this does to American honor and the threats this creates for American troops .
Of course , the CIA destroyed the torture tapes that were sought as evidence by the 9 - 11 Commission , courts and Congress .
They were destroyed because they were evidence of abuses that the weight of legal opinion would conclude constitutes criminal conduct under international and American law .
Their destruction probably constitutes obstruction of justice , intended to cover up the underlying crimes of the torture itself .
In this warped reality - distortion field that history will condemn as the Bush years , a general cannot even stand up for the rights , protection and safety of American POWs because to condemn abuses against our POWs would condemn the abuses he defends before Congress .
It is outrageous for advocates of torture to say : “ We are against torture , but ” when every previous President , Congress and Supreme Court have said : “ We are against torture , period . ”
Torture is a cancer that metastasizes to everything it touches .
Our international credibility collapses .
Our POWs are exposed to grave new dangers .
The destruction of evidence becomes inevitable .
The obstruction of justice becomes a reality and the inevitably failed cover - up is exposed .
In fact , the CIA needs to be protected from the bad judgment of our president , as much as the bad actions of our enemies .
Torture corrupts the military chain of command , Civilians who never served in the military order uniformed officers to commit acts that they strongly oppose .
Torture corrupts military justice by creating a super - secret infrastructure of detention centers that enable torture , morphing into an infrastructure of secret courts and secret evidence that almost inevitably lead to secret crimes that are ultimately exposed .
Torture corrupts our democracy as these wrongs are committed without public disclosure , without congressional oversight , and without judicial review that Justice Jackson warned at Nuremberg protects the rule of law in a civilized world .
It is no coincidence that Attorney General Michael Mukasey pursues the doctrine of former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , trying to exclude Congress yet again , in yet another attack on constitutional checks and balances .
An independent counsel is clearly needed because the Justice Department and CIA have been thoroughly integrated into the actions and justifications for the practices under investigation .
There is no credence when government agencies so thoroughly integrated into the torture policy investigate themselves without independent review .
This constitutes not merely the extreme perception of conflict of interest , but the extreme reality of conflict of interest .
This conflict is even more draconian because of the unexplained reversal of position by the attorney general himself , on this very subject , between his first and second days of testimony during his confirmation hearings .
Military families oppose torture because they have a profound respect for military honor , military justice and military values .
Like every previous generation of American presidents and American commanders , they know that torture endangers those they love , who serve so bravely .

Mercury Chases the Sunset
Image Credit & Copyright : Doug Zubenel
Explanation :
This colorful view of the western sky at sunset features last Wednesday 's slender crescent Moon .
Of course , when the Moon is in its crescent phase it can never be far from the Sun in the sky .
Also always close to the Sun in Earth 's sky is innermost planet Mercury , seen here below and right of center against the bright orange glow along the horizon .
Mercury is usually difficult to glimpse because of overwhelming sunlight , but increasingly better views of the small planet after sunset will be possible as it wanders farther east of the Sun in the coming days .
On January 14th , NASA 's MESSENGER spacecraft will have a good view too , as it makes its first Mercury flyby .
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : media@aclu.org
NEW YORK - The American Civil Liberties Union today filed a motion asking a federal judge to hold the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) in contempt , charging that the agency flouted a court order when it destroyed at least two videotapes documenting the harsh interrogation of prisoners in its custody .
In response to Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests filed by the ACLU and other organizations in October 2003 and May 2004 , the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered the CIA to produce or identify all records pertaining to the treatment of detainees in its custody .
Despite the court ’s ruling , the CIA never produced the tapes or even acknowledged their existence .
Last week , in anticipation of media reports concerning the tapes , CIA Director Michael Hayden publicly acknowledged that the CIA had made the tapes in 2002 but destroyed them in 2005 .
“ The CIA ’s secret destruction of these tapes displays a flagrant disregard for the rule of law , ” said Amrit Singh , a staff attorney with the ACLU ’s Immigrants ’ Rights Project .
“ It must be sanctioned for violating the court ’s order and the obligation to preserve records that fell within the scope of our Freedom of Information Act requests . ”
The tapes , which showed CIA operatives subjecting suspects to extremely harsh interrogation methods , should have been identified and processed for the ACLU in response to its FOIA request demanding information on the treatment and interrogation of detainees in U.S. custody .
The tapes were also withheld from the 9/11 Commission , appointed by President Bush and Congress , which had formally requested that the CIA hand over transcripts and recordings documenting the interrogation of CIA prisoners .
“ These tapes were clearly responsive to the Freedom of Information Act requests that we filed in 2003 and 2004 , and accordingly the CIA was under a legal obligation to produce the tapes to us or to provide a legal justification for withholding them , ” said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU ’s National Security Project .
“ By destroying these tapes , the CIA violated the statute as well as an order of the court .
In the circumstances , it would be entirely appropriate for the court to hold the agency in contempt . ”
The motion filed today relates to a lawsuit that was filed in 2004 to enforce a FOIA request for records concerning the treatment of prisoners in U.S. custody abroad .
The ACLU brought the FOIA lawsuit with the Center for Constitutional Rights , Physicians for Human Rights , Veterans for Common Sense and Veterans for Peace .
The motion filed today asks the court to hold the CIA in contempt ; to require the CIA to produce a complete list of all records that fall within the scope of the FOIA requests that have been destroyed ( including tapes ) ; and to require the CIA to file with the court a detailed written description of the substance of the destroyed tapes .
“ The interrogation techniques employed by our government raise fundamental questions of human rights and decency , ” said Arthur Eisenberg , New York Civil Liberties Union Legal Director .
“ The CIA can not avoid those questions by simply destroying the evidence . ”
The ACLU brief and related legal documents are available online at : www.aclu.org/torturefoia
Many of these documents are also contained and summarized in Administration of Torture , a recently published book by Jaffer and Singh .
More information is available online at :
www.aclu.org/administrationoftorture
Attorneys in the FOIA case are Lawrence S. Lustberg and Melanca D. Clark of the New Jersey - based law firm Gibbons P.C. ; Jaffer , Singh and Judy Rabinovitz of the ACLU ; Arthur Eisenberg and Beth Haroules of the New York Civil Liberties Union ; and Shayana Kadidal and Michael Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Rights .
AS New Scientist went to press , one of the front - runners for the Republican US presidential nomination was a politician who does not believe in evolution .

None of the other remaining candidates has denied evolution .

And While We 're Talking About Injustice
Brian wrote earlier about the relative lack of outcry in the Jena Six case among the liberal blogosphere , and Teh Portly Dyke has written a lot about how the mainstream media has ignored the story of the Republican U.S. Attorney General who tried to rape a fucking five year old .
So since we 're on the subject , I 'd like to express a little outrage myself .
First , a disclaimer : Andrew Meyer probably did n't deserve to get tasered .
The investigation is ongoing , of course , and it's important to remember that we do n't have a whole lot of context in which to evaluate what we saw in the Youtube video .
Nevertheless , it 's pretty apparent that the cops had him outnumbered , and had him on the ground .
The tasering bit seems excessive .
But ...
( And here 's where I start to sound like a bad liberal )
The guy went to the speech looking to get tasered -- or , at the very least , dragged out and arrested .
He showed up in this public forum , pushed his way past his classmates to get to the front of the line so he could harass a U.S. Senator with disrespectful , irrelevant questions that he already knew the answers to .
He even brought his own video camera , because -- like a lot of people under 25 who do n't have two brain cells to rub together -- he 's obsessed with being famous .
He 's grown up with The Real World and other " reality " shows , and has bought into the belief that the most worthwhile thing a person can aspire to is to be on TV .
Or , in a pinch , YouTube .
No question , the cops should n't have indulged his infantile posturing .
And no question , someone probably deserves to be severely reprimanded -- if not suspended or even fired -- over this .
But let 's not fool ourselves -- this is not the case where a student activist was punished by redneck cops for exercising his right to free speech ; this kid actually tried to deny other students their right to ask questions of the Senator , and deny the Senator the right to answer questions posed to him , by yelling and shrieking and acting like the self - centered little nitwit he is .
The cops may have overstepped their bounds , but that does n't mean that Andrew Meyer was right .
Anyway , if you Google the phrase " Andrew Meyer " with the word " taser , " you get 236,000 hits .
Meanwhile , if you simply Google the name " Lennox Yearwood " -- the African - American minister who had his leg severely injured ( possibly broken , depending on which account you read ) by Congressional Police Officers merely for wearing a badge that read " I Love the People of Iraq " while standing in line to hear the Petraeus testimony -- you merely get 143,000 hits .
Refine the search further to include the word " leg , " and you get a paltry 17,900 hits .
Where 's the outrage for Lennox Yearwood ?
Any chance that those who are working overtime to keep the Andrew Meyer story in the news might spend a little time focusing on an even greater abuse of power where someone actually was seriously hurt ?
If his plans are successful , the inventor of flash memory is just a few steps away from delivering three - dimensional semiconductors that will give us processing chips running at ten times the speed of current - generation designs .
Fujio Masuoka , CTO of Unisantis Electronics in Japan , has announced a deal [ PDF link ] to work on his 3D chip designs with Singapore ’s Institute of Microelectronics to take advantage of the island nation ’s government facilities and specialists .
He hopes that - within two years - the resulting 3D semiconductors will replace flat chip circuits to create processors that are ten times faster than current chips of the same size .
Masuoka , who invented flash memory while at Toshiba , says he intends to pay royalties to the Singapore government while licensing the new super chips to major manufacturers .
All of which means we could soon be using CPUs that make current cutting - edge architecture like the Cell look like a horse - drawn cart .

One of Hollywood 's biggest foes is about to be called on the carpet .
After years of steering Web surfers to free entertainment , the organizers of a massive directory of pirated movies , music and software in Sweden could finally face serious legal repercussions .
Based on evidence collected in a 2006 raid on the offices of The Pirate Bay , Swedish prosecutors say that by the end of January they expect to charge the individuals who operate the file - sharing service with conspiracy to breach copyrights .
While Sweden might seem to be an unlikely harbor for pirates of any kind , weak copyright laws , lax enforcement , high broadband penetration and general antipathy toward the entertainment industry have made it a file - sharing free - for - all .
Last year , 43 % of the people participating in a survey by Sweden 's biggest phone company said they planned to download music during the year .
A pro-piracy political party has more members than the Greens .
The prosecutors ' move comes after years of complaints from Hollywood executives and U.S. government officials .
U.S. Embassy officials have described Sweden as home to the " worst Internet piracy in the world , " and the Motion Picture Association of America has been fighting to shutter Pirate Bay 's site for years .
Sweden , which enjoys some of the world 's fastest Internet speeds , strengthened its laws in 2005 to make online theft of movies a crime .
But its efforts to crack down have had little success so far .
In 2006 , shortly after Swedish Justice Department representatives visiting Washington received a stern lecture from U.S. officials about the alleged damage being caused by Pirate Bay , Swedish police raided the site 's offices and shut it down .
It ’s been a while since we ’ve had a fresh How - To on the Hack - A - Day , and frankly we ’ve missed them .
To get things rolling , [ Eliot ] and I wanted to build a good knowledge base to help you hack your own stuff .
I know that soldering wo n’t be new to many of our readers , but everyone has to start sometime .
Our hope is simple : that this new series of How - To ’s will help inspire new and experienced hackers alike .
Having the right tools and workspace are key to successful soldering .
The actual technique is pretty simple .
We will cover all the basic tools you need , the key to good soldering , and how to undo your mistakes or harvest components from old hardware .
The first thing you ’ll need is a decent soldering iron .
Weller makes a decent product , but RadioShack ’s are dirt cheap if you ’re in a hurry .
My favorite iron was a temperature controlled Tenma with LED temp display ( sadly lost from a crappy storage unit along with my oscilloscope ) .
Most soldering stations come with a sponge ; they get lost and they tend to hold onto bits of solder .
I actually prefer to use a paper towel instead .
Either way , wet it down and give it a squeeze so it ’s not sopping wet .
If it dries out , it ’ll burn when you wipe your iron on it .
Buying the right kind of solder is just as important .
It comes in various thicknesses , metal alloys , and core types .
I wo n’t get very deep into the alloys .
Generally , you want 60 /40 ( 60 % tin , 40 % lead ) .
Most modern electronics are lead free , but for hobby work lead is fine .
Just wash your hands when you ’re done !
The solder produced for plumbing work is usually very thick ( left hand side ) and has a solid metal core ( or worse : acid core ) .
For electronics work , you ’ll definitely need rosin core .
The rosin acts as flux for the solder , allowing it to flow onto and attach to the metal .
You can certainly use liquid flux / rosin , but it ’s usually not easy to find locally .
For thickness , I always buy the thinnest rosin core I can find .
To sum up : you want thin , rosin core , 60 / 40 solder .
Not all iron tips are created equal .
For fine work , I always reach for my 15 watt Weller pencil iron .
It has the smallest tip I could find , and I ground an even finer point on the tip with my rotary tool .
The bigger iron is an inexpensive RadioShack station that I keep in my office to handle favors for coworkers .
Every so often , the tip of a soldering iron needs a little maintenance .
If the end of the iron is n’t tinned , as in bright and shiny when you wipe it down , you ’ll have a hard time getting solder to melt .
Think of this stuff as a sort of pumice stone for your iron .
Heat the iron up and rub the tip in the cleaner .
The cleaner will melt a bit and your soldering iron should work better than ever .
Securely holding the work piece is important , but your hands will be busy with the iron and solder .
My current favorite tool is this Panavise Jr. which runs about $ 25 .
Props to Ladyada for unknowingly turning me onto Panavise products .
If you need something cheaper , you can score a set of helping hands – it ’s set of alligator clips connected to a weighted base .
They work great and I still use them for smaller soldering projects .
Some projects require extra fine attention to detail .
A giant magnifying glass lamp comes in handy when visually inspecting for shorts and dealing with surface mount problems ( I inherited this one one from my grandmother ) .
You ’ll be fine without one , but they ’re great when you need to work on really small components or when your eyes are getting tired .
For one - off projects , prototyping boards from RadioShack are handy .
They ’re cheap , easy to get , and making a connection is as simple as bridging your solder across the copper pads .
Before investing your time soldering parts together , it ’s a good idea to prototype your circuit .
Breadboards like these are great for preventing frustration later on .
When I tried to buy my first one , I was about 10 years old .
Nobody knew what the hell I was talking about and the local RadioShack apparently did n’t keep them in stock .
People at RadioShack kept trying to sell me kitchen cutting boards .
After about a year of wondering if [ Forrest Mims ] was insane , I finally visited another RadioShack that actually had them .
Do n’t bake your bits .
Passive components like resistors or small ceramic capacitors do n’t usually suffer any problems from being heated up , but you should still pay attention to how long you ’ve been cooking them with your soldering iron .
If you ’re having problems getting a solder joint just right , let the parts rest for a few minutes so they have a chance to cool off between soldering rounds .
Integrated circuits like this logic chip are usually far more sensitive to heat and static than passive components .
Sockets are cheap insurance against blowing a chip .
RadioShack sells the small red handled clip as a heat sink .
It ’s okay , but a generic hemostat like the one above works and holds on even better .
They ’re also great for saving your finger tips from burns by holding wires in place while you solder them .
To successfully solder a component , do n’t melt the solder on the iron .
Put the iron against the copper on the board ( solder pad ) and the component you want to attach .
Give the iron a moment to heat up both of them .
Then melt the solder on the component and , if needed the copper pad .
Do not melt the solder on the tip of the iron .
Sometimes it ’s necessary to melt a small amount on the iron to facilitate heat transfer , but to achieve a good connection , you want the solder to melt and flow onto the component leads .
Heat up the component with the iron just before applying solder !
Once the joint is good , the soldering iron can be used to remove small amou
nts of excess solder from the joint .
Wipe the solder and burn rosin off by pulling the tip across your wet sponge or paper towel .
The joint should be good if the solder flowed onto both the copper pad and the wire lead of the component .
Now you ’ll need to trim down the excess wire lead of the component .
If you use diagonal cutters , the piece you cut off will probably fly through the air .
These flat cutters are my favorite : the metal wire stays still and the resulting edge is n’t nearly as sharp .
Nobody ’s perfect .
Sometimes we need to remove a bad component or undo a mistake .
Desoldering braid works sort of like a sponge for excess solder .
To desolder something , just place the braid over the target and apply your soldering iron over the top .
The heat should transfer through the braid and the melted solder will flow onto the the copper like oil though a wick .
For larger amounts of solder , I normally pull out my bigger iron .
For small amounts , even the pencil iron does the trick .
For larger desoldering jobs , like recovering components , a desoldering iron works wonders .
The hotter the better , so let it warm up for a while before using it .
Compress the bulb with your thumb before you touch the board with the iron .
Once it ’s in position , give it a moment the heat the solder and release the bulb .
The bulb with suck up the solder through the hollow tip .
Larger components might take a few hits , but smaller ones usually only take a single pull .
We ’ve covered all the basics : the tools , soldering and desoldering .
If you ’re looking for a good starter project , I highly suggest taking a shot at making your own headphone amplifier .
I built this one from RadioShack parts ( I had some high end opamps in my parts bin ) .
It ’s a rewarding , low cost project .

Chinese parents are known for their willingness to do whatever for the happiness of their children , and for Yang Qinji , a 68 - year - old father , the case is even more so .
The undated photo show Andy Lau ( L ) taking a photo with Yang Lijuan , who has been on a 13 - year craze for the Hong Kong pop star .
[ sina.com via Andy Lau's Fans Club ]
On March 27 , 2007 , Yang ended his life by jumping into the Salisbury sea in Hong Kong , one day after he managed to help his 29 - year - old daughter meet her icon , Hong Kong pop star Andy Lau , leaving a posthumous letter pleading Lau to meet his daughter for another time , reported sina.com , a leading Chinese web portal .
A 12 - year craze for pop singer
Yang Lijuan , the daughter , fell strongly for Lau after having a dream about him - a picture in her room bearing the words " You walk close to me , and we fell in love with each other . "
She quitted school since then , and turned into a full - time die - hard fan of Andy Lau .
Over the past 12 years , she has , through various means , expressed her admiration for Lau , and attended his concerts or fan meetings whenever possible , paying two trips to Hong Kong and six to Beijing .
Unwilling to see their daughter 's heart broken , Yang 's parents , especially the father , a retired middle school teacher , have stood by her all these years , trying to meet her demands .
In October 2004 , the father even accompanied his daughter to attend a Lau's concert at the Workers ' Stadium in Beijing .
However , the daughter 's craze for Lau also caused huge economic burden to the not - so - rich family .
In 2004 , in order to raise money for her daughter 's second trip to Hong Kong , the father sold their house , and the family has since lived in a rented house .
In 2006 , he even considered selling his kidney to pay his daughter 's third Hong Kong trip , causing a media outcry .
" We have no choice .
We feel our hearts aching to see the child tortured .
We only hope things will change after a meet with the icon . " the father was quoted as saying during an interview .
In response to the reports , Lau called Yang Li Juan to stop her overdone act .
" I hate those unfilial people who are selfish and show little respect and concern for their parents , and I will not care the fans who hope to see me through unhealthy means . "
A number of people — Greg Mankiw , in particular — have been pointing to relatively low new claims for unemployment insurance as a sign that the economy is actually doing just fine .
Oops .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) – First - time jobless claims rocketed higher last week .
Initial claims rose 69,000 to 375,000 in the week ended Jan. 26 , the Labor Department reported Thursday .
This is the highest level since early October and the biggest gain since September 2005 in the wake of Hurricane Katrina .
Now , to be fair , this number jumps around a lot , partly because of big problems in getting the seasonal adjustment right .
Probably things are n’t as bad as this latest number suggests — but probably they were n’t as good as the last few reports indicated , either .
Meanwhile , other stuff also suggests problems :
A VICIOUS cult run by cynical fraudsters , or a sincerely held religious belief persecuted by zealots ?
That is the long - standing row about Scientology , founded by the late science - fiction writer , L. Ron Hubbard .
In some countries , such as Germany , the group is watched by the security services .
In others , such as America and Australia , it has won charitable status as a religion .
Until now the fight could mostly be seen as one - sided .
Scientology 's lawyers are vigorous litigants .
The group argues that its internal materials ( which claim , among other things , that expensive courses of treatment can help rid people of infestation by alien souls from an extinct civilisation ) are commercially confidential and protected by copyright .
They react sharply to any perceived libel .
As a result , public critics of what they derisively term “ $ cientology ” risk expensive legal battles .
For example , a new unauthorised biography of Tom Cruise by a British author , Andrew Morton , contains detailed and highly critical material about the film star 's involvement in Scientology .
It is a bestseller in America but has not been published in Britain .
The publisher , St Martin's Press , has even asked internet booksellers not to ship it to foreign customers .
Though Scientology representatives vehemently deny breaking any laws , critics have claimed that they experience intensive harassment and intimidation .
Now Scientology is under attack from a group of internet activists known only as Anonymous .
Organised from a Wikipedia - style website ( editable by anyone ) and through anonymous internet chat rooms , “ Project Chanology ” , as the initiative is known , presents no easy target for Scientology 's lawyers .
It is promoting cyberwarfare techniques normally associated with extortionists , spies and terrorists .
Called “ distributed denial of service attacks ” , these typically involve using networks of infected computers to bombard the target 's websites and servers with bogus requests for data , causing them to crash .
Even governments find this troublesome .
Anonymous is also hoping to galvanise public opinion with a mass “ real - world ” protest outside every Scientology office worldwide on February 10th .
But its best weapon may be ridicule .
The group got going in reaction to efforts to ban an internal Scientology video of Mr Cruise that leaked onto the internet .
The star appears to discuss his beliefs with a degree of incoherence and exaggeration that might lead some to question Scientology 's effects on its adherents ' sanity .
A Scientology spokesman says it has been selectively edited .
Several internet sites have taken it down after threats of lawsuits .
But it keeps popping up .
The Wall Street JournalPfizer Is Sued Over Lipitor MarketingBy DAVID ARMSTRONGDecember 20 , 2007 ; Page B5A former Pfizer Inc. official in a lawsuit accused the company of illegally boosting sales of its top - selling drug Lipitor through an elaborate campaign of misleading educational programs for doctors .
Jesse Polansky , claims that the educational campaign was a key part of a marketing strategy that " led thousands of physicians to prescribe Lipitor for millions of patients who did not need medication " and could be harmed by overly aggressive treatment .
The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in February 2004 .
It was immediately sealed to allow federal prosecutors time to decide if they wanted to intervene in the case .
In August , the government said it would n't intervene , lifting the seal .
Pfizer was served a copy of the suit yesterday , according to Dr. Polansky 's lawyer , Steve Berman of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro .
The failure of the government to intervene may signal that prosecutors are skeptical about the merits of the case .
The government has n't intervened in other cases which led to huge fines against drug companies .
One example is another case involving Pfizer , this one for the off - label marketing of Neurontin .
Pfizer said , " We believe this case has no merit .
Furthermore , after reviewing the allegations in this complaint , the government declined to intervene in this action ... .
Pfizer does not condone the off - label promotion of our products .
We believe that our sales and marketing practices are solely based on our prescription information as approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . " Dr. Polansky was Pfizer 's director of outcomes management strategies from 2001 to 2003 , and his responsibilities included reviewing some of the marketing materials for Lipitor and other Pifzer products .
He says he was fired by Pfizer after complaining about marketing he considered to be improper .
Dr. Polansky now works as the senior medical officer for Medicare in a unit that investigates fraud and abuse at the big government health insurer .
The suit seeks compensation for Dr. Polansky as a whistleblower under laws that could give him a share of money recovered for any overpayments made by federal health - insurance programs .
Lipitor , a type of cholesterol treatment known as a statin , is the world 's biggest - selling drug , with sales of $ 13.6 billion last year , according to IMS Health .
The allegations against Pfizer echo concern elsewhere that continuing medical - education programs for doctors are often sales pitches for " off- label " uses of drugs .
A congressional committee this past summer said it was concerned there was little oversight of these programs -- where doctors are often wined and dined -- or enforcement when companies use them as marketing tools .
Pharmaceutical companies are prohibited from marketing drugs for indications other than what the FDA approves them for , although doctors are n't prohibited from prescribing them for unapproved uses .
Independent educational programs can discuss off - label uses that are n't FDA approved .
But Dr. Polansky 's lawsuit charges that the Pfizer - funded programs were n't independent .
The Lipitor educational programs were run by companies paid by Pfizer through " unrestricted educational grants , " the lawsuit says .
It alleges that the educational programs were integrated into the marketing plan for the drug , citing an internal Pfizer marketing plan for Lipitor with a page titled " Medical Education Platform Supports the New Positioning .
" Among other things , Dr. Polansky says Pfizer wanted to extend Lipitor use beyond the indications found on the drug 's label by targeting people at moderate risk of developing heart disease or having a heart attack .
He said the educational programs for doctors deliberately misrepresented the drug 's label to encourage Lipitor therapy for people in the moderate - risk category who did n't need the drug .
In his suit , Dr. Polansky also said the Pfizer programs included deliberate misinformation promoting the idea that kidney - disease patients may need to be treated with statins .
While kidney disease is recognized by some doctors as a risk for heart disease , it is n't part of the federal guidelines that factor into Lipitor 's approved use .

This had to be the most aggravating question during the Dartmouth debate , both in its implication and in sheer unconstitutional glory .
Moderator Tim Russert asks the Democratic presidential contenders to name their favorite Bible verse .
Um , Tim , are you trying to say that Democrats need to prove their faith ?
Nice Republican framing there .
And on whole other level , are you confirming the mindset that only practicing Christians should be eligible for the presidency ?
What if there was a Jew , Buddhist or a * gasp * atheist on that stage ?
Would that question be considered appropriate then ?
I wrote a long post on this a couple of months ago .
Here 's the highlight reel :
In short , you do n't get anything out of a gold standard that you did n't bring with you .
If your government is a credible steward of the money supply , you do n't need it ; and if it is n't , it wo n't be able to stay on it long anyway .
( See Argentina 's dollar peg ) .
Meanwhile , the limitations on the government 's ability to respond to fiscal crises , the necessity of defending against speculative attacks in times of crises , and the possibility of independent changes in the relative price of gold , make your economy more unstable .
It 's a terrible idea , which is why there are so few economists willing to raise their voices in support of it .
No Ron Paul supporter ( or other gold standard advocate ) has managed to articulate to me what problem the gold standard solves .
Inflation is low , and even better , relatively predictable , so the expectation is built into asset prices .
Moreover , most people on fixed incomes are retirees , and most retirees get almost half their income from Social Security , which is indexed for inflation .
This Ron Paul speech lists a number of reasons , all of them wrong :
1. The Federal Reserve destabilizes the economy with its " boom and bust " monetary policy .
This is hard to square with the fact that the longer the Federal Reserve has been in existance , the more stable the economy has been .
Dr. Paul 's words strongly imply that he believes that there was no business cycle in the 19th century , which is untrue ; as best we can tell , recessions were much longer and deeper before America had a central bank .
2. Americans do n't save because they 're afraid inflation will erode their savings .
This is daft .
Moderate inflationary expectations are built into the interest rates that banks offer .
After thirty years of stable monetary policy , a good portion of the population does n't even remember high inflation , and the ones that do are mostly retired and spending down their savings .
Americans do n't save because . . . well , have you tried the Wii ?
It 's awesome .
3. American exporters are whipsawed by our fluctuating currency .
Unless Dr. Paul has plans to put the entire world back on the gold standard -- which I mote would require the kind of powerful international organization he 's so suspicious of , or invasion - - our currency will still fluctuate relative to others if we 're on the gold standard .
Every time the price of gold changes in another country , American exporters will either be helped or hurt by a change in the relative prices of their goods .
The gold standard will shelter exporters from currency fluctuations only in their trade with other countries on the gold standard .
There are no other countries on the gold standard .
4 . Fiat money inflation benefits those shadowy figures who receive access to artificially inflated money before the inflationary effects kick in .
Those shadowy figures being the bankers who loaned it to you so that you could buy your house .
At any rate , this would only be true if we were talking about unexpected inflation .
Expected inflation is already built into asset prices .
The US economy does not have significant unexpected inflation .
5 . Fiat money inflation " also benefit big spending politicians who use the inflated currency created by the Fed to hide the true costs of the welfare - warfare state " .
This is an extraordinarily primitive view of the money supply .
The Federal government is not Caesar cutting his denarii with lead .
The revenues from seignorage on 2 % inflation are trivial .
The Federal government gets the money for the " welfare - warfare " state just where it says it does : by taxing the bejeesus out of your wages .
6 . Congress does not have constitutional authority to delegate its power " the authority to coin money and regulate the value of the currency " .
Hmm .
Okay , but I 'm pretty sure none of our legislators are qualified to operate a printing press , much less the annealing ovens and upsetting mills needed to mint coins .
7. Congress " should only permit currency backed by stable commodities such as silver and gold " .
Commodities , almost by definition , are not stable .
The price of gold looks as if it used to be stable , because the dollar was fixed relative to an ounce of gold .
This does not mean that its value relative to other economic goods was unchanged .
You could fix your currency to the price of a bushel of wheat , and suddenly " wheat bugs " would be claiming that wheat is the only reliable , stable commodity in the world whose price never changes .
That would n't stop fluctuating wheat supplies from whipsawing your economy back and forth .
To be sure , the supply of gold changes more slowly than the supply of wheat .
But demand for it is not so fixed .
EU Council president tells UN that the EU has major differences with China over key values like democracy , human rights and the rule of law , which are the EU ’s " compass " for action .
He calls on Beijing to respect the rights of Uyghurs in Xinjiang and pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong .
Without an agreement on investments , the Europeans will not follow up on the strategic agenda with the Chinese .
No split exists between the EU and the US .
We rejoin the meeting just as we sat down to lunch , and a talk by Houston Mayor Bill White who has the enviable distinction of having Matt Simmons as the Treasurer of his Campaign Committee .
He acknowledged Matt as a prophet ( with all that usually brings ) .
He sees the current situation as one that comes down to a race between depletion and technology .
It is not possible to give a political speech and create more oil fields .
It is not possible by giving a political speech to create a hydrogen economy either immediately or in the practical future .
It is not possible by giving a political speech to over - ride the laws of physics .
This is the last of the posts that deal with the content of the ASPO Conference last week in Houston .
I will have my usual personal closing review tomorrow .
As I hope you will gather , it was full of information and somewhat intense .
And that did not include talking to folk in the breaks , which expanded a lot on what was being said in the papers .
So if you want to think of this as the first commercial for next years meeting ( which will be in California ) then you ’re right again .
And just to remind you , the earlier posts were a report on the Workshop day , the first morning report , the rest of Thursday , and then Friday morning .
A quick thanks to all , and it was more fun than I had even hoped to meet so many of the TOD folk , as well as so many others – thank you all , and of course , a much bigger thank you to the organizers for putting this on .
The result , gentle folk , was well worth the effort .
There are , however , two things that a Government can do .
The coming peak in oil production will be preceded by a rise in price as oil , and thereafter gas becomes in greater demand with a reduced access to supply .
Government can help in this case by raising the Fuel Economy Standards and providing incentives to encourage a lower usage of fuel .
Bear in mind that the weight of a person is a small percentage of the weight of the vehicle that must be also moved , whenever one drives to work .
If the power train was a cable carrying electric power to motors in the wheels of a car then it easier and a more efficient vehicle can be built that can include regenerative braking .
Bear in mind that the decisions on how to go is influenced by consumer choice and taste , but this can be adjusted by control of standards , and we can control choice if there is a concerted effort , both nationally and internationally .
He noted that at one time the US had ( used ? ) 40 % of the world consumption of gas and diesel , we are now at 25 % and on this path there is nothing but trouble ahead .
He suggests that it is time to look harder at the gains that can come from better use of modern technology .
Houston is looking at making better use of flex - time and of encouraging folk to work from their homes .
He cited the policy of Dell , who actively discourage some of their employees from coming to the office .
It is no longer an answer just to provide financial support to the poor who are having trouble paying their fuel bills .
Houston has started to put energy efficient parts into old houses , to improve insulation and reduce energy costs .
The program has reduced energy use by 20 % in the test areas and is moving out into larger neighborhoods .
( It costs around $ 900 per household ) .
They are also working to encourage zero energy and zero water - use housing .
But they are finding that Inertia is not just a law in physics .
There is a strong sentiment that “ we just do n’t do it that way , ” that works against innovations , many of which do n’t get adopted as a result .
This should n’t be taken as a diatribe against the oil industry .
Which is as concerned as most about averting a spike in oil prices , since they realize that there will be a backlash that can generate a response that will impact them .
Industry therefore is working to ameliorate the price rises as much as they can , since it is an industry that has often been vilified for actions over which it has no control .
After his presentation , and the end of lunch , the Government panel from before lunch returned to a question and answer session .
It was pointed out that the will of the Congress , and all other politicians along the ladder , since they only respond when they see their constituents demanding action .
So the audience ( and you dear reader ) are encouraged to first arrange a meeting with the legislator , or an aide .
Then write a letter to the editor of your local paper , citing the meeting .
But if you ’re going look respectable , have a short piece of well - prepared paper ( Debbie Cook handed an example out at the Saturday meeting ) to illustrate the points ( no more than one simple explicit graph on a page ) , and bring along an authoritative figure that can help lend credence and stature to your presentation .
This will be particularly effective if you can tie it to some event related to energy that occurs , and you can expect that there will be one of these soon .
Senator Whipple urged that you stay away from emotive issues .
( Discussing population for example is a rapid way for a legislator to find an ex- in their title ) .
You must relate it to the issues that a constituent understands ( such as the price of gas ) .
Build on the issues that are important , or viewed as such by the press .
In the last 2 weeks , for example , there have been ten stories on air quality in the LA Times .
Recognize that we cannot change the culture that quickly and that the social benefits of any change must be explained ( simply ) .
And remember that governance is an interlocking structure in that while some things are done at the city level , others are related to state action and yet others are reacting to federal regulation .
You need to understand , when making a presentation , what can be achieved at that level .
Remember that in the Congress , the Peak Oil Caucus has only 15 members .
Because of a lack of knowledge about what is coming and what will work , the easiest path is to “ provide more ” and even though that might not be possible , a lot of the Congressional community do not know or accept that .
Sadly they did not get around to answering Euan ’s question on whether Texas was self - sufficient in fertilizer .
Recalling the names of those who had been awarded the Hubbert Award in the past , the organizers then presented Charles Maxwell with the 2007 Hubbert Award .
The Afternoon session then formally began with a presentation , for 75 minutes , of Scenarios for Houston after Peak Oil , presented by Peter Bishop and Seth Itzkan .
They began by quoting that “ if you do n’t know where you ’re going , you ’ll end up somewhere else . ”
Houston after Peak oil will not immediately be different to today , but as the impact is felt , and oil disappears , so it will change to a different place .
Bear in mind that much of Houston business is tied to oil .
We are now going through the first stage of the S - curve of Disruptive Change – in the first ( lower leg of the S ) we are in the “ no problem ” bit ; this is followed by the straight incline up the S – the “ what is going on here ? ” phase , which is then followed as the curve tops over by the third “ Whew , how did we survive that ! ” phase .
The talk is after the third phase , when we have turned to a form of life that people will like and be happy with , so it focuses on an ideal future .
In this there must be some adaptive change ( wearing coats in colder rooms ) , and Houston has to be sure it does n’t become a New Bedford , or a Detroit , devastated as the main industry fades down the road .
With Houston currently the 4th largest city in the country , and with 4.7 million people , and Texas using 12 Quads of energy ( California comes next with 8 Quads ) and used to being successful , at the same time Texans do n’t believe in collective decisions , but rather the life of the individual .
So all these had to be taken into account in developing a viable scenario for the future .
In this future they see a major role for solar , all transportation will be electric , with distance travel by rail .
This will make society somewhat more static , the mouse will become the transportation unit , and clothing will adapt more to season .
The greatest change however will be in building efficiency .
They cited a number of examples ( best found by looking at their presentation .
( Note not all the presentations , including this one , are up yet , but as soon as ASPO has them they will be , so please be patient ) .
The designers they quoted include Forbes Eco-lofts a development in Chelsea , which is outside of Boston .
They anticipate that wind turbines will be integrated into the design to provide power sufficient for building independence .
They also included the the BedZed Community , , which is carbon neutral .
By using 2 - ft thick walls they were able to cut energy demand by 75 % .
The 145 kW power plant is powered by wood chips , and the waste water is treated naturally on site , and is heated by the power plant .
It also has an electric car plug - in .
They also discussed the concept of SkyZed where small wind turbines around a housing tower generate the necessary power .
The third site is in Changsha , China , though one of the changes between the posted sites and the slides shown in the pictures is a change from conventional propeller wind turbines to “ egg- beaters . ”
You ’ll hate the journey , but enjoy the destination .
We then returned to the reality of today ’s oil supply , with some opening remarks by Henry Groppe , who talked about the current situation and the tightness of current supply , with the implication , and need for , rationing in the future .
( His slides are up as a pdf ) .
He sees us having passed from the Era of Plenty , where the U.S. had control , and the Era of Transition , where OPEC had control , into the current Era of Scarcity and Price Rationing .
He sees the imminent peak as being a point where price will ration demand .
Last year , for example he accumulated Non-OPEC Crude at 28.9 mbd with Eastern European crude ( sum 40.3 mbd ) and OPEC crude ( to 69 MBD ) to which he added NGL to get 80.6 mbd with a small amount of other .
He sees a slight further increase to about now , and then a decline in this total to 78 mbd by 2015 .
He tabulated deliveries , now at 84.1 mbd , again anticipating a decline to 81.8 mbd by 2015 .
He further anticipates that KSA has already peaked in production .
We can however expect nothing much to happen , until those in the media catch on , at which point it will be Panic !!
He then introduced Charles Maxwell who made a series of remarks of his own before sitting down for a conversation between himself , Mr Groppe and T Boone Pickens .
In his own remarks he noted that there are only three frontiers left to look for oil , the first is Deepwater , with 5 % of the prospects looked at so far .
However this is a very expensive venture that can only be accomplished by those with a lot of money ( small independents are out ) , with rigs costing on the high side of $ 600,000 a day .
The second is in commodities , with LNG being the prime candidate .
The problem is getting it to the customer that needs it , at a price that they will be willing to afford .
And the third location is the newly available geographic frontier , places we could not get to before , such as the FSU affiliate states .
The problem is that we no longer have any spare capacity to get us through the rough spots of Middle East production .
The problem is the speed of the change that is coming .
He feels that OPEC has made a mistake in the amount that they have released , and hopes that they have realized this and will release more oil in the coming months .
The damage that is being done to the world economy will take time to fix , and without additional oil – well we just have to have it .
Because of this rational response we can anticipate that oil will come back down to $ 70 to $ 75 a barrel .
He noted that the current rise caught some of the oil companies by surprise and that Exxon , for example , cannot get a semi- submersible rig they need until 2016 .
If the correction is made within 6 months we can get through it , since we can pull capacity from stocks .
From that point onward the only route is through conservation , with CAFÉ standards and insulation standards being imposed to reduce demand .
We are marching into the maw of the dragon with our flags flying and our heads up .
Life is wonderf .
. . . Chomp !!
Bear in mind that the Saudi ’s have seen the graphs , and do n’t want to produce too much , since , knowing what they have , they can , if they keep the price up , still make the money they need , while saving oil for their children .
Though he thinks that the KSA can produce 12 – 15 mbd for generations .
Nevertheless he is afraid , since there is no substitute fuel , that this will come out badly .
LNG imports will only solve part of the problem .
We will walk away from coal and not burn it , nuclear may be around , but it wo n’t help much .
Prices will come faster and harder than expected , with the period from 2010 to 2016 that of our greatest vulnerability .
We will need a lot of conservation and a lot of innovative new technology , but he thinks we will survive .
T Boone Pickens ( TBP ) then joined the other two and discussed his three favorite topics Oil and Gas , Water and the role of exercise .
TBP noted that natural gas wells now decline very quickly and LNG cargoes are going to go “ where the price is right . ”
Right now that is China , which has 4,000 NG buses in Beijing , and they do n’t have much natural gas for them .
( We ’re having a duck dinner – you ’re invited , bring a duck ) .
While the world is currently oversupplied this will not last long , we may get through 2008 , but things may well get tough by 2009 , and will gradually transition to being a transportation fuel .
Unconventional gas is in its last hurrah !
It is too hard to find , and what is being found is small .
The price of LNG projects has doubled , and as he looks at prospects all he sees is that we are running out .
The only thing that is therefore left to do is to kill demand with price rises .
He thinks that the majors , buying back stock and so on , are giving the message to the market that they ca n’t grow .
He sees end of the year demand at 88 mbpd , but supply only able to reach 85 , price will reach $ 100 before it gets to $ 80 .
He turns out to be one of the largest owners of water ( in the Ogallala Aquifer ) .
The proceedings for the day were then summarized by the second “ mystery respondent , ” which turned out to be our own Professor Goose !
PG 's summary hit some of the high points of the day , focusing on policy and social change .
He noted that even though a lot of smart people are thinking about small portions of the problem , it is likely that policy progress / change will follow the path of a Punctuated Equilibrium Policy Model until a tipping point hits .
Policies will bubble up from local and state policy innovations and mistakes until then .
After the tipping point , top down solutions will be attempted by those in power .
He also made the point that problem in integrating the many approaches to the ideas and data surrounding the problems we face is a lot like squeezing sand ; just as you think you have a grasp , it trickles away .
This is a tough thing we face .
PG concluded with the point that large scale social change requires a social movement , which he considers the communities behind " peak oil " and " climate change " to be .
For us to address the problem , we need leadership and policy entrepreneurship .
But most importantly , we need to get as many smart people as we can to keep having a discourse about the problem , challenge each other 's assumptions and ideas , and hopefully learn from each other to change our paradigm .
This formally ended the conference , but in the evening there were two further presentations , dealing with the missing link , the impacts of fossil fuel peaking on Global Climate Change .
The first presentation was by Dr Pushker Kharecha of NASA GIS .
He spoke about the models that have been developed to predict , as a function of the growth in greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere , the consequent changes in climate .
Due to recent studies they are lowering the critical temperatures at which they feel that irreversible changes can occur .
Unfortunately the presentation was sufficiently fast and detailed that I could either follow the discussion or write , but not both , but I did note that they have now explained the failure of the Antarctic to warm as had been predicted , as being due to the hole in the ozone layer , so that it is still man-induced .
He was followed by Dave Rutledge of Caltech , who talked about the change in projected temperatures due to GHG emissions , in light of the future consumption of different forms of fossil fuel .
He sees climate change as predominantly a coal problem .
After looking at the rate at which the world is going through oil , it will not be around to contribute much , for that much longer .
( Though he noted that the $ 10’s and $ 100 ’s of millions that have been spent running climate prediction models that are used to predict global temperature rise assume that supply will continue to meet demand all through this century , and that there are no constraints on carbon production ) .
He then looked at coal , in much the same way that he did when giving the guest post here at TOD .
His data showed that coal use peaked in 1913 , but he initially looked at Britain to see how one might model coal decline , and found that the predicted curves followed the decline models very well .
He then broadened the study to the United States , and found that the production from Montana is likely to skew any existing model , and that coal production is still increasing , though the amount that will be mined is considerably less than the amount that is currently considered a reserve .
He believes that , as a result , the current reserve estimate for the United States is about five times too high .
( It does n’t include coal sterilized by oil well penetration – you ’re not allowed to mine near one , or the inter - seam rock thinning out , that would preclude working one or the other ) .
As a result we are well through more than half of Eastern US coal .
Putting the whole thing together he sees the world URR at 435 Tboe ( trillion barrels of oil equivalent ) and that it will decline in carbon production by 2050 .
Using the coal and oil projections he then ran a model of anticipated temperature rise , based on the anticipated production of GHG , and came out with a predicted impact that was significantly less than that of any of the models used by the IPCC .
More information on the talk can be found on his website .
There were also breakout sessions on Saturday for policy and media relations , but I did n't take notes , so feel free to describe them in the comments .
So , that was the conference , thank you for sticking with us this far , and again , for those of you that were there , please chip in with corrections and comments .
G'night .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - A Chinese college has introduced fingerprint scanners to stop students playing truant , the China Daily said on Tuesday , but not everyone is pleased about it .
Meiya College of International Studies at Hunan University spent 250,000 yuan ( $ 32,360 ) last year to install the scanners in each of its 30 - plus classrooms .
“ Students are now required to ‘ check in ’ to each class by pressing their thumbs against the scanner , ” the newspaper said .
Hou Lichen , dean of the college in the central province of Hunan , said that in the past , teachers would record attendances by taking registers .
However , these were time - consuming and it was easy to cheat .
Attendance had risen to 95 percent since the scanners were introduced , the newspaper said .
However , not everyone is happy .
Gu Yifan , a first - year student , said she would never skip class , regardless of whether there was a scanner .
“ We are adults .
Is it really necessary to control us in this way ? ” she was quoted as saying .
Other students said they feared the fingerprint data could be leaked out of the college and used for other purposes .

I wanted to express how much I appreciate your effort to minimize my inconvenience .
I understand that you probably come from a disadvantaged background , you may have an addiction or two , or maybe your mother is sick in the hospital .
I quite understand your need to break into my car .
You only broke the rear passenger small window , so even in the cold weather there are no drifts reaching the front seats .
I know it was hard to open the car through that small window , so I appreciate the effort .
You took my GPS system .
I actually did n't like it because it does n't allow me to update the maps and they are quite outdated by now .
Thank you for giving me a reason to get a much better one .
You tool my work blackberry .
They are actually upgrading us to the new Pearl model .
I was due to get one in February .
But thanks to you , I will get a new one on Monday .
Thank you !
I do miss those $ 5 in spare change , but it 's a small price to pay .
Hope it goes a long way towards buying your next fix .
And thank you for not taking my garage key , EZ pass car , or NY map .
I would n't be able to get home without them .
I wish all car burglars were as decent as you are .
You should start a car burglary etiquette classes .

El Pais published a transcript of the conversation between George W. Bush , Jose Maria Aznar of Spain , and Condoleeza Rice held at Crawford before the Iraq War .
Bush is typically bullheaded , impatient , conspiratorial , bullying , arrogant , ill - informed and way over - optimistic .
The transcript shows the true colors of the man– a sort of thuggish , ignorant Mafia don– who destroyed the United States and destroyed Iraq .
( The introductory El Pais article is translated here . )
At one point Aznar prophetically says , “ The thing that worries me is your optimism . ”
The transcript , it seems to me , provides a whole rack of smoking guns that could be a basis for impeaching George W. Bush .
The transcript shows that Bush consciously intended to go to war without a United Nations Security Council resolution .
The United Nations Charter , to which the United States is a treaty signatory ( so that it has the force of American law ) , forbids any nation to launch an aggressive war on another country .
The only two legal mechanisms for war are either that it came in response to a direct attack or that the attacker gained a UNSC authorization .
The transcript shows Bush actively plotting to sidestep the UNSC if he could not , gangster - like , threaten its members into compliance .
The second grounds for impeachment is that Bush rejected out of hand a deal brokered by the Egyptians whereby Saddam Hussein would leave the country with a billion dollars and some documents about his WMD program .
Reuters reports :
‘ The Egyptians are speaking to Saddam Hussein .
It seems he ’s indicated he would be prepared to go into exile if he ’s allowed to take $ 1 billion and all the information he wants about weapons of mass destruction , ” Bush was quoted as saying at the meeting one month before the U.S. - led invasion . ’
The transcript in Spanish then says ( my translation ) :
‘ Aznar :
Is it certain that any possibility exists that Saddam Hussein will go into exile ?
Bush :
The possibility exists , including that he will be assassinated .
Aznar : Exile with a guarantee ?
Bush : No guarantee !
He is a thug , a terrorist , a war criminal .
Bush goes on to say , “ Saddam wo n’t change and he ’ll keep on playing games .
The time has come to get rid of him .
That ’s the way it is .
We ’ll be in Baghdad by the end of March . ”
In other words , Bush could have sent Saddam off to exile in Saudi Arabia and avoided the whole war , but refused to do so because of the family vendetta between the Bushes and the Tikritis .
Nearly 4,000 US soldiers have died and thousands have been wounded because Bush would not take the deal Saddam offered him .
Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis are dead , and millions displaced .
Going to war unnecessarily is an impeachable offense .
The whole immense catastrophe could have been avoided .
There is more evidence of thuggery in the transcript :
Excerpts courtesy Harper’s :
‘ Bush to American Allies : support war or starve [ Condoleezza Rice has just described the diplomatic situation to Bush and Aznar , explaining that Iraq is continuing to insist that it has no weapons of mass destruction . ]
Bush :
This is like Chinese water torture .
We have to put an end to it .
Aznar : I agree , but it would be best to have as much support as possible .
Have a little patience .
Bush :
My patience has ended .
I ’m not thinking of waiting beyond mid-March .
Aznar : I ’m not asking that you have endless patience .
Simply that everything is done to [ have maximum international support ] .
Bush : Countries like Mexico , Chile , Angola , and Cameroon should know that what ’s at stake is the security of the United States . . . [ Chilean President Ricardo ]
Lagos should know that the Free Trade Accord with Chile is awaiting Senate confirmation and a negative attitude about this could put ratification in danger .
Angola is receiving Millennium Account funds [ to help alleviate poverty ] and that could be jeopardized also if he ’s not supportive …
Aznar : Tony [ Blair ] wants to wait until March 14 .
Bush : I prefer the 10th .
This is like a good cop , bad cop routine .
I do n’t care if I ’m the bad cop and he ’s the good cop .
Bush on Iraq : the future is bright “ We ’re developing a very strong package of humanitarian aid .
We can win [ the war ] without much destruction .
We ’re planning for a post - Saddam Iraq and believe there is a strong base to build a better future .
Iraq has a good bureaucracy and relatively strong civil society . ”
Bush on French President Chirac : Mister Arab “ Chirac knows perfectly well the reality .
His intelligence services have explained .
The Arab countries are sending Chirac a clear message : Saddam Hussein must go .
The problem is that Chirac thinks he ’s Mister Arab and is making life impossible . ” ‘
Reuters has more :
‘ In case the war endangered energy supplies , “ the Saudis would help us and put all the oil necessary into the market , ” said Bush , who considered Europeans to be complacent about Saddam .
“ Maybe it ’s because he ’s dark - skinned , far away and Muslim , lots of Europeans think everything ’s okay with him , ” he said .
. . ‘
He was accusing the Europeans of racism !
He !
Most customer service organizations are architected around a simple idea : interacting with customers is expensive , driving costs down is a good thing , thus getting people to go away is beneficial .
Think about it : most inbound customer service people are rewarded for on - phone efficiency .
Calls per hour .
Lack of escalations .
Limited complaints .
What ’s the best way to do that ?
Get people to go away .
If you ’re on this system and a long - time customer calls in with a complicated problem , one that ’s going to require supervisor intervention and follow up , what ’s your best plan ?
Is it to spend an hour with this person over three days , or is the system designed to have you politely get them to just give up ?
I ’d focus on building a system that measures [ sales rate before call ] vs. [ sales rate after call ] .
If the sales rate goes up , give the call center person a raise .
It ’s that simple .
Paypal seized the money in my account on Friday .
After seven years as a user , they decided my new DVD project was suspiciously successful and it triggered all sorts of alarms .
The first step was a call from them … a cheerful person asked me a few questions and all seemed fine .
Then , with no warning , they escalated the process .
The system they put me in treated me like a criminal and at every step they made it difficult for me to keep going .
Phone calls were made , and I spoke with two incredibly friendly people who were clearly unable to do anything other than be friendly .
Both people were happy to talk to me for as long as I wanted , but neither person was able to do anything at all .
The system is clearly designed this way … to insulate the people who make decisions from the actual customers .
The desired outcome ( I go away ) does n’t seem like it ’s aligned with the corporate goals ( I stick around ) .
The question I ’d be asking is , " Do people who go through process and manage to prove that they are not criminals end up doing more business with us as a result of the way we treated them ? "
If the answer is no , you ’re probably doing it wrong .
The last straw was this :
After I put together all the documents they wanted ( including a copy of my passport ) and created a PDF , I tried to upload it .
They do n’t take PDFs , the alert box said , just JPGs .
So I sent the images and get this notice :
I followed up with the email address on the screen and got an email back , informing me that the email I had mailed to at PayPal was n’t monitored .
Sigh .
[ PS in the ninety minutes after I posted this , I heard from a slew of people .
Guess what ?
Every single one had a Paypal horror story to share .
Once you teach an entire organization to mistreat customers , it ’s hard to fix . ]
[ PPS the problem is fixed now .
Thanks for your concern … ]
Iran showdown has echoes of faked Tonkin attack Nick Juliano
Published : Friday January 11 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This A dramatic showdown at sea .
Crossed communication signals .
Apparently - hostile craft nearby .
Sketchy intelligence leading to ratcheted up rhetoric .
The similarities between this week 's confrontation between US warships and Iranian speedboats and events off the coast of North Vietnam 44 years ago were too hard for many experts to miss , leading to the question :
Is the Strait of Hormuz 2008 's Gulf of Tonkin ?
On Aug. 2nd and 4th , 1964 , the USS Maddox and the USS Turner Joy , patrolling off the North Vietnamese coast , intercepted signals indicating they were under attack .
Within days , Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution , which paved the way to the escalation of the Vietnam War .
However , as some intelligence agents suspected at the time , the Aug. 2nd attack took place after the USS Maddox fired first , according to a National Security Agency report released in 1995 .
This week another NSA report surfaced , confirming suspicions that the Aug. 4th attack never happened .
The researcher who uncovered the most recent NSA assessment tells RAW STORY that the Strait of Hormuz confrontation , and the immediate saber - rattling from the Bush administration and its allies , demonstrates the extent to which officials must be wary about politicizing shaky intelligence in times of war .
" The parallels ( between Tonkin and Hormuz ) speak for themselves , but what they say is that even the most basic factual assumptions can be made erroneously [ or ] can prove to be false , " Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists , told Raw Story .
" Therefore extreme caution is always appropriate before drawing conclusions ... that might leave to violent conflict .
That 's almost so obvious that I feel embarrassed saying it , but there is a history of mistaken interpretations of these kinds of encounters that ought to teach us humility . "
Humility and caution , of course , do n't seem to be the most popular buzz words in the Bush White House .
" It is a dangerous situation .
... I think it was a provocative act , " Bush warned two days after a handful of small Iranian speedboats spooked a fleet of US Navy warships .
The Pentagon 's initial account of the Jan. 6 confrontation said the Iranian boats " charged " the US ships , dropped boxes in the water that were thought to be mines and threatened to set up " explosions . "
An unnamed US Defense Department official told the Associated Press the day after the incident that it was " the most serious provocation of its sort " in the Gulf , although Iranian officials tried to downplay the incident as a simple misunderstanding .
It was not until Thursday , after the Pentagon and Iran had each released videos of the encounter , that the US acknowledged the verbal threats they had associated with the Iranian speedboats from day one could have been broadcast from virtually anywhere .
" I am coming to you ....
You will explode after a few minutes , " a voice says on the audio recording but Farsi speakers and Iranians have said the voice did not sound Iranian .
Aftergood said he was surprised at the uncertainty regarding the origin of that message , which was broadcast on a public communication channel and superimposed onto the end of the Pentagon video .
" One might 've thought that they would be able to pinpoint it exactly , but it turns out that 's not so , " said Aftergood , who runs FAS 's Project on Government Secrecy .
" It 's also surprising that President Bush was permitted to get so far out in front on this issue , even though there were significant uncertainties on what transpired . "
Others have questioned the supposed mines that were claimed to be dropped form the Iranian boats .
" The bit about the ' white boxes ' being dropped into the water seems almost equally dubious , " writes Glenn Greenwald .
" Neither the video of the incident released by the U.S. military , nor the video version released by the Iranian government , includes any such event , nor are there any references to it at all on the audio . "
Aftergood said the information should have been more fully vetted before the White House began warning Iran of " serious consequences " of future showdowns .
" What you hear talking is the child on the schoolyard , not the sober national leader , " he said .
" And i do n't think that serves anyone 's interest . "
Aftergood noted that America is less poorly equipped to avoid international incidents than it was during the Cold War .
" The credibility at least of the administration has taken a hit by the way this episode played out , " Aftergood said , but the near - confrontation could provide an opportunity for Bush to learn from his mistakes .
The US has largely given Iran the diplomatic silent treatment during the Bush years , which Aftergood said increases the likelihood that the next Strait of Hormuz - type incident wo n't de-escalate so quickly .
" If we could have a hotline with the Kremlin while they had thousands of nuclear weapons aimed at our country , one would think we could do the same for Iran , " he said .
" With some skillful statesmanship ... this could serve as the impetus for that , but it would be one way to turn a negative into a net positive . "

Man Carves Wife a 6,000 Stair Path in Mountain
A weird love story has come out of China recently and managed to touch the world .
It is a story of a man and an older woman who ran off to live and love each other in peace for over half century .
Over 50 years ago , Liu , was a 19 years - old boy , fell in love with a 29 year - old widowed mother named Xu .
At the time , it was unacceptable and immoral for a young man to love an older woman .
To avoid the market gossips , the couple decided to elope and lived in a cave in Jiangjin County in Southern ChongQing area .
In the beginning , they had nothing , no electricity or even food .
They had to eat grass and roots they found in the mountain , and Liu made a kerosene lamp that they used to lighten up their lives .
Starting the second year of living in the mountain , Liu began , and continue for over 50 years , to hand carve the steps so that his wife could get down the mountain easily .
A half century later in 2001 , a group of adventures were exploring the forest , they surprisingly found the elderly couple and the over 6,000 stairs of hand carved ladder .
“ My parents loved each other so much , they have lived in seclusion for over 50 years and never been apart a single day . ”
Liu MingSheng , one of their seven children said , “ He hand carved more than 6,000 steps over the years for my mother ’s convenience , although she does n’t go down the mountain that much . ” 
The couple had lived in peace for over 50 years until last week .
Liu , now 72 years - old , returned from his daily farm work and collapsed .
Xu sat and prayed with her husband as he passed away in her arms .
So in love with Xu , was Liu , that no one was able to release the grip he had on his wife ’s hand even after he had passed away .
“ You promised me you ’ll take care of me , you ’ll always be with me until the day I died , now you left before me , how am I going to live without you ? ” … …
Xu spent days softly repeating this sentence and touching her husband ’s black coffin with tears rolling down her cheeks .
In 2006 , their story had became one of the top 10 love stories from China , collected by the Chinese Women Weekly .
The local government has decided to preserve the â€œlove ladderâ€  and the place they lived as a museum , so this love story can live forever .
Video showing the real couple :

It must be rough being the overshadowed younger sibling of the cable world — the Kevin Dillon to HBO 's Matt , the Casey Affleck to its Ben .
I can only imagine the consternation over at Showtime some years ago , when it realized that its chief rival was actually going to get away with its claim to " transcend television . "
But who could protest ?
HBO had the most culturally significant program on the air ( The Sopranos ) , the most subversive ( Curb Your Enthusiasm ) , and the flat - out greatest ( The Wire ) .
Showtime does n't even have the dignity of an acronym to disguise its cheesy ' 70s moniker , which means the best it can do for a logo is throw a circle around the first three letters and then squirt the entire word with what appears to be thin ribbons of ketchup .
Edgy .
But suddenly , if I could watch just one , I 'd go with Showtime .
In part , that 's because most of HBO 's landmark shows are either finished or nearly so .
( The Wire has one more season left . )
Mostly , though , it 's because Showtime 's frustration and desperation is starting to manifest itself in its programming , which has become increasingly twisted over the past couple of years .
Shows like Weeds and Dexter push the notion of the sympathetic antihero into the realm of black comedy , overtly acknowledging that we 're most entertained by watching people flout all the social mores known to man .
You say you can identify with a mobster ?
How about with a serial killer ?
Tickled by a dysfunctional family of morticians ?
We got us a bereaved single mom who makes her living as a suburban pot dealer .
Showtime provides a fun - house - mirror reflection of HBO 's programming , transforming penetrating drama into absurdist satire .
You can see this warped sensibility in Dexter 's audaciously witty opening - credits sequence , in which the title character ( Michael C. Hall , formerly of HBO's Six Feet Under ) , a forensic expert who 's slaughtered several dozen victims , goes about his morning routine — shaving , making coffee , tying his shoes — all of it shot in a way that evokes bloody carnage .
Pop culture has been building up to the serial killer as hero ever since Hannibal Lecter , and Dexter cannily appropriates two of mankind 's guiltiest fantasies : that torturing people to death might be fun and — more crucially — that some people richly deserve that fate .
Unlike , say , the Hostel movies , however , Dexter does n't seek to discomfit or repulse .
For all its matter - of - fact gore , including close - ups of severed body parts and hotel rooms drenched in blood , the show is primarily a comedy of manners , observing a self - aware sociopath as he struggles to channel his homicidal urges ( born of childhood trauma ) into " productive " endeavors .
The first season , adapted from a Jeff Lindsay novel , was a tad plot - heavy ; season two , which begins in late September , should allow its writers the freedom to experiment with their protagonist 's burgeoning emotions .
It could get pretty sick , in a good way .
If I sound optimistic , that 's largely because Weeds , Showtime 's other current first - rate show , went ballistic in its second season , to the point that it 's now almost impossible to categorize .
( It returns on August 13 . )
Series creator Jenji Kohan continues to lay waste family values , pushing Nancy ( Mary - Louise Parker ) further into the drug trade and her two sons deeper into deviant and / or antisocial behavior .
But without skimping on outrageous humor — last year 's zenith was Uncle Andy 's lecture to thirteen - year - old Shane about the fine art of semen disposal —
Weeds grew darker and more despairing as the season progressed , concluding with the apparent offscreen murder of a major supporting character and a cliff - hanger in which every member of the Botwin family faces death , jail , or life in Uruguay .
That it 's hard to tell how seriously to take any of this is precisely what makes the series such an unruly , perplexing triumph .
Rather than attempt a synthesis of comedy and drama , it 's treating them as if they were fundamentally interchangeable , which is far more interesting .

I want to expand on what I wrote previously in “ A Simple But Challenging Game : Part II , this time focusing on Rosenthal ’s Centipede Game .
To remind you of the rules , in that game there are two players .
The players , named Mutt and Jeff , start out with $ 2 each , and they alternate rounds .
On the first round , Mutt can defect by stealing $ 2 from Jeff , and the game is over .
Otherwise , Mutt cooperates by not stealing , and Nature gives Mutt $ 1 .
Then Jeff can defect and steal $ 2 from Mutt , and the game is over , or he can cooperate and Nature gives Jeff $ 1 .
This continues until one or the other defects , or each player has $ 100 .
As I previously wrote , in this game , the Nash equilibrium is that Mutt should immediately defect on his first turn .
This result is obtained by induction .
When both players have $ 99 , it is clearly in Mutt ’s interest to steal from Jeff , so that the he will end with $ 101 , and Jeff will end with $ 97 .
But that means that when Jeff has $ 98 and Mutt has $ 99 , Jeff knows what Mutt will do if he cooperates , and can see that he should steal from Mutt , so that he will end with $ 100 and Mutt will end with $ 97 .
But of course that means that when both players have $ 98 , Mutt can see that he should steal from Jeff , and so on , until one reaches the conclusion that Mutt should start the game by stealing from Jeff .
Of course , this Nash equilibrium behavior does n’t really seem very wise ( not to mention ethical ) , and experiments show that humans will not follow it .
Instead they usually will cooperate until the end or near the end of the game , and thus obtain much more money than would “ Nashists ” who rigorously follow the conclusions of theoretical game theory .
Game theorists often like to characterize the behavior of Nashists as “ rational , ” which means that they need to explain the “ irrational ” behavior of humans in the Rosenthal Centipede Game .
See for example , this economics web - page , which gives the following “ possible explanations of ‘ irrational ’ behavior ” :
There are two types of explanation to account for the divergence .
The first assumes that the subject pool contains a certain proportion of altruists who place a positive weight in their utililty function on the payoff of their opponent .
Also to the extent that selfish players believe that there is some probability that other players are altruists , they have an incentive to mimic altruistic behaviour by passing .
The second explanation considers the possibility of action errors .
Errors in action , or ‘ noisy ’ play , may result from subjects experimenting with different strategies .
Or simply from subjects pressing the wrong key .
Let ’s step back for a second and consider what “ rational ” behavior should mean .
A standard definition from economics is that a rational agent will act so as to maximize his expected utility .
Let ’s accept this definition of “ rational . ”
The first thing we should note is that “ utility ” is not usually the same as “ pay - off ” in a game .
As noted in the first explanation above , many people get utility from helping other people get a pay - off .
But there are many other differences between pay - offs and utility .
You might lose utility from performing actions that seem unethical or unjust , and gain utility from performing actions that seem virtuous or just .
You might want to minimize the risk in your pay - off as well as maximize the expected pay - off .
You might value pay - offs in a non-linear way , so that the difference between $ 101 and $ 100 is very small in terms of utility .
Of course , this difference between pay - off and utility is very annoying theoretically .
We ’d really like the pay - offs to strictly represent utilities , but unfortunately for experiments , it is only possible to hand out dollars , not some abstract “ utils . ”
But suppose that the pay - offs in the Rosenthal Centipede Game really did represent utils .
Would the game theory result really be “ rational ” even in that case ?
Would the only remaining explanation of cooperating behavior be that the players just do n’t understand the situation and are making an error ?
No .
Remember that to be “ rational , ” an agent should maximize his expected utility .
But he can only do that conditioned on some belief about the nature of the person he is playing with .
That belief should take the form of a probability distribution for the possible strategies of his opponent .
A Nashist rigidly reasons by backward induction that his opponent must always defect at the first opportunity .
He even believes this if he plays second , and his opponent cooperates on the first turn !
But is this the most accurate belief possible , or the one that will serve to maximize utility ?
Probably not .
A much more accurate belief could be based on the understanding that even people who understand the backward induction argument can reason beyond it and see that many of their opponents are nevertheless likely to cooperate for a long time , and therefore it pays to cooperate .
If you believe that your opponent is likely to cooperate , it is completely “ rational ” to cooperate .
And if this belief that other players are likely to cooperate is backed by solid evidence such as the fact that they started the game by cooperating , then the behavior of the Nashist , based on inaccurate beliefs that cannot be updated , is in fact quite “ irrational , ” because it does not maximize his utility .
Sophisticated game theorists do in fact understand these points very well , but they muddy the waters by unnecessarily overloading the term “ rational ” with a second meaning beyond the definition above ; they in essence say that “ rational ” beliefs are those of the Nashist .
For example , take a look at this 1995 paper about the centipede game by Nobel Laureate Robert Aumann .
Aumann proves that “ Common Knowledge of Rationality ” ( by which he which he essentially means the certain knowledge that all players must always behave as Nashists ) will imply backward induction .
He specifically adds the following disclaimer at the end of his paper :
We have shown that common knowledge of rationality ( CKR ) implies backward induction .
Does that mean that in perfect information games , only the inductive choices are appropriate or wise ?
Would we always recommend the inductive choice ?
Certainly not .
CKR is an ideal ( this is not a value judgement ; “ ideal ” is meant as in “ ideal gas ” ) condition that is rarely met in practice ; when it is not met , the inductive choice may be not only unreasonable and unwise , but quite simply irrational .
In Rosenthal ’s ( 1982 ) centipede games , for example , even minute departures from CKR may make it incumbent on rational players to “ stay in ” until quite late in the game ( Aumann , 1992 ) ; the resulting outcome is very far from that of backward induction .
What we have shown is that if there is CKR , then one gets the backward induction outcome ; we do not claim that CKR obtains or “ should ” obtain , and we make no recommendations .
This is all well and good , but why use the horribly misleading name “ Common Knowledge of Rationality ” for something that would be more properly called “ Universal Insistence on Idiocy ? ”
I hope it is obvious by now why I am skeptical of explanations of various types of human behavior that are based on assuming that all humans are always Nashists , and even more skeptical of recommendations about how we should behave that are based on those same assumptions .

Fox anchor : ' officers should be commended ' for tasering student David Edwards and Jason Rhyne

Weighing in with his legal opinion regarding police officers ' tasering of a University of Florida student , attorney and Fox News anchor Gregg Jarrett said no excessive force was used during the incident .
" He is resisting .
And the videotape really does n't lie -- it speaks volumes about what 's going on , " said Jarrett , referring to video of the event that is circulating around the internet .
" The law does n't allow you to resist police officers when they ask you to do something , " he added .
The tasered student , Andrew Meyer , was wrestled to the ground by officers after asking Sen.
John Kerry a question during a school forum .
" Now you may have a beef with them being there in the first place and trying to escort you out -- you can argue that later -- but when they ask you to do something , you have to do it .
That 's the law , " Jarrett said .
Reviewing the videotape of the arrest , which played throughout the interview , Jarrett pointed to moments that he says show Meyer is clearly resisting arrest .
" There he is raising his arms , " he said as he watched .
" Yeah he may be saying ' I 'm not doing anything , ' but he is ... he is repeatedly resisting . "
Asked about an eyewitness report of the incident reported earlier in the segment , which indicated Meyer may have told officers he would cooperate if they let him stand up , Jarrett was incredulous .
" Why should they believe him ? " the anchor asked .
" He has already demonstrated in the previous minute that he is not going to do what he says he 's going to do . "
The tasering , according to Jarrett , was good police protocol .
"
The taser device actually is a method by which you decrease the level of force by subduing somebody , not increasing the level of force ... these police officers out to be commended for what it is they did . "
Regarding the possibility of future lawsuit from Meyer , Jarrett said the student did n't have a case , adding that no jury would sympathize with him as he was being " utterly obnoxious . "
Earlier in the program , witness Matthew Howland , who was on the scene during the scuffle , said at one point Meyer told officers he 'd cooperate .
" Andrew said ' I 'm not resisting .
If you let me up , I 'll walk out of here with you right now , " Howland told Fox . " But they kept him on the ground and about 20 seconds later they tased him . "
Howland later said that after the tasing , Meyer was taken to the lobby of the auditorium , where police asked for his name and other information -- requests the student refused .
" He does n't give up his information like his name because he says he 's scared - - he does n't want to give them any more information . "
This video is from Fox 's Fox News Live , broadcast September 18 .
WASHINGTON -- Today , the Federal Communications Commission is set to ram through two measures likely to roil the media and telecommunications industries and deepen political dissatisfaction with the agency 's chairman .

You know all that talk about GPUs being the new CPUs ?
Well it 's not just a lot of hot , ventilated air .
Thanks in large part to the launch of development kits like nVidia 's CUDA , Russian outfit Elcomsoft has just filed for a US patent which leverages GPUs to crack passwords .
Their approach harnesses the massively parallel processing capabilities of modern graphics cards to make minced - meat of corporate - strength password protection .
An NTLM - hashed Microsoft Vista password , for example , can now be cracked in 3 to 5 days ( instead of two months ) using a simple , off - the - shelf , $ 150 graphics card -- less complicated passwords can take just minutes .
Dial the GPU up to an $ 800 GeForce 8800 Ultra and Elcomsoft 's approach will crack passwords at a rate some 25 times faster than existing CPU - only approaches .

The Freeplay Foundation has given out more than 150,000 radios
The Freeplay Foundation is developing prototypes of a charging station for house lights it hopes will improve the quality of life for many Africans .
The Foundation said the lights would replace the expensive , polluting and unhealthy alternatives many Africans currently use to light their homes .
Field testing of the prototypes will start in Kenya in the next few months .
Light and life
Kristine Pearson , director of the Freeplay Foundation , said few Africans in the continents most vulnerable areas had access to electricity to light homes .
" Their life stops or is very narrowed when the sun goes down , " she said .
" Two extra hours of light would make a big difference to their life . "
The World Bank estimates that more than 500 million people in sub-Saharan Africa do not have access to electricity supplies that could be used to light their homes .
Instead , said Ms Pearson , many used kerosene lamps , battery - powered lights or wood fires as sources of illumination after sundown .
Buying kerosene or batteries can consume up to 15 % of a household 's budget , said Ms Pearson .
In addition wood was hard to gather and unhealthy to burn .
As part of its LifeLight Project the Freeplay Foundation has drawn up designs for a charging base unit that would be able to power up several detachable lights that can be used around a home .
The Foundation aims to train women to sell and maintain the lights
Working prototypes are now being made that will be tested with families in Kenya to refine the design .
Freeplay technology has already been used to create wind - up torches and small lights said Ms Pearson but the LifeLight Project aims to make bigger , brighter bulbs for homes .
She said the Foundation was adopting a similar approach to that used for the wind - up Lifeline radio to get the lights to families .
Instead of just giving the lights out and then leaving , the Foundation aims to recruit women who will sell the lights and be trained to repair and maintain them for customers .
Ms Pearson said the take up of the lights was likely to be rapid because it would piggyback on the network created by the Foundation to maintain Lifeline radios .
Since it was established in 1998 the Foundation has given out more than 150,000 Lifeline radios .
Ms Pearson said the Foundation had applied for a grant to fund the design and testing work from the World Bank as part of that organisation 's Lighting Africa initiative .
Dr Wakefield stands by his findings
The doctor who first suggested a link between MMR and autism paid children £ 5 for their blood samples at his son's birthday party , a hearing was told .
Dr Andrew Wakefield and two colleagues face professional misconduct charges over their controversial research into the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine .
The General Medical Council alleges the trio acted unethically and dishonestly towards the Lancet medical journal .
They all deny the allegations in the case which could last several months .
Supporters welcome Dr Wakefield outside the GMC Immunisation rates
The case centres on research carried out by Dr Wakefield , and colleagues Professor John Walker - Smith , and Professor Simon Murch , which raised doubts about the safety of the triple vaccine .
The suggestion of the 1998 research paper - published in the Lancet - was that MMR was linked not only to autism , but also to the bowel disorder Crohn 's disease .
Dr Wakefield continues to vigorously deny any allegation of wrongdoing

Doctor on misconduct charges
It led to falling numbers of parents immunising their children and a row over whether the then prime minister , Tony Blair , had vaccinated his son , Leo .
But the medical establishment has repeatedly argued that the triple vaccine is perfectly safe .
And a host of major studies has since failed to find any evidence of a link between MMR and autism .
The allegations against the doctors relate to investigations for their study on 12 youngsters with bowel disorders carried out between 1996 and 1998 .
At the time , all three doctors were employed at the Royal Free Hospital 's medical school in London , with honorary clinical contracts at the Royal Free Hospital .
It was also alleged that 11 children were subjected to a series of invasive tests , including colonoscopies , lumbar punctures , blood and urine tests and MRI scans .
This was contrary to their best clinical interests and Dr Wakefield did not have the " requisite paediatric qualifications " nor sought the right approval for the tests , the charge sheet went on .
Dr Wakefield and Prof Walker - Smith are also accused of acting " dishonestly and irresponsibly " in failing to disclose in the Lancet paper the method by which they recruited patients for inclusion in the study .
And it is alleged that a drug was administered to one child for experimental reasons .
The allegations that he took blood from children at his son's birthday party date back to prior to 20 March 1999 .
Later on , he joked about the incident while giving a presentation at the Mind Institute in California , and said he intended to get samples the same way in the future , the hearing was told .
Another of the key allegations against Dr Wakefield is that he was being paid at the time for advising solicitors on legal action by parents who believed their children had been harmed by MMR .
Deny
All three doctors are accused of conducting the study on a basis which was not approved by the hospital 's ethics committee .
One example is that some of the children may not have qualified for the study on the basis of their behavioural symptoms .
In a statement ahead of the hearing Dr Wakefield 's solicitor said : " Dr Wakefield continues to vigorously deny any allegation of wrongdoing . "
The Lancet has disowned Dr Wakefield 's 1998 paper , the editor admitting he would not have published it if he had known about what he called a " fatal conflict of interest " .
The campaign group , Jabs , which believes MMR has damaged children , has been demonstrating in support of Dr Wakefield outside the GMC .

In wrong hands , FBI biometric info ' can follow you forever ' David Edwards and Jason Rhyne

This A newly announced FBI plan to catalog precise physical characteristics of individuals around the world -- a vast $ 1 billion dollar project that makes the bureau 's fingerprint database look quaint by comparison -- is raising eyebrows among critics who worry about how the data may be used .
Taking advantage of the science of biometrics , which relies on precise body measurements unique to every human being , the FBI hopes to be able to identify criminal and terrorist suspects by face - shape , scars and even iris patterns .
But the idea raises some red flags for CNN legal analyst Sonny Hostin .
" The goal to have a comprehensive data base to track terror suspects , criminals , that sort of thing .
I think it 's a wonderful goal , " said Hostin .
" But you have to be very careful , because what if the wrong person is in that database ?
That is something that can follow you forever . "
Hostin pointed out that while victims of other forms of identity theft could eventually correct the record , stolen biometric information -- in the wrong hands -- would present a more permanent problem .
In a Saturday piece about the initiative in the Washington Post , Silicon Valley tech forecaster Paul Saffo worried that the FBI would be unable to ensure that the data was secure .
" Unlike say , a credit card number , biometric data is forever , " Saffo told the paper .
" If someone steals and spoofs your iris image , you can't just get a new eyeball . "
Asked by CNN anchor Alina Cho whether the database should concern " those of use who are n't on terror watch lists , like the two of us , " Hostin cut her off .
" Hopefully , " she joked about her absence from the terror list , but added that the plan warranted serious concern .
" I 'm already in a database , having been a federal prosecutor and having security clearance , " she said .
" The FBI wants to take that information and keep it and that 's the problem -- and generally you can get access to it and ask for information that 's on you .
But in this situation you may not be able to get that information .
So I think everyone does have to be careful . "
As reported by the Post , other critics voiced additional concerns about the program .
" You 're giving the federal government access to an extraordinary amount of information linked to biometric identifiers that is becoming increasingly inaccurate , " said Marc Rotenberg , the executive director for the Electronic Privacy Information Center .
Nevertheless , Barry Steinhardt , the director of the Technology and Liberty Project at the American Civil Liberties Union , told the paper that the system was poised to become a ubiquitous law enforcement tool .
" It 's going to be an essential component of tracking , " he said .
" It 's enabling the Always On Surveillance Society . "
This video is from CNN's American Morning , broadcast on December 24 , 2007 .
A day after it was officially confirmed that NATO had made a request to the German Defense Ministry to provide 250 combat troops to a Quick Reaction Force in northern Afghanistan , former NATO Chief of Staff Harald Kujat warned that German soldiers were ill - equipped to deal with combat operations against the Taliban and al Qaeda insurgents .
Kujat , a former chairperson of NATO 's military committee , deplored the lack of adequate hardware at the disposal of the German military and said on Wednesday , Jan. 30 , that Bundeswehr troops " did not even have functioning devices , with which they could communicate with their allies in Afghanistan . "
NATO submitted a formal request on Tuesday for Germany to provide a replacement for the 350 - strong Norwegian force that leaves in July after an initial inquiry had been made late last year .
The German Defense Ministry confirmed earlier this month that it was considering whether to deploy the troops , responding to a media report that referred to a " new quality " in the German engagement in Afghanistan .
Government officials have , however , in recent weeks denied that supplying a rapid reaction force would amount to sending men into combat .
They said the force was designed to provide emergency support to other troops in the north and that though its brief would include hunting " terrorists " and dealing with kidnappings this would not be its main task .
Inadequate equipment could cost lives
Soldiers could be at risk from lack of equipment
Kujat called on German Defense Minister Franz Josef Jung to prevent such a deployment as the inadequacy of German military equipment and lack of necessary supplies could lead to casualties , in addition to those which would come from engaging the enemy .
He maintained that the soldiers themselves were well - trained and qualified to deal with the challenges of combat but the serious deficits in modern and efficient guidance systems and communication devices could negate their skills as soldiers .
Jung was in Kabul for discussions with Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Tuesday , and made it clear that German soldiers were " ready to participate in operations against terrorists and cooperate with other international forces in any other part of the country . "
Reacting to the news that NATO planned to send more troops to his country to counter the threat of a resurgent Taliban back by supporters of al Qaeda , Karzai said training the Afghan police and army was more important than sending more foreign troops to the country .
Karzai doubts wisdom of sending more troops
President Karzai advocated more investment in the Afghan police and army
" More than anything else , we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions , our army , our police force , our administrative structure , our judiciary and so on , " Karzai told German newspaper Die Welt on Wednesday .
" Although the situation has finally improved , the unintentional bombing of Afghan civilians by NATO and US troops is particularly painful , although it stems from a lack of ground troops , " he added .
" However , I am not sure that sending more troops is the right answer . "
The Western alliance already has around 37,000 troops deployed in the country .
NATO commanders say they need some 7,500 extra troops to carry out their mission as they battle the Taliban .
Afghanistan 's army currently numbers 58,000 troops , with a target of 70,000 .
Karzai said he had the impression that the war " is not happening here , " but was being exported to Afghanistan from other countries .
" We should concentrate on the sanctuaries and the training camps , " he said .
" Afghanistan is not a sanctuary .
It was one , but we have taken it back . "
Focus should shift to Pakistan
Taliban fighters are thought to be re-grouping in Pakistan
Most concern focuses on the mountainous border area with Pakistan , where Afghan and Western forces believe Taliban extremists regroup to launch attacks in southern Afghanistan .
Karzai said his recent meeting with Pakistan 's under - pressure President Pervez Musharraf had been " very constructive . "
" My hope is that Pakistan will take harder and clearer measures in the future and thus becomes a region where extremism is no longer used as a political instrument , " he was quoted as saying .
" If Pakistan takes a step in this direction , we in Afghanistan will take many steps to support it . "
For years I 've considered myself a Blue Dog Democrat , fiscally Conservative but with a heavy leaning toward personal Liberty , Constitutional Rights , and more than a little Pursuit of Happiness .
I voted for Bill Clinton , both times , Al Gore and John Kerry ( although I was an Edwards supporter that primary season ) .
Like many Democrats , I 've always viewed the Republican Party as power lusting and dangerous to our civil liberties ... willing to legislate against the rights of any group that does n't march lockstep with their Christian beliefs .
It 's not like they try to hide it .
What makes a Blue Dog Democrat ?
I suppose it's an obsessive belief in balanced budgets , we are not " Tax / Borrow / Print and Spend " Democrats .
We believe the Government should live within its means without further taxes or borrowing .
We believe in a sound monetary policy .
We believe the Government should n't be creating money to make up shortfalls in the budget .
Currently , if the Government can't borrow enough money to pay its bills it resorts to printing more money .
This causes the value of the dollar to drop , it causes inflation and it causes the value of your savings to drop .
We are against unconstitutional and preemptive wars .
We do not believe the United States Government should be looking for fights around the globe .
We believe that we can make more friends and earn more respect around the world by talking and trading with countries than we can by bombing them .
We believe the Constitution is our contract with our state representatives and with our government .
We expect them individually and as a whole to abide by the separation of powers and to be ever vigilant and proactive in guarding our rights against federal encroachment .
We also expect our representatives to work within the limits of a Constitutional Government and not assume powers that rightly belong to the States , or to coerce states into federal compliance by threatening to withhold funds .
The Ninth Amendment States -
" The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people . "
The Tenth Amendment States -
" The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved for the States respectively , or to the people . "
The biggest reason this country is being torn apart and divided every two , four , and six years is because we have failed to hold our representatives accountable to the Constitution , specifically the Ninth and Tenth Amendments .
The Ninth Amendment means , quite simply , that any right not specifically acknowledged in the Constitution is still your right , and the United States Government cannot use the omission of a right as a justification to deny you that right or to claim jurisdiction over any other rights you may hold individually or at the State level .
The Tenth Amendment makes explicit what had only been implied - That all powers not expressly granted to the United States Government in the Constitution are prohibited to it .
The omission of a power or limit of powers does not entitle the United States Government , or any Branch thereof , to assume or claim new or undeclared powers without an amendment to the Constitution .
All powers not explicitly granted it in the Constitution are reserved for the individual states , or for the people .
Any politician who claims that the United States Constitution is outdated , anachronistic , or " just a god - damn piece of paper " ( a quote attributed to President George W. Bush ) , is saying that they are above the law .
Any politician who says that the Constitution is a living document is saying the same thing .
In both cases they are usually trying to subvert the Ninth and Tenth amendments .
They want you to believe these two amendments are no longer relevant .
They want you to believe that your rights are not really inalienable ( unable to be taken away or given away ) , but rather privileges granted to you by the Federal Government , privileges that they can revoke and legislate away .
They would have you to believe any power not expressly forbidden them is an inherent power and the prerogative of Government .
The claimed justification for assuming these powers is Article I , Section 8 , Clause 3 - Giving Congress Power " to regulate commerce with foreign nations , among the several states and with Indian tribes . "
The Commerce Clause , as it's known , is the basis on which Congress enacts Social Policy , environmental , criminal and civil rights laws .
We believe the Founding Fathers would be appalled , and quite literally " up in arms " over the Federal Governments use of the Commerce Clause to trump the Ninth and Tenth Amendments , as they were added expressly to keep the Government from expanding it 's powers without a Constitutional Amendment .
The Ninth and Tenth Amendments were a deliberate attempt to protect us from our representatives and from the perils of a centralized bureaucratic dictatorship .

Today , many people are getting away easily a fake doctor ’s note .
They get approved for their excuses for skipping work or missing from school .
They submit a doctor ’s note that says to the employers or boss that the employees or staff member is unwell ill or due to their illness they ought to be allowed to stay away from the work place .
A good number of these doctor ’s notes are fake for the reason that either the worker or student is not ill or that the fact that the note was never signed by a dr .
To learn more about fake doctors note , click here .
If you happen not to be the type that skips duty every now and then , then your chances of being excused are much higher if you turn up carrying a doctor ’s note .
This is due to the fact that you already possess a solid reputation as one who rarely misses work .
The employer would most likely just take note of it and keep then keep it for the records sake .
You also might want to get a doctor ’s note at jaseemumer.com .
If the presented doctor ’s note contains the details and features of a genuine doctor ’s note , then endorsement could be straightforward without too much inspection .
Mistrust would occur if the details cannot be verified and it looks unprofessional .
Do your research well .
If your note states a particular kind of injury or illness , then be ready to prove it if called upon to do so .
If it states that you have flu , obviously flu the symptoms should still be evident even after few days .
Be alert on the kind of sickness that you use as your excuse .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Food from healthy clones of cattle , swine and goats is as safe as food from non-cloned animals , the Food and Drug Administration said in a report released Tuesday .
Debate has raged around food products from cloned cattle , such as this one produced by the company Viagen .
" Extensive evaluation of the available data has not identified any subtle hazards that might indicate food - consumption risks in healthy clones of cattle , swine , or goats , " the 968 - page " final risk assessment " concluded .
" Thus , edible products from healthy clones that meet existing requirements for meat and milk in commerce pose no increased food consumption risk (s ) relative to comparable products from sexually - derived animals . "
But the FDA said it needs more information to determine the safety of meat and milk from cloned sheep .
The FDA also concluded that food from newborn cattle clones " may pose some very limited human food consumption risk . "
The purpose of using cloned animals is to improve the overall value of a given herd by creating genetic copies of donor animals , resulting in a herd that produces higher - quality milk and meat .
For years , heated debate over the use of cloned animals for food production has stretched from Congress to cattle farms and dinner tables nationwide .
Judy Fortin has more on the debate over meat and milk from cloned animals ».
Dr. Stephen Sundlof , director of the agency 's Center of Food Safety and Applied Nutrition , acknowledged the controversy to reporters .
About half of the more than 30,500 comments from the public the FDA has received about the matter have dealt with labeling , he said .
But , he added , agency regulators cannot require cloned products be labeled as such if -- as they assert -- there is no material difference between them and food produced by conventional methods .
" There 's really nothing for us to label , " he said .
Consumers wo n't be able to figure it out for themselves , he said .
No test exists that could distinguish meat from a cloned animal from other meat .
Either way , food products from cloned animals or their offspring would not reach store shelves for years , experts said .
But companies could label their clone - free products as such , Sundlof said .
In addition , foods labeled " organic " would not contain cloned products .
Tuesday 's announcement followed the agency 's December 2006 preliminary conclusion , reached after a four - year review , that milk and meat from cloned animals are safe for human consumption .
The agency was then to collect more safety data before issuing a final decision .
Last month , the Senate passed a measure intended to bar the FDA from approving the products until further study was conducted .
The legislation , part of the Senate 's $ 286 billion farm bill , also required the Agriculture Department to examine consumer acceptance of cloned meats .
On Tuesday , opponents of using cloned animals in food production expressed anger at the move .
" The FDA has acted recklessly and I am profoundly disappointed in their rush to approve cloned foods , " Sen.
Barbara Mikulski , D- Maryland , said in a written statement .
" Just because something was created in a lab does n't mean we should have to eat it .
If we discover a problem with cloned food after it is in our food supply and it's not labeled , the FDA wo n't be able to recall it like they did Vioxx -- the food will already be tainted . "
Vioxx , a painkiller , was withdrawn from the market in 2004 after it was linked to a heightened risk of heart attack and stroke .
" We think the FDA should pay attention to what Congress is asking them to do , " said J.D. Hanson , policy analyst for the Center for Food Safety .
" It looks like they are releasing it to sidestep what Congress has asked them to do . "
The National Farmers Union , in a written statement , said " consumers have the right to know if the food they feed their families comes from a cloned animal . "
Another concern is possible economic fallout .
" People will start consuming less dairy and meat " if they are not sure of the products ' safety , predicted Michael Hansen , a senior scientist with Consumers Union .
His group calls for more study and clear labeling .
Perhaps in an effort to placate critics , Tuesday 's report included hundreds of pages of raw data in the risk assessment .
Some consumer groups said they were pleased with the report .
" There are still unanswered questions about the use of cloned animals in the food supply , but the Food and Drug Administration has satisfactorily answered the safety question , " the Center for Science in the Public Interest said in a written statement .
" While the safety of any food cannot be proven with absolute certainty , consumers should have confidence that meat and milk from cloned animals and their offspring will be safe . "
Experts say it is unlikely actual clones would be used in food production .
A cloned cow costs $ 15,000 to $ 20,000 to create .
More likely , experts said , the offspring of cloned animals would be used .
Bruce Knight , the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's undersecretary for marketing and regulatory programs , said only about 600 cloned animals exist in the United States , about 570 of which are cattle .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Health Library
He said the agency is urging providers to extend a voluntary moratorium on the use of the meat or milk from cloned animals during the transition , a period he would not specify .
Mark Walton , president of ViaGen , which uses cloning technologies , said his company will comply with the request , but he played down the scope of the matter .
" The number of cloned animals in the barn yard today is minuscule compared to the size of the total livestock population , " said Walton .
" In addition , clones are to be used as breeding animals , not for consumption .
Because of a supply chain management system that allows tracking of cloned livestock , consumers are unlikely to ever eat these animals . "
A spokeswoman for the National Cattlemen 's Beef Association , Karen Batra , predicted , " It will be many , many years " before the technology becomes mainstream .
She further predicted that its adoption would not be accompanied by a hike in prices .
" There comes a point where consumers will find another form of meat , " she said .

MIAMI ( Reuters ) - Seven men plotted to bring down the U.S. government by poisoning saltshakers and bombing landmark buildings , a prosecutor told Miami jurors as their terrorism conspiracy trial opened on Tuesday .
A combination of handout photographs provided by the U.S. Department of Justice shows the seven people arrested in Miami Thursday , who U.S. officials said on June 23 , 2006 , had discussed attacks on the landmark Sears Tower in Chicago , the FBI building in Miami and other government buildings .
Seven men plotted to bring down the U.S. government by poisoning saltshakers and bombing landmark buildings , a prosecutor told Miami jurors as their terrorism conspiracy trial opened on Tuesday .
REUTERS / Department of Justice / Handout
The “ Liberty City Seven ” aimed to create chaos as part of a holy war to pave the way for al Qaeda - affiliated guerrillas to take over the United States , Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Gregorie said in the prosecution ’s opening statement .
“ We need to make the people go crazy in the streets , ” Gregorie quoted alleged ringleader Narseal Batiste as saying .
“ Allah is going to take over through us . ”
Defense lawyers said the charges were “ nonsense ” scripted by the government and orchestrated by paid FBI informants they called Conman No. 1 and Conman No. 2 .
They said the defendants , one of whom was devoted mainly to smoking marijuana , had no weapons or intent to do violence and that it was the informants who suggested poisoning restaurant saltshakers and blowing up buildings .
The “ Liberty City Seven , ” named for the poor part of Miami where they gathered in a rundown warehouse , were arrested in 2006 on charges of plotting to blow up Chicago ’s 110 - story Sears Tower -- the tallest U.S. skyscraper -- along with several FBI offices and the Miami federal court complex where they are on trial .
The young men face up to 70 years in prison if convicted on all four conspiracy counts in a case government officials have touted as an important victory in the war against terrorism .
‘ ASPIRATIONAL ’
But federal agents said when they were arrested that the group ’s plans were “ aspirational rather than operational , ” and posed no real threat because they had neither al Qaeda contacts nor means of carrying out attacks .
The government ’s main evidence is drawn from 15,000 audio and videotaped conversations made by the informants .
One infiltrated the group and introduced the other , a purported al Qaeda operative from Yemen , as a friend of his uncle .
“ Unknown to Mr. Batiste , it ’s Uncle Sam , ” Gregorie said .
Batiste ’s attorney , Ana Jhones , portrayed him as a would - be religious leader who aspired to big things but lacked intellect and ability .
He pretended to go along with the informants , she said , because he was trying to con them out of $ 50,000 to turn the decrepit warehouse into a community gathering place .
“ All he wanted to do was get his money and run and who better to con than somebody who was supposedly al Qaeda , ” Jhones said .
She said the taped conversations would reveal plots “ so outrageous they ’re also incredible , ” such as Batiste ’s proposal to march to the White House door and announce , “ Here I am . ”
“ It will be entertaining , ” Jhones told the jurors , who are expected to hear about two months ’ worth of testimony .
The defendants met at the warehouse , which they called “ the temple ” or “ the embassy , ” to practice martial arts and study religious texts , but their lawyers scoffed at depictions of them as Islamist extremists .
Defendant Stanley Phanor is a Roman Catholic who eats pork , said his attorney , Roderick Vereen .
“ You will not see one of these guys say ‘ Yay Allah , yay jihad , yay holy war , ’ ” Vereen told the jury .
President Ahmadinejad says Iran 's nuclear programme is peaceful
Mr Ahmadinejad said the latest report by the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) showed Iran had been truthful about its nuclear activities .
The IAEA found Iran had clarified some of its nuclear history but questions remained over present activities .
The US has vowed to push for further UN sanctions in the light of the report .
The IAEA report praised Tehran for making progress in responding to questions about past activities but warned that the agency 's knowledge about Tehran 's current nuclear programme was diminishing .
It said that Iran was continuing to enrich uranium in defiance of demands by the UN Security Council .
" Selective co-operation " was " not good enough " , the White House said after the report 's release on Thursday .
Meanwhile , a meeting scheduled for next week to discuss further sanctions against Iran has been cancelled because China has pulled out , diplomats say .
' Political victory '
Iran has portrayed the IAEA 's latest findings as a political victory .
" Since the first days , we have declared that Iran 's nuclear activities are lawful and in the framework of its legal rights , but the Western countries ' propagation networks and political pressures did not allow the Iranians ' voice be heard in the world , " Mr Ahmadinejad is quoted by state media as saying .
" Now the whole world has seen that the news was not true and Iran 's activities have been clean and peaceful and all the main questions of the IAEA have received their appropriate answers . "
Mr Ahmadinejad said the time had come for the US and its allies to change their behaviour .
" Upon wrong and incorrect information you issued two resolutions , " he said , referring to two earlier rounds of UN sanctions .
" Now that you have found out that this information was wrong , you have to be brave and come forward and tell the Iranian nation ' We made a mistake ' and apologise . "
Weapons fear
While Tehran insists the IAEA report gave it a clean bill of health , the US and its allies fear Iran is developing a nuclear weapons capability .
The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) reached a deal in August with Iran , according to which Tehran would answer outstanding questions as part of a four - year probe into its nuclear drive .
This report sadly makes clear that Iran seems uninterested in working with the rest of the world
Dana Perino
White House spokeswoman
Sanctions pressure continues
" Iran has provided sufficient access to individuals and has responded in a timely manner to questions and provided clarifications and amplifications on issues raised in the context of the work plan , " the latest report said .
However , it said Iran 's co-operation had been " reactive " rather than " pro-active " and that the IAEA was continuing to check whether Iran 's declarations were complete .
The report also found that the agency 's knowledge about Tehran 's current nuclear programme was diminishing and that Iran had not suspended its uranium enrichment activities as called for by the Security Council .
It says the government had been operating 3,000 centrifuges , the machines used to enrich uranium , at its plant at Natanz .
Sanctions threat
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said : " This report indicates that Iran continues to defy the international community and two unanimous UN Security Council resolutions . "
She added that the documents made it " clear that Iran seems uninterested in working with the rest of the world " .
Ms Perino said the US planned to work towards a new set of Security Council sanctions with representatives of the five permanent members , along with Germany , at a meeting scheduled for next week in Brussels .
Western powers are concerned because , while enriched uranium is used as fuel for nuclear reactors , highly enriched uranium can also be used to make nuclear bombs .
Two UN Security Council resolutions approved in March imposed limited sanctions on Iran , including a ban on arms sales and restrictions on financial assistance .
In September , council members agreed to delay a vote on further measures until the publication of the current report .
Top Iranian nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili said the report proved that accusations against his country were baseless and new sanctions would be wrong .

Pollard supporters lump Bush with Haniya and Nasrallah
But what does George Bush have in common with two men he must regard as arch enemies ?
The tagline of the poster makes it clear - " Bush , free your captive ! "
Hamas has been holding an Israeli soldier captive in Gaza since 2006 , while Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers .
The " captive " that Mr Bush is being asked to set free is Jonathan Pollard .
The case of Pollard , a US Navy intelligence analyst who gave classified material to Israel , is a sore point in otherwise excellent relations between Israel and the US .
' Bargaining Chip '
In 1987 , Pollard was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole .
Mrs Pollard has written to Mr Bush pleading for clemency
During Mr Bush 's three - day visit to Israel and the West Bank , Pollard 's supporters are once again demanding his release .
Along with the poster campaign and small rallies , his wife , Esther , has written a letter to the US president pleading for clemency .
Pollard 's supporters argue that he could not have committed " treason " as both Israel and the US are allies .
They say that Pollard fully co-operated with a subsequent investigation , only to receive an unduly harsh sentence .
Mrs Pollard says that the refusal to release her husband is politically motivated and that the US is using him as " bargaining chip " .
" At every single juncture my husband 's plight is exploited for political gain , " she told BBC News .
" Both the US administration and the state department are very aware of his value to the Israeli public . "
' Traitor '
The documents that Pollard leaked have never been made public for intelligence reasons .
But they were said to include information on Soviet arm shipments to Syria , Iraqi and Syrian chemical weapons , the Pakistani atomic bomb and Libyan air defences , according to the author and journalist Wolf Blitzer in his book Territory of Lies .
We have to assume that not only did the intelligence go to Israel but that it went to other countries as well
NIS agent Ron Olive
Ron Olive , the agent in charge of counterintelligence for the Naval Investigative Service at the time of Pollard 's arrest , told the BBC that the incident was " one of the most devastating cases of espionage in US history " during which Pollard stole over " one million classified documents " .
" Even though Israel is an ally , it had friends that are n't necessarily friend of the US , " said Mr Olive , who wrote a book about the case , Capturing Jonathan Pollard .
He argues that all countries ' intelligence services are susceptible to penetration , including Israel .
" We have to assume that not only did the intelligence go to Israel but that it went to other countries as well , " he added .
While many Israeli officials would like to forget about the Pollard affair , the issue is periodically raised at the highest levels .
Presidential pardon
In 1998 , former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was reported to have won a guarantee from then - President Bill Clinton that Pollard would be released , tied to a Palestinian prisoner exchange deal .
But the CIA boss at the time , George Tenet , threatened to resign if President Clinton agreed to the release .
If the Pollard affair was a low point in Israeli - American relations , the damage it did at the time seems to have been forgotten by the two sides .
Mr Bush was hailed as something of a prodigal son in Israel .
" I think it 's clear from this visit that the Pollard case is not an issue and that Israeli - American relations are as strong as ever , " says Gabriel Sheffer , a professor of politics at Hebrew University .
But Pollard 's supporters say they will not stop fighting until he is released .
Mrs Pollard says she is hopeful of a possible US presidential pardon .
" I 'm hopeful that we 're reaching the end of the time , " she said .
Daily Show examines Republican Party ' Trapped in the Closet ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday September 11 , 2007
Print This Email This Jon Stewart returned to The Daily Show on Monday , saying sarcastically , " Thank God , that while we were on break , we did n't miss any inherently funny scandals , " and then wailing , " Senator Craig , he gets busted on the gay sex thing on my first day of vacation ! ...
Unfortunately , two weeks is a lifetime . "
After being assured that the Craig story is still developing , Stewart turned with relief to " our senior anonymous Congressional gay public restroom sex correspondent . "
The door of a bathroom stall then opened to reveal Ron Corddry , who left the Daily Show in 2006 , seated on a toilet , fully clothed .
" Been right here , Jon , " explained Corddry .
" Spent the past 14 months holed up in this stall .
... I knew there was a story here , Jon , I just did n't know what it was . "
Corddry went on to explain the complexities of the gay sex toe - tap code .
" Wingtips mean you 're a married man .
Socks with sandals means this is your first time .
And , Jon , anyone in those brightly - colored plastic Crocs ?
That means anything goes .
...
That 's not just in bathrooms .
Any time you see anyone wearing Crocs , beware .
...
They are soliciting incredibly depraved gay sex . "
When Stewart pointed out that Corddry was no longer on contract with the show and was n't being paid , Corddry replied , " That 's okay , Jon .
I do n't want the money .
To me , coming back to the show after more than a year for three minutes of anal sex jokes while sitting on a prop toilet -- that 's its own reward . "
The segment concluded with " R. Party Trapped in the Closet , " a parody of R. Kelly 's " Trapped in the Closet " song series , consisting of clips of Senator Craig interspersed with comments by Stewart and further commentary by a Kelly - style singer .
The following video is from Comedy Central 's The Daily Show , broadcast on September 10 .

Snapshots of Hyperion show its holey nature .
Hyperion up close .
NASA / JPL / Space Science
Saturn 's moon Hyperion looks like a sponge — it is full of holes .
This image of Saturn 's largest irregularly - shaped moon ( see picture ) was snapped by the Cassini spacecraft on a close flyby in September 2005 , and shows Hyperion in all its porous glory .
The structure , revealed in Nature today1 , comes as something of a surprise : " We certainly had n't predicted it , " says Peter Thomas , at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , who led the research team .
The holey look indicates that the moon was probably formed by the gradual accumulation of small particles .
It has probably stayed in its irregular , lumpy form because it is too small to be squashed by its own gravity , says Thomas .
The moon measures just 360 by 280 by 225 kilometres .
Large objects generally get packed into more compact spheres by gravity pulling the material together .
The porous nature of the object means that Hyperion 's craters are slightly deeper than would be expected for a solid object , since incoming objects met less resistance and penetrated more deeply .
The pictures made it easy to come up with a reasonable explanation for Hyperion 's sponginess , Thomas says , adding that it is something that could be predicted only with the benefit of hindsight .

Hyperion 's density — worked out by Thomas to be 544 kilograms per cubic metre , which is low for a moon — indicates that the object is spongy all the way through .
" The low density of Hyperion ensures that much of its interior is porous , " says Dale Cruikshank , from the NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field , California .
Cruikshank 's own work on Hyperion , also published in Nature today2 , shows that the moon is made of ice contaminated with hydrocarbon - containing complex organic materials .
" The ice is ' dirty ' , " he says .
Cruikshank adds that other low - density objects might also turn out to be porous .
" There are some other low - density bodies in the outer Solar System , including some of Saturn 's small , close - in satellites , " he says .
But these have n't yet been snapped in high enough resolution to know for sure whether they are spongy like Hyperion .

The Asian python population has swelled over the past 20 years after owners dumped pet snakes they no longer wanted in the Everglades .
" Encounters like that are almost never seen in the wild .
And here it 's happened for the fourth time , " Professor Mazzotti said .
In the other cases , the alligator won or the battle was an apparent draw .
" They were probably evenly matched in size , " Professor Mazzotti said of the latest battle .
" If the python got a good grip on the alligator before the alligator got a good grip on him , he could win . "
While the gator may have been injured before the battle began , wounds were found on it that apparently were not caused by python bites .
Professor Mazzotti believes it was alive when the battle began .
And it may have clawed at the python 's stomach as the snake tried to digest it , leading to the blow - up .
The python was found with the gator 's hindquarters protruding from its midsection .
Its stomach still surrounded the alligator 's head , shoulders , and forelimbs .
The remains were discovered and photographed by helicopter pilot and wildlife researcher Michael Barron .
The incident has alerted biologists to new potential dangers from Burmese pythons in the Everglades .
Not only can the python kill other reptiles , the snakes will also eat otters , squirrels , endangered woodstorks and sparrows .
While there are thousands of alligators in the Everglades , Joe Wasilewski , a wildlife biologist and crocodile tracker , said it was unknown how many pythons there were .
" We need to set traps and do a proper survey of the snakes , " he said .
At least 150 have been captured in the last two years .
The problem arises when people buy pets they are not prepared to care for - and a reproducing snake can have as many as 100 hatchlings .

Even as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice defended her department ’s oversight of private security contractors , new evidence surfaced Thursday that the U.S. sought to conceal details of Blackwater shootings of Iraqi civilians more than two years ago .
In one instance , internal e-mails show that State Department officials tried to deflect a 2005 Los Angeles Times inquiry into an alleged killing of an Iraqi civilian by Blackwater guards .
“ Give [ the Los Angeles Times ] what we can and then dump the rest on Blackwater , ” one State Department official wrote to another in the e-mails , which were obtained by ABC News .
“ We ca n’t win this one . ”
One department official taking part in a chain of e-mails noted that the “ findings of the investigation are to remain off - limits to the reporter . ”
Another recommended that there be no mention of the existence of a criminal investigation since such a reference would “ raise questions and issues . ”
In the May 2005 incident , a Blackwater convoy was transporting a senior U.S. diplomat down a Baghdad thoroughfare when guards opened fire on an approaching taxi .
The taxi driver , Mohammed Nouri Hattab , told The Times that he was slowing to a stop when a burst of machine - gun fire cut into his taxi , wounding him and killing a passenger , 19 - year - old newlywed Yas Ali Mohammed Yassiri .
The Times began making inquiries after receiving a tip in August 2005 .
Peter Mitchell , then a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Iraq , told superiors that he planned to tell a reporter that the State Department had “ thoroughly investigated ” the incident and that “ no criminal act occurred . ”
The e-mails indicate , however , that the only investigation done was “ administrative . ”
Two Blackwater employees were fired and sent back to the U.S. after they were found to have violated operating procedures .
Blackwater has declined to comment on the incident .
“ As for the legal jurisdiction under which a [ private security contractor ] operates , this is where things get hazy , ” Mitchell wrote to superiors .
“ If the [ private security company ] is found negligent , the only recourse is dismissal .
In cases where there was clear criminal intent , a criminal case could hypothetically be pursued in U.S. federal court , but this has yet to happen out here . ”
Mitchell could not be reached for comment Thursday .
His proposed response sparked a furious debate within the department .
It eventually reached David Satterfield , now Rice ’s senior advisor on Iraq .
Satterfield , according to the e-mail chain , recommended that any response to the reporter be approved by Washington .
“ This is a sensitive story that deals with sensitive contract issues , ” one official wrote .
In his e-mail to the Times reporter , Mitchell said that State officials were continuing to investigate the incident .
In the end , the State Department declined to provide comment .
“ I ’ve been assured that the issue continues to be staffed back in Washington , ” Mitchell said .
In another e-mail obtained by the news channel , a regional State Department official complained of several incidents in which Blackwater guards had allegedly fired at innocent civilians .
The official complained that Iraqis had been frustrated in seeking justice for alleged wrongdoing by Blackwater .
“ If we are unable or unwilling to address this issue , sooner or later those requesting compensation for their losses will lose patience with us and seek recourse through other means , ” the officer wrote .
“ In the worst - case scenario , some might seek revenge . ”

Moscow / Brussels – Russia ’s firebrand envoy to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) said Thursday that US military aid to Kosovo amounted to arming ‘ former terrorists . ’
Responding to news of US President George W Bush ’s approval of military aid to Kosovo Thursday , Russia ’s ambassador to NATO Dmitry Rogozin warned that such a move could lead to ‘ new terrorist clashes in the Balkans . ’
The weapons , Rogozin stressed , ‘ wo n’t be collectors ’ items , ’ they ’ll be ‘used and shot from , ’ news agency Interfax quoted him as saying .
Russia ’s NATO envoy called for an early meeting of the Russia - NATO council to discuss the US plans to deliver arms .
The United States has said that furnishing defence capabilities to Kosovo would ensure stability in the region , but Rogozin on Thursday rejected the US policy as ‘ twisted logic . ’
‘ To give former terrorists weapons for the war against terrorism appears at least amusing if not worse , ’ the Interfax news agency quoted Rogozin as saying from Brussels .
‘ It is well known that those in power in Kosovo came in as the organizers and leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army , which many states recognized as a terrorist organization , ’ he said .
The US was among the first nations to recognize Kosovo after it split from Serbia , despite heavy protest from Russia , which warned that the example of the province ’s independence would fan the flames of separatist struggles worldwide .
Rogozin suggested Thursday that an early meeting of the Russia - NATO council could take place on March 28 , when tentative talks were planned with NATO chief Jaap de Hoop Scheffer .
US President George W Bush and Putin are expected to face off over the countries ’ differing perceptions of NATO at a summit for the organizations on April 2 in Bucharest .

envelope - tossing , congressional staffer for former Republican Senator Mike DeWine — until the online diary about her sex adventures got some unexpected notoriety .
Her stories about adventures with the political elite snared a few pious policy - makers , including her apparent S&M fuck pal , Robert Steinbuch , DeWine 's former counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Naturally , she was canned from her job , accompanied by media fireworks .
Did Ms. Cutler crawl away , hide under the bed , enroll in a 10 - day rehab , or issue a non-denial denial ?
Hardly .
She wrote a scintillating novelization of her experience — the bawdy , smart , and hilarious The Washingtonienne — and posed for Playboy .
Jessica retired her online diary — also called The Washingtonienne — after blogger Wonkette revealed her identity .
But she continues to blog at JessicaCutlerOnline.com while contemplating her next novel and jumping out of the occasional cake .
Jessica and I talked about the hypocrisy of Capitol Hill 's Christian conservatives , the differences between prostitution and getting paid for sex , and which drugs are best for getting it on .
It seems like you found yourself writing a novel because you were forced to .
I mean , you had your little private life , and your girlfriends , and you were gossiping like anybody else would with their friends .
And then all of the sudden , your secret blog got outed !
So you kind of had to write a book to say your piece , or to set the record straight .
Yes .
I think that was totally the situation , you know ?
And not a lot of people understand that .
The longest thing I 'd ever written prior to that was like a 5,000 - word article for a magazine .
About what ?
Shoes .
It 's so clichéd — a " Sex and the City " type thing .
Whatever .
I did n't like writing .
That 's why I quit a job at a magazine and ended up working in D.C.
The thing is ... my life was n't perfect , but I was really happy !
You know , I was dating lots of guys and just living my life .
We were talking among friends , you know , and at the time , we just thought , " Oh , we 're using up all our minutes on our cellphones , and ...
I do n't want to email this to you because it has our IP addresses and you never know .
" So when you blogged the gossip , you were actually trying to be more private .
Yeah !
And I thought , worst - case scenario , if this ever gets back to me , I will delete it , I 'll deny that I wrote it , and it will be bygones !
( Laughs ) Well apparently you learned your lesson in D.C. — just deny and shred !( Laughs )
But then I thought taking responsibility was the right thing to do .
It 's better than lying about it .
I remember the first couple of days when all this came out , after I left my job , I went on the Internet and there was all this speculation over who was writing it .
And they were suggesting other people in my office , and people in other offices .
I felt bad , you know ?
So I started getting phone calls from reporters , and they have my unlisted number .
I figured , they must know .
How did they get my number ?
So I figured that whoever knew it was me was emailing reporters .
It really freaked me out .
I was a journalist in college , so I know what it 's like to be a young reporter .
If you hear about this girl who could be another Monica — that 's sort of what everyone 's hoping for .
If you find out her address and where she lives , what are you gonna do ?
You 're gonna go to her house !
Other people were telling me , " You probably better call these people back before someone shows up at your apartment . "
And that was something I did n't want .
So I thought I handled it the best I could .
Well , it 's interesting when you say , " the best you could . "
Because you have this air about you , especially in person , where you 're self - deprecating .
And everything I 'd heard about you before I read your book made me think that you were sort of like a deer — a sexy deer — caught in the headlights .
But when I started reading your book , I thought , " My god .
She can write !
Her timing is incredible .
She has acute observational skills .
She can Write with a capital W. "
This book just flies .
And then I thought , well , okay … maybe it 's ghostwritten and this is just a creation of a scandal .
But then I went to your blog , and there was that same voice again .
And there was your wit and your authority .
You have so much authority in your writing ... Thanks !
You do !
If only people could see the look on your face .
It 's all squished up , like you 're saying …
" What ? !" Well , I think when you read a lot of criticism , you start to see yourself through their eyes .
But I 'm proud of the book .
I think a lot of people just try to diminish any kind of accomplishment .
You know , ' cause it always goes back to …
" Well , she was a hooker .
" You 've gotten all the stigma and criticism of being a sex worker without the paycheck .
I know !
It 's not fair !
( Laughs )
It 's more like you were a party girl .
Maybe you 're still a party girl .
You enjoyed going out and having all the usual fun , whether it meant drugs , dancing , great sex , bad sex , crazy adventures .
And then just having the fun of talking about it the next day — but you were n't charging by the hour !
( Laughs ) I know .
That is one of those things that just does n't go away .
And it 's like a big sticking point for peopleI want to know what your own response is to that , Jessica .
Because I 've also been characterized as a full - time pro .
And I have not run my life as a prostitution business .
Not because I think it 's wrong , but it 's just not my life story .
So I find when I get that sort of attitude from someone , I get kind of feisty .
In many respects , I identify with whores .
If I 'm around other whores , I feel like part of the crew .
Because we'd have some things in common , in terms of our life experience , in the way people perceive us .
And I can identify with a lot of their values – their sense of the reality of what really goes on with sex that people do n't like to talk about .
I wonder if you feel the same way , or if you just want to be as far as possible from anyone thinking you have anything to do with it .
The latter is totally not the case .
When I start to feel defensive , my attitude is sort of like , if people are calling me a whore , " Well , what 's wrong with being a whore ? "
You know ?
I mean , I think girls who are sex workers — and men , all sex workers — they see another side of humanity and sexuality .
People who 've never worked in the sex industry — people who 've never done it — do n't know the half of it .
I 've heard girls I know who escort say , " I think every woman should do this , because you find out a lot .
You learn a lot about men . "
They tell me , " You do n't even know .
You wrote a book and even you do n't know the half of it . "
And I 'm like ...
" Yes , I want to know all about it ...
" I really do n't know what the hang - up is about that .
I do n't know why people really seem to dislike prostitutes .
I do n't understand that attitude at all .
Are you more confrontational than you were when you first started working in D.C. ?
I ask because you worked for a lot of conservative guys that have … like , piggy opinions about how women should stay at home with their legs crossed .
And god forbid they have an abortion .
You know , the attitude that America would be better if women were basically barefoot and pregnant .
You worked for some really famous so - called Christian conservatives .
[ Ed : Jessica worked for Senator Mike DeWine ( R ) - Ohio , who was defeated in the 2006 election . ]
And the way you describe D.C. political life , it 's just as hypocritical and full of shit as everyone imagines it to be .
Oh yeah .
I mean , the platform the Senator I worked for had ... he was a Christian conservative .
And was he really ?
Do you think these people have a grain of sincerity ?
The way it is , each Senator is a figurehead .
And you have the staffers doing the work .
But you know , like … from hanging out with them and partying with them and stuff , like — I was n't the only girl in my office that had an abortion .
I went there not knowing anyone , you know ?
I 'm not the daughter of any contributors and did n't know anyone who had anything to do with Capitol Hill .
I just went in there for my interview .
I would have worked for anybody , you know ?
You were a whore !
Yes , I was !
( Laughs )
Ideologically , yes !
It was sort of like I just took whatever , because you need names on your resume .
And they did n't ask me what I thought about anything .
They did n't ask me , " Have you had abortions ?
What do you think about that ?
What are your views on this or that ?
You 're single .
Are you sleeping around ? "
It did n't matter … then .
And even when I started working there , people knew I was dating around .
They knew I was seeing someone in my office , and that we had , you know … non-vanilla sex .
And none of it was a problem until it got out .
There 's a part of your book that does n't get as much attention , but was riveting to me .
It actually created both a lot of tension in the storyline , a sense of suspense — and also , I hate to admit this to you , but it brought out the mommy in me .
It was n't your sexual activities .
But I found myself thinking : " Jessica , do n't keep drinking !
Jessica — Jessie , you 're getting too high !
That 's the fifth night in a row !
You 've been a wreck in the morning !
Oh , this poor little baby .
I 'm just all worried about her . "
And then I would think to myself , " God , you are such a mom .
" And it was actually quite interesting to read a female narrator being so blasé and straightforward about being high and saying what she likes about being high .
Because , of course , male novelists do this constantly , and they do n't provoke such a protective reaction .
If it 's Ernest Hemingway or Bret Easton Ellis or whoever , you know , they drink every night , they 're always loaded out of their minds , and everybody still sort of expects that they 'll work it out in the end .
But when a young woman talks about it , even I start to worry .
And the way you write about it , it 's often hilarious — your drug adventures had me rolling on the floor !
I could n't believe all the nutty shit you did .
But I also found myself saying to myself , " I wonder what 's gonna happen ? "
Actually , if it had ended up with you saying , " And now I am a good AA member and all this is over " — I do n't know if I would have liked that .
That would 've been too neat .
Anyway , I want to get your opinions about what drugs are the most fun , as far as sex is concerned .
And where you 're at in terms of the peril of being high all the time .
Obviously drugs are a distraction from … you know , real sex , and the way intimacy is when you 're sober .
But if you really do n't want to deal with that , you will have a lot of drunk sex , high sex .
It 's fun , but it 's not real .
I mean , I do n't do this frequently .
I would say the last time I , you know ... ( laughs ) got high and had sex was last week .
And I woke up the next morning and thought , " That was sloppy !
" But why is it attractive ?
If you 're doing this with someone , and you 're really not secure with them , or you 're worrying what they think — if you 're both messed up , you 're not thinking about it so much .
Have you given any thought to your next book ?
Well , I have meetings with editors and they just want to hear about my life .
I tell them , and they say , " Oh you have enough material for three books . "
But I do n't want to do that .
So I have some outlines .
I think it 'll sorta be chick lit .
Well , I 'm going to jump in and give you some advice .
Fuck the chick lit notion , because it 's already over .
You have acute powers of observation , and you 've seen into some interesting lives .
Your candor comes out when you write .
I just interviewed someone who was talking about how she studies the Victorian Age .
And she told me that in those days , best friends would write each other 's biography .
I thought that was fascinating .
Like , what if I had to write another friend 's memoir ...
Oh , I would love to do that !
I 've met so many girls who just blow me out of the water .
You know ?
And I 've met girls who had really sad stories .
Like , " If I wrote a novel , you could def … "
But the thing is — they 're too scatterbrained or too troubled to actually get around to it .
And people are always saying , " Well , you should write it for them ! "
But then I 'd feel like I 'm stealing her stories ... Well , when you 're a writer , you become a story stealer .
I hate people like that !
I mean ( laughs ) , there was a book kind of written about me .
I left things out of my book , out of respect for the author , and then she wrote about them !
And I was like … ohhh !
I was kind of surprised that she did that .
And I wonder if her husband knows the scenes are real .
He probably does n't .
[ Ed : Maybe he does now ! ]
Or maybe he knows and he does n't care .
But if I 'd put it in my book , she might be suing me !
( Laughs ) Well , I think the fertility of your blog is probably going to show you the way .
Every time I turn to it , you get me screaming or you get me giggling about something .
It 's supposed to be fun .
In a way , I wish I never took the original blog down .
You could always resurrect it .
But I 'm being kind of sued over that .
( Laughs ) Nothing would be happening if they did n't perceive you as someone with deep pockets to go after .
I so do n't .
Actually , I filed for bankruptcy yesterday .
Oh !
Why ?( Laughs ) Congratulations , Miss Cutler !
Yes .
I am officially broke .
Kind of a relief .
You know ... Well , not to be a target .
There 's that .
But with a blog — I mean , what happens when someone 's offended by something someone 's posted .
Usually , there might be some email exchange , or some blog war ... you know , if someone writes an attack on you , you can respond to it , if you want to acknowledge it at all .
It 's mostly really silly .
Especially someone calling you ugly or slutty .
Okay — how many times do I have to go through this ?
Okay , I 'm an ugly slut .
And you 're not ?
" You 're better than me , you 're so much smarter , you have a better blog ... "
What else do I have to say ?
Well , I 'll just clear it up for our audience .
Jessica Cutler is a talented writer .
She is not ugly — she is so not -ugly .
She is bankrupt , however .
She 's very pretty , very bankrupt ...
And she 's slutty in all the good ways that so many of our slut - positive friends like to be .
Sluts are the nicest people in the world .
They 're people pleasers !

TEHRAN  Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard accused the United States on Wednesday of fabricating a video showing Iranian speedboats confronting United States Navy warships in the Persian Gulf over the weekend , according to a report carried by the semiofficial Fars news agency and state - run television .
“ Images released by the U.S. Department of Defense about the Navy vessels were made from file pictures , and the audio was fabricated , ” an unnamed Revolutionary Guard official said , according to Fars , which has close links to the Revolutionary Guard .
It was the first time Iran had commented on the video that the Pentagon released Tuesday .
The audio includes a statement that says , “ I am coming to you , ” and adds , “ You will explode after a few minutes . ”
The voice was recorded from the internationally recognized channel for ship - to - ship communications , Navy officials have said .
The Pentagon immediately dismissed the assertion that the video , which shows Iranian speedboats maneuvering around and among the Navy warships , had been fabricated .
Bryan Whitman , a Pentagon spokesman , said Iran ’s “ allegation is absurd , factually incorrect and reflects the lack of seriousness with which they take this serious incident . ”
Longest ear hair
Radhakant Bajpai , 50 , of Naya Ganj , India , is one of many medical record breakers to make their way into this year 's Guinness World Records Book .
The hair sprouting from his outer ears measures 13.2 cm ( 5.19 inches ) at its longest point and was confirmed by Dr R P Gupta .
Mr Radhakant said : " God has been very kind to me . "
And what it means to Mrs. Obama is sacrificing many of the things she holds most dear , in favor of a larger goal .
Although she has concluded that this mission is worth what it takes , achieving such acceptance has been difficult , and the adjustments are ongoing .
Her husband ’s vaulting ambition was always a given .
“ She knew what she was getting into , ” says Craig Robinson , Michelle ’s brother , who is the men ’s basketball head coach at Brown University .
“ Ever since I ’ve known Barack , he ’s said that he wanted to be in politics .
He ’s never changed his interests ; it just happened that he ’s turned out to be very good at it . ”
But Obama ’s accelerated timetable came as a shock , even to his spouse .
As recently as 2000 , Obama — then a little - known Illinois state senator — lost his first race for Congress .
But in 2004 he ran for the U.S. Senate and won in a landslide victory , collecting more votes than any Illinois politician in history and becoming the nation ’s only black senator .
No sooner had his family adjusted to that development than he started to consider a run for the presidency in 2008 .
“ This was a sudden decision , ” Mrs. Obama says .
“ He had just won his U.S. Senate seat .
In my mind , it was ‘ O.K. , here we are — you ’re a U.S. senator . ’ ”
With Barack commuting to Washington while Michelle and the children remained in Chicago , the family ’s life was already complicated , and Michelle was stunned when Barack abruptly fast - forwarded his presidential aspirations .
“ I thought , Uhhhh — you ’re kidding !
It was like , No , not right now — right ?
There was a period of ‘ Let ’s not do this now ; let ’s press the “ easy ” button !
Can we get a break , please ? ’ ”
She sighs and rolls her eyes .
“ So we had to talk about it .
Before I signed on , I had to know , in my mind and my heart , how is this going to work for me , and would I be O.K. with that ?
He would n’t have done this if he did n’t feel confident that I felt good about it , because it is a huge sacrifice .
The pressure and stress on the family is n’t new .
But we entered this thing knowing it was going to be really , really hard .
For us , the question was : are we ready to do something really hard again , right after doing something that was really hard ? ”
Barack eventually managed to persuade the whole family that his quest justified the cost .
“ This is something that ’s bigger than everybody , ” says Craig Robinson .
“ This is so important that it ’s worth her saying , ‘ I ’ve got to rethink the way my family is structured . ’ ”
Although Mrs. Obama had recently been appointed as vice president at the University of Chicago Medical Center , her husband ’s announcement in February 2007 that he was entering the presidential race forced her to scale back her professional commitments .
In May , she reduced her work schedule to 20 percent in order to meet the needs of her family while participating in the campaign .
“ She was intending to take a full leave of absence , but she could n’t make herself separate from this professional career that ’s been so important to her , ” says Susan Sher , vice president for legal and governmental affairs at the University of Chicago Medical Center , where she is Mrs. Obama ’s boss .
“ Her involvement in her work life has been so serious that it ’s not easy to just say , ‘ Never mind . ’ ”
Mrs. Obama has a long history of speaking out about the ways in which men ’s choices — particularly their professional ambitions — often leave their wives to pick up the slack , even when they have their own careers .
“ What I notice about men , all men , is that their order is me , my family , God is in there somewhere , but me is first , ” she told the Chicago Tribune in 2004 .
“ And for women , me is fourth , and that ’s not healthy . ”
There have been rumours circulating for years that John Travolta ’s son Jett has an undiagnosed case of autism , which the Travolta family have refused to acknowledge to the media .
One of the Travolta ’s neighbors has been interviewed by Hollywood , Interrupted , and as a father of a 4 year old autistic child , he is not happy with the way the Travolta are shunning their own son because of his disability :
“ I do n’t think it ’s a stretch to call their treatment of Jett child abuse , ” Ocala , Florida restaurant manager Tim Kenny tells Hollywood , Interrupted .
Kenny claims he met Travolta at his restaurant in February , and , after “ comping ” the movie star and his daughter a meal per restaurant policy for celebrities , he asked him , “ as one autistic child ’s father to another , ” if he “ was doing anything special in terms of therapy ” for Jett .
Aghast , Travolta responded , “ Well , we involve him in the arts . ”
Then , he offered to send Kenny a book , and high - tailed it out of the restaurant .
“ If I ever received a Scientology book from him [ Travolta ] , I ’d find him , and throw it back at him , ” says Kenny .
“ Scientology is keeping him from acknowledging his son ’s autism .
They see it as a weakness .
That ’s what the space aliens are telling him I guess . ”
Joking aside , the Kennys are “ disgusted by ” Travolta .
They claim that Travolta has turned down invitations to participate in autism fundraisers , and most recently refused to participate in a local celebrity golf tournament if a connection to autism advocacy was promoted .
The organizers of the charity tournament scheduled at the Golden Hills Country Club in November are alleged to have changed the billing from an autism event to the more generic “ fundraiser for disabled children ” to accommodate the star .
Calls to event organizer , the Family Resources Coalition , were not returned by post time .
The Kennys also claim that Kelly and John “ let Jett sit in front of video games all day eating junk food , while they eat the best organic food money can buy .
They exclude Jett from all social events because they are embarrassed . ”
“ Once , ” reports Kenny , “ when Kelly took him to the movies , Jett started to have a meltdown and Kelly pointed at the nanny and ordered , ‘ Take care of it . ’ ” “ Jett does not speak at all , ” confirms Kenny .
“ He has not even been taught how to communicate .
We struggle every week to pay for our daughter ’s therapy .
How dare he [ Travolta ] ruin his own son ’s chances of recovering !
We want to get the word out on this . ”
Apparently this is not the first time that alarm bells have rung about the Travolta ’s behavior towards his son ’s autism before .
Other celebrities familiar with autism , as well as the Autism Society of America , have expressed their frustration at how the Travoltas are sweeping their son ’s ailment under the carpet .
The reason for their denial may stem from the fact that Scientology does not recognise autism as a disorder , nor will they go anywhere near using drugs to treat the psychological illness .
Autistics in Scientology are usually known as “ degraded beings ” who brought the affliction on themselves .
Kelly Preston has gone as far as saying in the past that Jett suffers from Kawasaki Syndrome like disease because of “ environmental toxins ” , with Jett reacting badly specifically to carpet cleaning chemicals .
As I am not a doctor by any stretch of the imagination , I ’ve Googled Kawasaki Syndrome to research the disease Preston claims her son suffers from .
I ’ve compared it to a couple of more medical sites and Preston ’s explanation sounds like bullshit .
Autism symptoms and Kawasaki Syndrome symptoms meet nowhere in between , one is a neurological affliction , whilst one is a disease with physical manifestations that can be treated .
I can only assume that Jett was n’t upset at the carpet cleaning chemicals Kelly was using in her home .
It sounds like a more likely explanation for him to become upset by the loud sound of the vacuum cleaner .
If speculation over the Travolta ’s ostracising their son from society because of autism is true , then they need to be investigated and have that child placed in the care of responsible individuals who will provide proper treatment for this poor boy .
Jett does not deserve to live his life like this because of his parent ’s crazy beliefs .
My family attended a few Jehovah ’s Witnesses meetings for a while when I was younger , as my mother had lost faith in Catholicism and thought that the group were friendly people who were profoundly devoted to God .
I had to get a back operation when I was a teenager that if I did n’t have would have rendered me a hunchback for the rest of my life .
The Witnesses told my mother that if I were to go through with the operation ( where I had to take out my own blood a few weeks beforehand and then have it transfused in my body in case a lot of blood was lost during the procedure ) , that I would go to hell and be essentially banned from the group .
My mother looked at them , told them they were nuts , and further informed them she would go to hell with me .
Needless to say we ’re back to being Catholics , but my mother chose me over her beliefs at the time – just like any other loving parent should do for their child .
It is sad that a couple could be brainwashed into thinking such hogwash and then choose to ignore their child just to save face publicity wise .
The FBI said innocent people had nothing to fear from a database
The FBI is due to award a $ 1bn ( £ 0.5 bn ) contract next month for the databank of peoples ' physical characteristics .
FBI assistant director Thomas E Bush told the BBC the targets would be what he called the " bad guys " - terrorist and criminal suspects .
But civil liberties groups have warned the technology may be unreliable .
The FBI system is expected to contain a range of biometric information , including eventually iris images and face - shape data .
' Careful vetting '
Mr Bush told the BBC that innocent people would have nothing to fear from the database , called Next Generation Identification .
" Post - 9/11 we 've had an increase in our customer base .
We need a system that is literally bigger , faster better , " he said .
" What we deal with is bad guys data , suspected terrorists or criminals . "
He added that there would be " very careful vetting " to ensure that the system is not abused .
However Barry Steinhardt of the American Civil Liberties Union told the Washington Post that it would enable an " always - on surveillance society " .
The newspaper says the FBI , which already has 55 m sets of digital fingerprints , has also been compiling images of faces and palm patterns .

The Pirate Bay is currently working on an OiNK replacement in an attempt to bring the hundreds of thousands of music albums back online that disappeared during the raid .
The replacement will be released within a week and on the BOiNK.cd domain .
BOiNK will be a little different from OiNK .
For instance , the tracker will be public and it will start out with a lot less torrents than OiNK had when it was raided .
The success of BOiNK will mainly depend on the former OiNK community , who will be asked to upload their old OiNK torrents .
The most important thing about BOiNK is perhaps the message it sends out to the IFPI and the BPI :
It shows that that if you stop one tracker , others will pop up days after .
It is a hydra .
Call it a slap in the face if you want .
BOiNK will probably be ready in a few days .
People from the Pirate Bay , Mininova , TorrentFreak and even the recently arrested ( and released ) OiNK admin are currently at The Oil of the 21st Century conference where they are – among other things – discussing filesharing , culture and copyright related issues .
BOiNK is a Pirate Bay only project , OiNK and other BitTorrent sites are not involved .
In the meantime , please stay away from scam sites that pretend to be related to OiNK .
All they will do is take your money and run away .
As soon as there ’s an approved donation campaign ( if there will be any ) we will report it here .
Brokep from the Pirate Bay working on BOiNK .

The MediaDefender - Defenders have released the source code for the " trapping " and decoy software that MediaDefender uses to spread fake files on P2P networks .
Similar to the previously released e-mails , tracking database and phone call this leak is also spread by the group that goes by the name “ MediaDefender - Defenders “ .
In the .nfo that was posted with the torrent we read :
The source is complete for their operations regarding Kazaa , bittorrent , gnutella etc .
This system is now released for the public in order to identify the decoys they set up .
A special thanks to the MD employee that gave this to us .
It appears that this leak was not collected from the e-mails .
The MD - Defenders themselves claim that a MD employee handed over the files to them , but this has n’t be verified by other sources at this point .
This leak contains a wealth of information and seriously harm MediaDefender ’s future operations .
BitTorrent tracker owners and other admins who are involved in managing P2P networks can utilize the leaked information to brace themselves against companies like MediaDefender , who try to pollute their networks with fake files .
From the leak it seems that MediaDefender is active on virtually every P2P network , including Usenet .
Not surprisingly , most applications are dedicated to BitTorrent , which is probably their main target because of its popularity .
Application names BTPoster , BTSeedInflator , BTDecoyClient and BTInterdictor make it quite obvious what they are supposed to do .
At this point it is still unclear who the MediaDefender - Defenders are and how they got their hands on all this information .
MediaDefender has announced that the FBI will be investigating the source of the leaks .
To be continued ?

O'Reilly goes ballistic over former White House press secretary Scott McClellan 's publisher 's recent revelations and Scotty in particular for not coming out and clarifying whether he is calling Bush a liar in his upcoming book or not .
Download Download ( fixing clips )
O'Reilly :
It 's not going to hurt his dopey book sales to come out and clear the air about a very serious allegation about people he worked with , people he was close to .
What 's the matter with this McClellan ?
So Billo , just as he has done so many times before , sent his minions out to ambush him at his home but there was no answer .
The big giant head then gets himself all worked up , screaming and shaking his finger and he basically calls Scott a wimp in playgroundspeak .
Word to Scotty .
Billo's coming to your home and insulting your manliness in front of hundreds of thousands of viewers .
You just gonna take that ?

WASHINGTON --
The Senate appears poised to hand the White House another victory with a measure that would make permanent an expansion of government spy powers and shield phone companies from liability for assisting government eavesdropping .
With floor consideration scheduled to start today , Democrats are split on how to cut back on the administration 's surveillance powers .
The only option that appears to have sufficient backing is a bipartisan measure the White House has blessed .
Opponents of the White House - backed bill are ...
Do the investigative reporters at the Washington Post and New York Times fall under the Writers Guild Contract ?
Are Bernstein and Woodward too busy in makeup ?
Can the WGA and Producers get together and give satirical news an exemption ?
While the Writers Strike keeps The Daily Show from cleverly pointing out the obvious , The Washington Post and New York Times ignore the obvious altogether .
We 've been lied to by this White House .
Who says ?
Scott McClellan , the guy who was paid to lie for the guys who lied in the first place .
Of course , if he really wanted to bare his soul he would have let Helen Thomas write the foreword of " What Happened : Was I Lying Then Or Am I Lying Now ? "
Point is , other than blogs and the Keith Olbermann network - and the Writers Strike continuing to keep Jon Stewart , Bill Maher and Stephen Colbert on the sidelines - we 're left with the right to spin an insider story of a White House coverup .
The so - called liberal Mainstream Media ?
Try to find the McClellan revelation in todays liberal bastions , Washington Post or the New York Times .
Wonder if Howard Kurtz will wonder how his print employer , the one that was Ben Bradlee 's once proud publication during Watergate , could have been missed what should be a blockbuster tale of deception of the American people at the very highest level .
The McClellan story may not be the smoking gun that leads to impeachment , but it could unlock the inner- workings of a White House who does n't trust the American people with the truth and sees the betrayal of a covert CIA spy as acceptable politics .
And that 's not worth of a mention ?
That 's not to say that the broadcast 's Lords of Loud wo n't cover McClellan 's story .
Bill O'Reilly :
It 's a non-story .
I said so in " Culture Warrior " , now out in paperback .
Sean Hannity : Vince Foster , Kathleen Willey , Could have had bin Laden on a silver platter .
Mark Levin : McClellan is a brownshirt of the Clinton crime family .
Sean Hannity : George Soros , Moveon.org , I did not have sex with that woman ...
Rush Limbaugh : So , McClellan is a proven liar .
Why would we believe anything he says ?
Sean Hannity : ACLU , New York Times , Human effect on global warming a sham

Why is hell is Ingraham sitting in for Bill ?
And The Washington Post ?

The United States has expressed hope that Mongolia will continue to send its 9th contingent of soldiers to Iraq in 2008 , Mongolia 's presidential press office said Friday .
" The president of the U.S. , George W. Bush , hoped the country 's activities in Iraq could be more effectual , " U.S. Ambassador to Mongolia Mark C. Minton said during a meeting with Mongolia 's President Nambaryn Enkhbayar .
Enkhbayar said Mongolia had been involved in Iraq since the very start and he would submit the U.S. request to Mongolia 's National Security Committee .
In 2003 Mongolia sent its first group of soldiers to Iraq for post - war reconstruction and peacekeeping .
Since then eight groups of soldiers have gone from Mongolia to the war - torn nation .

Britain 's oldest boss is working her usual nine - to - five day at the office - the only difference is she is also celebrating her 100th birthday .
Company director Phyllis
Self still drives herself to work six days a week where she manages the bustling garden centre business she has run since 1974 .
The great - grandmother works a 48 - hour week , dealing with all correspondence , payroll , and the hiring and firing of nearly 200 staff at the Whitehall Garden Centre .
Scroll down for more ...
As she opened her telegram from the Queen , Mrs Self said she has no intention of retiring from the demanding job - and said " keeping busy " was her age - defying secret .
She said : " I 've never thought about stopping , retiring or anything like that .
I like people too much .
" When people ask how I 've got to a 100 , I say the secret is just being busy all the time , meeting people and dealing with people .
That 's what I love .
" I stay at work usually until we close up for the day , and sometimes I 'm the last one here , but it keeps me young . "
As well as being a director , grandmother - of - five Phyllis is company secretary of the family firm , which has its headquarters in Chippenham , Wiltshire , and a second branch in Bristol .
Her son Chris , 70 , is the managing director and two of her grandsons , Peter and Mark , also work for her .
Born Phyllis Johnson in Birkenhead , Lancashire , in 1907 , she was the only child to two teachers , who later devoted their lives to caring for orphaned children .

After finishing school in 1925 , ambitious Mrs Self found a job as a personnel officer for a wool mill in Rochdale , where she worked for several years .
She moved to Wiltshire in the early 1930s , to continue her career at Avon Rubber in Melksham , and soon met her husband Roland at a hunt ball .
The happy couple settled at his farm in Lacock where she was a farmer 's wife while raising their two children , Chris and John .
Her son John opened the garden centre on a disused field in 1972 , but when he emigrated two years later and Roland passed away , Mrs Self and Christopher took over .
She said : " It was only after my husband passed away and John left the garden centre that I thought of working there .
" I was 64 then , and would never have imagined carrying on for this long . "
Under their management the business expanded rapidly and the two garden centres are now among the biggest of their kind in the South West .
Thirty - five years later , she still drives her red Mini the short drive to the centre for 9 am - and often works a 48 - hour week .
She has never taken a driving test because she began driving in the early 1930s before the statutory test was introduced .
Mrs Self , who has 11 great - grandchildren , still enjoys driving to Chippenham and Bath for shopping trips .
" I 'm not finding it as easy as I did in my younger days , but I can still do the administration side , although I 've had to give up the practical work , " she said .
" My son got me a little buggy to go around on , but I do n't use it much .
I like to walk around the store and talk to everyone .
Scroll down for more ...
" I know all the staff , and have only taken a few days off since we opened 35 years ago .
" I drive to work , but to be honest I 've never taken a test .
The first car I drove was my late husband 's in about 1935 . "
Mrs Self still finds time to pursue her two hobbies - the local church , St Cyriac 's in Lacock , and the Chippenham Floral Society of which she is vice - president .
She professes to have no health secrets , but said : " I have no secrets whatsoever , except that I have never smoked .
" I eat what I like , and like to have a whisky and ginger in the evenings , but that 's the only alcohol I have . "
The local church held a special communion service for Mrs Self 's birthday , and she will be treated to a party for family and friends on Saturday evening .
She said : " I am really looking forward to the party .
For some reason , so much has been made of it .
It seems other people have got more excited about it than me !
" I do n't really see what the fuss is about . "
WAKEFIELD -
The summer reading feats of Lynne Bimmler 's sixth - grade class are proudly chronicled on the St. Joseph 's School website .
" The sixth grade reads an average of 7.5 books each with many students in double digits , " says a note on the class page .
" Of course , Harry Potter was a popular choice . "
But last month , students found that their favorite series had " disapparated " from the school library , after St. Joseph 's pastor , the Rev. Ron Barker , removed the books , declaring that the themes of witchcraft and sorcery were inappropriate for a Catholic school .
" He said that he thought most children were strong enough to resist the temptation , " said one mother who asked that her name not be used because she did not want her family to be singled out .
" But he said it 's his job to protect the weak and the strong . "
The removal at St. Joseph's is the first reported instance that the wildly popular series has been banned in the Bay State , according to the American Library Association .
But British author J.K. Rowling 's series , which many educators credit with inspiring a generation of children to pick up a book , has been as controversial as it has been popular .
Groups in at least 17 other states have tried to ban the books since the first one was published in 1998 , prompting the library association last year to name the Harry Potter collection " the most challenged books of the 21st century . "
" Most of the controversy is centered around the witchcraft and occult themes , " said Deborah Caldwell , who directs the office of intellectual freedom for the association .
" But there are others who say the books model disrespect for adults . "
Barker declined an interview yesterday , saying through his secretary that the removal of the books " is an in - house situation . "
The decision has angered some parents at St. Joseph's .
" I 'm upset it was done in the first place , and I 'm upset it was done without talking to anyone about it , " said Rick Hudson , who has sent all three of his children to the school .
But not everyone interviewed at the school yesterday was against the banning .
" I think the spirit of what he 's doing is the right thing , " said a mother who asked that her name not be used .
" I believe he is sincerely interested in the children 's well - being . "
" We send our kids here for a reason , " she added .
The Catholic Church has no formal policy on the books .
This summer , the US Conference of Catholic Bishops rated the most recent movie , " Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , " appropriate for adults and adolescents .
Though Massachusetts is thought of as a bastion of liberal thought today , the state has a long history of banning books .
In 1650 , William Pynchon 's " The Meritorius Price of Our Redemption " was publicly burned because colony leaders considered it too critical of the Puritan religion .
In 1878 , the New England Watch and Ward Society was founded to ban books , fight pornography , and " watch and ward off evildoers . "
At the height of the society 's power , in the 1920s and 1930s , controversial books at the Boston Public Library were kept in a locked room , and the police vice squad arrested anyone selling works considered offensive .
As a result , Boston led the nation in censorship based on moral grounds .
Later , publishers actively sought to have books " banned in Boston " to increase sales in the rest of the country .

Israel 's top secret sites on Google Earth
Israel 's most top secret security installations have been jeopardized by a new version of Google Earth , Israeli military experts say .
Satellite photographs of the sites , downloaded from Google Earth , were published last week on the front page of Israel 's largest - selling newspaper .
The latest version of the popular Internet mapping tool clearly shows sites viewed by the government as sensitive - such as the nation 's classified nuclear research station in the Negev Desert city of Dimona , the headquarters of the Mossad spy agency , Israeli air force bases , the location of the Arrow missile defense system and the central military headquarters and Defense Ministry compound in Tel Aviv .
Yediot Ahronot , the Israeli daily that published the photographs on its front page , said the upgraded Web site is an " asset " to enemy states and a " treasure " to terrorists .
Israel has spent decades and millions of dollars hiding these sites from public view .
All are heavily guarded round - the - clock , and the location of the Mossad headquarters is a closely guarded secret .
Reporters in Israel are forbidden from photographing or revealing any details about these locations under strict military censorship .
Israeli government and security officials refused to comment on the photographs .
But a former military intelligence officer , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said : " Anything I say will be counterproductive .
I think I 'll avoid that issue completely . "
But Professor Gerald Steinberg , chairman of the political science department at Bar - Ilan University in Ramat Gan , disagrees .
He says Israel has been prepared for the new Google Earth images , which he says do not endanger Israel 's security .
" Israel has had 10 years to prepare for this , " said Steinberg , who helped draft an agreement with the United States limiting satellite resolution imagery .
" It was the Clinton administration 's policy to make available high - resolution imaging .
Israel was granted a cushion which for clear security reasons does not put all the available information on the Internet .
" The satellite pictures were available before now to anyone with a few thousand dollars .
They are not real - time pictures , and they were not taken yesterday .
I do n't think this is a major change in security . "
The new high - resolution images , made available to Google Earth users last week , consist of one pixel per 2.4 square yards .
Until now , previous images of Israel were limited to one pixel per 12 to 24 yards .
Cordy Griffiths , a Google spokesperson in London , said the images were upgraded last week in line with a Google Earth policy of improving its service to users .
But Griffiths said all Google Earth images are bought from commercial satellite imaging companies and governed by the U.S. - Israel agreement .
" These new images fall within the law , " said Griffiths .
" It is higher resolution than the imagery we had before , but it is freely available material that we buy from third parties .
The onus is on them to check that everything is legal . "
Griffiths preferred not to answer whether Israeli officials have complained to Google since the new images were posted .
" We would be happy to discuss any concerns the Israeli government might have , " she said .
" None of the images have been changed since the imagery update for Israel in Google Earth last week . "
Griffiths also denied reports that Google images of India were deliberately blurred or distorted to protect security installations in that country .
" Google does not intentionally degrade or distort image quality .
However , we use the imagery that comes to us from our data suppliers , some of which includes clearly blurred or degraded imagery .
For example , an airbase in the Netherlands , the vice president 's residence in Washington , D.C. , " she said .
According to Israeli experts , the photographs in question are a year or two years old , and clearly show the layout of top - secret buildings .
The photograph of the nuclear plant at Dimona shows the approach roads , internal walkways and individual buildings in a facility that is off - limits and hidden behind electric fences with large warnings signs and a complex array of cameras and other security devices .
The images also include Camp Rabin , the heavily guarded defense headquarters in central Tel Aviv that is surrounded by anti-terrorist blockades , a high wall and buildings with bomb - proof windows .
It contains the underground bunker from which Israel 's top generals command their military campaigns , as well as the offices of the prime minister , defense minister and Shin Bet secret service .
Moreover , the alleged Mossad headquarters , whose location is a highly protected secret , was identified and labeled by a Google Earth user .
" This contains a stock of information in which any intelligence body would be willing to invest a great deal of money and effort in order to get its hands on it , " said Alex Fishman , Yediot Ahronot security correspondent .
" Locating sensitive strategic and security facilities in Israel is a major objective for countries like Iran and Syria . "
But political scientist Steinberg recalls similar fears when the first satellite photos of Dimona were declassified by the United States some 10 years ago .
" There was concern this would have a negative impact on Israeli security , " he said .
" It does n't seem to have given any information to anyone that was used to carry out attacks . "
( CNN ) -- President Bush blasted the Democratic - controlled Congress on Tuesday for having " the worst record in 20 years . "
" Congress is not getting its work done , " Bush said , flanked by members of the Republican House leadership .
" The House of Representatives has wasted valuable time on a constant stream of investigations , and the Senate has wasted valuable time on an endless series of failed votes to pull our troops out of Iraq . "
Bush criticized Congress for not being able to send " a single appropriations bill " to him .
" They have n't seen a bill they could not solve without shoving a tax hike into it , " he said .
Democrats quickly fired back .
Jim Manley , senior aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , said , " Taking advice from President Bush about fiscal responsibility and getting things done for the American people is like taking hunting lessons from Dick Cheney .
Neither is a very good idea . "
Rep. Rahm Emanuel , D - Illinois , issued a statement saying , " President Bush 's rally this morning reminds us that congressional Republicans remain ready and willing to rubber - stamp the Bush agenda :
No to children 's health care ; no to a new direction in Iraq ; and no to investing in America 's future .
The White House and congressional Republicans want to continue the status quo . "
Bush said the Senate was " wasting valuable time " by taking up the children 's health insurance bill , which he had earlier vetoed .
Watch Bush describe what he thinks Congress is doing wrong »
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D - Maryland , issued a statement calling Bush " the biggest obstacle " to extending health coverage to " 10 million low - income , working - class American children . "
Hoyer said GOP
House leaders need to " stop posing for pictures , and sit down with Democrats and Republicans in Congress who are working together to extend coverage to our children . "
The State Children 's Health Insurance Program measure passed in the House last week would expand the program by nearly $ 35 billion over five years , the same as the measure Bush vetoed on October 3 .
Bush had proposed adding $ 5 billion to the program , and said the version he vetoed would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded , state - run program .
Democratic leaders said the new version addresses Republican objections by tightening restrictions on illegal immigrants receiving SCHIP benefits ; capping the income levels of families that qualify for the program ; and preventing adults from receiving benefits .
The program currently covers about 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid , the federal health insurance program for the poor , but who can't afford private insurance .
Democrats want to extend the program to another 4 million , paying for it with a 61 - cent - per - pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes .
Bush said Congress knows the current version of the children 's health bill " does not have a chance , " to get enough votes to override another veto .
Hoyer accused Bush of breaking a promise he made in 2004 to extend coverage under the SCHIP program .
" Now , Congress must do what the president said he would do , " he said in his statement .
The Senate could vote on the bill as early as Tuesday .
Bush also threatened to veto a " three - bill pileup . "
" There are now reports that Congressional leaders may be considering combining the Veterans and Department of Defense appropriations bills , and then add a bloated labor , health and education spending bill to both of them , " he said .
" Congress should pass each bill one at a time in a fiscally responsible manner , " he said .
Bush also urged Congress to send him a " clean defense appropriations bill and a war supplemental bill . "
" They ought to get me a bill that funds among other things bullets and body armor , " he said .
Bush also criticized Congress for trying to " hold hostage " funding for troops .
" It would be irresponsible to not give our troops the resources they need to get their job done because Congress was unable to get its job done , " he said .
Hoyer 's release said Bush 's comments on appropriations bills and fiscal responsibility " ring hollow . "
" The fact is , this administration has pursued the most fiscally irresponsible policies in American history , turning record surpluses into record deficits and adding more than $ 3 trillion to the national debt , " he said .
" Democrats are the party of fiscal responsibility today because we believe our government must pay for the things it purchases and not force our children to pay our bills .
The fight over 2008 appropriations bills is not a fight over spending .
It is a fight over priorities . "

Chimps share many traits that we consider to be uniquely human , but now a new study suggests that the menopause really does set humans apart from other apes .
A detailed look at long - term fertility data from six populations of chimpanzees , compared with similar data from populations of hunter - gatherer humans , shows that both chimp and human birth rates have similar patterns of reproductive decline after the age of 40 .
But where chimp survival drops along with fertility , humans stop reproducing and continue to live for a long time .
Some chimps in their 40s are in fact better at reproducing than humans at that age .
And contrary to the general case in humans , in chimps old females are preferred by males .
“ Human life history is in fact one of the most radical departures from the apes , ” says Melissa Emery Thompson , at Harvard University , Cambridge , Massachusetts , US , who led the research .

Aged mums
“ We live longer than expected for our size , we have vastly higher reproductive costs , yet manage to reproduce much faster , we mature very slowly , and we have this peculiar post - reproductive period that distinguishes us from most other mammals . ”
Emery Thompson gathered data from colleagues working on wild chimps at sites across Africa , and compared fertility patterns with that of human foragers – the Kung people of Botswana , and Aché of Paraguay .
Their finding that birth rates of both chimps and humans decline after 40 suggests that the “ biological clock ” is a feature that has been conserved over the course of human evolution .
Healthy chimps over 40 reproduced quite well , the team found .
And whereas when a woman over 60 has children after IVF it makes headline news , it is not unusual for old chimps to give birth .
“ Females in the wild and in captivity have given birth in their 50s and the oldest living captive female , who is about 69 , gave birth past the age of 60 , ” says Emery Thompson .
One wild chimp , called Auntie Rose , was fertile until she died aged 63 , and still had males fighting over her , she notes .
Sexy but bald
“ Male chimpanzees are consistently more sexually interested in older females , even those like Auntie Rose who was nearly bald , ” says Emery Thompson .
“ This is a definite difference from humans . ”
Male chimps might prefer older females as their age might be a good indication of genetic fitness .
As to why evolution has not favoured any extension of human reproduction that would complement our extended life , Emory Thompson says that is an open question , though grandmothers in hunter - gatherer societies bring in more calories than they actually require .
Women with living mothers have higher birth rates than those without , supporting the idea that “ grandmothering ” may be more genetically profitable than having children in late life .
Apart from humans , only some species of whales have an extended period of post - reproductive life that could be called menopausal .
Pilot whales stop breeding at around 40 , for example , and live for several decades longer .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Investment professionals ' " shortsightedness " led them to make fundamental errors that led to the mortgage crisis and credit meltdown , St. Louis Federal Reserve President William Poole said Wednesday .
In a speech to financial planners , Poole detailed five key mistakes that borrowers and lenders made that have pushed the economy to the brink of recession .
“ ' I can understand the mistakes many financially naïve borrowers made but have a hard time understanding how so many investment professionals could have been so wrong . ' ” — William Poole , St. Louis Fed
In brief remarks on the economy , Poole said he believed growth would continue this year , thus avoiding a recession .
" The fundamentals of our economy remain strong ... and 2008 looks to be a year of rising growth , " he said in his prepared remarks .
Poole is seen as an influential member of the Federal Open Market Committee , but does not vote on monetary - policy decisions this year .
Last year , he voted in favor of all the FOMC 's rate cuts .
As Poole spoke , another big Wall Street firm joined the ranks of those forecasting a recession this year .
Jan Hatzius , chief economist at Goldman Sachs , said in a note to clients that he now sees a short , mild recession , with the jobless rate rising to 6.25 % and the Federal Reserve forced to cut interest rates to 2.50 % , down from 4.25 % currently .
The bulk of Poole 's speech was devoted to the need for better financial education -- not only for borrowers but also for investment professionals .
Poole said five key mistakes were made , and professionals made four of them .
" I can understand the mistakes many financially naïve borrowers made but have a hard time understanding how so many investment professionals could have been so wrong , " he said in the prepared text .
" Many observers point to greed , but I prefer a different explanation .
Shortsightedness rather than greed explains actions that led to losses of tens of billions of dollars and the failure of many financial firms . "
Poole 's list of five key mistakes :
Borrowers took on mortgages they could not afford .
Mortgage brokers put too many people in unsuitable mortgages .
They knew , for instance , that adjustable - rate mortgages probably would n't be right for many borrowers if interest rates rose as the market expected .
Investment banks jeopardized their reputations by securitizing mortgages without doing due diligence on the underlying assets , many of which were based on " inadequate or spurious information . "
Rating agencies put their stamp of approval on securitized mortgages without considering whether AAA ratings could be maintained if house prices fell .
Investors scooped up those securities without doing adequate analysis first .
" Investors too readily accepted the AAA ratings at face value , " Poole said .
" A reach for yield with inadequate attention to risk in another basic lesson that apparently cannot be relearned often enough .
" There are no new lessons here , " he said .
" The mistakes that brought us to this point have been made before . "

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Orthomolecular Medicine News Service , October 30 , 2007
Doctors Say , Raise the RDAs Now ( OMNS October 30 , 2007 ) The US Recommended Daily Allowance / Dietary Reference Intakes are too low and most should be raised immediately , says an independent panel of physicians , academics and researchers .
In a statement this week , the Independent Vitamin Safety Review Panel said :  Government - sponsored nutrient recommendations , such as the US RDA / DRIs , are not keeping pace with recent progress in nutrition research .
While current official recommendations for vitamin A , iron , calcium , and some other nutrients are generally adequate , the public has been asked to consume far too little of many other key nutrients .
Inadequate intake , and inadequate standards to judge intake , have resulted in widespread nutrient inadequacy , chronic disease , and an undernourished but overweight population . 
Citing a large number of physician reports and clinical studies , the IVSRP called for substantial increases in daily intake of the B- vitamins , vitamins C , D and E , and the minerals selenium , zinc , magnesium and chromium .
 Raising the RDA / DRI will save lives and improve health ,  the Panel said .
 Clinical and sub-clinical nutrient deficiencies are among the main causes of our societys greatest healthcare problems .
Cancer , cardiovascular disease , mental illness , and other diseases are caused or aggravated by poor nutrient intake .
The good news is that scientific evidence shows that adequately high consumption of nutrients helps prevent these diseases . 
Specifically , the IVSRP called for a new standard , an Optimum Health Requirement , recommending daily adult consumption of nutrients in the following higher quantities : Vitamins B - 1
Thiamine : 25 mg
B - 2 Riboflavin : 25 mg
B - 3 Niacinamide : 300 mg
B - 6 Pyridoxine : 25 mg
Folic acid : 2,000 mcg
B - 12 Cobalamin : 500 mcg
C : 2,000 mg
D3 : 1,500 IU
E as natural mixed tocopherols : 200 IU Minerals Zinc : 25 mg
Magnesium : 500 mg
Selenium : 200 mcg
Chromium : 200 mcg
The Panel concluded by stating : " In the past , over - conservative government - sponsored standards have encouraged dietary complacency .
People have been led to believe that they can get all the nutrients they need from a ' balanced diet ' of processed foods .
That is not true .
For adequate vitamin and mineral intake , a diet of unprocessed , whole foods , along with the intelligent use of nutritional supplements , is more than just a good idea : it is essential . "

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China is to relocate at least 4 million more people from the Three Gorges Dam reservoir area in the next 10 to 15 years to protect its “ ecological safety , ” Xinhua news agency said on Thursday .
The Three Gorges Dam Project discharges water to lower the water level in the reservoir , due to excessive rainfall upstream of the Yangtze River , in Yichang , central China 's Hubei province July 22 , 2007 .
China is to relocate at least 4 million more people from the Three Gorges Dam reservoir area in the next 10 to 15 years to protect its " ecological safety " , Xinhua news agency said on Thursday .
REUTERS / China Daily
The $ 25 billion dam near Chongqing , in southwest China , is the world ’s largest hydropower project , but even senior officials who have defended the project as an engineering wonder now warn that areas around the dam are paying a heavy environmental cost .
They cite erosion and landslides on steep hills around the dam , conflicts over land shortages and “ ecological deterioration caused by irrational development . ”
The dam , whose construction flooded 116 towns and hundreds of cultural sites and displaced 1.4 million people , is a work in progress , but state media have said it could be completed by the end of 2008 , just after the Beijing Olympic Games .
“ More than 4 million people currently living in northeast and southwest Chongqing , where the Three Gorges Reservoir extends for 600 km ( 360 miles ) , would be encouraged to resettle on the urban outskirts about an hour ’s bus ride from downtown Chongqing , ” Xinhua said , quoting a report on the on sina.com news site .
No details about the relocation were available , but Yu Yuanmu , vice mayor of Chongqing , was quoted by Xinhua as saying the ecological safety of the area was at risk from the growing population .
Environmentalists have long criticized the project , saying silt trapped behind the dam is causing erosion and warning that the dam ’s reservoir will turn into a cesspool of raw sewage and industrial chemicals backing onto Chongqing .
The State Council had approved a plan which was of “ great importance to the environmental protection ” of the area , Jiang Yong , director of the Chongqing development plan bureau , was quoted by the China Daily as saying .
“ One of the key elements in Chongqing ’s new development plan is to further our efforts to protect the environment of the reservoir area since the environment here has changed greatly due to the Three Gorges project and massive population relocation . ”
Relocation has also been a flashpoint for unrest over the dam .
Many object to being moved away from their communities and livelihoods , and petitioners have accused local governments of pocketing much of their compensation .
Bestselling writer Jonathan Lethem -- author of one of my favorite novels Motherless Brooklyn -- has put together an offer that 's hard to beat .
He 'll sell you a story for a book , play , or screenplay for a mere $ 1 .
Then you can take the story idea , make it your own , and move it in new and unexpected directions .
This is obviously not a get - rich - quick scheme .
It 's actually more about bringing Larry Lessig 's notion of free culture to the literary domain .
You can get more on Lethem 's ideas here , but the upshot is that Lethem , being a fan of " adaptations , appropriations , collage , and sampling , " wants artists to " make material free and available for [ creative ] reuse . "
( Some of this thinking informs a recent piece in Harper 's called " The ecstasy of influence : A plagiarism . " )
The initiative , which he calls The Promiscuous Materials Project , offers a step in the right direction .

ThinkFilm is releasing Alex Gibney 's documentary " Taxi To The Dark Side " and submitted a poster for MPAA approval which featured a photo of two soldiers leading away a handcuffed and hooded man .
The MPAA rejected it as being " not suitable for audiences of all ages " .
The hypocrisy of this , in the face of posters for horror / slasher flicks like " Saw " and " Hostel " , is astounding .
Censorship pure and simple .
The photo used in the proposed poster is derived from an actual photograph which the army also tried to censor .
The MPAA has also rejected a one - sheet for Roadside Attractions " The Road To Guantanamo " which featured a hooded man hanging by his wrists from handcuffs .
MPAA message ?
Torture for entertainment is suitable for all ages .
Torture examined in a documentary is not .
Think Film is appealing .

WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
The bank is the UK 's central bank
The Bank of England is doing it and it's not the only one .
So is the US Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Canada .
In total £ 54bn ( $ 110 bn ) will be made available to world money markets by the five central banks , with £ 10bn up for grabs in the UK .
The ECB has made £ 250 bn available ( $ 500bn ) .
It 's known as an auction of funds and it's the first time the banks have joined forces in such a way .
But what is the auction all about ?
THE ANSWER
When central banks offer cash loans to help banks deal with a credit crisis
An auction of funds is when the world 's central banks offer cash loans to help banks deal with a credit crisis .
It 's supposed to ease the strain on the system and help business to continue as usual .
Banks normally borrow from each other or borrow funds from the money markets when they have a mismatch between borrowers and cash .
But the money can dry up if some banks start to hoard cash to guard against uncertainty in the world 's financial markets .
Stigma
Institutions are currently nervous about lending money because of heavy losses linked to problems in the US mortgage market .
No one knows how big the losses are so banks want to hoard money against future losses , and they also fear lending to their competitors who may also be holding big , undisclosed losses .
As a result banks are unable to borrow in the money markets or elsewhere at a cheap rate of interest .
It also means that any cuts in interest rates made by central banks are not passed on to individuals and companies .
Other central banks are offering funds
Banks with high loan - to - deposit ratios , such as Northern Rock , have been hardest hit , as they rely heavily on money market funding which has now dried up .
Offering to inject the cash into money markets by auction is an attempt by the Bank of England to reduce the interest rates banks are charging each other and encourage them to start lending to each other more readily .
" One of the Bank 's two core purposes is to maintain the stability of the financial system , " says a Bank spokesperson .
" It has to make sure the overall system is safe and secure and that threats to financial stability are detected and reduced . "
BBC business editor Robert Peston says just the announcement of the auction has injected a bit more confidence in markets , but it is limited .
Untouched
" By way of evidence , the interest rates at which bankers are prepared to lend to each other have come down , " he says .
They fell from 6.627 % to 6.514 % .
The money on offer does not exist before the auction .
It 's created for the purpose of lending it out to banks and electronically transfers to their accounts .
When the banks pay it back it is usually worked into the bank 's accounts but can just disappear again .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ?
aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
The amount of money up for grabs is announced before an auction and at what rate it must be repaid and over what period .
The £ 10bn on offer in the UK today will have a three - month repayment period .
Banks then bid for as much as they like of the total available .
They put in a bid saying how much of it they want and what interest rate they are prepared to pay above the minimum rate set by the bank .
The Bank then allocates the money to the highest until it has run out .
In this case , the Bank had bids for the whole £ 10bn .
It allocated 75 % of the money at the low interest rate of 5.39 % and the rest at higher rates .
There is always chance that the money could be left untouched .
It can be an expensive way of borrowing and there is also a stigma attached to drawing on such funding , as it shows a bank needs to get hold of extra funds .

Search engine giant Google Inc. says it's " concerned " about efforts by Rogers Communications Inc. to insert branded corporate messages into third - party websites , a move critics say is a case of a Internet service provider overstepping its boundaries .
Toronto - based Rogers confirmed yesterday that it has spent the past few weeks testing a new technology that allows it to post Web - based notices to its Internet subscribers when they are approaching their monthly data limits .
The messages carry Rogers ' name and logo and appear in the body of Web pages in place of original content , not as a pop - up window .
One such notice , posted online , showed the Rogers content occupying the top third of Google 's normally sparse search page .
The search giant was not impressed with the makeover .
" We are concerned about these reports , " Google said in an emailed statement to the Toronto Star .
" As a general principle , we believe that maintaining the Internet as a neutral platform means that carriers should n't be able to interfere with Web content without users ' permission , " the Google statement said .
" We are in the process of contacting the relevant parties to bring this to a quick resolution . "
Some bloggers noted the Rogers notice on Google 's search page seemed more like free advertising than a customer - service bulletin , since it suggested the user " upgrade to another level of service which provides higher usage limits and speeds by visiting rogers.com . "
Critics say Rogers ' move , though perhaps well - intentioned , could set a dangerous precedent that says it 's okay for the companies that pipe the Internet into people 's homes and offices to exercise control over their subscribers ' activity online .
" It 's a very slippery slope , " said Philippa Lawson , the executive director of the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic .
Lawson said a more appropriate way for Rogers to communicate with its customer base is through email , a service that Rogers also provides its Internet subscribers .
But Taanta Gupta , a Rogers spokesperson , said the company does not have email addresses for all of its subscribers .
She compared the effort to messages sent to people 's cellphones when they are about to exceed their monthly airtime allowances .
" We 've done customer research on the technology and the feedback was good .
So now we 're trialling it . "
Rogers ' experiment is being touted by some as more evidence of the need for legislation that enshrines the so - called principle of " Net neutrality , " which basically says that all Web content is created equal .
Net neutrality proponents say they are concerned some companies want more control over access to the Internet 's infrastructure to reap more money from their investments – particularly as consumers flock to bandwidth - hogging Internet applications such as file sharing and video .

That could lead to extra charges on content creators and Web - based business such as Google , eBay and Amazon.com in order to secure premium access to subscribers – a move some say will stifle innovation on the Web since only deep - pocketed companies will be able to afford the necessary access .
It 's not the first time Rogers has been accused of messing with Internet traffic .

As I keep harking on , I moved to Linux .
I ’m happy and things are getting a lot more routine for me .
I ’ve been seeing a lot of fake screenshots this week for Windows 7 and it made me think what I would need from the next version of Windows to migrate back .
While I realise Microsoft could probably live without my business , Linux really does hold the floor for desktop progress over the next few years , with MS and Apple both sitting it out until late - 2009 / 2010 .
In that time , there are going to be three or four major Ubuntu releases , all upping the tempo of Linux in the desktop role .
MS does have the most marketshare but it has fallen into last place in terms of features , stability and performance .
On a personal note , when I ’ve seen these fake Windows pictures ( example right ) , I have to admit part of me would hop back to Vista , XP or even Win2 k in a heartbeat .
Linux does still have issues , and being the config - prodder that I am with the perverse hardware that I have , I run into issues and undoubtedly spend a few hours here and there hacking around .
You did n’t have that choice in Windows .
It either worked or did n’t and you had to accept that and just get on with things .
But the vast majority of my psyche loves the freedom of Linux , loves the community spirit and the overwhelming scent of progress each time I download updates — rather than Windows ’ asthmatic excuse for a restart .
So what could Windows do to regain my trust and custom ?
1. Divorce the media companies — Dump DRM
DRM is always a hot topic but I ’m not citing it here just because it ’s fashionable .
I used Vista for just under a year and know how much the whole system lags as a result of MS taking XP and wrapping its around a cattle - prod that fires when something is n’t perfect .
The argument for keeping trusted - system - DRM was to keep content providers happy , presumably to get their contracts from the big media firms at lower rates …
But why should I be punished if I ’m not using that media ?
Hell , why is every user expected to illegally copy any media they put in their computer ?
It does n’t make sense .
Get rid of it and we can talk .
2. Software repositories
If you ’re a Windows user , you might not be familiar with the Linux way of downloading , installing and upgrading software .
On many distributions , you can use one tool ( graphical or command - line — your choice ) to download your software from your distribution ’s servers and install it automatically .
Additionally , all your installed programs are checked for updates each day and if any are available , they ’re downloaded and installed in the same fashion .
It ’s absolutely epic .
In Windows , unless it has auto - updates built into the particular software , you install something and it lingers until you go and check the website on your own .
This is bad .
This is how desktop users get hacked open — they ’ll install something like Winamp , a few months later somebody will find an exploit for the old version and before you know it , that user ’s PC is sending out spam and all sorts of other crap .
You might say that this would cost MS millions , but they could make money by allowing software vendors to sell software through their repository ( a bit like Steam for applications ) .
Centralised software distribution is too powerful a feature not to use .
MS should definitely adopt it .
3 . Introduce a flexible filesystem ( with modules )
Admittedly this is n’t for the average user but in Linux , I enjoy a very flexible filesystem arrangement .
I have disks , sftp servers and samba shares mounted all over my system , where I like .
I have a directory in my home folder that is actually on my Linux server on the other side of the planet , making it oh - so - easy to upload images to the blog .
Windows has a stagnant , device - orientated filesystem that just does n’t cut it ( for me ) .
It works but it ’s a pain in the rear end when you ca n’t treat any filesytem like any other .
It needs ( nice ) symbolic linking , the ability to mount a samba ( that ’s Windows File Share to Windows users ) under your home directory as a normal folder .
Additionally , Microsoft need to add modules ( and allow for third party modules ) to allow reading and writing to a lot more partition types .
I now have no NTFS drives .
My USB and flash media are FAT32 but all my hard disks are ext2 or ext3 and there ’s no way in hell that I ’m going to convert everything back , again .
4. Simplify purchase and upgrades with just one desktop SKU
Windows 2000 only had a " professional " desktop varient .
XP brought with it an additional " home " Stock Keeping Unit ( SKU ) .
Vista multiplied like a nasty bacterium , spawning endless variants , bringing few differences but with massive price differences .
Home Basic , Home Premium , Business , Enterprise and Ultimate .
There ’s also a super - basic version doing the rounds in the developing world .
I see the marketing rationale — " ultimate " sounds a billion and five times better than " basic " — but it ’s just infuriating when you want the business edition and you also have the cheek to want the media centre functionality ?
Yeah , you have to buy another Vista license ( in the guise of a full upgrade package ) — originally 170 /$ 350 but now just 120/$ 245 .
Bargain !
And , hey , you could also drop the price a little too .
There are other revenue schemes that you could exploit in order to drive your seat cost down .
Think of your users for once , Microsoft .
Put everything in one package like Linux and OSX .
5 . Overhaul its standard utilities
I know the job of Calculator and Notepad are basic , but that does n’t mean that the Windows 95 version was perfect .
Most of the standard " applications " that ship with Windows are dated and are rarely used in serious circumstances , rather replaced with better tools .
In Linux , the best tool is chosen for the job and if it does n’t keep up with the competition , it ’s replaced .
Microsoft needs to spend less time mucking around making Texas - Hold - Em games for Ultimate users and improve the apps that everybody has to use at some point .
6 . Rip out the registry
The Windows registry is one of Windows ’ largest single point of failure .
In short , if it breaks , your computer is broken .
As Jeff Atwood wrote a few months ago :
That ’s why every single registry editing tip you ’ll ever find starts with a big fat screaming disclaimer about how you can break your computer with regedit .
Its main purpose is to centralise settings for both Windows and all the installed applications .
The problem with this : it ’s idiotic .
Why would you want to separate your user - files from your config files ?
You would n’t — it ’s only like this because Vista , like XP , like 2000 , like all the other nt versions , is still woefully dependant on the single - user designs from earlier Windows times .
Jeff also points out that the registry is n’t self - cleaning ( probably a good thing ) and you end up with piles and piles of crap building up .
You can resort to registry cleaners but they can sometimes do damage .
The silly thing is , there is a user - space file - registry in Vista — but it ’s dependant on application creators on implementing it .
Microsoft should just rip out the reg , perhaps with a redirector ( relocating faux entries to and from file ) for legacy support .
7. Better multi-monitor support
Support for multiple monitors is there , and has been since Win2 k but you ca n’t have more than one taskbar ( ie. one for the other screens ) .
You do , however , have the lucky opportunity to purchase UltraMon .
Do n’t get me wrong : it ’s an excellent piece of software but the problem it solves should n’t exist in the first place .
It ’s also not as good as a proper taskbar .
This is n’t an issue in Linux .
In conclusion … Microsoft have had years to seriously innovate on the desktop .
Some would argue that XP was that big step but 2000 -> XP was a tiny jump in functionality , security and stability compared to Win98->2000 .
For the sake of the Windows brand , Windows 7 needs to kick ass ; otherwise it ’s going to end up dying off as people find that there are already better operating systems out there .
How much of this is essential to win back my allegiance ?
Certainly the first four ( combined ) would woo me a little but if it was still let down by poor apps and the same buggy registry that ’s been floating around since 1995 , I ’d stick with Linux .
A well - known writer walked into a producer ’s house and said to the producer that he had come up with a great act .
The producer , intrigued , told the writer to briefly describe his idea .
“ Well , ” said the writer , “ I have an idea for a political party who claims to be against the war in Iraq , but wo n’t do anything about it .
The party will also claim to be against torture , but wo n’t do anything about that either .
In fact , they will be swept into power precisely because of their public opposition to both of those things , but privately they will be informed of possible acts of torture performed by our government , and they wo n’t say anything about it .
At any rate , they continue their two - faced behavior - publicly opposing the war and torture , but privately being apparently content with it , until the end of their congressional term , when they will all gather together on the floor of the House , where they will all publicly shit on the original version of the Constitution , on loan from the National Archives . ”
The producer looked at the writer , and said , “ That is really quite disgusting .
What do you call the act ? ”
The writer responded , “ The Democrats . ”
PARIS , Nov. 26  The European agriculture commissioner , Mariann Fischer Boel , warned farm ministers on Monday that Europe ’s resistance to importing genetically modified products like livestock feed was contributing to the rising cost of raising pigs and chickens and could pose a threat to the meat industry .
Her warning , made during a closed - door lunch in Brussels , highlighted renewed debate over whether Europe could afford to impose tougher rules on genetically modified products than other parts of the world .
Some European officials say the region should maintain its skeptical stance toward the technology on safety grounds , while others argue for a more pragmatic approach to enhance the region ’s competitiveness and help the agricultural sector .
Michael Mann , a spokesman for Ms. Fischer Boel , said Monday that the European Union ’s zero - tolerance policy toward genetically modified foods comes at “ potential major cost . ”
Terrorizing Ourselves
From now on , tighter security is the rule .
But how much of our freedom will we sacrifice ?
Two days after the attacks at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , Virginia Sloan realized that if the terrorists wanted to attack American freedoms , they had got somewhere .
" I was valet parking for dinner , and I had my hood and trunk and the inside of my car searched , " says Sloan , executive director of the Constitution Project , a legal - issues organization in Washington .
" Can we as Americans tolerate that ?
I think not . "
Maybe we can .
Americans are generally unfriendly to security measures that intrude too much on their privacy .
But that was before last week , before they saw the crematoriums in New York City and Washington and started to wonder if the next dive - bombing airliner could be aimed at them .
If ever there was a time when they might be receptive to trimming their accustomed freedoms , that time is now .
And whether they are receptive or not , the changes have already begun .
Long waits to cross the Canadian and Mexican borders were the rule last week , as vehicles and travelers were finecombed by border police .
Civil libertarians are bracing for an upsurge of " racial profiling " at airports targeting Arab Americans , or for an FBI investigation of the attacks that sucks in many innocent members of that group , or simply for a wave of hate crimes against them .
Emergencies have always been a time when the niceties of law have been most vulnerable to the demands of national security or national hysteria .
As Senate minority leader Trent Lott said last week , " When you 're in this type of conflict , when you 're at war , civil liberties are treated differently . "
World War II produced the internment camps for Japanese Americans , a development upheld in 1944 by the Supreme Court but later repudiated .
After the bombing at the federal building in Oklahoma City , the Immigration and Naturalization Service was authorized to establish a new court to consider the deportation of suspected alien terrorists , in which cases would be heard without the usual obligation to inform the accused of the evidence against them .
Now the Bush Administration is considering the establishment of special military tribunals .
Suspected terrorists could be tried without the ordinary legal constraints of American justice .
During World War II , German saboteurs were tried secretly that way in Washington , and those convicted were hanged 30 days later .
Just one day after last week 's attacks , the Senate also approved a provision expanding the circumstances under which law - enforcement agencies can force Internet service providers to hand over information about subscriber e-mails .
If the Federal Government were to monitor more e-mails , a key question would be whether it would hold on to them for some time or dispose of them almost at once , as it now does with the information obtained from instant background checks mandated by federal law for gun purchases .
Americans may be willing to let their e-mails pass one time through a sort of national filter that would screen for hints of terrorist activity .
They will be far more reluctant to allow the government to collect a national e-mail database .
Civil libertarians expect renewed calls for a national identification card .
The cards could have photographs and hard - to - falsify identifying information like handprint or retina data that could be read by scanners at , say , airline counters .
If cards were required for many common transactions renting a car , buying an airline ticket they would be useful for keeping track of criminals and terrorists .
Or you .
Eva Jefferson Paterson , executive director of the Lawyers ' Committee on Civil Rights Under Law in San Francisco , predicts that innocent citizens would be challenged constantly to produce their cards .
" You could be stopped by the police to prove you can walk down the street , " she says .
" Poor people and people of color would be stopped the most . "
There could also be stepped - up public surveillance .
At last year 's Super Bowl in Tampa , Fla. , law - enforcement officials secretly scanned spectators ' faces with surveillance cameras and instantly matched their faceprints against photographs of suspected terrorists and known criminals in computerized databases .
Facial - recognition technology might help , says Bruce Hoffman , vice president for external affairs at the Rand Corp. and a former adviser to the National Commission on Terrorism , but mostly after the fact , during an investigation .
And that means storing all the face data collected , something civil libertarians fear will allow the government to track any individual .
If systems were set up all over a city , you could be " checkpointed " by camera when you board a train , stop at a cash machine and enter a store or the place where you work .
" We are vulnerable , " says Hoffman , " and there 's a certain level of risk that we have to accept and live with .
To me , the cure can be far worse than the disease . "
Says Morton Halperin , senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations : " If you take both security and civil liberties seriously , you can find solutions that respect individual rights and privacy and still give the intelligence and law - enforcement agencies the scope that they need .
We had worked that out in terms of airports .
Nobody thinks you have the civil liberty to take knives on airplanes .
I do n't know who made the decision to let people bring knives on anyway , but it was certainly not civil libertarians . "

The US attorney ’s office and the FBI this week charged a California couple with shining a laser into the cockpit of a sheriff ’s department helicopter , a federal criminal complaint that could land them in jail for up to 20 years and earn them a $ 250,000 fine .
The federal criminal complaint was filed on December 13 , against Jared Dooley and Kendra Snow .
The complaint states that on November 8 , 2007 , at about 10:55 p.m. , a green laser beam illuminated the cockpit of a Kern County Sheriff ’s Department helicopter , which was flying at 500 feet during routine patrol in Bakersfield , California .
When the light hit the cockpit , it disoriented the Kern County Sheriff ’s pilot , causing pain and discomfort in his eyes for a couple of hours , the FBI said in a statement .
Despite the vision problems , the pilot and a tactical observer in the helicopter were able to pinpoint the origin of the laser beam at Dooley ’ house .
On November 27 , FBI and local police executed a federal search warrant , locating a hand - held green laser device in Dooley ’s pickup truck and a red laser device in his home .
Both Dooley and Snow later admitted they had used the green laser device on the night of the incident , the FBI stated .
Snow told investigating agents that she and Dooley were standing in the driveway on November 8 and “ taking turns shining the laser around watching the tracers in the sky . ”
Lasers pose a safety hazard to flight operations , the FBI said and between 1990 and 2005 there were over 400 of them .
The focused beams of a laser light remain powerful at extended viewing distances and can expose pilots to radiation levels above those considered to be flight safe .
Brief exposure to even a relatively low - powered laser beam can cause discomfort and temporary visual impairments , such as glare , flash blind , and afterimages .
The FBI noted that it is illegal to target aircraft and represents a danger to flight crews and , potentially , the public from an accident that could occur if a flight crew is impaired in its ability to safely operate its aircraft .
Many lasers are over 10 times more powerful than the typical red laser pointers used in the classroom or workplace and can cause significant damage to the eyes .
And there has been a rash of incidents recently .
· A 13 - year - old boy was arrested in November on suspicion of reckless endangerment after he allegedly pointed a green laser at a Phoenix Police Department helicopter , police said .
· Three police forces and the US Coast Guard on this month chased down a Boston - area man who faces the possibility of federal charges after allegedly pointing a hand - held laser beam at a helicopter .
· Last week a UK man was arrested after he almost caused a police helicopter to crash when he shone a laser into the pilot 's eyes .
The laser disabled the crew ’s night - vision lights .
TED Prize
The TED Prize was born out of the visions offered onstage at the TED Conference for how change can happen in the world , one idea at a time .
The TED Prize was first awarded in 2005 , to Robert Fischell ( who wished for new cures to brain disorders ) , Edward Burtynsky ( who wished for a global conversation about sustainability ) , and Bono ( who wished for a social movement of activism for Africa ) .
In the years after , the TED Prize was awarded to a diverse list of leaders , ranging from author Dave Eggers to oceanographer Sylvia Earle to space archaeologist Sarah Parcak to healthcare visionary Raj Panjabi .
TED
Prize wishes helped combat poverty , open dialogue on religious intolerance , inspire art in 150 countries and imagine the future of education .
The award
At its inception , the TED Prize award was $ 100,000 , along with full access to the TED community ’s range of talent and expertise .
In 2013 , it was expanded to a $ 1 million award , to help the winner quickly build capacity for carrying out their ambitious wish .
The award was designed to support the building of a global project 's core infrastructure , with people across the world adding their own collaborative action .
The wish
Imagine an inspiring , high - impact idea that could create ripples of change .
Each TED
Prize winner had that kind of ambitious wish — and the vision , pragmatism and leadership to make it come true .
Millions of people around the world helped carry forward their ideas , with many still active today .
The next chapter
With the aid of various alarm calls the Siberian jay bird species tells other members of its group what their main predators - ¬hawks ¬ - are doing .
The alarm calls are sufficient for Siberian jays to evince situation - specific fleeing behaviors , which enhances their chances of survival .
This discovery , being published by Uppsala University researcher Michael Griesser in the journal Current Biology , shows for the first time that animals can assess and communicate about the behavior of predators .
Many animal species are exposed daily to the risk of being killed by a predator .
Certain apes and marmots have developed specific alarm calls that communicate the category of predators or the distance of predators to other group members .
It has been proposed that this is an adaptation that helps them survive daily encounters with predators .
" But the risk a predator represents to its prey is also contingent on the behavior of the predator , so it would be an advantage for survival to be able to communicate whether the predators are in hunting mode or are full and contented , " explains Michael Griesser , a researcher at the Department of Ecology and Evolution at Uppsala University .
The findings of the study show that Siberian jays have different alarm calls for hawks that are sitting , searching for prey , or attacking .
With the help of a playback experiment in which the scientist played the various alarm calls for Siberian jays , he was able to demonstrate that the alarm call is sufficient to get Siberian jays to evince a situation - specific fleeing behavior .
Upon hearing the call that is given for sitting hawks , they fly up to the tops of trees and look for the hawk .
The attack call prompts them to flee to the closest refuge as quickly as possible and then to start to look for the hawk .
Playing the call that is given for hawks searching for prey gets the jays to flee to the nearest refuge and stay there without moving , for several minutes , to avoid being discovered by the hawk .
" These findings are astonishing and show for the first time that animals can assess and communicate about the behavior of their predators , and that not only mammals but also birds have developed advanced communication systems , " says Michael Griesser .
An earlier study of Siberian jays showed that parents protect their young but not unrelated group members with their alarm calls and that this extra protection leads to much lower odds that related group members will be taken by a hawk during their first winter .
Together with the new study , this shows for the first time that alarm calls actually do enhance the survival of other individuals .
Until now this was merely an assumption , even though this is a basic function of alarm calls .
" Since complex communication systems in the animal world were developed primarily in species that live in family groups , it appears that selection based on kinship is an important factor for the development of such systems in the animal world .
To be able to save the life of a related animal ultimately serves to further the animal 's own genes .
Perhaps this factor was also a key condition for our ancestors , who also lived in family groups , to be able to develop the capacity for language , " says Michael Griesser .
The US Congress has passed a measure to prevent people with a history of mental illness from buying guns .
The bill must be signed by the President George W Bush , and clarifies what mental health records can be used to help gun dealers decide whether to sell someone a firearm .
The bill is a response to the killings at Virginia Tech University in April when a student shot dead 32 people .
The US Congress hopes that this bill , with its emphasis on background checks on a national data base , could prevent something similiar happening again and help reduce the loss of life in a country where 30,000 people die from gun wounds every year .
If passed into law , it would be the first major new gun control measure in the US since the presidency of Bill Clinton a decade ago .

Mice discovered accidentally at the Wistar Institute in Pennsylvania have the seemingly miraculous ability to regenerate like a salamander , and even regrow vital organs .
Researchers systematically amputated digits and damaged various organs of the mice , including the heart , liver and brain , most of which grew back .
The results stunned scientists because if such regeneration is possible in this mammal , it might also be possible in humans .
The researchers also made a remarkable second discovery :
When cells from the regenerative mice were injected into normal mice , the normal mice adopted the ability to regenerate .
And when the special mice bred with normal mice , their offspring inherited souped - up regeneration capabilities .
The mice , known as the MRL strain , were specially bred to develop lupus .
But researchers do n't know why exactly the animals ' injuries heal so well .
" If we identified the molecules that allow mice that do n't regenerate to regenerate ... and I think we could be close to doing that , then I think the next step is to consider what these molecules would do in individuals , " said Ellen Heber - Katz , a professor of molecular and cellular oncogenesis at Wistar , located on the University of Pennsylvania campus in Philadelphia .
Heber - Katz discovered the strain in 1998 accidentally while working with mice specially bred for studying autoimmune diseases .
She had pierced holes in the ears of the genetically altered mice to distinguish them from a control group , but they healed quickly with no scarring .
She and her colleagues wanted to find out what other parts of this strain of mice would grow back , so they snipped off the tip of a tail , severed a spinal cord , injured the optic nerve and damaged various internal organs .
The incredible wound - healing they observed abruptly shifted the focus of Heber - Katz 's lab 's research from autoimmune disease to regenerative medicine .
The researchers began hunting for the specific genes that gave the mice their special powers .
They are focusing on three specific genes at the moment , but she suspects that many more likely contribute to the regenerative abilities .
While some amphibians can regrow body parts , mammals for the most part do not have that ability , making this a very special mouse indeed .
If the results can be translated to humans , it would be a dream come true for people who want to live forever .
" When those genes ( responsible for the mice regeneration ) are found , we can start to think about manipulating them in humans with drugs or ( later ) gene therapy , thereby enhancing our own regeneration , " said Aubrey de Grey , a longevity expert and editor of the scientific journal Rejuvenation Research .
Other labs have also begun to join the investigation .
The mice seem to exhibit regenerative capabilities similar to that of human fetuses in the first trimester , said Dr. Stephen Badylak , a surgery research professor and director of the Center for Pre-Clinical Tissue Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh 's McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine .
" It offers us insight into a more fetal - like healing response , where scar tissue is minimal and regeneration is abundant , " Badylak said .
" It 's a great model to examine healing mechanisms and use that information to see if we can stimulate the same thing to happen in people . "
Heber - Katz said she will soon publish her results on digit regrowth in a peer - reviewed medical journal .
Heber - Katz presented new data showing that the strain of mice can also grow back severed digits at the Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence conference in Cambridge , England .
( " Engineered negligible senescence " is a fancy term for life extension . )
Protests in the Pakistani city of Quetta against Rushdie 's award
Enlarge Image
Such actions are the root cause of terrorism , Religious Affairs Minister Ejaz - ul - Haq told parliament .
The minister later said he had not meant to condone or incite terrorism but stress its origins .
Pakistan 's parliament has condemned the knighthood .
Iran says it shows " Islamophobia " among British officials .
Mr ul - Haq was speaking during a session of Pakistan 's National Assembly in which it unanimously condemned Britain 's award of a knighthood to the author Salman Rushdie and demanded it be withdrawn .
His comments in the Urdu language caused uproar .
" If someone commits suicide bombing to protect the honour of the Prophet Mohammad , his act is justified , " he said , according to the translation by the Reuters news agency .
Sir Salman says he is thrilled by the honour
" If Britain does n't withdraw the award , all Muslim countries should break off diplomatic relations . "
Opponents accused
Mr ul - Haq of inciting violence .
Later he returned to the floor of the assembly and said his remarks were not meant to be a justification of suicide attacks .
Mr ul - Haq is a well known Islamic hardliner .
He is the son of former President Zia ul - Haq who carried out a process of ' Islamisation ' in Pakistan before dying in a plane crash in 1988 .
Iran criticism
The resolution passed by the lower house of parliament said that honouring Salman Rushdie " hurt Muslim sentiments " .
Sir Salman 's book The Satanic Verses sparked protests by Muslims around the world and led to Iran issuing a fatwa in 1989 , ordering his execution .
Iran also criticised the knighthood , saying praising the " apostate " showed Islamophobia among British officials .
A spokesman for the British High Commission in Islamabad would not comment on the parliamentary resolution , but he said the knighthood was a reflection of Mr Rushdie 's contribution to literature throughout a long and diverse career .
Like Iran , Pakistan is an Islamic republic with an overwhelmingly Muslim population which saw violent protests against The Satanic Verses in 1989 .
Pakistan 's parliamentary affairs minister Sher Afgan Khan Niazi , who proposed the resolution , said the knighthood would " encourage people to commit blasphemy against the Prophet Mohammad " .

The religious bigots really need to get over the Satanic Verses

Sir Salman , 59 , was one of almost 950 people to appear on the Queen 's Birthday Honours list , which is aimed at recognising outstanding achievement .
The controversial Indian - born author 's fourth book - The Satanic Verses in 1988 - describes a cosmic battle between good and evil and combines fantasy , philosophy and farce .
It was immediately condemned by the Islamic world because of its perceived blasphemous depiction of the Prophet Muhammad .
It was banned in many countries with large Muslim communities and in 1989 , Ayatollah Khomeini , Iran 's spiritual leader , issued a fatwa .
In 1998 , the Iranian government said it would no longer support the fatwa , but some groups have said it is irrevocable .
The following year , Sir Salman returned to public life .
Of his knighthood for services to literature , Rushdie said : " I am thrilled and humbled to receive this great honour , and am very grateful that my work has been recognised in this way . "
Here ’s a radical idea :
All software should be a tool or language because it reduces your risk of failure .
I ’ve written before that if an area is important enough , it eventually becomes a language .
We ’ve watched it happen over and over again , sometimes in the most unlikely places .
For example , Adobe made it ’s start by turning printing into a language called Postscript .
It gave them enormous advantages over the competition .
Here ’s another prediction : we wo n’t see the real universal Social Graph until it is expressed as a language not an application .
Why ?
Because as I have said before , it is a living breathing dynamically changing entity that means a lot of different things to a lot of different people .
Why do I say tools and languages are lower risk ?
Certainly this flies in the face of conventional wisdom .
Many VC’s , for example , want no part of a tools play .
They see it as extremely risky for a variety of reasons .
Dealing with IT and other technical types seems hard .
As customers they are seen as too demanding .
They want it all for free as Open Source , etc. , etc . .
That ’s one particular market , and there are answers to those questions , but making software into a tool does not necessarily require that you sell to that market .
Sometimes , the tool nature is almost invisible .
Spreadsheets , for example , are really languages .
Creating a spreadsheet is an odd form of programming .
In fact , it ’s great because it ’s probably the most widely used and understood language that ’s ever been created .
Here ’s another way to look at it .
I recently wrote an article called “ Why Small Software Teams Grow Large “ .
It was a response to a number of questions that had come up over my proposition that you need a small team to write really great software .
Here is a question that relates to this post :
Are n’t all the great small team examples tools ?
Linux , Delphi , and Quattro Pro are described by Chris as “ generic tools built without regard for any specific business logic . ”
There are two ways to think about this .
Chris takes the path that says the example is irrelevant because most software is n’t that way .
I take the path of saying that the example is spot on because all software should become a language if done right .
The benefit ?
Your small team is enormously more productive as are your customers if you can actually make the language something they can grasp and use .
There is a reason these small teams built languages ( though I ’m not sure I view Linux as a tool / language ) .
In fact , Quattro Pro had no less than 18 interpreters buried in the guts .
Very few of them were surfaced for end users , most were there to make the code simpler and the product more powerful .
You see what ’s at work there ?
Languages / Tools make it possible for smaller teams to be even more productive .
If you buy into the idea that small teams are the best , you must want them to have the best possible tools as well ?
What could be better than to make the software they ’re working on a special purpose tool ?
I ’m certainly not the first one to think of things this way .
There is an entire area based on the idea of Domain Specific Languages .
The idea is to create a language around the problem you ’re trying to solve in order to make it easier to solve the problem .
Tools like Ruby on Rails or Lisp are extremely good at that task .
Rather than dive into a highly technical tangent , let ’s get back to the theme here .
Why would making your software into a tool reduce risk ?
We ’ve already hit on one aspect–it can make the developers much more productive .
Here is another : a tool makes it much easier for the software to adapt to changing needs of customers .
I do a fair amount of what I call “ Termite Inspection ” for various VC ’s around the Valley .
Some of these engagements boil down to , “ This company has a great idea , but they seem to be stuck in a rut .
What should they do ? ”
Many times what has happened is a company started out with a great idea and some knowledge of the domain .
They built a piece of software that is a very literal embodiment of their view of the domain .
So long as the whole domain and all the customers fit their view , life is good .
However , for most non-trivial ( i.e. interesting market size ) domains , nobody knows the whole domain .
You learn as you go .
Customers throw curve balls .
If the only way to adapt to that is to either keep adding tons of features to the software , or do expensive custom work on each deal , that ’s way too much friction to scale .
A domain specific language makes it possible to manuever a bit at low cost and give customers what they want .
I finally put two and two together on just how important this can really be when reading Fred Wilson ’s excellent article on Why Startups Fail .
Interestingly , he classifies all of his failures ( and presumably others ) into two categories :
1 ) It was a dumb idea and we realized it early on and killed the investment .
I ’ve only been involved in one investment in this category personally although I ’ve lived through a bunch like this over the years in the partnerships I ’ve been in .
2 ) It was a decent idea but directionally incorrect , it was hugely overfunded , the burn rate was taken to levels way beyond reason , and it became impossible to adapt the business in a financially viable manner .
Can you see where this is going ?
Category 1 wo n’t be helped , and Fred correctly says you can identify this and cut your losses early on .
Building the software as a tool is a perfect antidote to # 2 .
The “ decent idea but directionally incorrect ” is strikingly similar to Marc Andreesen ’s concept of achieving a product / market fit , which he says is the only thing that matters .
Fred Wilson gives us a great anecdote :
Dick Costolo , co-founder of FeedBurner , describes a startup as the process of going down lots of dark alleys only to find that they are dead ends .
Dick describes the art of a successful deal as figuring out they are dead ends quickly and trying another and another until you find the one paved with gold .
Achieving the product / market fit is a matter of trial and error .
It is searching through an unknown territory filled with dead ends .
To survive , succeed , and prosper , your software needs maximum flexibility and adaptability .
That ’s the definition of a Tool .
It can be adapted even as the requirements keep changing radically , and it can be adapted very cheaply and efficiently .
The principle should be clear by now , but there are troubling questions of practice .
First , creating a tool sounds harder than writing an application .
My answer is that it ’s harder because of who can do it and who can’t .
Once the tool is created , any developer should be able to use it to create new features .
Creating it is the province of developers a notch or two above the lowest common denominator .
The good news is that you do n’t need to many of them .
Given my preferred maximum team size of 10 developers , you should easily get buy if 2 or 3 of the 10 are language creators .
Look for people who ’ve done it before and are comfortable with the idea .
Look for people who are adept with dynamic languages and tools like Ruby on Rails .
Second , delivering a tool sounds like a nightmare for users .
What do you do if your users are not technical ?
Just because you ’ve delivered a tool does n’t mean you have to leave sharp blades and flaming torches hanging out of the toolbox .
Nothing is easier to attach a user interface to than a language .
That ’s one of the great beauties .
But here ’s a real quantum leap : combine your application - as - tool with a ui- as - tool for true power and flexibility .
I ’ve been working with Adobe ’s Flex along those lines and the results are amazing .
Other combinations that are similar to this would be combining something like PHP , which could be viewed as UI - as - tool with your application .
This is how the various social web 2.0 sites have gotten going so quickly and cheaply .
PHP straddles both sides of the spectrum and allowed these organisms to evolve very quickly .
In the end , you will wind up with a much better user experience because you ’ll be able to quickly evolve your UI based on feedback .
Take it into usability testing early , and the combination of application and UI languages will make it straightforward to act on recommendations .
I hope you can get a sense from this post how powerful a competitive weapon having a language versus an application can be .
It actually reduces your costs , increases your flexibility , and let ’s you respond with ultimate nimbleness to market demands until you ’ve found the best possible product / market fit .

We 're not really sure what 's going down at Tesla Motors , but it ai n't pretty .
Martin Eberhard , co-founder of the electric sports car company , says at least 26 people have been fired , some of whom were canned without severance .
Eberhard got the boot in the fall , and according to his blog , he 's looking at starting " a new company ( possibly even an electric car company ) in the energy / clean technology space .
. .
Bubble or not , I am optimistic about my own ability to raise money from high - quality investors for my next venture . "
From what we 've seen , he 's got good reason to feel optimistic .
We recently spotted the guy at Buck 's where he was getting the royal treatment .
VC types were approaching him and shaking his hand , and he was talking with some dude about how lots of people would like to start a car company now .

The Indian crowd allegedly made offensive gestures
The four fans were evicted from a one - day international match in Mumbai ( Bombay ) on Wednesday .
Symonds is the only mixed race player in the Australian side , having made his international debut in 1998 .
He frequently clashed with Indian players during the one - day series , which Australia won 4 - 2 .
Cricket officials say that photographs of fans making offensive gestures to Symonds as he came in to bat have been handed over to police .
Police say that the four fans , including a woman , have been charged with harassment and have now been released on bail to appear in court at a later date .
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says that the gestures were made even as an anti-racism message flashed on a big screen .
" There is no place for racism in cricket either on or off the field , " a joint statement released on Wednesday by Indian and Australian cricket officials said .
" All cricket nations have to be on guard to ensure that the fun does not cross the boundary into unacceptable behaviour . "
' Cultural misunderstanding '
Officials say that Indian fans might have targeted Symonds because of his heated exchanges with Indian bowlers Harbhajan Singh and Shantakumaran Sreesanth .
Symonds has sometimes clashed with Indian players
Symonds , who was born in England to West Indian parents , but then adopted and taken to Australia by his new family when he was two years old , complained of being subjected to monkey chanting earlier in the series .
Initially his allegations were dismissed by the Indian cricket authorities , who said that there was a lack of evidence and later that it may have been caused by a " cultural misunderstanding " .
Their attitude was strongly criticised in the Australian press , which described it as " ranging from ridiculous to ignorant " .
Our correspondent says that the issue has become a major debating point on online blogs , with charges being traded by Indian and Australian cricket fans .
With the rhetoric heating up and India due to tour Australia in December , our correspondent says that this is an issue that is threatening to turn ugly .
Cricket Australia officials have , however , ruled any possibility of future tours to India being boycotted because of the issue .
" I do n't think it has got to that stage .
There is an ICC International Cricket Council anti-racism policy in place .
The ICC and the BCCI [ the Board of Control for Cricket in India ] will no doubt deal with these issues , " said CA chief executive James Sutherland .
" While the incident in the last game in Mumbai was disappointing , it is pleasing to see the officials at the ground are taking the response to evict those people from the ground and take the appropriate action . "
Sutherland said Symonds now wanted to put the matter behind him .
" It is not something that he is necessarily comfortable with - but he sees that there is no cause for reaction , because that only further inflames it , " he added .

stadtkind - stuttgart.de Besuch im Kessel Was ihr mit Freunden unternehmen könnt

Die beste Aussicht , die leckerste Pizza und die kühlsten Drinks : Wenn Freunde im Kessel zu Besuch sind , will man Stuttgarts coole Ecken ansteuern und auschecken .
Gut , dass wir Stadtkinder wissen , wo die zu finden sind .
I ’ve read various articles debating the importance of the 1080 p .
I want to set the record straight once and for all : if you are serious about properly setting up your viewing room , you will definitely benefit from 1080 p ( and even 1440 p . )
Why ?
Because the 1080 p resolution is the first to deliver enough detail to your eyeball when you are seated at the proper distance from the screen .
But do n’t just take my word for it : read on for the proof .
There are a few obvious factors to being able to detect resolution differences : the resolution of the screen , the size of the screen , and the viewing distance .
To be able to detect differences between resolutions , the screen must be large enough and you must sit close enough .
So the question becomes “ How do I know if need a higher resolution or not ? ” .
Here is your answer .
Based on the resolving ability of the human eye , it is possible to estimate when the differences between resolutions will become apparent .
A person with 20 / 20 vision can resolve 60 pixels per degree , which corresponds to recognizing the letter “ E ” on the 20/20 line of a Snellen eye chart from 20 feet away .
Using the Home Theater Calculator spreadsheet as a base , I created a chart showing , for any given screen size , how close you need to sit to be able to detect some or all of the benefits of a higher resolution screen .
( Click the picture below for a larger version . )
What the chart shows is that , for a 50 - inch screen , the benefits of 720 p vs. 480 p start to become apparent at viewing distances closer than 14.6 feet and become fully apparent at 9.8 feet .
For the same screen size , the benefits of 1080 p vs. 720 p start to become apparent when closer than 9.8 feet and become full apparent at 6.5 feet .
In my opinion , 6.5 feet is closer than most people will sit to their 50 ″ plasma TV ( even through the THX recommended viewing distance for a 50 ″ screen is 5.6 ft ) .
So , most consumers will not be able to see the full benefit of their 1080 p TV .
However , front projectors and rear projection displays are a different story .
They make it very easy to obtain large screen sizes .
Plus , LCD and Plasma displays are constantly getting larger and less expensive .
In my home , for example , I have a 123 - inch screen and a projector with a 1280 ×720 resolution .
For a 123 - inch screen , the benefits of 720 p vs. 480 p starts to become apparent at viewing distances closer than 36 feet ( 14 feet behind my back wall ) and become fully apparent at 24 feet ( 2 feet behind my back wall ) .
For the same screen size , the benefits of 1080 p vs. 720 p start to become apparent when closer than 24 feet and become full apparent at 16 feet ( just between the first and second row of seating in my theater ) .
This means that people in the back row of my home theater would see some improvement if I purchased a 1080 p projector and that people in the front row would notice a drastic improvement .
( Note : the THX recommended max viewing distance for a 123 ″ screen is 13.7 feet ) .
So , how close should you be sitting to your TV ?
Obviously , you need to look at your room and see what makes sense for how you will be using it .
If you have a dedicated viewing room and can place seating anywhere you want , you can use this chart as a guideline .
It ’s based on THX and SMPTE specifications for movie theaters ; the details are available in the Home Theater Calculator spreadsheet .
Looking at this chart , it is apparent that 1080 p is the lowest resolution to fall within the recommended seating distance range .
Any resolution less than 1080 p is not detailed enough if you are sitting the proper distance from the screen .
For me and many people with large projection screens , 1080 p is the minimum resolution you ’d want .
In fact , you could probably even benefit from 1440 p .
If you have n’t heard of 1440 p , you will .
Here ’s a link to some info on Audioholics.com .
It is part of the HDMI 1.3 spec , along with 48 - bit color depth , and will probably surface for the public in 2009 or so .
You ’ll partially be able to see the benefits of 1440 p at the THX Max Recommended viewing distance and the resolution benefits will be fully apparent if you are just a little closer .
I ’ve read of plans for resolutions reaching 2160 p but I do n’t see any benefit ; you ’d have to sit too darn close to the screen to notice any improvement .
If you sit too close , you ca n’t see the far edges of the screen .
In conclusion
If you are a videophile with a properly setup viewing room , you should definitely be able to notice the resolution enhancement that 1080 p brings .
However , if you are an average consumer with a flat panel on the far wall of your family room , you are not likely to be close enough to notice any advantage .
Check the chart above and use that to make your decision .
ISF states the the most important aspects of picture quality are ( in order ) : 1 ) contrast ratio , 2 ) color saturation , 3 ) color accuracy , 4 ) resolution .
Resolution is 4th on the list and plasma is generally superior to LCD in all of the other areas ( but much more prone to reflections / glare . )
So pick your display size , then measure your seating distance , and then use the charts above to figure out if you would benefit from the larger screen size .
So be sure to calibrate your screen !
I recommend the following for calibration .
Recommended Calibration Tools
“ I do n’t like reading charts – just tell me what resolution I need ”
If you do n’t like reading charts and are looking for a quick answer , enter you screen size below to see how close you ’ll need to sit to fully appreciate various screen resolutions .
Enter screen size : inches diagonal For 480 p ( 720×480 ) resolution , you must sit :
feet or closer to see all available detail
( 720×480 ) resolution , you must sit : feet or closer to see all available detail For 720 p ( 1280 ×720 ) resolution , you must sit :
feet or closer to see all available detail
( 1280×720 ) resolution , you must sit : feet or closer to see all available detail For 1080 p ( 1920 ×1080 ) resolution , you must sit :
feet or closer to see all available detail
( 1920 ×1080 ) resolution , you must sit : feet or closer to see all available detail For 4 k ( 3840 ×2160 ) resolution , you must sit :
feet or closer to see all available detail
( 3840×2160 ) resolution , you must sit : feet or closer to see all available detail For 8 k ( 7680×4320 ) resolution , you must sit :
feet or closer to see all available detail
Note about “ or closer ” viewing distances calculated above : if you sit closer than the distances shown above , you will be able to see some ( but not all ) of the detail offered by the next higher resolution .

JSON Is Not XML .
Douglas argued that JSON is much simpler than XML .
JSON took a very different approach than XML in a couple of areas : there is no version number because the spec is declared stable forever ; it takes a non-draconian “ be liberal in what you accept and conservative in what you produce ” philosophy to be friendly to supersets ( such as YAML www.yaml.org, which is big in the Ruby world )
The JSON folks are agitating for the infrastructure vendors to support a JSONRequest API http://www.json.org/JSONRequest.html that addresses some limitations in XmlHttpRequest for AJAX environments .
There seemed to be a lot more JSON fans than XML fans in that thread ( maybe because the original post was just a wee bit inflammatory )
JSON may be something like 100x faster to parse than XML in today 's browsers ( but I doubt very much if the best JSON parsers are anywhere near that much faster than the best XML parsers ... it would be interesting to know ! ) ,
JSON parsing ends up with something akin to a typed " business object " rather than an untyped DOM tree
To do that in XML requires yet another layer or two of cruft ( a schema and a databinding tool )
The bottom line argument for JSON comes down to elegance -- it does what is does simply and cleanly , and simply refuses to worry about many of the things that complicate XML such as metadata ( attributes ) , comments , processing instructions , a schema language , and namespaces .
The sweet spot for JSON is serializing simple data structures for transfer between programming languages .
If you need more complex data structures ( maybe with some kind of schema for validation ) , use XML .
If you want to do full blown RPC use SOAP or XML - RPC .
If you just want a light - weight format for moving data around , JSON fits the bill admirably .
What do we lose from not using XML ?
The ability to use XML tools .
If you ’re someone who breathes XSLT that might be a problem ; if like me your approach when faced with XML is to parse it in to a more agreeable data structure as soon as possible you ’ll find JSON far more productive .
The debate about JSON vs. XML as a data interchange format has begun in blogspace , following JSON inventor and architect at Yahoo Douglas Crockford 's talk at XML 2006 JSON , the fat - free alternative to XML ( ppt ) .
JSON is a data interchange format whose design goals were to be textual , minimal , and a subset of JavaScript ; it supports two structures : objects ( unordered collections of name / value pairs ) and arrays ( ordered sequences of values ) , as well as four simple types : strings , numbers , booleans , and null .
Some of the main points Douglas raises for why JSON is well - suited as a data - interchance format were : Douglas also listed and refuted common arguments against JSON : Mike Champion , Program Manager for XML Standards at Microsoft attended the talk and summarised his takeaways
Mike also commented his own opinion that he sees JSON as a good solution for browser - server communication , " but not a serious contender for interoperability purposes ... will we see JSON substituting for XML in SOAP messages , RSS feeds , etc . ?
Will people store JSON persistently ?
That will require JSON - flavored APIs , schema / ' data contract ' languages , query / transformation languages , apps , etc .
" Dave Winer kicked off the debate saying that JSON " proposes to solve a problem that was neatly solved by XML - RPC in 1998 " and remarked at the complexity of a real world JSON example " look at how deep they went to re-invent , XML itself was n't good enough for them ... "
Dave 's post kicked off a long discussion thread which included Douglas Crockford responding " The good thing about reinventing the wheel is that you can get a round one . "
Mike Champion summarized some of the key takeways from the thread :
Mike also commented his own opinions that while XML is n't as elegant , it is more sturdy and flexible .
JSON may look simpler now but it's own limitations will become apparent once people start testing it in new scenarios .
The argument that JSON is better because it is more elegant " does n't bode well for its ultimate success " if you consider historical examples of more elegant technologies that lost to more widely adopted heavier technologies , such as LISP vs. C.Simon Wilson added his own thoughts
XML co-inventor Tim Bray also commented that JSON exists " to put structs on the wire " , whereas : with XML " it ’s assumed that you might want to stream it in by the gigabyte , or load it into one of a many different in - memory data structures , or run a full - text indexer over the contents , or render it for human consumption , or , well , anything . "
Tim went on further to position when ot use one vs. the other :
Use JSON ... if you want to serialize a data structure that ’s not too text - heavy and all you want is for the receiver to get the same data structure with minimal effort , and you trust the other end to get the i18n right , JSON is hunky - dory .
Use XML if you want to provide general - purpose data that the receiver might want to do unforeseen weird and crazy things with , or if you want to be really paranoid and picky about i18n , or if what you ’re sending is more like a document than a struct , or if the order of the data matters , or if the data is potentially long - lived ( as in , more than seconds ) XML is the way to go .
Folks tried from the beginning to make XML right for data as well as documents , and even though I think the effort made XML more useful than its predecessors , I think it 's clear folks never entirely succeeded .
XML is much better suited to documents and text than records and data .

Physicist Leo Szilard , the scientist who conceived of a nuclear chain reaction , worked on the Manhattan Project when he moved to the United States . *
Photo : Corbis * 1933 : Physicist Leo Szilard gets the nuclear age rolling , so to speak , by conceiving the idea of a nuclear chain reaction while standing at a red light .
Szilard , a native of Budapest and a soldier in the Austro - Hungarian army during World War I , left Hungary for Germany to escape the postwar rise of anti-Semitism .
Originally an engineering student , he switched to physics after moving to Berlin and studied under Albert Einstein , among others .
His decade in Berlin was fruitful and Slizard was engaged in a number of projects , including development of the linear accelerator , cyclotron and home refrigeration .
But with the rise of the Nazis , Slizard found himself on the move again , this time to London .
Not long after his arrival , Slizard read an article in the Times of London rejecting the idea of any practical use for atomic energy .
So incensed was Slizard , the story goes , that he stood right there at a traffic signal in Bloomsbury and dreamed up the nuclear chain reaction .
A year later he patented the concept .
His early attempts at triggering a reaction , however , failed .
He tried using beryllium and indium to no effect and , in 1936 , he assigned his chain - reaction patent to the British Admiralty to ensure secrecy .
Soon thereafter , Slizard accepted a teaching post at Columbia University in New York , and moved to the United States .
There , he met Enrico Fermi and , reacting to the discovery of nuclear fission in a Berlin laboratory , the two men realized uranium was the agent they needed to produce their reaction .
Working at the University of Chicago , they produced the world 's first controlled nuclear chain reaction in December 1942 .
Both men worked on the Manhattan Project , which developed an atomic bomb for the United States .
Slizard agreed to join the project partly out of the belief that the Americans represented the one true moral force in the world .
The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki convinced him otherwise , however , especially as he had been a leading " scientist of conscience , " an advocate of demonstrating the power of the bomb to the Japanese in some way other than obliterating two population centers .
Following the war , Slizard , remaining true to his belief that scientists are morally responsible for the consequences of their work , switched disciplines , moving to molecular biology .
He died in 1964 , at the age of 66 .

Googling for something else , I found this March 2005 Jeffrey Goldberg article that got me annoyed at Dick Holbrooke all over again :
At sixty - two , Biden has a cheerful vanity and an exuberant restlessness that make him seem far younger .
Since the election , he has become a leader of a modest - sized faction — “ the national - security Democrats , ” in the words of Richard Holbrooke , an ambassador to the United Nations under President Clinton — that includes the most hawkish members in the Democratic Party .
Because , obviously , those Democrats who thought it would be a bad idea to launch a years - long bloody , expensive , and futile military operation in Iraq do n't care about national security .
Those who were totally wrong may have gotten tons of people killed , but at least they 're not dirty fucking hippies .
That seems to be the general idea .
Anyways this kind of thing is why I think we can do better than President Hillary Clinton :
“ She is probably more assertive and willing to use force than her husband , ” says Richard Holbrooke , the former envoy for Bill Clinton .
“ Hillary Clinton is a classic national - security Democrat .
She is better at framing national - security issues for the current era than her husband was at a common point in his career . ”
I mean , if those were just the words of some guy you could discount them , but he 's one of her top people .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Harriet Miers Knew of Destruction of Interrogation Tapes ABC 's Jonathan Karl on latest details in the destruction of CIA tapes .
Dec. 7 , 2007  -- ABC
News has learned that at least one White House official knew about the CIA 's planned destruction of videotapes in 2005 that documented the interrogation of two al Qaeda operatives : then - White House counsel Harriet Miers .
Three officials told ABC News Miers urged the CIA not to destroy the tapes .
Intelligence officials say the decision to destroy the tapes was made by Jose Rodriguez , former head of the CIA 's covert - operations division .
Even former CIA director Porter Goss did not know the tapes were destroyed .
The White House said today President Bush did n't know either .
Congress is now demanding to know why the CIA destroyed those tapes , just as its interrogation methods were facing intense public scrutiny .
To some prominent members of Congress there 's only one explanation : a coverup .
Democratic Senate leaders compared the CIA 's actions to the Watergate scandal .
Sen. Edward Kennedy , D - Mass. , asked , " What would cause the CIA to take this action ?
The answer is obvious -- coverup . "
" What is at stake here goes to the heart of the rule of law and justice in America , " said Sen. Richard Durbin , D - Ill .
This afternoon , Durbin wrote Attorney General Michael Mukasey urging him to investigate a possible " obstruction of justice . "
Members of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission also expressed concern .
Co-Chairman Tom Kean said the Commission had demanded all information about the interrogations and was never told about the tapes .
" They knew what they had and they did n't give it to us , " Kean said .
In a message to employees Thursday , CIA Director Michael Hayden made no apologies for the tapes ' destruction insisting the decision to destroy them was " in line with the law . "
In 2002 , the CIA videotaped the interrogations of two terror suspects , including top al Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah .
The tapes showed what the CIA calls " enhanced interrogation techniques , " methods which critics call torture .
In February 2003 , the CIA says it told the leaders of congressional intelligence committees about the tapes and that it planned to destroy them .
On Nov. 2 , 2005 , the Washington Post detailed the CIA 's secret prison program known as " black sites . "
It was November 2005 that the CIA destroyed the tapes .
Hayden said the tapes were destroyed because " they were no longer of intelligence value " and that they posed " a serious security risk " because if leaked , they 'd reveal the identity of covert CIA agents .
Kennedy objected to that explanation : " That excuse wo n't wash ...
How is it possible that the director of the CIA has so little faith in his own agency ? "
A Limited Liability Company ( LLC ) is not a separate tax entity like a corporation ; instead , it is what the IRS calls a “ pass - through entity , ” like a partnership or sole proprietorship .
All of the profits and losses of the LLC “ pass through ” the business to the LLC owners ( called members ) , who report this information on their personal tax returns .
The LLC itself does not pay federal income taxes , but some states do charge the LLC itself a tax .
Income taxes
The IRS treats your LLC like a sole proprietorship or a partnership , depending on the number of members in your LLC .
If you ’ve already done business as a sole proprietorship or partnership , you ’re ahead of the game because you know many of the rules already .
If not , here are the basics :
Single - owner LLCs
The IRS treats one - member LLCs as sole proprietorships for tax purposes .
This means that the LLC itself does not pay taxes and does not have to file a return with the IRS .
As the sole owner of your LLC , you must report all profits ( or losses ) of the LLC on Schedule C and submit it with your 1040 tax return .
Even if you leave profits in the company ’s bank account at the end of the year — for instance , to cover future expenses or expand the business — you must pay taxes on that money .
Multi-owner LLCs
The IRS treats co-owned LLCs as partnerships for tax purposes .
Co-owned LLCs themselves do not pay taxes on business income ; instead , the LLC owners each pay taxes on their lawful share of the profits on their personal income tax returns ( with Schedule E attached ) .
Each LLC member ’s share of profits and losses , called a distributive share , is set out in the LLC operating agreement .
Most operating agreements provide that a member ’s distributive share is in proportion to his percentage interest in the business .
For instance , if Jimmy owns 60 % of the LLC , and Luana owns the other 40 % , Jimmy will be entitled to 60 % of the LLC ’s profits and losses , and Luana will be entitled to 40 % .
If you ’d like to split up profits and losses in a way that is not proportionate to the members ’ percentage interests in the business , it ’s called a “ special allocation , ” and you must carefully follow IRS rules .
However members ’ distributive shares are divvied up , the IRS treats each LLC member as though they receive their entire distributive share each year .
This means that each LLC member must pay taxes on their distributive share whether or not the LLC actually distributes the money to him / her .
The practical significance of this IRS rule is that even if LLC members need to leave profits in the LLC — for instance , to buy inventory or expand the business — each LLC member is liable for income tax on her / his rightful share of that money .
Even though a co-owned LLC itself does not pay income taxes , it must file Form 1065 with the IRS .
This form , the same one that a partnership files , is an informational return that the IRS reviews to make sure the LLC members are reporting their income correctly .
The LLC must also provide each LLC member with a “ Schedule K - 1 , ” which breaks down each member ’s share of the LLC ’s profits and losses .
In turn , each LLC member reports this profit and loss information on his or her individual Form 1040 , with Schedule E attached .
LLCs can elect corporate taxation
If your LLC will regularly need to retain a significant amount of profits in the company , you ( and your co-owners , if you have any ) may be able to save money by electing to have your LLC taxed as a corporation .
For details , see “ Can Corporate Taxation Cut Your LLC Tax Bill ? ” at the end of this article .
Estimating and paying income taxes
Because LLC members are not considered employees of the LLC , but rather self - employed business owners , they are not subject to tax withholding .
Instead , each LLC member is responsible for setting aside enough money to pay taxes on his / her share of the profits .
The members must estimate the amount of tax they ’ll owe for the year and make payments to the IRS ( and usually to the appropriate state tax agency ) each quarter — in April , June , September and January .
Self - employment taxes
Because , again , LLC members are not employees but self - employed business owners , contributions to the Social Security and Medicare systems ( collectively called the “ self - employment ” tax ) are not withheld from their paychecks .
Instead , most LLC owners are required to pay the self - employment tax directly to the IRS .
The current rule is that any owner who works in or helps manage the business must pay this tax on their distributive share — his or her rightful share of profits .
However , owners who are not active in the LLC — that is , those who have merely invested money but do n’t provide services or make management decisions for the LLC — may be exempt from paying self - employment taxes on their share of profits .
The regulations in this area are a bit complicated , but if you actively manage or work in your LLC , you can expect to pay the self - employment tax on all LLC profits allocated to you .
Each owner who is subject to the self - employment tax reports it on Schedule SE , which s/he submits annually with his / her 1040 tax return .
LLC owners pay twice as much self - employment tax as regular employees , since regular employees ’ contributions to the self - employment tax are matched by their employers .
The self - employment tax rate for 2002 for business owners is 15.3 % of the first $ 84,900 of income and 2.9 % of everything over $ 84,900 .
You ’ll need to research the current year ’s rate .
Expenses and deductions
As you no doubt already know , you do n’t have to pay taxes — income taxes or self - employment taxes — on money that your business spends in pursuit of profit .
You can deduct ( “ write off ” ) your legitimate business expenses from your business income , which can greatly lower the profits you must report to the IRS .
Deductible expenses include start - up costs , automobile , travel and entertainment expenses and advertising and promotion costs .
State taxes and fees
Most states tax LLC profits the same way the IRS does :
The LLC owners pay taxes to the state on their personal returns ; the LLC itself does not pay a state tax .
A few states , however , do charge the LLC a tax based on the amount of income the LLC makes , in addition to the income tax its owners pay .
For instance , California levies a tax on LLCs that make over $ 250,000 per year ; the tax ranges from about $ 1,000 to $ 9,000 .
In addition , some states ( including California , Delaware , Illinois , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Pennsylvania and Wyoming ) impose an annual fee on LLCs , called a ” franchise tax , ” an “ annual registration fee ” or a “ renewal fee . ”
In most states , the fee is about $ 100 , but California exacts a hefty $ 800 fee per year from LLCs , and Illinois , Massachusetts and Pennsylvania charge $ 300 , $ 500 and $ 330 , respectively .
Before forming an LLC , find out if your state charges a separate LLC - level tax by visiting the website of your state ’s Revenue or Tax Department , or by giving them a call .
Can corporate taxation cut your LLC tax bill ?
If you regularly need to keep a substantial amount of profits in your LLC ( called “ retained earnings ” ) , you might benefit from electing corporate taxation .
Any LLC can be treated like a corporation for tax purposes by filing IRS Form 8832 and checking the corporate tax treatment box on the form .
After making this election , profits kept in the LLC are taxed at the separate income tax rates that apply to corporations ; the owners do n’t pay personal income taxes on profits left in the company .
( Unlike an LLC , a corporation pays its own taxes on all corporate profits left in the business . )
Because the corporate income tax rates for the first $ 75,000 of corporate taxable income are lower than the individual income tax rates that apply to most LLC owners , this can save you and your co-owners money in overall taxes .
For example , if your retail outfit needs to stock up on expensive inventory at the beginning of each year , you might decide to leave $ 50,000 in your business at year ’s end .
With the regular pass - through taxation of an LLC , these retained profits would likely be taxed at your individual tax rate , which is probably over 27 % .
But with corporate taxation , that $ 50,000 is taxed at the lower 15 % corporate rate .
Once you elect corporate taxation , however , you ca n’t switch back to pass - through taxation for five years , and if you do switch back , there could be negative tax consequences .
In other words , you should treat the decision to elect corporate taxation as seriously as you would the decision to convert your LLC to a corporation .

For close to two and a half thousand years , Iran has been a great nation .
Five empires , from the Medians to the Safavids have risen and fallen , at their height stretching from Libya to Eastern Europe to India .
It is telling that though Arab armies dominated a strip of land from west Africa to the Indonesian archipelago , Iran has never long been ruled , aside from by the brief Mongol occupation , keeping its own language , Farsi , and its own Shi’ite form of Islam .
Iran is a fiercely independent Nation ; it remained a truly independent country until the Shia safavids fell and the new powers of Britain and Russia began imperial jockeying for power .
For a long period Iran ceased to be a real state , becoming a theatre in which European , and later American , proxies ( political parties , militias and kings ) could vie for power , trade and influence .
Iran proves that there are few things more troubled than a great nation fallen .
Pride is a hard thing for people to let go of .
There has scant been a time in modern history when Iran has spent long outside the spotlights glare .
Perhaps it is an echo of its grand past , perhaps it is a defiant attitude of a people who feel it to be their birthright to be noticed but for good or ill , Iran is important .
It has had a state that has for over a hundred years been loathed either by its own people or by those outside , often both .
Today , we are faced by an Iran headed by the conservative cleric , Supreme leader Ali Khamenei and a radical populist , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
It is fermenting trouble in its region , it is accused of seeking nuclear weapons , regularly spitting anti Zionist rhetoric , known for oppressing its own people , and interfering in Iraq .
And yet , of all the world ’s “ outposts of tyranny , ” Iran is the home of surprising nuance , and a more open system and culture than one might think .
It has not been ground into poverty through incompetent Government ; indeed it is broadly comparable to Turkey in statistics ( Population and GDP per person at purchasing power parity ) .
Unlike North Korea or Burma , it is no secretive monolith , devoid of audible opposition .
Unlike Zimbabwe , Sudan or any number of other African dictatorships , it is not especially corrupt , nor is it run for personal gain .
Indeed , it can claim credibly to be one of the most plural democracies in the region , in this it is only beaten by Israel , the Palestinian Authority and Lebanon .
Its Unicameral Parliament is fully elected through universal suffrage ; the same is true for the office of president , an office with the power to appoint the government .
It is often suggested that a true democracy is one that can produce a surprise result ; the 2005 election of Ahmadinejad was just that .
There is an 86 member Assembly of Experts , elected in eight year terms , which choose the supreme leader , and are able to fire or hire him at any time .
Democracy in not just about procedure , it is as much about freedom of association and speech .
In this Iran compares favourably to most Arab states ; protests are small but common ; the president has been heckled , even egged on occasions , without anything of the violent recriminations one would expect in Zimbabwe , Saudi Arabia or from John Prescott .
The press is also surprisingly free ( more a credit to courageous editors and journalists than state benevolence ) , editorials regularly lambaste the government for incompetence and the blogosphere is alive with dissent that comes not just from noisy exiles , as we saw in Iraq and see in other dictatorships , but from those still living in the country .
Reformist presidents and members of parliament have also been elected ; people who sought to improve relationships with the west and pluralize the system of government , views that run counter to those of the conservative elite .
Women and minorities , including a Jew , have also been elected to parliament .
That is a rose tinted picture , empty of the many just criticisms .
The press is given a very hard time , a handful of political prisoners still exist , newspapers are often closed , and this became more prevalent in the early naughties , when the reformist president Khatami prompted a backlash from the Conservative elite .
The Parliament and the president may be elected , but candidates must be approved by the “ council of guardians , ” A body of twelve , half appointed be the supreme leader and half appointed by the head of the judiciary ( then they must be approved by parliament ) ; the head of the judiciary is also appointed directly by the supreme leader .
The Assembly of Experts must also be religiously trained ( though liberals have challenged this ) .
The supreme leader also holds power over the army and police , as well as appointing a hugely powerful expediency council who can manipulate politics , as they did in 2004 , when they ensured that nearly all liberal candidates were barred from standing in Parliament , in a deliberate snub of the courageously reformist then president Khatami .
So , the procedures of government are far from perfect and there is little separation of Legislature , Judiciary and Executive , but directly or indirectly , all arms of government are accountable to some democratically elected body .
If the overwhelming will of the public was towards reform , the electoral process of changing the Council of Experts , the Parliament , the supreme leader and the President could be achieved .
From this point the President could appoint a government that would change the constitution and the new supreme leader would support it .
It is a very convoluted , almost imposable path to reform , but it exists , more than can be said of a truer autocracy like that of Saudi Arabia .
Ever since the Islamic revolution in November 1979 , led by the first supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini , the west , especially the US , whose embassy staff were taken hostage for 444 days , have been sour .
Given Iran ’s nuances , surprising appetite for pluralism and its election of a reformist president ( Khatami ) in 1997 and 2001 , is as odd as it is disappointing .
One would have thought that the West would have sought moderate partners to deal with , improving relationships , and Iran ’s moderates would have been emboldened by the benefits they could bring to their country from closer ties to rich countries , especially given their vast reserves of oil , the third largest easily available reserves on earth .
The key factor in maintaining the hostility has been an Iranian national psyche scarred by the series of exploitations and shameful betrayals perpetrated by the west pushing Iran into a reactionary hostility , and a lack of vision in the west , where we are often incapable of seeing Iran as anything but the autocratic , confrontational monolith that it is n’t , or at least does not have to be .
The sad truth is that if you besiege a county like we have done Iran , it will inevitably gain a siege mentality .
In the Past hundred years , we have done much harm to Iran , emboldening its extremists and comprehensively discrediting its moderates .
In the power tussles between Britain and Russia that followed the fall of the Shiite Safavid Empire , Britain came off better .
In 1903 , the D’Arcy oil concession signed over the drilling rights for Iran ’s oil to the UK ( Anglo Iranian ( later becoming BP ) ) ; by the 1940s 85 percent of oil profits went to Britain .
This concession was made by a Turkmen , a man who most Iranians saw as a foreigner and this was the basis of hatred and distrust of imperialism during the larger part of the 20th century .
After World War
One , the USSR had lost most of its appetite for imperialism ( for a time ) , Iran had ceased to have value as a buffer against the now fallen Ottoman empire and had become a purely commercial exploit .
Iran had signed a constitution in 1909 , allowing for a degree of democracy ; reformers had hoped that this would strengthen the country against Russia and Britain , but it was seldom adhered to ; Reza Kahn , a Cossack army officer , staged a coup and appointed himself king , or Shah .
Anglo Iranian assumed a role similar to that of the British East India Company , bribing and brokering power .
World War Two made Iran even more critical ;
Oil was a key resource , and Iran showed some sign of strengthening its ties with the Germans , so the Allies invaded in 1941 .
The Iranians were hugely sidelined ; by this time nearly all oil profits went to the British .
It was after World War Two , a time when Iran took its first , arguably only , foray into democracy , when Iran tried to rectify this .
People could smell the death of empire , Ghandi had been victorious in India , colonies were developing strong independence movements and dependencies were showing a greater appetite for nationalism .
Mohamed Mossadegh was elected president in 1951 ; he was popular and fiercely independent .
He nationalised the oil industry .
Anglo Iranian was to lose out .
This sparked the Abadan crisis ( named after the oil town of Abadan in the south ) when Britain and Iran were brought close to war ( this was echoed half a decade later when Egypt ’s President Nasser nationalised the Suez canal , bringing Britain and Egypt to a disastrous war ) .
Instead , enlisting the support of the United States by convincing them that Mossadegh was a communist , reliant on the communist party ( which he did eventually come to be after the west undermined his other support ) .
They launched a campaign against the man , showing that now sadly commonplace disregard for democracy when it does not produce favourable results .
They accused him of being homosexual , fuelled dissident groups , openly suggested that the Shah ( by then Reza ’s son Mohamed Reza Pahlavi ) fire him and take over , sent operatives to stir trouble and staged fake government retaliation , and eventually a coup , Operation AJAX .
Mossadegh ’s nationalisation may have been bad for the economy , he may have improved relationships with Russia , he may have been authoritarian , but the later two of these were mainly as a response to the unrest fermented by the CIA and the British .
The Shah had at first been opposed to taking over , but changed his mind .
He was exiled for a short period in January 1953 , but returned soon later , and Mossadegh was forced out by a Military coup incited and supplied by the CIA .
The Shah appointed a new prime minister , but essentially ruled the country .
Anglo Iranian was split between British petroleum ( 40 percent ) , five US companies ( 40 percent ) and royal Dutch Shell ; in other words , once again , there was very little Iranian about Anglo Iranian .
In the 16 years of his rule , the Shah had become a western puppet ; he built up a vast and powerful military to act as a buffer against the USSR , supplied by the west and had a network of secret police , the SAVAK , trained by the CIA and Mossad , who tortured and enforced by fear .
He was adored by the west and hated by his own people .
This was the first of the West ’s two great modern betrayals of Iran .
When faced with a dictator , people tend to turn either to democracy and pluralism , or to religion , sometimes both .
The Islamic Revolution of February 1979 , when the Shah was forced into exile and Ayatollah Khomeini , the spiritual leader who had spent years in exile , returned to become supreme leader was as much a rejection of outside interference and dictatorship as it was an embrace of religious rule .
Indeed , liberals played a large part in it ; the first president was Mehdi Bazargan , a democracy campaigner who resigned after the siege of the US embassy .
The liberals were then crushed as the hostage crisis wore on and Iran became alienated , but they remained a political force , publishing newspapers , running and winning in parliament .
On September the 22nd 1980 , Saddam Hussein invaded the newly formed Islamic republic ; after initial victories , the Iranians fought back .
They looked like they would take Basra and Iraq ’s southern oil fields ; the west ’s second , more vicious betrayal of Iran began .
British , American , French and German companies busied themselves selling military hardware from aircraft to nerve agents to Saddam .
The Americans gave the Iraqi ’s satellite images and sent the navy to “ secure oil routes ” out of Iraq ( they shot down an Iranian airliner in the process ) .
The Iranians , fast running out of the tools of war that the Shah had spent so much money on , were forced to buy weapons from the Chinese , Israel ( yes , Israel , the Israelis saw Saddam as a greater threat than the Iranians , they were probably right ) and the illegal market ; this was not enough , so , under resourced , they resorted to human wave attacks reminiscent of World War One .
In nearly eight years , the border moved little , at least half a million died on either side and a generation was left brutalised .
More died from the gas we supplied to the Iraqis than died from gas in the Great War .
The Iranian government claims that there are two million people still suffering from , or who have died from the after effects of the gas .
There are a few who still claim that arming Saddam was the right thing to do ; it stopped the radical Islamic government from gaining oil that would have given it the world largest reserves .
In truth , it prolonged a war between a small well - armed country and a large poorly armed one .
It strengthened the Iraqi dictator , giving him an experienced military apparatus he would later use to invade Kuwait and to oppress his own people .
It also provided the perfect emergency in which the Radical Islamists could conduct trials in kangaroo courts and hang former officials of the shah ’s Iran and crack down on liberals .
Iran did not want to fight the war and if Saddam had felt he could no continue , he would have sued for peace .
Just as Russian communism was forged in the cruelty of war , leaving it more callous and militaristic than it begun , and Iran ’s Islamic republic was born into a world that hated it .
The abused child too often becomes the aggressive adult .
Is it any wonder that , after all we have done to it , Iran is so troublesome ?
If it was the governments of Ronald Reagan and George Bush in the 80s and early 90s that did a lot to create the unpleasant Iran we face today , it was Bill Clinton and George Bush junior who have missed opportunities to retrieve it .
In the year after the Iran Iraq war ended , Ayatollah Khomeini died .
His president , Ali Khamenei , took his position .
The first elections were held in this year also , and the mild reformist , Ali Rafsanjani won .
He began half - heartedly trying to reconcile Iran with the west ; at first , this went well , and Iran adhered to the sanctions imposed against Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait .
It also began a period of privatisation and economic liberalisation with a view to opening up economic ties with foreign powers .
He succeeded in building a good relationship with other Middle Eastern powers , Russia and China ; the latter of these relationships still lasts ( though mainly due to China ’s ravenous desire for oil ) .
But when the UN force drove Iraq out , Iran felt threatened and opposed the war .
Under Rafsanjani , the relationship did not heal , and the west , especially the US , refused to deal with Iran until they halted their support for Hezbollah and gave up its quest for nuclear power .
It was the 1997 election of Mohammad Khatami that represented a greater missed opportunity .
He was a real reformer , a man who had been friends with Mahdi Bazargan while he had been a Member of Parliament until his death in 1995 .
Khatami’s “ dialogue among civilisations ” ended the sanctions and EU nations began renewing ties .
A graduate in western philosophy , he made it his goal to renew Iran ’s standing and negotiate with the west ; it is even suggested that he was ready to recognise Israel ( though he denied this ) .
At home he put the “ twin bills ” to Parliament ; these shored up democratic control of the government and were supposed to be a launching pad for further reforms , and he was constantly dogged by conservative foes and often by the supreme leader who outranked him , controlling the army and police .
In 1998 , during the World Cup , he and Bill Clinton met to watch the Iran vs. USA match .
For a brief moment it looked like with the scent of better relationships with the US and all that would bring in the air , Iran ’s conservatives would relent and Khatami would normalise the situation .
Then , in the wake of the US embassy bombings in Kenya and Clinton ’s loss of political capital during the Lewinski affair , voices hostile to Iran , accusing it of supporting terrorism , won out and Iran was once again rejected .
It was in this time , after the first notable wave of Al Qaeda bombings that the fallacy of Iran ’s link to Islamic Terrorism was constructed .
Terrorism is a word banded about far too easily ; we hear Al Qaeda called terrorists and we hear Hezballah and Hamas called terrorists .
To the ill informed or to the Zionist , this has the effect of equating the two , one organisation set on destroying the west and creating a pure Islamic Caliphate across the Muslim world , an irreconcilable aim , and two organisations that seek to drive Israelis out of “ Arab ” land ; a focused , negotiable and in part justifiable aim .
Iran supports the latter but not the former .
Indeed it suffers from an Al Qaeda linked Sunni militant campaign because many Sunnis see the Shiite republic as an apostasy .
Iran supports terrorism of a form , but only in the way that many Americans supported the IRA and the US government supported the “ Contras ” in Nicaragua .
This false link found a new wind after September the 11th as it became used by those who wanted to expand the “ war on terror ” from Afghanistan to Iran and Iraq .
They managed to use it against Saddam ’s Iraq , a country whose links to Al Qaeda were even less likely than Iran ’s ; Bin Laden regularly listed their secular Iraqi leadership among his many grievances around the Middle East .
Of course , after 9/11 , there was no hope of reconciliation .
Khatami may have been victorious in the parliamentary elections of 2000 , where the liberals he supported gained a majority , and he had also won a second term in 2001 , but the conservatives in the regime became fearful and lashed out at the media , closing down several newspapers and threatening liberal groups .
They were helped in this first by the Clinton government ’s frostiness , then by the reckless posturing of the Bush administration .
It showed Iran ’s elite that the liberals could not deliver improvements , that it was better to stick with conservative fervour ; at least that caused fear in the markets , driving up oil prices , making them richer .
Once Iran was part of the “ Axis of Evil , ” reformers could no longer claim a clear goal internationally .
Both the US and Europe were set on ostracising the country until the regime changed , or was changed .
It was this imposed isolation , which had far more to do with the United States ’ misguided agenda than any change in Iran that led to the election of the rabble rousing nationalist and former Mayor of Tehran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Both he and the United States wanted a confrontation , they both got it , and they have both lost a lot .
The United States lost because it became clear that their democratising adventure in Iraq had failed and could not be repeated in Iran , making them look weak and allowing dictatorial allies like Saudi Arabia to fill the void and try to contain Iran , thus destroying any claim the US might have had to a principled foreign policy in the wake of September 11th .
Iran lost because its brazen leader ’s brinkmanship has taken it to greater levels of isolation because of its aggressive foreign policy , nuclear program and support for violent proxies in Iraq , Lebanon and Palestine .
What we have seen is that oft repeated spiral of belligerence , action and recrimination .
Iran continues funding Hezbollah and pursuing nuclear energy , America presses the UN for sanctions , Iran funds Hezbollah more and pushes harder for nuclear energy .
And so on , and so on .
It looks unlikely that with its present leaders Iran will take the initiative and break the trend , so we , the west , must try .
First we must acknowledge that there is no miracle cure ; Iran will not change its government , stop interfering in the region and abandon its nuclear program whatever we offer it .
Indeed , there is nothing we can do to stop the nuclear program or support for terrorism short of an invasion .
We would be pushed to do that without introducing conscription .
We can freeze bank accounts , only to see truckloads of cash transported , we can bomb facilities only to see them move further underground or to secret locations , we can impose sanctions only to see oil revenues go up due to increased worry on the market .
If Iran wants to behave badly , it will .
We know that trying to freeze them out does not work ; it only alienates liberals and strengthens extremists .
The truth is that being “ tough on Iran ” is being soft on the radicals .
What we must do is open up dialogue without precondition .
We must understand that when we tell Iran to stop meddling in Iraq , it seems hypocritical because we occupy it .
When we tell Iran to stop pursuing nuclear weapons , it seems unfair because we have them and keep quiet about Israel having them .
When we tell Iran to stop funding foreign proxies , it seems laughable because Israel is viewed as our proxy and we have tried to rule Iran for centuries through proxies .
When Mahmoud Amadinejad claims that America is “ the centre of world arrogance , ” he may have a point .
So long as the conservatives are able to use these depressingly justifiable arguments to prove the hostility of the west , we cannot hope for a friendlier Iran .
We must prove that we are no longer the enemy , offer help with their Nuclear power program , take a more balanced view on the Israel - Palestine problem , stop military posturing in the gulf and stop making it apparent that we want to overthrow their government .
Once these things are done , extremists like Ahmadinejad will be robbed of a platform and the west could no longer be used as a scapegoat .
The reformers will suddenly gain a platform with open talks ; they can claim that they have much to offer in normalised relations , trade and investment to offer the country .
The Supreme Leader would have a hard task blocking the candidacy of liberals if public opinion was against him , which it would become due to Iran ’s tenacious journalists and near universal access to the uncontrollable forums of the internet .
All in all , we must move past the old carrot and stick diplomacy that assumes Iran is a single entity like the state in North Korea , which it is not .
We cannot simply resolve to reward Iran if it behaves well and punish it if it behaves badly because punishment is a present to the extremist and tends to punish only those who want to take the country closer to the west .
The extremist can play the victim , and the liberal is the victim .
All this would not be an easy experience , we would have to deal with an unpleasant regime , it may look like we are rewarding bad behaviour , and it may look like appeasement .
But we must remember that Iran is no irrational player , bent on world domination ; it has proved time and time again a willingness to act rationally in its own interest .
It dealt with Israel during the war with Iraq , it tried to improve ties with the west in the 90s and has fostered good relationships ( until the latest round of UN condemnations ) with Russia and China .
It we make it clear that it is in their interest to work with the west , not against it , that we will stop all connivances against it , Iran will , given time , move towards us .
There are already signs that Iran is willing to make compromises to enter talks on its nuclear program , perhaps exchanging more comprehensive monitoring for help on civil nuclear power .
There is also speculation that , tired of the conflict and isolation he has brought , the elite of Iran are losing faith in Ahmadinejad ; there were rumours in the blogosphere that he was only allowed to present the release of the fifteen hostages as a reward for staying quiet for the thirteen day duration of their captivity .
There is also increasing opposition from the public , many of whom are upset by the brinkmanship ; and with oil prices having fallen in the last year , he no longer has such a strong economic prop to support the fiscal ineptitude of his government .
Do not be surprised if Ahmadinejad is persuaded not to stand for the next election in 2009 or runs and loses .
This is even more likely to happen if the next president of the US shows a greater willingness to reward Iran and a lesser willingness to condemn it .
There is a lot to hope for in the next few years , there is also a lot of danger .
It would only take one act ; the kidnap of more Iranian diplomats in Iran ( justified or not ) , a bombing of nuclear sites , an increase in Iran ’s support of Shia militias in the face of the failing surge in Iraq or an outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Iran , to push the situation to an irretrievable situation .
We must not underestimate Iran ’s ability to cause trouble ; it could easily precipitate the break - up of Iraq , supporting Shia genocide against Sunnis .
This break - up would draw Turkey into conflict with the newly independent Kurdistan , Saudi Arabia into conflict with the Shia areas south of Iraq and Iran .
We are not that far from a regional war , fought along religious sectarian lines , and we must do all we can to avoid this ; being “ tough ” with Iran is a sure road to failure .
Maybe appeasement should be given a second chance .

Social Bookmarks :
The torture techniques authorized by Rumsfeld , Bush and Cheney are not just immoral and illegal ; they are a terrible threat to our national security .
Why ?
Because they originated as a means to extract false confessions in totalitarian societies , not as a means to gain actual , workable intelligence , i.e. anything we might hope to think of as the truth .
Many of the techniques were mirror images of techniques that American soldiers had been trained to resist if captured by Viet Cong or North Korean or Soviet thugs - the famous SERE training .
They had also , of course , been used by the Nazis .
Yes , these torture methods , in most cases , left no physical marks - precisely so that captured American soldiers could be shown on television giving confessions as if they were volunteering real information .
But they were lying , of course , because torture forced them to lie .
And so , in an unknowable number of cases , have the torture - victims of the Bush administration .
One thing I 'd forgotten , of course , is one central case in which torture did give us actionable intelligence :
" Al Qaeda continues to have a deep interest in acquiring weapons of mass destruction ...
I can trace the story of a sernior terrorist operative telling how Iraq provided training in these weapons to al Qaeda .
Fortunately , this operative is now detained and he has told his story . "
The man who spoke those words was Colin Powell at the UN .
The " operative " , we now know , was Ibn al - Shaykh al - Libbi .
He was waterboarded and given Bush - approved hypothermia treatment , i.e. frozen till he could take it no longer .
It was only then that he told of al Qaeda 's links with Saddam 's WMDs .
Guess what ?
Libbi subsequently retracted his confession .
According to ABC
News , the CIA subsequently found al - Libbi " had no knowledge of such training or weapons and fabricated the statements because he was terrified of further harsh treatment . "
So I now realize that part of the reason I believed the WMD case for war against Saddam was because the Bush administration had been secretly torturing suspects and got false confessions .
The biggest intelligence failure in recent US history - the WMD case in Iraq - was partly created by the torture policy .
The same story is true of another tortured prisoner , Abu Zubaydah , as recounted in Ron Suskind 's book .
Zubaydah , as Savage reports ,
was waterboarded , beaten , threatened , subjected to mock executions , and bombarded with continuous deafening noise and harsh lighting .
Zubayhdah gave the FBI dozens of warnings of looming attacks across the US : plots to bomb shopping malls , banks , supermarkets , nuclear plants , apartment buildings , water systems .
Many of the terror alerts issued by the Bush administration were based on Zubaydah 's tortured false confessions .
See the picture ?
It 's a closed circle .
Cheney and Bush have sealed off the government from even cursory Congressional oversight ; they have instituted torture as a primary means for intelligence gathering ; and used that intelligence to justify war and more torture .
Once you enter this vortex of torture and untruth , there is no escaping it .
This is where we now find ourselves .
There is no doubt in my mind , in other words , that not only is torture evil , it is terribly dangerous for our national security .
We have expended enormous resources in fighting threats that are not there , while failing to expend the necessary resorces and time to figure out accurately what exact threats we do face .
When you hear of the intelligence extracted by torture , remember that it was the intelligence that " proved " that Saddam and WMDs and links to al Qaeda .
Tyrants get the tortured to say what they want them to say .
The point of torture is always and everywhere torture .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Better : A Surgeon 's Notes on Performance is a terrific book , especially for software developers .
Issues of efficiency , ethics , and improving personal performance are all critical to software professionals .
“ Better ” addresses them with insights that forced me to re-examine some of my own ideas and practices .
Highly recommended .
I found some folks arguing about whether developers should write messy code .
Having observed our amazing midwives “ deliver ” for the second time , I believe it is often an issue of Informed Choice .
Presuming that the client or stake holder bears the entire “ cost ” of the decision , they deserve the last word .
I know more than a few people who argue with this , saying that writing clean code is in the client ’s best interests .
Well yes , of course it is .
And in my experience , so are a number of other practices such as managing a project using Theory P using small teams , and customizing a design for the specific project .
But let ’s make this really simple : the client is asking for something which — in your professional opinion — is not in their best interests but also is not so ruinously bad that the entire project will absolutely , positively fail .
There can be a set of options that are all somewhat reasonable , with some better or much better than others , but none being outright wrong .
In midwifery , there is a choice between giving birth in the hospital or at home .
There is a choice between having an epidural or going natural .
There are choices about what to administer to the newborn as a prophylactic against infection .
The mother makes an informed decision on each of these subjects with the assistance of the midwife , and the midwife supports here even if it is a decision that the midwife feels is statistically less than optimum .
In software development , a client may wish to design everything up front .
I believe with all of my heart this is not the best way to go , but let me tell you : I have managed projects on this basis and succeeded .
I think I have done a better job managing projects another way , but I ca n’t tell you that a project absolutely has to fail if you start this way .
Likewise large teams deliver software , and some of the things I have built have had a very high buzzword - to - value ratio .
I would argue against these practices in many cases , but if the client is fully informed of the possible outcomes , they must be permitted to control their own destiny .
I know there ’s a grey area here .
If you believe the client wants things so messy and so unhygienic that you do n’t have confidence in the project , I will support your decision to say no to the client .
I applaud that .
But if it ’s in that grey area where we are arguing the difference between good and mediocre but serviceable from the client ’s perspective , I believe that my responsibility is to provide clients with the information they need to make the decision .
So for example , if they demand BDUF , I have to tell them how I think the project will actually go if we walk that line .
I need them to “ sign a consent form ” explaining that they understand the risk that we will deliver something that will meet the written requirements but will not meet their updated , educated requirements once the project is underway .
They must be clear on the fact that this choice will be a loss for them if and when they realize that the origional direction was imperfect .
I need them looking me straight in the eye and saying “ I understand what you are saying , but I am willing to take that chance .
” If they argue with me and tell me I ’m wrong , that BDUF is always better than iterative , then I know that I am not the right man for them .
I know that they are not making an informed choice .
And likewise , if asked to do something quick and dirty , I will say “ no ” if the client tells me they believe it is the best way .
But if they understand technical debt , if they know they are making a trade off of now versus later , who am I to reach into their pocket and spend their money as I see fit ?
Our midwives know much more about giving birth than we did .
And they advised us accordingly .
But we bore the responsibility for certain decisions , and they ceded those decisions to us , even when they had strong opinions about what was the best thing to do .
I think as a software developer I must follow the same path .
A midwife will not allow a client to perform a home Caesarian section .
There are limits , there are things we know mean instant and irrevocable failure .
But where judgment is required , where there is a decision between mediocre , good , and better outcomes , they advise and then allow the client to make the final say .
I believe we in software must follow the same path .
The Rolling Stone has a long article about the vast sums of taxpayer money pouring into the coffers of sleazy US contractors in Iraq — and how that money is n't being used to make things better for anyone but the ultra-rich in the US .
In short , some $ 8.8 billion of the $ 12 billion proved impossible to find .
" Who in their right mind would send 360 tons of cash into a war zone ? " asked Rep. Henry Waxman , chairman of the House Oversight Committee .
" But that 's exactly what our government did . "
Because contractors were paid on cost - plus arrangements , they had a powerful incentive to spend to the hilt .
The undisputed master of milking the system is KBR , the former Halliburton subsidiary so ubiquitous in Iraq that soldiers even encounter its customer - survey sheets in outhouses .
The company has been exposed by whistle - blowers in numerous Senate hearings for everything from double - charging taxpayers for $ 617,000 worth of sodas to overcharging the government 600 percent for fuel shipments .
When things went wrong , KBR simply scrapped expensive gear :
The company dumped 50,000 pounds of nails in the desert because they were too short , and left the Army no choice but to set fire to a supply truck that had a flat tire .
" They did not have the proper wrench to change the tire , " an Iraq vet named Richard Murphy told investigators , " so the decision was made to torch the truck . "
In perhaps the ultimate example of military capitalism , KBR reportedly ran convoys of empty trucks back and forth across the insurgent - laden desert , pointlessly risking the lives of soldiers and drivers so the company could charge the taxpayer for its phantom deliveries .
Truckers for KBR , knowing full well that the trips were bullshit , derisively referred to their cargo as " sailboat fuel . "
In an April recording , Bin Laden said the West was at war with Islam
The message said to be from the al - Qaeda leader came from a five - minute audio file on an Islamist website .
The man said he had personally assigned 19 attackers and " brother Zacarias " was not one of them .
Earlier this month , a US court jailed Moussaoui for life without parole for his role in the attacks .
" I am the one in charge of the 19 brothers and I never assigned brother Zacarias to be with them in that mission , " the voice said , in a reference to the 19 hijackers of 11 September 2001 .
" Since Zacarias Moussaoui was still learning how to fly , he was n't No 20 in the group , as your government claimed , " he said .
Moussaoui confessed because of pressure caused by over four years in prison , he said .
Moussaoui , a French citizen of Moroccan descent , pleaded guilty in April 2005 to six charges of conspiracy over the hijacking attacks on New York and Washington .
Clear statement
The man in the recording also said that none of the Guantanamo Bay detainees were connected to the attacks .
An unidentified US counterterrorism official told the Associated Press news agency that the US was aware of the message and there was no reason to doubt its authenticity .
Moussaoui has been sentenced to life without parole
If verified , the recording would be the third statement by Bin Laden this year .
On 23 April , Arab satellite TV al - Jazeera broadcast a tape purportedly from Bin Laden in which he said the West was at war with Islam .
In a tape released in a similar way in January , Bin Laden warned of further attacks on the US .
The new audio recording would also be one of the al - Qaeda leader 's clearest statements on his operational involvement in the 11 September 2001 attacks , correspondents say .
But the importance of this recording does not lie in the veracity or otherwise of its claims , says the BBC's Adam Brookes .
It lies in the fact that it is a reminder both to the Americans and to Bin Laden 's sympathisers worldwide that he remains alive , at large and a political player , our correspondent says .

Ralph Nader supports Edwards ' anti-corporate message Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday December 18 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Perennial third - party presidential candidate Ralph Nader was asked by Hardball 's Chris Matthews on Monday , " Is there anybody in this campaign you like the looks of that can win , so that you would n't have to run ? "
" I do like Kucinich .
But the frontrunners -- Edwards now has the most progressive message across a broad spectrum ... of any leading candidate I 've seen in years , " Nader replied .
" The key phrase is when he says he does n't want to replace a corporate Republican with a corporate Democrat .
...
He raises the issue of the concentration of power and wealth in a few hands that are working against the interests of the vast majority of the American people . "
" What 's the alternative to corporate power ? "
Matthews asked .
" Sovereignty of the people , " responded Nader .
" It 's people taking back their government ... cleaning up campaign corruption ... empowering workers ... controlling Congress . "
Matthews asked Nader , " Why did the corporations win all the big fights ? " and said that what concerns him even more than corporate power is the prospect of a company like Chrysler being sold to a private equity firm , which has no accountability even to shareholders .
" Wo n't we wish we had the corporations back again ? " he asked .
Nader agreed , but had no answers to suggest .
Matthews then raised the charge that Nader cost Gore the 2000 election by taking 1.63 % of the votes in Florida and that he'd violated a promise not to run in any contested states .
Nader replied that he'd always said he would run in all 50 states and insisted that " Gore won in Florida . "
Nader also argued that his own candidacy helped Gore overall .
" By pushing Gore to take more progressive policies , unlike what Lieberman wanted to do , social scientists concluded that the Green campaign got more votes for Gore , " Nader stated .
" Every time he went out after the oil , drug , insurance companies , his polls went up . "
" A lot of people think that pulled him away from the center , " Matthews commented .
" It 's a false assessment , " Nader replied , suggesting that rather than trying to preserve their monopoly over progressive voters , the Democratic Party should have stolen his 2000 platform .
" Would n't the old Democrats have taken it away and gotten more votes ? " he asked .
" Living wage , full universal health care , restructuring of the tax system , giving more voice to ordinary folks .
They did n't .
That 's the reason they lost . "
Nader concluded by emphasizing that he could not endorse Obama because " he does n't have the agenda " but that " if Edwards wins ... and he does n't back off " he might support him .
" One of my heroes , Ralph Nader , " concluded Matthews .
The following video is from MSNBC 's HARDBALL , broadcast on December 17 , 2007
Meals of all kinds , painstakingly prepared by company chefs , are free at the company 's headquarters in Mountain View , Calif. , a modern corporate campus known as the Googleplex .
Other amenities there include children 's day care , doctors , dry cleaning , laundry , a gym , and basketball and volleyball courts .
Maternity or paternity leave is 12 weeks at 75 percent of full pay .
There is also up to $ 500 available for takeout meals for the entire family after a newborn arrives , courtesy of Google .
Shuttle buses ( with wireless Internet access for working while commuting ) ferry employees to the Googleplex from throughout the Bay area .
And the big perk : the company 's engineers are given 20 percent of their time to pursue their own ideas instead of company assignments .
The company is currently hiring about 10 people a day , adding to a workforce of more than 5,000 .
The essence of the Google pitch , said Shona L. Brown , vice president of operations , is : " Hey , come join us doing really exciting things .
We 're trying to change the world . "
That prospect proved appealing to Paul Rademacher , 31 , who came to Google in September from DreamWorks , where he worked on the software behind movies like " Shrek 2 " and " Madagascar . "
Mr. Rademacher caught the attention of Google executives with a Web site he built on his own , www.housingmaps.com, which links Google 's mapping software with property listings on Craigslist , the online bulletin board , to display houses and neighborhoods .
After talking to Google engineers and executives , Mr. Rademacher came away impressed that the company was a place that gave people " room to do great things . "
At Google , he is working on new products that remain secret .

Six state legislatures are defying a federal law requiring new driver 's licenses that aim to prevent identity theft , fraud and terrorism .
The states have passed laws in the past two months , saying the federal law has a steep cost and invades privacy by requiring 240 million Americans to get highly secure licenses by 2013 .
The 9/11 Commission urged the first standards for licenses to stop fraud and terrorists such as the Sept. 11 hijackers , who lied on residency statements to get licenses and state IDs .
Lawmakers in Maine , Montana , New Hampshire , Oklahoma , South Carolina and Washington say new standards would be expensive to implement and result in a national ID card that compromises privacy .
The National Conference of State Legislatures estimates that it will cost states more than $ 11 billion .
State resistance has drawn criticism from the Homeland Security Department .
" I cannot imagine a state official anywhere that would want to have to testify before Congress about … how their non-compliant licenses contributed to a terrorist attack , " department spokesman Russ Knocke said .
Knocke said the federal government can't force states to comply .
But he said each state 's residents are likely to bring pressure on their local governments when they learn they 'll be barred from boarding airplanes because their state 's licenses do n't meet federal standards .
Airline passengers can use other government photo identification , such as passports and military IDs .
Some lawmakers say any inconvenience is outweighed by the cost and potential privacy invasion for each state to create a photo database of license holders .
" The people of New Hampshire are adamantly opposed to any kind of ' papers - please ' society reminiscent of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia , " said Neal Kurk , a Republican state representative from New Hampshire .
" This is another effort of the federal government to keep track of all its citizens . "
The federal law requires everyone to renew licenses by 2013 with documents showing their Social Security number and home address , and that they are in the USA legally .
State Sen. Larry Martin , a Republican from South Carolina , said the law will overwhelm states by requiring agencies to verify documents such as birth certificates .
The defiance by six states could force Congress to reconsider the law , said Barry Steinhardt of the American Civil Liberties Union .
" You can't have a national ID card if the residents of six states wo n't have one , " Steinhardt said .

The co-pilot of a Heathrow - bound passenger flight had to be dragged from the cockpit and handcuffed after suffering an apparent mental breakdown in mid-air , it emerged yesterday .
Passengers on the Air Canada flight from Toronto to London said the co-pilot was restrained after yelling and " invoking God " while at the controls of the Boeing 767 plane more than 30,000 feet above the Atlantic .
The flight was forced to make an emergency diversion to Ireland 's Shannon airport early on Monday and the unnamed crew member was taken to a nearby psychiatric unit .
Sean Finucane , one of 146 passengers on board , said the co-pilot was carried into the cabin with his hands and ankles cuffed after he was restrained by cabin crew and a passenger , reported to be an off - duty Canadian soldier .
The crew member was then handcuffed to a seat as his captain requested permission to land from Irish air traffic authorities .
" He was very , very distraught .
He was yelling loudly , " Finucane told Canadian broadcaster CBC .
" His voice was clear , he did n't sound like he was drunk or anything , but he was swearing and asking for God .
He specifically said he wants to talk to God . "
It is understood that crew first became concerned less than an hour before they were due to arrive at Heathrow , when the pilot began " speaking loudly to himself and acting in a peculiar fashion " , according to one source .
The co-pilot was taken by ambulance from the airport to a psychiatric unit .
Passengers on flight AC848 were taken off the plane to a hotel while a replacement crew flew to Shannon .
The flight arrived at Heathrow eight hours late .
An Air Canada spokesman confirmed that the flight captain had requested a " medical diversion " to Shannon .
" The co-pilot fell ill during the flight and the captain elected to divert to Shannon , " he said .
" The aircraft landed without incident .
At no time was the safety of the passengers or crew in question .
The flight was met by medical personnel and the individual is now in care . "
A spokesman for Shannon airport said : " We were advised that a crew member was unwell and that was the reason for the diversion . "
Members of the co-pilot 's family and a representative of the Air Canada Pilots ' Association flew to Shannon yesterday .
" Although the illness of flight crew is rare , pilots are fully trained for such an event , " said Captain Andy Wilson , president of ACPA .
" The safe diversion was the result of the pilot following standard operating procedures in the professional manner that is expected of Air Canada pilots . "
Transport Canada , the national body in charge of aviation safety , has opened an investigation and will interview the flight crew .
Canadian pilots must undergo a medical check every six months as a condition of their licence .
In 1999 a New York - bound EgyptAir flight crashed into the Atlantic shortly after the co-pilot , who was controlling the plane , was heard to say " I put my faith in God " as the autopilot was switched off .
The plane then plunged into a steep dive and crashed into the sea , killing 217 people .
Following Karl Rove ’s appearance this morning on “ Meet The Press ” David Gregory ( who is involved in the Plame scandal .
More on that later . ) held a round table discussion which included former Time Magazine reporter Matt Cooper .

Gregory : Matt Cooper , let ’s pick up on an aspect of the interview with , with Karl Rove having to do with the leak case , the CIA leak case , that you were part of as well .
And something ’s that ’s very interesting , he , he went out of his way to say , “ I would not have been a confirming source on this kind of information ” and taking issue with , with Novak ’s testimony in his column that he knew who Valerie Plame was .
He said he would never confirm that information .
That ’s different from your experience with him .
Cooper : Yeah , I , I think he was dissembling , to put it charitably .
Look , Karl Rove told me about Valerie Plame ’s identity on July 11th , 2003 .
I called him because Ambassador Wilson was in the news that week .
I did n’t know Ambassador Wilson even had a wife until I talked to Karl Rove and he said that she worked at the agency and she worked on WMD .
I mean , to imply that he did n’t know about it or that this was all the leak …
Gregory :
Or that he had heard it from somebody else …
Cooper : … by someone else , or he heard it as some rumor out in the hallway is , is nonsense .
Gregory :
But he makes no apologies to Valerie Plame .
Cooper : Karl Rove never apologizes .
That ’s not what he does ..

Newsweek has a fantastic article on the psychology and neuroscience behind the politics of fear which draws directly on examples from the current and past US elections .
American politics in particular it seems , has , in recent years , used fear as a way of trying to motivate voters and support particular candidates .
The Newsweek article looks at why fear is such a potent force in decision - making and what psychology research has shown us about how invoking concepts of death or threat actually affects our reasoning and desires .
“ When we ’re insecure , we want our leaders to have what ’s called an ‘ unconflicted personality ’ , ” says political psychologist Jeff Greenberg of the University of Arizona .
“ Bush was very clear in his beliefs and had no doubts , but Kerry was painted as a flip - flopper …
That real - world observation has been replicated in lab studies .
In one experiment Greenberg and colleagues ran during the 2004 campaign , volunteers who completed a questionnaire that reminded them about their own inevitable death ( how thoughts of their own death made them feel and what they thought would happen to them physically after they died ) expressed greater support for Bush than voters of similar leanings who were not reminded of mortality .
The researchers also found that subliminal reminders of death increased support for Bush ( and decreased support for Kerry ) even among liberals .
It ’s not clear if such responses in the lab would endure in an actual voting booth .
So perhaps one should not be too cynical about the decision by the Department of Homeland Security to raise the terror - threat level on Election Day 2004 .
“ Political use of fear is not something new , ” says NYU ’s LeDoux .
“ But certainly the ante has been upped .
We ’ve gone from ‘ vote for me or you ’ll end up poor ’ to ‘ vote for me or you ’ll end up dead ’ . ”
Documentary maker Adam Curtis argued in his three - part series The Power of Nightmares ( video : parts one , two , three ) that since the cold war politicians across the globe have been attempting to promote the idea of foreign threats so they can then promise to deliver us from them .
Curtis is by no means a neutral commentator , but as he ’s demonstrated with a number of his documentaries , his analysis of politics as an essentially psychological process is an interesting take on world affairs .
My only reservation about the Newsweek piece is that it takes the somewhat simplistic line that the amygdala equals fear in the brain .
The amygdala must have the worst PR of all of the brain structures , but to set the record straight , there ’s more to the amygdala than fear , and more to fear than the amygdala .
Neurophilosophy has a guide to the neurobiology of fear if you want an overview of the wider fear circuits in the brain , and Current Biology has a freely available article which is a primer on the amygdala .
You may be interested to know that this almond shaped brain area is also involved in a range of positive emotional states , so it ’s not all doom and gloom .

Dispute between neighbors – this is a true story .
A city councilman in Utah , Mark Easton , had a beautiful view of the east Mountains until a new neighbor purchased the lot below his house and built a new home .
The home was 18 inches higher than the ordinances would allow , so Mark Easton , mad about his lost view , went to the city to make sure they enforced the lower roof line ordinance .
The new neighbor had to drop the roof line at great expense .
Recently , Mark Easton called the city , and informed them that his new neighbor had installed some vents on the side of his home .
Mark did not like the looks of the vents and asked the city to investigate .
When they went to Mark ’s home to view the vents , this is what they found …………… …
HERE IS MARK’S VIEW NOW !
ARE YOU MAD NOW , MARK ?

On the morning of April Fools ' Day 2005 , I woke up in a sexual addiction treatment centre in a suburb of Philadelphia .
As I limped out of the drab dog's bed in which I was expected to sleep for the next 30 wankless nights , I observed the previous incumbent had left a thread of dental floss by the pillow - most likely as a noose for his poor , famished dinkle .
When I 'd arrived the day before , the counsellors had taken away my copy of the Guardian , as there was a depiction of the Venus de Milo in the arts section , but let me keep the Sun , which obviously had a page 3 lovely .
What kind of pervert police force censors a truncated sculpture but lets Keeley Hazell pass without question ?
" Blimey , this devious swine 's got a picture of a concrete bird with no arms - hanging 's too good for him ! "
If they were to censor London town , they would ignore Soho but think that the statue of Alison Lapper in Trafalgar Square had been commissioned by Caligula .
Being all holed up in the aptly named KeyStone clinic ( while the facility did not have its own uniformed police force , the suggestion of bungling silent film cops is appropriate ) was an all too familiar drag .
Not that I 'd ever been incarcerated in sex chokey before , Lord no , but it was the umpteenth time that I 'd been confronted with the galling reality that there are things over which I have no control and people who can force their will upon you .
Teachers , sex police , actual police , drug counsellors : people who can make you sit in a drugless , sexless cell either real or metaphorical and ponder the actuality of life 's solitary essence .
In the end it 's just you .
Alone .
The necessity for harsh self - assessment was n't the only thing I hated about that KeyStone place .
No , that vied for supremacy with multitudinous bastard truths .
I hated my bed : the mattress was sponge , and you had to stretch your own sheet over this miserable little single divan in the corner of the room .
And I hated the room itself where the strangled urges of onanism clung to the walls like mildew .
I particularly hated the American grey squirrels that were running around outside - just free , like idiots , giggling and touching each other in the early spring sunshine .
The triumph of these little divs over our noble red British squirrel had become a searing metaphor for my own subjugation at the hands of the anti-fuck Yanks .
To make my surrender to conformity more official , I had been obliged to sign a contract promising that I would refrain from masturbation , porn , " seductive behaviour " and " sexual contact with another person " .
I should have been photographed signing it , like when a footballer joins a new team .
Sex is recreational for me , as well as a way of accruing status and validation ( even before I attained the unique accolade of " Shagger of the Year " from the Sun .
We all need something to help us unwind at the end of the day .
You might have a glass of wine , or a joint , or a big delicious blob of heroin to silence your silly brainbox of its witterings , but there has to be some form of punctuation , or life just seems utterly relentless .
And this is what sex provides for me - a breathing space , when you 're outside of yourself and your own head .
Especially in the actual moment of climax , where you literally go , " Ah , there 's that , then .
I 've unwound .
I 've let go . "
Not without good reason do the French describe an orgasm as a " little death " .
That 's exactly what it is for me ( in a good way , obviously ) - a little moment away , a holiday from my head .
So why would a fella who plainly enjoys how's yer father as much as I do go to a so - called " sex camp " ?
Many people are sceptical about the idea of what I like to call " sexy addiction " , thinking it a spurious notion , invented primarily to help Hollywood film stars evade responsibility for their priapic excesses .
But I reckon there is such a thing .
Addiction , by definition , is a compulsive behaviour that you cannot control or relinquish , in spite of its destructive consequences .
And if my life proves nothing else , it demonstrates that this formula can be applied to sex just as easily as it can be to drugs or alcohol , both of which I know more than a bit about .
At one point , about five years ago , I had a harem of about 10 women , whom I would rotate in addition to one - night stands and random casual encounters .
But shagging - incessant as it was - no longer seemed to have the required calming effect .
I was on the brink of becoming sufficiently well known for my carnal overindulgences - with lapdancers and prostitutes , to say nothing of all the women who did n't sell sex for a living - to cause me professional difficulties .
There 's nothing especially peculiar or odd about my erotic predilections .
It 's the scale of my sexual endeavours that causes the problems , not the nature of them .
I just like girls , all different ones , in an unsophisticated , unevolved way , like a Sun reader or a yobbo at a bus stop in Basildon , perhaps because , at my core , that 's what I am .
I 'm a bloke from Grays with a good job and a terrific haircut who 's been given a Wonka ticket to a lovely sex factory ' cos of the ol ' fame , and while Augustus Gloop drowns and Veruca Salt goes blue , I 'm cleaning up , I 'm rinsin ' it baby !
I have n't always treated women well - more than one relationship has collapsed because of my infidelity - but to this day I feel a fierce warmth for women who have the same disregard for the social conventions of sexual protocol as I do .
I love it when I meet a woman and her sexuality is dancing across her face , so it 's apparent that all we need to do is nod and find a cupboard .
My manager , John Noel - think of a big , kind , lovely , vicious bastard , like a Darth Vader from Manchester running a school for disadvantaged children - who had previously successfully forced me into drug rehabilitation , thought a little stretch in winky - nick would do me the power of good , and used threats , bullying , love and blackmail to make me go .
I eventually agreed for the same reason that I had given up drink and drugs - because my ambition is the most powerful force within me .
While some celebrities have " yes men " surrounding them , I have " fuck - off " men .
And so John spitefully decided not to send me to some sort of celebrity treatment centre , like the world - renowned Meadows Clinic in Arizona , but a facility where not all the places were private , where a certain proportion of people were there on judicial programmes - " jail - swerves " , they call them , when you 're a drug addict and you 're offered a choice of prison or rehab .
The same option exists for the terminally saucy - get treatment or go to prison ; in prison there 'll be much more sex but it could err on the side of coercive .
I had no idea of what to expect when I arrived at KeyStone , although I 'd spoken to one of the counsellors several times on the phone - the reassuringly named Travis Flowers .
I told Travis about the lack of control I was exercising over who I was having sex with .
I was pursuing hanky - panky like it was a job , like there was a league table that I had to be at the summit of .
And as I explained how I toiled each day with the diligence of Bobby Moore and the grit of Julian Dicks , humming slave songs to keep my spirits up , Travis reassured me that I was just the sort of person who needed KeyStone 's help .
The clinic was in the middle of this square in some quiet Philadelphia suburb .
The house looked like a normal American family home does - you know , where they 've got the sloping roof to the porch bit and gardens around it , a bit like where the Waltons lived , all pastoral and sweet , but with John - Boy chained up in the mop cupboard scrabbling around trying to fiddle with his goolies through a mask of tears .
Over the road there was a church : a modern grey building , which constantly played a recording of church bells .
Strange it was .
Why no proper bells ?
I never went in but I bet it was a robot church for androids , where the Bible was in binary and their Jesus had laser eyes and metal claws .
I was greeted on the steps of the clinic by one of the counsellors .
I can't remember her name , but she was wearing a T - shirt with frogs on .
It turned out she was obsessed with 'em , and when I asked her why she said , " When I was a kid , there was a pond near my house which all the frogs would try to get back to , and they'd get killed crossing over the road , so I used to try and help them across . "
" Fucking hell , " I thought .
" D'ya wanna have a clearer analogy etched on your T - shirt ?
How troublingly apposite that your mission in life should now be to save people from destruction as they pursue their natural instinct to spawn . "
At this point , the frog - lady introduced me to a subdued and pinch - faced individual .
" Arthur will show you around , " she said cheerfully .
" He 's gonna be your roommate . "
( In the film , Arthur would be played by Rick Moranis or William H Macy . )
Arthur showed me round the kitchen with its horrible meaty American meals .
Meals which I , as a vegetarian , could n't eat , so I would have to live on fruit for the month , like a little ape .
One by one , I began to meet more of my fellow clients , or patients , or inmates , or perverts - whatever you want to call them , including an intimidating Puerto Rican cove who looked like a hybrid of Colin Farrell 's " Bullseye " character from the film Daredevil and Bill Sykes 's dog in Oliver Twist ( whose name was also Bullseye , strangely enough ) , who kept calling me " London " - " Hey , London ! " I resented being called " London " .
There are eight million people living in London , and my identity , I hope , is quite specific .
He addressed me the same way he would 've Ken Livingstone or Danny Baker - God knows what they'd be doing there .
I 'm not even from London ; I 'm from Essex .
( Though I suppose " Essex " would have been even less appropriate - it has , after all , got the three letters " s - e - x " in it and that 's what caused all this bother . )
This demeaning and geographically inaccurate mode of address was just one aspect of what soon began to seem like a concerted campaign to dismantle every element of my persona .
It was not just my copy of the Guardian that had been confiscated on my arrival , but also my Richard Pryor CDs and my William Burroughs novel .
And I 'd not been at KeyStone long before my attire began to attract complaints .
Apparently , the way my excess belt hung in front of my crotch was confusing and enticing to the pervert fraternity as it suggested a phallus .
So they censored me .
I was like Elvis " the Pelvis " Presley on Ed Sullivan , I tells ya , punished for the crime of being sexy .
As the days went on , I started to learn why other people were in there .
I found out that Arthur was a paedophile who had eloped with his 13 - year - old foster daughter .
If he went back to Arizona to face the charges , he'd be in line for either lifetime imprisonment or execution .
Peter , a well groomed , silver - bearded Christopher Lee figure , had had sex with his wife 's sister when she was 12 .
These revelations came as a bit of a blow and made me question the rationale of the whole dashed trip .
" OK , " I thought , " I 've a bit of an eye for the ladies , now as a kind of punishment I 'm rooming with a paedophile .
Is that gonna be helpful ? "
Like them lads that get sent down for nicking a car radio and end up sharing a cell with a diligent bank robber mentor who schools them in criminality .
I went down to the office and started making frantic phone - calls home , saying , " Get me out of this place . "
If I 'd been less terrified I might 've paused to dream up a new reality show format , I'm a Celebrity , Get Me Out of This Demented Sex Centre " , where minor faces off the box are forced to doss down with , say , Peter Sutcliffe for the amusement of an apathetic nation .
John was on holiday , and no one I spoke to was prepared to sanction my departure so , out of fear , desperation and a kind of morbid curiosity , I decided to stay .
It 's extraordinary how quickly you get institutionalised in that kind of environment .
You start wearing , not pyjamas exactly , as you do get dressed , but certainly indoorsy sorts of clothes .
They have meetings every morning and afternoon .
The rituals are astonishing .
You have to go round the room introducing yourself - " Hello , I 'm Russell " - and then admitting to your recent transgressions .
These are n't really wrongdoings as we would normally understand them , more everyday actions that have developed a sexual component : " I had an erotic thought " ; " I experienced eroticised rage " ; or " I did some eroticised humour " .
Then you 'd round the whole thing off by saying , " My goal for today is to get through the KeyStone experience and just live it as best I can . "
People began to customise this closing declaration , I suppose as a way of emphasising their own particular characters .
But far from lessening the institutional feel of the whole proceedings , it kind of exacerbated it .
Soon enough , each person seemed to have their own slogan : " Hello , I 'm Stuart , and I 'm gonna swim like a KeyStone dolphin . "
These customised slogans would often be drawn from the totemic cuddly toy that we were each obliged to select from the mantelpiece .
I had a camel .
Or someone else would say , " I'm gonna ride the KeyStone Express , " and all the others would make supportive train - noises - " Wooh !
Wooh ! "
And I 'd be sat there in the middle thinking , " Oh great , I 'm in a nuthouse . "
In that situation , however , alienated from my normal surroundings , I realised that the outer surface of what I thought was my unique , individual identity was just a set of routines .
We all have an essential self , but if you spend every day chopping up meat on a slab , and selling it by the pound , soon you 'll find you 've become a butcher .
And if you do n't want to become a butcher ( and why would you ? ) , you 're going to have to cut right through to the bare bones of your own character in the hope of finding out who you really are .
Which bloody hurts .
Perhaps you 're wondering what formulated my peculiar sexuality ?
It ai n't that peculiar .
I 'm a bloke from Essex who likes birds with big bottoms and big boobs , lovely dolly birds .
I do n't mean to be dismissive - they might be incredibly dark , fretful Sylvia Plath - style heroines for all I know - but if they are , I 'd rather not find out because life 's difficult enough .
The episode that defined my relations with women - and with myself - occurred in Hong Kong with my dad .
I was 17 .
His third marriage had just broken up , so he needed someone to go on holiday with .
I was unemployed , penniless , birdless and desperate for his approval ; we were the perfect holiday companions .
On the plane home he said , " I went away with a boy and came back with a man . "
Both of those people were me , so what happened to induce such a significant transition ?
In addition to Hong Kong we visited Bali , Singapore and Thailand , and in all those places we saw incredible things .
There was only one sight I was interested in seeing .
Or rather one thing I was inerested in doing , repeatedly .
One thing that chewed its way into my barren little soul and gave me , at long last , a physical pursuit that I was good at .
Sex .
Disposable sex , sex as leisure , sex for pleasure , sex you sordid little treasure , drag me from monotony and give me kicks too hot to measure .
On day one in Hong Kong we went to some sleazy dive hidden behind a thick black drape where women from the east traipsed louchely along the mirrored promenade in garish beachwear .
That promenade was a conveyor belt from which produce could be selected ; I did n't know that then but my cock did , twitching , preparing frantically , trying to recall correct procedure .
" This is not a drill , repeat , this is not a drill . "
My dad sat there next to me , familiar with this glistening and foreign terrain .
I did n't understand what I was witnessing , but by jingo , I knew I liked it .
Dumbstruck , I sat looking at the women , their hair , each strand identifiable as it responded to a fan that had been placed there to elicit exactly the reaction I felt in my pantaloons , their toenails , painted and perfect , each solitary toe a match for me .
They did n't seem enslaved or exploited - to me they were n't ; they were mistresses , goddesses , salvation .
" I can't wait to tell my mates that I saw these women in swimsuits , " I said to myself .
Before long , I was sat on a barstool with a Filipino girl called Mary - Lou , or something similarly unlikely .
I thought , " I can't wait to tell my mates I was sat talking to Mary - Lou . "
That quickly became , " I can't wait to tell my mates I was kissing her . "
Then we were leaving , a street , a cab , perfume , hairspray , the three Asian prostitutes that my dad was drunkenly herding - Mary - Lou , another girl and the madam of the club , who had come along just for sport ( when I learned that she 'd come along without payment , I thought that a testimony to my dad 's powers ) .
Back at our hotel room , my dad set about unwrapping his two prostitutes , like pass - the - parcel where the music never stopped , and I sat nervously on the edge of the other twin bed with Mary - Lou , kissing her and thinking she was beautiful and falling in love .
I 'd only had anything close to sex once before - a week before my 16th birthday .
I 'd been careful to cultivate an image of myself as an aristocratic sex - pert , but she must have known I was a virgin as soon as the bungling encounter commenced .
In Hong Kong , I was naked and shy about my body .
I had trouble getting hard , and the blow job seemed daft , not sexual , just giggly and intrusive .
After the un-sex , I carried Mary - Lou in my weedy arms out on to the balcony to look at the view of a great , looming skyscraper , disapprovingly observing .
Mary - Lou did n't make me feel embarrassed , and was incredibly romantic really , given the context .
I stroked Mary - Lou 's hair and kissed her cheek and traced my finger down her perfect nose , scored by the cacophony from the adjacent bedlam , " Yeah , come on ! " and " Phwooar , you 're juicy ! "
As she was about to go , she said expertly , " Russell , I must leave now before I fall in love with you . "
My heart skipped , and I heard , " Oh , fucking hell , I 'm gonna be sick " - a disapproving announcement from dear old Ron .
The next morning , my dad , concealed behind a newspaper , folded down the top right - hand corner .
" Did you wear a condom with that bird last night ? "
" Oh , no I did n't , Dad . "
He sniffed , " You should 've . "
Then the corner of the page flicked up once again , and he was gone .
In the course of the rest of that holiday , I had sex with loads more prostitutes ; always got a hard on , never wore a condom , and never fell in love .
In Bangkok , when bar girls in Patpong left their posts to follow me down the street , cooing and touching my hair , I felt that I had my dad 's unequivocal approval .
When I came back from Asia , I was much more comfortable around women , and my sexuality had morphed forever from bewildered innocence into something more complex and rapacious .
Once my career as a comedian and TV presenter started to pick up , I began to have loads of encounters after gigs .
As my sexual appetite grew , I found myself engaged in an increasingly desperate quest to satisfy it .
I became so open to suggestion that when someone asked me if I 'd like to go to an orgy , I did n't think twice before accepting this invitation .
The word " orgy " is undeniably an evocative one .
It conjures up sumptuous images of delicate muslin drapes being teased by a breeze , Turkish music playing everywhere ( in fact my whole orgy scenario seems to have been lifted pretty much wholesale from a Turkish Delight advert ) , nubile Nubian women entwined about each other like a Henry Moore statue , people decadently devouring grapes .
I thought there 'd probably be a sort of Swiss bloke with no irises or pupils in his eyes as well , just kind of staring .
But what I got in a tower block in Hackney was people who looked like they were made out of Ready Brek , swathed in clingfilm , waddling back and forth with towels about their waists .
And everywhere there was this intangible sadness , as if the orgy was being directed by Mike Leigh .
I remember this woman came bustling out of a doorway when I first got there - she reminded me of my mum , which did n't help - and said , " Just done my second . . . better go and rinse my mouth out . "
Then a washing - machine repair man turned up - not as a guest , but to repair the washing - machine .
It was to rescue me from these kinds of grisly scenarios that John Noel sent me to KeyStone .
And I 'm glad he did .
One day I had to write a victims ' list - a litany of the women I 'd wronged as a result of my sexual addiction .
I felt like Saddam Hussein trying to pick out individual Kurds .

The Caffeinated Coder posted an interesting item today about a psychology study that shows that less competent people are generally over confident about their abilities by around 50 % .
Giggles about management aside , I 've seen this bear out in my experiences .
The study showed that the only way to make incompetent people understand that they did n't know what they were talking about was to educate them about the domain .
Only then , did they truly understand how foolish they sounded .
This reminds me of something I look out for when interviewing Java developers .
I have made it my business to get down deep and dirty on the nuances of the Singleton .
I believe it is important for developers to do some sort of coding during the interview process .
Typically I will stub out a class for candidates and ask them to fill in the rest :
public class SingletonTest {
// ... code goes here ...
public static void main ( String [ ] args ) {
// Your task , should you choose to accept it , is to make this line of code work
SingletonTest st = SingletonTest.getInstance ( ) ;
}
}
Most folks know the Singleton .
If they do n't then I will explain it , but will probably not hire them because not knowing the GoF Design Patterns is a candidate smell to me .
After they have filled it in , I will ask questions along the lines of :
Why is the constructor private , and not package or protected level access ?
What are some of the alternative ways of initializing the single instance ?
Is this class threadsafe ?
For a static class variable with an initializer ( private static SingletonTest instance = new SingletonTest ( ) ) , when does the object get created ?
If we make the constructor protected and extend the class with a new class SingletonTestPlusPlus and then call SingletonTestPlusPlus.getInstance ( ) , what is the type of variable st in main - SingletonTest or SingletonTestPlusPlus ?
Trace the call stack with me at initialization time .
Would SingletonTestPlusPlus 's constructor be called before or after SingletonTest's ?
Most people ace the code , and easily answer # 1 .
I 'm amazed how difficult # 2 seems to be , but eventually people will figure out there is more than one way to initialize a class variable .
By the time we get to # 3 and # 4 it starts thinning out pretty dramatically .
I rarely get to # 5 or # 6 .
The point of this exercise is not for the candidate to get everything right , but to see how they operate when they do n't know an answer .
My observation is that the more competent you are , the more intelligent a conversation you can have , and that is really what I 'm looking for here .
I like to see candidates who are on a voyage of discovery , buoyed by a passion for knowledge and personal improvement .
I certainly do n't mind push back either - I think that is a good sign .
You should not simply accept what anyone is telling you if it goes against everything you know and hold true .
At the same time , you need to have an open mind and be willing to learn - that is the sign of a competent person .
One candidate I had called me out on the relevance of the Singleton and said he would write a Service Locator implementation instead .
For the record , I think the Singleton is pretty much irrelevant in these days of Dependency Injection , but the candidate could not be convinced to write one in spite of my agreeing with him .
That candidate was a " no hire " .
Over the years I 've had some interesting technical " discussions " .
No one has thrown a punch at me yet [ 1 ] , but there has been some interesting and heated debates about the relative merits of lazy initialization over static initializers , or where the curly bracket should be , or double checked locking idioms , or why the main method in Java is so verbose .
Reminds me of something my mother is fond of saying : " Ignorance is bliss " .
But then again , she was a teacher ...
[ 1 ] I once worked with a project manager who got into a fight with a candidate during an interview and punches were thrown .
Perhaps the fact that he was a pompous , self righteous , git had something to do with it .
One of the most valuable but least mourned traditions destroyed by the George W. Bush administration is the quaint notion that the government wo n't do stuff that 's against the law .
It used to be the case that Congress could outlaw something , and by virtue of it being outlawed , it could safely be assumed that -- for the most part , at least -- government and political actors would n't do that thing .
Because it was against the law .
And this country was governed by the rule of law .
The stain of criminality would be too much for publicly elected officials to withstand .
Well , here 's a sampling from just this week of things that we used to assume would never happen -- least of all to what used to be our most cherished civil liberties -- but happened anyway , and for which there 's really no particular punishment , and for which the current political climate promises no particular remedy :
The ADVISE system , announced as scrapped this week by the Department of Homeland Security .
The Analysis , Dissemination , Visualization , Insight and Semantic Enhancement program was : one of the broadest of 12 data - mining projects in the agency ... able to ingest 1 billion pieces per hour of structured information , such as databases of cargo shippers , and 1 million pieces per hour from unstructured text , such as government intelligence reports .
Why was it scrapped ?
Pilot tests of the program were quietly suspended in March after Congress ' Government Accountability Office warned that " the ADVISE tool could misidentify or erroneously associate an individual with undesirable activity such as fraud , crime or terrorism . "
Oh , really ?
Then do you think this was a good way to test the system ?
Homeland Security 's inspector general and the DHS privacy office discovered that tests used live data about real people rather than made - up data for one to two years without meeting privacy requirements .
Of course not !
Even Joementum agrees : Sen. Joseph Lieberman , I - Conn. , chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee , said DHS " must follow federal privacy laws — in this case the E - Government Act which requires privacy impact assessments before personal information can be used — in order to maintain public support for these new technologies . "
Must follow federal privacy laws .
Unless it does n't .
In which case Senator Lieberman will do ... what , exactly ?
Right .
National Security Letters , struck down as unconstitutional in federal court yesterday .
The same National Security Letters that you may recall were found back in March to have been wildly abused by the FBI .
Unchecked , rampant abuse .
Unconstitutional abuse of power .
And even the nation 's top law enforcement official lying to Congress about it .
The inspector general 's report prompted an uproar in Congress because Attorney General Alberto Gonzales had testified that there had not been a reported instance of Patriot Act powers being abused .
Later , it turned out Gonzales had been aware of the problems with the National Security Letters .
The penalty ?
A tidy retirement package for Abu Gonzales , secured while Congress twiddled its thumbs and maybe , sorta , kinda considered forcing him out instead of holding the door for him .
The Federal Records Act and the Presidential Records Act , which both require that the White House preserve records of its official e-mail traffic .
You remember , right ?
The e-mails that the Congress has been seeking with its " subpoena power , " but which the " administration " says it lost ?
Five million times over ?
Turns out they just , you know , did n't feel like complying with that law , either .
And what 's the remedy ?
The National Security Archive is suing the White House .
In the meantime , Henry Waxman is investigating , but guess what ?
The White House says it 's not it 's fault , because the archiving required by law was contracted out .
To whom ?
They wo n't tell !
The law requires that these things be preserved .
But what 's the penalty for just not doing it ?
Nobody knows .
In Iran -Contra , we found out that there were no particular penalties described in the Presidential Records Act .
And nobody 's changed that .
It 's just ... against the law .
And that 's just a sampling of this week 's action .
I did n't even get to the " administration 's " continued intransigence over its application of various " national security " and " state secrets " pleadings , which took a hit in court this week too , in connection with the ACLU 's FOIA suit over the other domestic spying programs .
All of this must , unfortunately , also be considered in the context of Congressional maneuvering on Iraq as well .
Why ?
Because next week Congress is set to hear testimony from General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker which many observers believe will be misleading at best , and full of outright lies at worst .
And this is Congressionally mandated testimony .
A report required by law in the last Iraq supplemental .
To be delivered , in fact , under the signature of the president .
Full of benchmarks and requirements , but no benchmarks or requirements that the reports and testimony be truthful or empirically sound .
Because we still take that stuff for granted , even though this " administration " has made a mockery of that assumption too many times to count , and certainly too many times for the Congress to have forgotten .
And yet , there it is .
And there 's more coming , too .
With another $ 200 billion supplemental on the table , Congress will shortly consider still more guidelines , reporting requirements , and anything - but - timetables .
Given the record , dare we even hope that this time , they 'll be viewed as obligations and not merely annoyances that can safely be disposed of with yet another cloud of obfuscation , stonewalling , and outright bullshit ?
People often ask me to predict how long newspapers can survive in the Internet age .
Ten years ago I believed newspapers would last another five years .
Clearly I am not qualified to make this sort of prediction .
But being unqualified has never dampened my enthusiasm for publicly embarrassing myself .
I think it ’s time to take another run at this prediction .
First , it must be noted that old technologies sometimes evolve to stay relevant .
For example , radio evolved from something the family listens to in the living room to something that individuals ( mostly ) listen to in the car .
There ’s some chance that newspapers could evolve in a totally unexpected way and thrive for a hundred years .
Let me paint a picture that seems most likely to me .
I predict that the end of printed newspapers will happen in the time it takes for most people to upgrade their cell phones two more times .
The iPhone , and its inevitable copycats , ( let ’s call them iClones ) are newspaper killers .
When you have a web browser in your pocket , a printed newspaper is redundant .
Eventually , all cell phones will have Internet browsing built in .
You might not have a web browser on your next cell phone , but the one after that will have it as a standard feature .
Most people prefer to read a printed page versus a computer screen .
A cell phone screen is the worst of all .
But newspapers will collapse as a business long before 100 % of iPhone and iClone owners give up their printed newspaper subscriptions .
I do n’t know if it will take 20 % of iPhone / iClone owners to cancel their subscriptions , or if it will take 60 % , but whatever the number , it seems likely we will reach it .
Then the printed newspaper will disappear .
The iPhone and iClones have several advantages over regular newspapers .
The news on the Internet is mostly free , and updated by the minute .
Your cell phone can include video clips , and the news can be filtered for your personal preferences .
Browsing web pages on a phone is slow at the moment , but the speed will improve .
I predict one more innovation in cell phones that is the real wild card for newspapers .
I ’m sure someone has already invented this in a lab or written about it in a science fiction book , but it ’s a somewhat obvious idea .
Let 's call it a Venetian screen .
Imagine your cell phone equipped with a built - in scroll of “ digital paper ” that pulls out to the side , like a sideways Venetian blind , for reading web pages and documents .
It would look like this .
( click to enlarge )
That will solve the issue of phone screens being too tiny to read .
Your phone would still have a regular screen for most purposes , but for pleasure reading , you pull out the Venetian screen with its larger and clearer text .
In this imagined future , the newspaper publishers make the move to all - digital newspapers .
But that wo n’t be much of a business unless they change the concept of a newspaper at the same time .
What I ’d like to see is a newspaper that is a hybrid of social voting , such as you see on web sites like www.reddit.com and www.digg.com, but further filtered by human editors who weed out the redundant , the juvenile , and the stuff unsubstantiated by facts .
And I ’d like to see counterpoints to everything .
This way you ’d get the stories and opinions considered most worthy by the public , with some editorial quality control .
I also imagine the business model for bloggers changing .
Now bloggers run ads and make money based on the traffic to their sites .
In the future , I can imagine bloggers opting in for a system where they allow newspapers to grab their content any time the newspapers want , move it into the newspaper ’s own content model on any given day , surround it with their own ads , and pay the blogger a percentage of ad revenue .
In other words , every blogger ( and cartoonist ) would be self - syndicated , but newspapers would n’t print the same bloggers every day .
They ’d grab only the best writings of the day based on social voting and the newspaper ’s own editorial opinions .
Online newspapers would offer subscribers several options .
You could have an uncensored online newspaper for adults , a G - rated version for kids , a version with extra helpings of good news , or celebrity news , etc .
And of course the reader could select his own local news , weather , and ads .
Comics would be much funnier if cartoonists did n’t have to conform to a G rating as is now the case .
With online newspapers , and individual filters for each reader , a kid could subscribe to a newspaper with Dilbert in it , but any off - color strips would be automatically replaced by something more appropriate for that day .
Everyone wins .
It ’s easy to think that everything I described could be so automated you never need much in the way of a newspaper business organizing it all .
I do n’t think that will ever happen .
You still need hordes of people keeping the technology current , editing for quality control , doing the art , doing market testing , selling the right kind of ads , etc .
So I see printed newspapers lasting until you upgrade your phone two more times .
But the newspaper business can thrive online if it changes how it gathers and edits content .
And clearly there will be massive amounts of consolidation .
There wo n’t be 3,000 newspapers online .
There might be a dozen .
And local news will come from hometown bloggers who self - syndicate to all of the newspapers .
That ’s how I see it .
The new 256 - slice CT machine takes large numbers of X - ray pictures , and combines them using computer technology to produce the final detailed images .
It also generates images in a fraction of the time of other scanners : a full body scan takes less than a minute .
The Philips machine was unveiled at the Radiological Society of North America .
Because the images are 3D they can be rotated and viewed from different directions - giving doctors the greatest possible help in looking for signs of abnormalities or disease .
All images also can be accessed on any computer in a hospital or by colleagues and researchers remotely , to make it easier for the whole team to share information .
The heart in fine detail

The scan is much quicker than current technology , as the machine 's X - ray emitting gantry - the giant ring - shaped part that surrounds the patient - can rotate four times in a single second - 22 % faster than current systems .
The cost of the equipment - known as the Brilliance CT - is unclear .
At present , it is only being used in one hospital : the Metro Health medical centre in Cleveland , Ohio , which has been using it for the past month .
" This scanner allows radiologists to produce high quality images and is also designed to reduce patients ' exposure to X - rays , " Steve Rusckowski , chief executive of Philips Medical Systems , said .
" It is so powerful it can capture an image of the entire heart in just two beats . "
The record company EMI was behind the first commercially viable CT scanner , which was invented by Sir Godfrey Newbold Hounsfield in Hayes , United Kingdom at the company 's laboratories and unveiled in 1972 .
At the same time , Allan McLeod Cormack of Tufts University independently invented a similar machine , and the two men shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Medicine .
" This is a quantum shift from the first CT scanners as it gives a lot more detail , " says Dr Keith Prowse , Chairman of the British Lung Foundation .
" It seems to be another step beyond what we were previously able to do .
The high resolution enables you to see smaller things in both the lungs and the airways and then decide whether there is anything there and how best to get at it .
" In the case of cancer , it will help us see how far it has spread .
It will also help us pick up new patterns of abnormality .
It promises to be a significant advance . "
Ex -Secret Service agent reveals Chicago JFK plot David Edwards
Published : Sunday November 25 , 2007

Print This Email This Abraham Bolden , a former Secret Service agent , tells CNN that he knew of a plot to assassinate John F. Kennedy in Chicago several weeks beforehand .
Bolden is writing a book about the alleged plot titled " The Echo from Dealey Plaza :
The true story of the first African American on the White House Secret Service detail and his quest for justice after the assassination of JFK . "
According to CNN , the agent said that " just before President Kennedy was to go to Chicago in early November 1963 , the agency got an important tip .
An employee of a boarding house had seen rifles with telescopic sites and an outline of Kennedy 's motorcade route in a room rented by Cuban nationals . "
However , CNN correspondent Brian Todd noted that Bolden , for unspecified reasons , " would not go on camera with us or do a phone interview , " so they also spoke to Lamar Waldron , author of " Ultimate Sacrifice , " who " told us what he believed happened to the suspected Cuban hit man . "
" From all indications , the surveillance on the two men were -- was blown somehow , " Waldron said .
" And so the two men were actually at large at the time that JFK was getting ready to leave Washington and come to Chicago . "
Todd noted that " Kennedy 's trip to Chicago was canceled , " but that " it 's not clear if it was because of a security threat . "
" Contacted by CNN , the Secret Service would not comment on Abraham Bolden 's claim , but did tell us he was separated from the agency in 1964 after being convicted of a crime , " Todd added .
" Published reports say Bolden was convicted of soliciting bribes from a counterfeiter , but that his accuser later recanted .
Bolden claims he was framed . "

MI5 has accused China of spying on British firms , it emerged last night .
In an unprecedented move , the security service claimed Beijing had carried out espionage on key areas of the UK economy including the computer systems of big banks .
Jonathan Evans , MI5 's director - general , sent a letter this week to 300 chief executives and the security bosses of financial services firms warning of attacks by ' Chinese state organisations ' .
The alert was posted on a secure Government website and warns British companies doing business in China that they are being targeted by the Chinese Army , which is reportedly trying to steal confidential information over the internet .
The summary is carried on the website of the Centre for the Protection of the National Infrastructure .
It says : ' The contents of the letter highlight the following : the Director - General 's concerns about the possible damage to UK business resulting from electronic attack sponsored by Chinese state organisations , and the fact that the attacks are designed to defeat best practice IT security systems .
' The letter acknowledges the strong economic and commercial reasons to do business with Chinas but the need to ensure management of the risks involved . '
A report in The Times said a number of unidentified firms had been compromised in recent months by Chinese attacks .
The victims include one of Europe 's largest engineering companies and a large oil company .
However , a source familiar with the MI5 warning said that the warning applied to provincial law firms and businesses just as much as it did to the big firms in the City of London .
Martin Jordan , of accountants KPMG , who has seen the contents of the letter , said : ' If the Chinese know that a British firm is trying to buy a company or other assets such as land in China then they are using every means at their disposal to discover how much money the British company is prepared to spend for that asset . '
A security expert who has seen the letter said the tactics used by the Chinese hackers included ' custom Trojans ' , computer programs which hack into the network of a firm and feed back confidential data .
Last night the Home Office refused to comment on what it termed ' leaked private correspondence ' .
A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in London said he was unaware of the allegations and had not received any complaints from British authorities .
An 18 - year - old was arrested by the FBI yesterday , accused of selling to gangsters a computer program which could have been used to steal £ 10 million .
Police say the unnamed boy , from Hamilton , New Zealand , was the kingpin of an international cyber - crime network .
The program he wrote allowed thieves to take over other computers using the Internet .
In today ’s New York York Times , Shelia Blair , Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , makes this proposal on how to fix the subprime mortgage crisis :
[ S ] ubprime servicers should take a more standardized approach : restructure all 2/28 and 3/27 subprime hybrid loans for owner - occupied homes in cases where the borrower has been making timely payments but ca n’t afford the reset payments .
Convert these to fixed - rate loans at the starter rate .
In other words , Blair is calling for a wholesale rewriting of the terms of every sub - prime mortgage in the country , without regard to the credit worthiness of the homeowners involved .
And , incredibly , she claims it is n’t a bailout :
This would be no bailout .
These borrowers would still be required to make their monthly payments — at rates higher than what prime is today .
Billions in savings would be generated by avoiding the administrative , legal , marketing and other costs of foreclosure , which can run to half or more of the loan amount .
And avoiding foreclosure would protect neighboring properties and hasten the recovery of markets burdened by an excess supply of houses .
Yes , it would be a bailout .
The people benefited by it would end up with lower mortgage payments than they would otherwise have had , and , in many cases , mortgage payments lower than what they otherwise would have had under the terms of their existing loans and , in most cases , lower than would be justified given their credit ratings .
Moreover , Blair is suggesting that the mortgage industry should take a gamble on these loans even though the entire subprime meltdown is testimony to the fact that the people who qualified for them were , for the most part , not good credit risks .
Yes , it would save money in the short term , but in the long term , it would simply delay the inevitable for most people .
Rather than delaying the inevitable , the government needs to let this “ crisis ” play itself out .
Yes , it will be painful .
People will lose their homes and the housing market will remain depressed for another year , if not longer .
But , quite honestly , this is the price to be paid for nearly a decade of an irrationally - rising real estate market and people who bought houses that , notwithstanding the great no -interest loan they could qualify for , they really could not afford .
The bathtub is undoubtedly the hardest bathroom appliance to clean according to the professionals .
This is why we have decided to write down a step by step tutorial which can aid you facilitate your bathroom cleaning duties and more importantly help you maintain a clean and bacteria and germ - free tub .
Commence the bathtub cleaning by spaying a commercial tub cleaner or shampoo on your tube .
Spray the cleaning solution at the top of one of your tub ’s sides and allow then give the cleaning detergent several seconds to run down to the bottom .
Next grab a soft clean pad and start scrubbing the side of the tub that you have sprayed with the cleaner or shampoo .
Never under any circumstances use an abrasive pad because it will cause irreparable damages the surface of your bathtub .
When you are done scrubbing let the bathtub cleaner or shampoo sit for several minutes .
While the cleaner or shampoo is sitting at one side , treat the other side of the tub in the same manner .
And then treat the bottom of the tub , analogically .
Once all sides have been treated and the cleaner or shampoo has sat for a while , grab the shower head of your tub and rinse the shampoo or cleaner with hot water .
Now check to see if all the dirty , soap scum and stains have been removing by running your hand through the surfaces of your bathtub .
If you feel any roughness , threat the problematic area once more .
Now that the tube is clean , you must turn attention to the splash guard .
The splash guard is a lot easier to clean than the tub .
Simply soak a sponge into the tub cleaner or shampoo and apply the cleaning solution over the splash guard with the soft side of the sponge .
When done allow the cleaning detergent to sit and once again use warm water to rinse .
If necessary repeat the procedure but it is highly unlikely that it will come to that .
Next clean your bathtub curtain or door .
You can clean the curtain by applying all - purpose bathroom cleaner on it and rinsing with warm water .
On the other hand if you have a door instead of a curtain it is for the best if you treat it in the same manner with which you have treated your bathtub .
Continue the bathtub cleaning by cleaning the faucet and shower head .
Simply pour some dish soap on a clean cloth and start rubbing the bathtub features .
Do the same with the towel rack if you bathtub has one .
When done , rinse everything with hot water .
It is advisable that you rinse everything twice because dish soap tends to leave a lot of residue .
End the bathtub cleaning by checking the drain to see whether it is clogged .
If it is , unclog your drain before you call it a day .
If all this seems too time consuming for you , you can always use the professional cleaning services of a cleaning company .
Regardless what approach you choose , it is important that you clean your bathtub regularly because bathing in a dirty tub is n’t healthy .
Macs are even more expensive than I thought Saturday , December 22 , 2007 by Dave Winer .
When I got back from Europe my black MacBook would n't boot , it just sat there with a disk icon and a flashing question mark .
So I made an appointment at the Apple store in Emeryville to have it looked at .
When I got there , there was no wait , they were calling my name .
The repair guy opened the Mac , took out the disk , went into the back room , and came back saying the disk was bad , I 'd need a new one .
How much ?
$ 160 .
How large ?
80 GB . I 've been buying disks lately , I bought a 500 GB disk for $ 150 a few weeks ago , and just bought a 1TB disk for $ 280 .
So I knew that $ 160 for 80 GB , even in a portable form factor , was probably a ripoff , but I figured here I am now , I can get the computer working , so I said OK and shrugged it off .
The new disk went in , I signed a form , and was about to leave and asked for the old disk and the clerk said it was his not mine .
They were going to send it back to the manufacturer .
I figured it would be refurbished and sold cheap to someone in a third world country .
Little did I suspect .
He got his supervisor .
She insisted that the drive belonged to Apple , even though I had paid an inflated price to buy a new one .
She showed me the language on the reverse side of the form I signed .
It was even worse than she had said .
There was no guarantee that the drive they had just put in my Mac was new !
It might have been someone else 's defective drive .
I said it was outrageous .
I grabbed a copy of the agreement and left .
I scanned the agreement , highlighting section 4 , the part the store manager cited .
Now there are a lot of speeches I could give .
Here are a few .
1 . I buy Macs knowing they 're more expensive , but I expect to be treated better .
I drive a BMW for the same reason .
Luckily there 's Mercedes , Audi , Lexus , et al to keep BMW customer service in top form ( which it has been so far , I 'm on my fourth BMW ) .
I always say this -- Apple service is outstanding when you buy something , but it falls down , often , when you need it fixed .
Not always , but often .
2 . There are consumer protection laws that require auto repair shops to offer you the old parts .
Why does n't that apply to computer repairs ?
Or maybe it does .
3 . Apple prices are ripoffs , but this is an unusually heinous ripoff .
To charge such inflated prices for used parts , they should have some shame .
4 . They do n't seem to have any fallback when there 's a dissatisfied customer .
As an Apple shareholder , I think it would work better if store personnel felt they were guardians of the company 's reputation .
Consider for a moment that you are ripping off the customer .
What tools can you offer the sales person to make good with the customer ?
Could you let the customers who object take their drives home ?
Could you offer a discount coupon on the next purchase , or free premium support for a year ?
That they let me walk out of the store , a person who spends thousands of dollars with Apple , feeling like I had been abused , says they have n't got all the glitches out of their retail process .
5 . Falling back on the fine print is really lame .
I think they should tell you up front , before they do the work , that you 're not getting the old drive back .
What if the data on the drive can be recovered ?
What if there are credit card numbers and other personal information on the drive ?
Source code ?
Trade secrets ?
Does Apple really want to treat their customers privacy so shabbily ?
For what ?
Do n't they already make enough money off the $ 160 price for the new disk ?
It 's amazing that a company can make it this far , having such special customers , and rarely if ever acknowledging it .
Update :
What I learned about security , privacy and Apple .
View the forum thread .
So , I 'm standing astride this 548ft crack that that has rather alarmingly appeared in the floor of Tate Modern .
I 'm with an architect and a couple of builders , and we are examining the crack from a wide variety of angles and sticking our fingers inside and giving it a damn good poke and generally trying very hard indeed to work a few things out .
The first is : how on earth did it get here ?
The second is : could it be dangerous ?
This being the Tate , we also feel obliged , finally , to consider the possibility that it might be art .
We are each clutching a black leaflet that reads : " Warning .
Please watch your step in the Turbine Hall .
Please keep your children under supervision . "
The leaflet explains that the crack is by a Colombian artist , Doris Salcedo , and that it is called Shibboleth , which , according to the Oxford English Dictionary , is " a word used as a test for detecting people from another district or country by their pronunciation ; a word or a sound very difficult for foreigners to pronounce correctly " .
The Old Testament relates that the Ephraimites were trying to cross the river Jordan when they were caught by their sworn enemies the Gileadites , who forced them all to say the word " shibboleth " .
Since the unfortunate Ephraimites ' dialect did not include the sound " sh " , this allowed the Gileadites to identify and slaughter large numbers of Ephraimites .
So a shibboleth , the leaflet continues , is " a token of power : the power to judge and kill " .
None of this , though , is of much immediate concern to us , because what we want to know is how Salcedo got the crack to appear in the first place .
This is , after all , as solid a piece of postwar real estate as you are likely to encounter ; a massive former power station built in 1947 and comprehensively renovated in 1981 .
And the crack is big .
It starts as a tiny hairline fissure in the concrete floor , beneath a wastepaper bin ( is this significant ?
Reader , we confess : we do not know ) up at the hall 's western entrance , gradually widening and deepening as it descends in a crazy zigzag , with branches shooting off here and there , until it disappears under the wall at the other end .
At its widest it is maybe 10 inches across ; at its deepest it is maybe a three - foot crevasse .
There has , obviously , been a great deal of speculation about the origins of the crack .
The artist herself has let it be known that it took her a year to create and five weeks to install , and that bits of it were air - freighted across the Atlantic , but has refused absolutely to reveal her precise method .
" What is important is the meaning of the piece ; the making of it is not important , " she says , adding that the work is " bottomless " and " as deep as humanity " .
A spokeswoman for the Tate says firmly that it will never divulge how the piece - the eighth in its annual Unilever series of works commissioned specially for the Turbine Hall - was made .
" The artist and Tate are not going into great detail other than to say we opened up the Turbine Hall floor in order to create a cavity , " a spokeswoman says .
" The work was made with utmost precision according to drawings by the artist , and nothing was accidental . "
The press , for its part , reckons " concrete sections were lowered into a trench " ( the Daily Telegraph ) , or that the artist " dug into a ' false ' floor sitting on top of the original " ( the Times ) .
The Independent speaks of " realistic mouldings " and " visible fabrication " .
No one , in short , has the slightest clue .
Time to call in the experts .
Graham Merton , managing director of Eaton Gate , a prestige building firm operating at " the top end of the domestic refurbishment market " , stands four - square across the fissure and rubs his chin .
" What I reckon , " he says , " is that they dug some of the old floor out - look , that slab there is definitely different , that 's the original floor over there .
It need n't have been much , maybe just 20 or 30 centimetres .
Then replacement slabs were cast in a workshop somewhere , with the cracks already in them , and laid in situ .
And where it gets deep down there , they could actually have dug down into the earth with a mechanical tool , and applied a hard slurry finish .
No reason why not .
But it 's certainly impressive . "
Ferhan Azman , an award - winning Turkish - born architect with lots of experience in concrete , kneels to probe the crack 's sides .
" Is n't it great ? " she asks .
" It works as art for me .
It 's about how our physical environment affects us .
Look how wary , how destabilised you feel in a building with a great big crack down the middle .
Anyway , it looks like they 've taken a layer off the top here , and then in - filled with pre-cast pieces .
It 's not that mysterious .
There 'd be no problem digging down ; with a building like this you could go on for ever without undermining its foundations . "
Denis Ryan of TM Ryan & Sons casts the experienced eye of a south London builder over the work .
" I 'd say , " he ventures , " that they 've dug quite a narrow but quite a deep trench here , probably not much wider than the crack itself , then dropped in narrow pre-cast vertical slabs , all made off - site , to form the sides .
Then you use a levelling compound to disguise the joins and make it look like you 've replaced an entire slab of the floor .
Whatever they 've done , it 's clever .
They 've got three builders here and none of us can really agree on the technique . "
They can agree on one thing , though : they would all get sued for it .
" This is extremely dangerous , " says Merton , who otherwise likes the crack a lot , saying it reminds him of " an earthquake , like a reminder to look after the planet , to remember that everything , even the most massive structures , may be at risk .
Art should do that , should n't it ?
Challenge you , make you think . "
Professionally , however , he warns you could " easily break a leg here .
I 'd never be allowed to let a building out like this .
Heels will go in , ankles will get twisted , lawsuits will follow .
Health and safety - wise , it 's a disaster . "
Ryan concurs , but jokes that if he tells his clients people are now paying good money to see eight - inch - wide cracks in the floor , " soon everyone will be wanting one " .
It probably is good art , though , he reckons : " It 's got everyone talking about it , has n't it ?
That 's the main thing . "
Azman only hopes health and safety do not get their hands on it .
" There 's been so much removal of commonsense from our lives , " she says .
" People may say children can fall in , but children could fall into the river outside .
You just have to tell them to be careful ! "
So I thank our experts and head out into the rain , considerably wiser about the techniques of concrete construction but , it has to be said , still not entirely sure I know just how that crack got there .
Fortunately , at the end of the phone is Mr E .
Mr E is a builder who was working at Tate Modern on another project while Shibboleth was being installed , and although for contractual reasons he does not wish to be further identified , he is very happy to recount what he witnessed .
So here 's the answer ...
" They dug a dirty great trench about a yard wide and a yard deep , " says Mr E , still lost in wonderment .
" Then they brought in lorry - load after lorry - load of cement and poured it in , using 10 - foot sections of what looked like carved polystyrene moulding to form the sides .
Then a whole bunch of people lay down on their stomachs for about a week and finished it off with brushes .
Looked bloody uncomfortable , I can tell you .
It 's about racism ?
Ca n't see it myself , but I 'm not much of a one for modern art .
It was a pretty good trench , though .
And one hell of a lot of cement .
Good luck to 'em . "

Courtesy of the Indiana blog Taking Down Words , we get the police report of not only this incident , but a nearly identical incident that took place in 1998 .
You can check out both here .
I could write out a summary of the allegations , but the aforementioned Advance Indiana has already done an excellent job in this regard , so I will point you toward his post :
In a shocking police report filed by the Clark Co. Sheriff 's office , Murphy is accused of sexually assaulting another man on Saturday , July 28 , 2007 , while he lay sleeping in his bed .
The alleged assault of the 22 - year - old man took place in the Jeffersonville , Indiana home of his sister following a Young Republican party in which both Murphy and the 22 - year - old man had been in attendance .
The victim 's sister had urged both men to spend the night at her home because of the amount of alcohol the two had consumed during the party .
The victim awoke in the morning to find Murphy performing oral sex on him according to the report .
When the victim asked Murphy what he was doing , he responded : " He was holding his dick with one hand and sucking my dick with his mouth . "
The victim then pushed Murphy away , gathered his personal belongings and left .
Murphy was later confronted with the charges by the victim 's sister according to the report .
The sister says Murphy admitted to her that he performed the sex act on her brother .
Here is a picture of Mr. Murphy with his good friend former Rep. Mike Sodrel , who is considering another run against Rep. Baron Hill in Indiana 's 9th :
Also of note is how quickly the Young Republicans erased any and all mention of their former leader .
The first mention of the resignation came from this site , which simply mentioned that Murphy had resigned , effective immediately , and had already been replaced .
Then came news of a resignation letter which was apparently sent out by Murphy , the text is as follows :
To my dearest friends in Florida , It ’s been an absolutely crazy weekend for me , and I just wanted to take a few minutes and share with you some of the decisions I ’ve had to make in a very short amount of time .
Some you may have heard , some not .
I wanted to address the Floridians specifically because of the close friendships I have developed with so many of you .
First the great news .
I bid on a contract for my company a little more than a year ago .
I did n’t think it was going to go anywhere .
It was a huge project , and taking on the commitment would be life altering for me and my business — my company doing in one year what I would ordinarily do in five .
I never thought in a million years that I would land this bid .
Well , I landed the bid Friday .
Yay for me , right ?
There was a major catch .
Due to the nature of the client , one of the stipulations in the contract was that I hold no official partisan titles .
( insert gut - wrenching dilemma here ) I could help .
I could maintain the political consulting division of my business as long as I had additional lead consultants .
But I could hold no official Republican positions .
My family sat down with me Saturday evening to look at things from every angle .
We ’re very close .
My mom was pretty blunt about what I needed to do .
If I did n’t take the job , there could potentially never be that type of opportunity again and I would be shorting the security of my future and the future of my family .
I took mom ’s advice to heart .
Every one knows how hard I ’ve worked for the party and the Young Republicans .
We ’ve achieved some amazing things together .
So you understand how torturous and monumental this decision is — especially coming after an election I spent the last 6 months of my life working toward .
I spent the majority of my weekend shaking with anxious indecision .
I did n’t want to disappoint people .
I did n’t want people to be angry .
But I prayed with my family , and we determined that I have to take this opportunity for my long - term security .
So what does that mean ?
I have resigned from all of my Republican partisan positions and I signed my new client contracts this yesterday .
Jessica Colón will take my place as YRNF Chair .
We ’re working VERY hard to make sure the transition is seamless .
The elections of 2007 and 2008 are absolutely critical and the YRNF needs to be operating at full capacity – no limits , no constraints .
I have the utmost confidence in Jessica Colón and the team we have all built to lead the Young Republicans into a new era of accomplishment .
I believe in the strength and resolve of the organization and its members and have full confidence that my resignation will in no way hinder the new administration ’s capability to make a positive impact on the upcoming elections .
Together , we adopted our Recruit , Educate and Deploy strategy .
Please support Jessica and the team .
The whole 21 - person elected team is still in place , save one .
With strong and talented people in place ready to take over the fight , my decision became at least a little easier .
It would be ( as my mom said ) stupid to bypass this business opportunity .
My parents also gave me one other piece of advice .
It was a piece of advice that I did n’t need because it was already in my heart to do .
Once we made the decision , they told me , " Make sure you talk to all of those nice people in Florida .
We know how much they did for you and we know how much you care for them . "
So , I hope you can understand how heart - wrenching this has been for me .
And I hope you know how much I appreciate everything all of you have done me and for the Young Republicans .
This whole thing has been as unexpected to me as much as it has you .
I hope you can support me on one of the " biggest decisions of my life . "
Your Friend ,
Glenn Murphy
The Young Republicans have quietly and quickly scrubbed any mention of their fallen leader , although the Indiana site has n't .
Google Cache reveals that the site had Murphy all over it , including a YouTube appeal for GOP presidential contenders to participate in the upcoming YouTube debate .
The video has since been removed as well .
I will be updating this story as more details emerge .
I just wanted to get this out there so folks could know about it .
Update : Here is the Google Cache of the now - defunct Team Murphy !
campaign website .
Update II : Thanks to Bob Johnson for pointing me toward a better picture of Mr. Murphy , from the recent Young Republicans convention :
To echo some other similar comments :
This guy was the leader of the Young Republicans ?
Update III : Thanks to exmearden for this quote :
" I will essentially be the mouthpiece and effective leader for the tens of thousands of Young Republicans , 18 to 40 , across the country , " said Murphy , who took a vacation following the organization ’s convention and returned to Clark County last weekend .
Update IV : To answer a few criticisms , I have this to say -- Yes , this matters .
If the allegations are true , then this is a leader in the GOP ( at least for Indiana , if not nationally ) who committed a crime .
If he is deemed innocent -- which would depend upon the police or courts finding the act was between two consenting adults -- then the hypocrisy of the situation speaks for itself .
The MSM is starting to run with this story , and as always , it will start small .
Here is a story from the local New Albany Tribune , which confirms the preliminary details of the story :
On Tuesday , Glenn Murphy Jr. e-mailed media a letter announcing his resignation from both positions , citing an unexpected business opportunity that would prohibit him from holding a partisan political office .
However , on Friday the Clark County Sheriff ’s Department began investigating Murphy for alleged criminal deviate conduct — potentially a class B felony — after speaking with a 22 - year - old man who claims that on July 31 , Murphy performed an unwanted sex act on him while the man slept in a relative ’s Jeffersonville home .
Murphy , a 33 - year - old Utica resident , has not been arrested nor has he been charged with a crime .
Such police reports are generally confidential , but a copy of it has been posted on a politically focused Internet site and another was provided to a reporter with The Evening News and The Tribune on Tuesday evening .
Larry Wilder , Murphy ’s attorney , said Murphy is cooperating with police and Prosecutor Steve Stewart .
Wilder said Murphy contends the sex act was consensual .
Assuming this falls off of the rec diary list , I will post a news roundup with full coverage of the stories in Wednesday 's papers .
Be on the lookout !
This article is a submission for the Soccerlens Football Writing Competition ; to participate , please read the details here .
Contrary to what the media and others want you to believe , the word “ soccer ” is not an American creation .
Or , “ They ( rest of the world ) call it football , and we ( North Americans ) call it soccer . ” 😉
Derivation of the word
The word was derived from Association Football , which was the original term given to the game in the 1860s at the elite schools that spawned the sport in England .
The abbreviation “ Assoccer ” , which became “ soccer , ” was used by the British upper classes of that period .
When the sport was embraced by the less fortunate , the name of “ soccer ” was passed down .
But most commoners used the word “ football ” to describe their new game .
Nowadays , from the British Royal Family down to the passionate supporters in the terraces at Anfield ( Liverpool FC ) , Old Trafford ( Manchester United ) , or Stamford Bridge ( Chelsea FC of London ) , the game is called football .
Or “ footy . ”
Game and Name Exported by Sailors , Coaches , and Immigrants
When immigrants , coaches , and sailors exported the game overseas , the word “ football ” was loosely translated to fit the local languages .
For example , Fútbol does not literally mean “ football ” in Spanish .
Nor does Futebol translate into “ football ” in Brazilian Portuguese .
The words “ fut or fute ” do not mean “ foot ” in either language .
It was the English influence that still is found today .
Many professional soccer teams in Argentina have English names : Arsenal , Banfield , Newell ’s Old Boys , and River Plate to name a few of the more famous ones .
Real Madrid was originally called the “ Sociedad Madrid Football Club ” by its British founders in 1902 .
If you look closely , you can see the initials MFC in their famous logo .
In Italy , one of the most famous clubs , AC Milan , was founded as the Milan Cricket and Athletic Club in 1899 .
In Italy , the coach is called “ Mister . ”
As a tribute to the early English coaches who taught the game in that country .
Italy has its own unique term for the game , where it is known as “ calcio , ” not football .
The word translates to “ kickball . ”
Coming to America
When the sport arrived on our shores in the late 19th century ( the US National Team played its first game against Canada in 1885 ) , it was called Association Football .
It was not called soccer .
Only after the Second World War was the sport commonly referred to as “ soccer . ”
Perhaps due to the growing impact of the NFL ( American Football ) , and the belief that the game was foreign .
Which is strange , because in the early 20th century , there were many industrial teams and leagues throughout the country .
While the sport was not as popular as baseball , it was on the sporting landscape .
The USA competed at the first World Cup , which was held in Uruguay .
The American team finished third , which remains its best historical performance .
Many well - known soccer nations such as England , Germany , and Italy did not compete at the first World Cup .
In fact , up until the 1970s , the USSF ( United States Soccer Federation ) used the word “ football ” in its title .
Other Countries Call it Soccer
In some areas of the Caribbean , along with Australia , South Africa , and New Zealand , you can say the word “ soccer ” and the locals will understand its meaning .
Although the emphasis is to call the sport football , the English legacy remains .
One region of the former British Empire that did not embrace the game was India , where cricket remains the most popular spectator and participant sport .
In any language , the whole world is united by a ball .
Or two …

A smoke machine ensures the cow emits its gas at set times
The bovine backside has been attached to the side of the Rowan Tree pub in the city 's historic Old Town .
It lifts its tail and shoots out a cloud of white smoke at passers - by throughout the day .
Pub landlord Norrie Rowan , a former Scotland international rugby star , said the cow was becoming as popular with tourists as nearby Greyfriars Bobby .
It was installed on the side of the pub earlier this year , but the mechanics that allow it to break wind at 1100 GMT , noon and 1300 GMT are a new addition .
A dry ice machine ensures the flatulent beast is regular and helps locals keep track of time in a similar way to the city 's famous One O'clock Gun .
Mr Rowan said the cow was a bit of fun that had already become a popular landmark in the Cowgate area of Edinburgh .
He added : " The cow is already famous around Edinburgh and I get hundreds of tourists coming by and taking pictures of it . "
' Why does n't she just talk already ? '
Sibel has tried every available channel to pursue her claims legitimately - including internal FBI processes , Congress , the courts , the 911 Commission and the media .
She went as high as FBI Director Robert Mueller in the FBI - and the internal FBI report said that she was " 100 % right . "
In Congress , Sibel went to Waxman , Leahy and Grassley - all of whom have been supporters .
Sibel went to the courts and was gagged via the State Secrets Privilege from having the courts hear her case .
And she has tried various avenues in the media to get her story out .
The MSM has generally been terrible in covering Sibel 's story , but she has given a hundred interviews and published dozens of articles .
So to those of you who ask ' Why does n't she speak already ? '
I can tell you that she already has .
I have covered this story closely for years and I pick a number out of the air estimate that I already know , from the public record , 75 % of what she has to say .
Sibel 's case involves illegal weapons sales , money laundering , drug trafficking , nuclear black market , terrorism and the corruption of the US Govt .
Sibel has already named names ( though not all ) - Richard Perle , Douglas Feith , William Cohen , Marc Grossman , Eric Edelman , Dennis Hastert , Bob Livingston and others - and she has also named the countries involved : Turkey , Israel , Pakistan , the other ' Stans - and of course the US .
The crimes in Sibel 's story range from the micro level ( espionage at the FBI translation unit ) to the macro level ( e.g. supplying Pakistan 's nuclear program , blackmail / bribery of members of congress , covering up 9/11 , and various other military - industrial - complex related corruption . )
We know all this despite the gag orders and the invocation of the State Secrets Privilege .
So to those who ask ' Why does n't she just speak out ? ' - well , she already has spoken out , deftly dancing around all those efforts to silence her .
As Sibel repeatedly points out , no one in the MSM has even dared to ask why her case has been cloaked in the State Secrets Privilege ( SSP ) .
We know why the SSP was invoked in the NSA spying scandal , and we know why it was invoked in the El - Masri case , and we know why it was invoked in the Maher Arar case - but no - one in the MSM has really asked why it was invoked in Sibel 's case .
It was invoked to hide criminality at the highest levels of the US Govt .
Sibel rightly calls it " Treason . "
I ( mostly ) wo n't deal with the ' tactics ' issue in this post .
Many of you think that Sibel 's offer ( which was clumsily characterized as ' unedited ' - but her actual offer is " I 'll tell you the story so long as you do n't leave the important pieces on the cutting room floor " ) to tell her story to a broadcast network is destined to fail .
That might very well be true , but it certainly was n't designed to fail , it is a legitimate attempt to get some accountability - as was / is her offer to appear , under oath , in Congress .
Importantly , Sibel would much prefer to appear in Congress than in the media .
She 'd prefer to be under oath , she 'd like to be able to subpoena the documents that prove her case , and she 'd like to be able to subpoena the other FBI agents who were working the cases that she was working on ( all of whom would apparently be willing to testify . )
If you are interested in learning more about Sibel 's case , I recommend that you start with Phil Girladi 's piece in American Conservative which Sibel says " sums up the case very well , considering the length ... as far as published articles go , this one nails it 100 % . "
Then there is the Vanity Fair article " An Inconvenient Patriot . "
I strongly recommend Sibel 's Hijacking of a Nation - parts one and two , and Sibel 's Open Letterto the 911 Commission .
Those of you who would prefer video versions , see particularly " Sibel Edmonds .
Everybody Knows , " and " Sibel Edmonds .
Investigations Thwarted " and any of my other videos here .
All of this has been a long introduction to a repost of my " What the heck is Sibel Edmonds '
Case about ?
And why should I care ? "
It is n't great , or complete , but here it is :
**************
As part of our campaign this week to call for hearings into Sibel Edmonds case , below the fold is a short - as - possible piece which hopes to answer the burning question in Sibel 's case :
What the heck is her case about ?
For a longer version , see my recent interview with Scott Horton
Please call the offices of Congressmen Waxman - ( 202 ) 225-3976 - and Conyers - ( 202 ) 225-5126 - demanding open hearings into Sibel Edmonds ' case and the State Secrets Privilege .
-----------
Sibel Edmonds ' case is about the intersection of illegal arms trafficking , heroin trafficking , money laundering , terrorist activities and the corruption of many " highly - recognizable , highly - known names " in and around the US government .
Sibel says that the people involved will go straight to prison if we can get hearings into her case .
Richard Perle , in prison .
Douglas Feith , in prison .
Dennis Hastert , in prison .
Marc Grossman , in prison .
According to Sibel , the best place to begin trying to understand the case is a recent articleby Phil Giraldi in the American Conservative .
Sibel says " Giraldi has it 100 % right ; this I consider the most accurate summary of my case . "
Giraldi writes :
" Sibel Edmonds ... could provide a major insight into how neoconservatives distort US foreign policy and enrich themselves at the same time .
On one level , her story appears straightforward : several Turkish lobbying groups allegedly bribed congressmen to support policies favourable to Ankara .
But beyond that , the Edmonds revelations become more serpentine and appear to involve AIPAC , Israel and a number of leading neoconservatives who have profited from the Turkish connection .
[ ]
Turkey benefits from the relationship by securing general benevolence and increased aid from the US Congress - as well as access to otherwise unattainable military technology .
The Turkish General Staff has a particular interest because much of the military spending is channeled through companies in which the generals have a financial stake , making for a very cozy and comfortable business arrangement .
The commercial interest has also fostered close political ties , with the American Turkish Council , American Turkish Cultural Alliance and the Assembly of Turkish American Associations all developing warm relationships with AIPAC and other Jewish and Israel advocacy groups throughout the US .
Someone has to be in the middle to keep the happy affair going , so enter the neocons , intent on securing Israel against all comers and also keen to turn a dollar . "
Giraldi goes on to list some neocons who are " linked to Turkey " - Richard Perle , Douglas Feith , Paul Wolfowitz , Marc Grossman , Eric Edelman , and Stephen Solarz - and he suggests that they " enrich themselves " via drug trafficking and arms dealing .
The American Turkish Council ( ATC )
The main Turkish lobbying group in the US is an organization called the American Turkish Council ( ATC ) - one of the most powerful lobby groups in the country .
The ATC is heavily stacked with former government officials - statesmen , lobbyists and ' dime a dozen generals ' - lobbyists and representatives of the military - industrial - complex ( MIC ) .
Brent Scowcroft is the chairman , and heavy hitters from Lockheed Martin , Raytheon , Boeing , Northrup Grumman and other ' defense ' contractors populate the board .
It 's perhaps not surprising , then , that Turkey is a major recipient of US military aid - running to the billions of dollars - with muchof it financed by the US taxpayer .
Giraldi suggests in his article that this largesse appears to be the result of bribes paid to congressmen - a suggestion that should n't surprise anyone - but there 's much more to the story than the usual Iron Triangle / Revolving Door story that we 're all familiar with .
In a 10 - page articlein Vanity Fair on Sibel 's case , the ATC is described as " a front for criminal activity " involving " large - scale drug deals and of selling classified military technologies to the highest bidder . "
We 'll discuss the drug side of the story shortly , but let 's first take a quick look at the military technology element - not only are the MIC contractors bribing congress to ensure that military aid flows to Turkey ( and Israel ) , the Turks and the Israelis are also illegally selling that technology to the highest bidder - which inevitably includes America 's enemies , States , and terrorist groups .
Sibel 's case also involves the nuclear black market - some Turkish members of the ATC have supplied Pakistan 's A.Q. Khan network with hardware , as have American companies that Sibel overheard on the wiretaps .
Perhaps even more disturbing , as reportedin Vanity Fair , other wiretaps indicate that " Turkish groups had been installing doctoral students at U.S. research institutions in order to acquire information about black market nuclear weapons . "
Daniel Ellsberg saysthat , according to Sibel , bribes were paid to people at the State Department to facilitate this activity .
These are extraordinary claims , of course , and we have a lot of evidence to support the claims - including , but not limited to , the fact that Valerie Plame 's front company , Brewster Jennings , had been conducting a counter - intelligence operation against the ATC for years .
One very interesting aspect of Sibel 's case that has not really gained traction is that while the ATC is understood to be the key focus of her case , it appears that AIPAC is equally involved .
In a terrific 2005 interviewwith Chris Deliso , Sibel said :
Essentially , there is only one investigation – a very big one , an all - inclusive one ...
But I can tell you there are a lot of people involved , a lot of ranking officials , and a lot of illegal activities that include multi-billion - dollar drug - smuggling operations , black - market nuclear sales to terrorists and unsavory regimes , you name it ...
You can start from the AIPAC angle .
You can start from the Plame case .
You can start from my case .
They all end up going to the same place , and they revolve around the same nucleus of people .
And she went a little bit further in a great interviewwith David Swanson this week :
" AIPAC helped form the American Turkish Council - look at the board members , look at the people .
You will see the same people involved in both fronts , because it is the same operation . "
Reading between the lines ( in a number of different places ) , it appears that Sibel was actively involved in ' the AIPAC investigation ' as well as the investigation into the ATC .
As she says , both the ATC and AIPAC are both ' fronts ' for the ' same ( criminal ) operation . '
Drug Trafficking .
As I document in " Sibel Edmonds & the Neocons ' Turkish Gravy - Train , " Afghanistan supplies almost 90 % of the world 's heroin , and most of that goes straight to Turkey where it is processed , packaged , warehoused , and then re-exported to other countries for final consumption .
Turkey supplies approximately 80 % of Europe 's heroin , and 15 % of heroin in the US - worth approximately $ 40 billion at street prices .
Turkey is widely acknowledged to be controlled by a " Deep State . "
In 1996 , a deadly car crash at a place called Susurluk blew this out into the open .
In the car were four people who probably should n't have been in the car together :
" an MP , a police chief , a beauty queen and her lover , a top Turkish gangster and hitman called Abdullah Catli ...
Catli , a heroin trafficker on Interpol ’s wanted list , was carrying a diplomatic passport signed by none other than the Turkish Interior Minister himself .
[ ]
The Susurluk Incident became Turkey ’s Watergate , exposing the deep links between the Turkish state , terrorists and drug traffickers .
It revealed what Turks call the Gizli Devlet , or Deep State – the politicians , military officers and intelligence officials who worked with drug bosses to move drugs from Afghanistan into Europe . "
Sibel spells it out :
" The Turkish government , MIT and the Turkish military , not only sanctions , but also actively participates in and oversees the narcotics activities and networks . "
As I outlined in the curiously - titled " Sibel Edmonds : America 's Watergate , " Sibel 's case demonstrates that Turkey 's Deep State ' owns ' large parts of the American establishment , to the point where it appears that there also is a ' Deep State ' in the US as well .
ATC / AIPAC appear to be headquarters for this Deep State in the US , a cozy club where drug dealers , weapons traffickers and past - and - present government officials coexist .
Happily !
And if that 's not bad enough , we also know that :
" Heroin trafficking is also the main source of funding for the al - Qaeda terrorists .
A Time Magazine articlein August 2004 reported that al - Qaeda has established a smuggling network that is peddling Afghan heroin to buyers across the Middle East , Asia , and Europe , and in turn is using the drug revenues to purchase weapons and explosives .
The article states : " ... al - Qaeda and its Taliban allies are increasingly financing operations with opium sales .
Anti-drug officials in Afghanistan have no hard figures on how much al - Qaeda and the Taliban are earning from drugs , but conservative estimates run into tens of millions of dollars . "
That is , our Turkish Deep State friends , the people we are directly providing with weapons , are outsourcing some of their distribution activities to al - Qaeda and the Taliban ( and , while we 're at it , to the Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA . ) )
When we are discussing issues such as al - Qaeda smuggling heroin through Afghanistan and the other ' Stans , sometimes it can seem remote and distant , so let 's come back to something more concrete .
In Adrian Gatton 's terrific recent article , The Susurluk Legacy , he quotes Huseyin Baybasin , a Turkish heroin kingpin who is now in jail in Holland :
" I handled the drugs which came through the channel of the Turkish Consulate in England ...
I was with the Mafia but I was carrying this out with the same Mafia group in which the rulers of Turkey were part . "
Gatton also describes how anyone in the UK government who dared speak about the issue were immediately rebuked by the Foreign Office ( the UK equivalent of the State Department . )
The parallels with Sibel 's case could n't be clearer .
As 60 Minutes first reported ( youtube ) in 2002 , and Vanity Fair later reported , the Turkish Embassy was directing a lot of the heroin trafficking activity - in conjunction with people at the ATC .
" Sibel also recalled hearing wiretaps indicating that Turkish Embassy targets frequently spoke to staff members at the A.T.C .
[ ]
In her secure testimony , Edmonds disclosed some of what she recalled hearing ...
Many ( calls ) involved an F.B.I. target at ( Chicago's ) large Turkish Consulate ...
Some of the calls reportedly contained what sounded like references to large scale drug shipments and other crimes . "
And just as the UK Foreign Office silenced anyone in the UK who tried to speak out , Sibel says :
The Department of State is easily the most corrupted of the major government agencies .
[ ]
In some cases where the FBI stumbles upon evidence of high - level officials being involved in drug - smuggling , they 're even prevented from sharing it with the DEA [ Drug Enforcement Agency ] .
The Department of State just comes in and says , " Leave it . "
Elsewhere , Sibel says :
" For years and years , information and evidence being collected by the counterintelligence operations of certain U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies has been prevented from being transferred to criminal and narcotics divisions , and from being shared with the Drug Enforcement Agency and others with prosecutorial power .
Those with direct knowledge have been prevented from making this information available and public by various gag orders and invocation of the State Secrets Privilege .
Why ? "
Pay attention here , because the ATC is where the worlds of the MIC and the heroin trafficking collide .
One of the key Turkish interfaces at the ATC is the Turkish Generals - people that Giraldi says own a stake in the companies through which the military spending is channeled .
As described earlier , these exact same people , the Turkish Deep State , also control much of the global heroin market .
In between the MIC and the heroin traffickers - are the " neoconservatives ( who ) distort US foreign policy and enrich themselves at the same time . "
One of the difficulties in trying to unravel the Sibel Edmonds case is that we are n't sure where one case ends and another begins .
We know that some of the wiretaps were from the ATC , and some from the Turkish embassy in DC , and some from the embassy in Chicago .
We also know that many of the wiretaps involve conversations between the embassies and the ATC .
Some of the wiretaps relate to drug trafficking , some relate to the nuclear black market and other weapons trafficking , and some refer to terrorist activity - including 9/11 .
Perhaps it 's not surprising , then , when she says :
You have the same players when you look into these activities at high - levels you come across the same players , they are the same people .
Those ' same people ' - at least on the American side - according to Giraldi , appear to be Richard Perle , Douglas Feith , Paul Wolfowitz , Marc Grossman , Eric Edelman , and Stephen Solarz .
It appears that we can also add William Cohen and Joseph Ralston - and Dennis Hastert - to that roster , and I 'm sure there are a few more that have n't yet been publicly identified .
If what Sibel says is true , and her claims are all backed by documents and wiretaps , and also backed up by other agents who have filed similar complaints , and are ready and willing to testify .
All of these people should be in jail .
For a long , long time .
Congress must hold hearings to get to the bottom of these crimes .
If you agree , please call Congress , today , and demand public , open hearings .
**************
The president ’s State of the Union speech was pointedly ignored , even while it was going on , according to the report filed by The Hill , the Beltway ’s newspaper of record .
All eyes were on the two Democratic presidential aspirants , whose closely watched nonverbal cues acted out a political pantomime :
“ When Bush proclaimed , ‘ Ladies and gentlemen , some may deny the surge is working , but among terrorists there is no doubt , ’ Clinton sprang to her feet in applause but Obama remained firmly seated .
The president ’s line divided most of the Democratic audience , with nearly half standing to applaud and the other half sitting in stony silence . ”
So here the lines are clearly drawn .
In the presence of Power , a candidate who spun and twisted her own rapidly shifting position on the Iraq war is suddenly struck with an attack of wordless honesty : applauding the mythical “ surge ” and the war she ’ll inherit and prosecute to the fullest , while her challenger sits on his hands and stares into futurity .
Ah , but she still had the presence of mind to calculate her responses somewhat , even as the truth serum worked its way through her system :
“ In one instance Clinton appeared to gauge Obama ’s response before showing her own .
When Bush warned the Iranian government that ‘ America will confront those who threaten our troops , we will stand by our allies , and we will defend our vital interests in the Persian Gulf , ’ Obama jumped up to applaud .
Clinton leaned across Sen. Joseph Biden ( D - Del. ) , seated to her left , to look in Obama ’s direction before slowly standing . ”
A kumbaya moment for the Democrats , as they all stood and saluted the main plank in the War Party ’s platform : the centrality of our newly conquered Middle Eastern possessions .
If Obama wins , his “ New Frontier ” will be a new frontier of empire , and he ’s cool with that .
So are his followers , or the great mass of them : they ’ll follow him into battle in yet another overseas crusade to make the world safe for America ’s hubris .
As he enunciates platitudes as if they were profundities , his fans swoon .
They ’ll fall for practically anything he says , as long as he says it as if he were John F. Kennedy channeling Martin Luther King .
Once in office , President Obama will be declaring that we ’ll “ pay any price , bear any burden ” faster than you can say “ we shall overcome . ”
The Hill reminds us :
“ The Illinois senator strongly criticized the former first lady last year when she supported a resolution calling for Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard to be designated a terrorist organization .
Obama supporters and other Democrats charged the vote would give Bush political cover to begin military operations against Iran . ”
Yet it seems that the division between the candidates on this issue is n’t that great , after all .
Obama ’s campaign rhetoric was appealing to the base , without mentioning that he agrees in principle with the Clintons ( and Bush ) that our “ vital interests ” include everything from the beaches of the Mediterranean to the salty shores of the Caspian Sea .
All are united in their fealty to the Empire .
What they disagree is on how to manage it and how to go about expanding it :
“ There also appeared to be some division among Democrats Monday over whether to continue to pump money into the Iraq war effort .
When Bush said he would ‘ ask Congress to meet its responsibilities to these brave men and women by fully funding our troops , ’ Obama and Clinton remained seated while Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) stood up behind them to applaud . ”
Forget the television ads , the speeches , the promises , the debating points  this Kabuki play performed at the Capitol Hill Theater tells us all we need to know about what really matters in an American president .
Our celebrity politics minimizes serious discussion of foreign policy issues , as the media floods the airwaves with endless speculation as to whether Hillary was really crying or if Obama is “ black enough . ”
It takes a Washington moment such as this to dramatize where the lines are drawn and where they ’re blurred .
On the Republican side of the aisle , things are bleaker still .
John McCain , a vainglorious braggart with a volcanic temper and dangerous foreign policy views , is attacking Mitt Romney for wavering in his support of the “ surge , ” and the campaign has been turned into a warmongering competition .
McCain is sure to be the winner in that contest .
Whether that will be enough to earn the reluctant nod of the Republican establishment remains to be seen .
I was saddened by the inglorious fate of the Kucinich campaign : is this what the alleged left wing of the Democratic Party has come to ?
One thinks of Eugene McCarthy , George McGovern , politicians of some stature and with some appeal .
Today , there is nothing comparable .
It ’s tragic , really , and I wonder if anyone will ever again fill that vacuum in American politics , the space a principled , old - style leftist would occupy .
I ’d settle for another Norman Thomas .
If anti-imperialism of the Left is moribund , then the same sort of “ isolationist ” sentiment is stirring on the Right .
Ron Paul is the avatar of this rising movement , which derives a strict non-interventionism from an even stricter reading of the Constitution .
There is no provision for an empire anywhere in that document , and therefore Paul is against it : that , at least , has been the thrust of his campaign .
The candidate himself , however , is much more general in his critique of what he and his followers call the “ welfare - warfare state . ”
The campaign ’s failure to get into double - digit territory is a real disappointment for many antiwar activists , on the Left as well as the Right , and this shortcoming is due precisely to a lack of emphasis on the war issue .
Aside from the organizational problems that arise in a spontaneous movement on the verge of taking on a mass character , the campaign failed to pose the question point - blank :
Do we want a republic , or an empire ?
As Garet Garrett  editor , journalist , and sometime novelist of the Old Right  put it in 1952 :
“ Between government in the republican meaning , that is , Constitutional , representative , limited government , on the one hand , and Empire on the other hand , there is mortal enmity .
Either one must forbid the other or one will destroy the other .
That we know .
Yet never has the choice been put to a vote of the people . ”
Call me naïve , but I truly believe that if it ever comes to a vote on the question , the republic will win  hands down .
Yet these are problems with the campaign , not the candidate .
Rep .
Paul is the most principled politician in American politics ; even his enemies will grant him that .
When it ’s just the candidate speaking extemporaneously , as in the debates , the issue of war and peace is always front and center , much to the despair of his more conservative supporters ( and would - be supporters ) .
That ’s why he ’s so beloved by all those “ Paul - tards ” out there , who , if enthusiasm could be measured and translated into votes , would catapult Paul into the Oval Office with the greatest of ease .
What is needed , however , is a more solid movement , one that incorporates non-electoral means to achieve its goals , as the essential element of a long - range strategic vision for the growing Left - Right alliance against imperialism abroad and authoritarianism on the home front .
That is the real challenge , and electoral politics matters , at this stage , only insofar as it furthers a larger organized movement operating on many fronts .
The merger of identity and celebrity politics is blinding many liberals to the essential similarity of the Democratic contenders when it comes to the vital realm of foreign policy .
The ritualized gestures and nonverbal proclamations of the cartoon candidates that pass for “ front - runners ” in the presidential sweepstakes tell the whole story with no need for words .
The unspoken pact of the two wings of the War Party is unity even in division , unity on the one overriding issue that concerns them all : global hegemony as America ’s manifest destiny .
Whether it ’s done in the name of exporting democracy or acting out our self - image as righteous humanitarians , unilaterally or through the UN , U.S. military intervention around the world is retained as a prerogative by all the “ major ” presidential candidates and all “ serious ” policy analysts in Washington .
We ’re all preemptionists now .
Well , nearly all : there is a remnant , on both the Left and the Right  think of , oh , fans of Glenn Greenwald and avid readers of The American Conservative  that is developing into a significant factor , with much potential for growth .
Given the right strategy and organizational discipline , this rising trend could easily fill the vacuum left in American politics by the demise of mass opposition to overseas adventurism : the Brahmin anti-imperialists of New England , who opposed our first foray into empire - building ; the old - style left - wing populist upsurges , from William Jennings Bryan to SDS , which were invariably energized to a large degree by anti-imperialist fervor ; and the Old Right tradition stretching back to the America First Committee and such heroic figures as John T. Flynn , about whom I have written extensively .
The Paul campaign represents another chapter in this continuing history , and by that measure it is a resounding success .
One need n’t vote for him  or vote at all  to realize that the energy generated by Paul could move mountains .
It will take time , dedication , and the kind of intellectual and political entrepreneurship that comes with building a genuinely broad - based yet principled movement , and in increasingly troubled times , at that .
The leadership of such a movement will be tested and tested again , and some will be found wanting , while others will rise .
Yet the knowledge that we represent a valid , vital , and even hallowed tradition in American politics , one that deserves to be revived and will yet have its moment , is what will carry us forward , well beyond this election year .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
The new edition of my 1993 book Reclaiming the American Right : The Lost Legacy of the Conservative Movement is available for pre-order on Amazon .
The book is due out sometime in May , and I ’m really looking forward to it .
In light of the above discussion of the importance of evoking the historical continuity of anti-interventionist and libertarian activism in this country , the subject matter of Reclaiming is especially pertinent .
While I am in no way breaking new ground in this work , what I attempted to do was synthesize the arguments and summarize the organizational histories of the movement known as the “ Old ” Right , the pre-Buckley , pre-National Review conservative movement that was dominated by the hated “ isolationists ”  i.e. , American patriots who foresaw what would happen to us once we became an empire , dreaded it , and fought like hell to prevent it .
I tell the story of how and why I was inspired to write it here , the first in a series that turned up at Taki ’s Top Drawer .
Speaking of which , I ’m having fun blogging over at Taki ’s joint : he ’s always a blast to be around .
Go check out the stuff that ’s either too naughty or just plain off topic for Antiwar.com .
It ’s a good thing that old devil Taki is kind enough to let me get away with it .
Miles Cooper is a former primary school caretaker
Miles Cooper , 27 , from Cambridge , said he had been angry at authorities and " very concerned about the direction my country was heading in " .
Mr Cooper denies 12 charges related to seven letter bombs sent in England and Wales in January and February .
The Oxford Crown Court jury has retired to consider its verdict .
Mr Cooper allegedly sent seven letter bombs , five of which exploded , injuring eight people .
The locations were Abingdon in Oxfordshire ; Culham , near Abingdon ; Birmingham ; Folkestone , in Kent ; Victoria in central London ; Wokingham in Berkshire ; and the DVLA offices in Swansea .
Based on what I learned at school and learned from history books , an authoritarian state eventually develops , and free speech is stifled
Miles Cooper
The UK ' mail bomb ' devices
He does not contest that he sent the letters to three forensic science laboratories , a computer company , an accountancy firm , the DVLA and a residential address , but denies intending to cause injury .
Mr Cooper told the jury his anger at the country 's authorities had intensified when his father Clive was unable to have DNA samples removed from the police database , even though he had been cleared in 2003 of assault .
" I felt my father had been used and I felt unable to do anything about it , " he said .
Mr Cooper added that prior to this , he had campaigned about government 's proposals to introduce ID cards , but that his approach changed after the episode with his father .
Mr Cooper said he had been further angered by the treatment of anti-nuclear protesters , and also by an incident involving Walter Wolfgang , then 82 , who was thrown out of the 2005 Labour Party conference for shouting " nonsense " at then foreign secretary Jack Straw as he delivered a speech .
He told the court his decision to abandon peaceful methods of protest was " not an easy step to make " .
But he said he made the transition " as it became more and more obvious that the government was not going to listen to peaceful protesters and , in fact , they were starting to use anti-terror legislation against them " .
' Surveillance society '
He said the letters he sent containing explosive devices were intended to cause fear rather than harm .
They were sent , he added , to organisations he believed were connected to government control , surveillance and monitoring .
" I was hoping to achieve a bomb scare , to shut down a building , but cause no real harm to any individual , " he said .
" The overall goal was to shut down certain departments in certain buildings and ultimately to highlight my cause .
" I am genuinely ashamed of what I 've done . "
Mr Cooper also told the court he had concerns over the amount of power given to the government .

When David was approached by a colleague for an estimate on some PHP work , David insisted that he'd need to see some of the code first .
The only background David had on the project was that it was a PHP site with a MySQL backend , and a pretty sizable user base .
When David received the code , the first thing that he noticed was an unreasonably large file called namelib .
php .
It was apparently intended to clean up users ' first names ...
<? $ name = $ _GET [ ' name ' ] ; switch ( $ name ) { case " aafke " : echo " Aafke " ; break ; case " aaron " : echo " Aaron " ; break ; case " abbie " : echo " Abbie " ; break ; case " abby " : echo " Abby " ; break ; case " abdel " : echo " Abdel " ; break ; case " abe " : echo " Abe " ; break ; case " abeltje " : echo " Abeltje " ; break ; /* Snip */ case " zora " : echo " Zora " ; break ; case " zorah " : echo " Zorah " ; break ; case " zuzana " : echo " Zuzana " ; break ; case " zuzanna " : echo " Zuzanna " ; break ; case " zuzanny " : echo " Zuzanny " ; break ; default : echo $ name ;
// Name not in the database yet , lowercase is better than nothing } ?>
David could n't help but smile as he replaced thousands of lines of generated code with one easy line :
echo ucfirst ( $ _GET [ ' name ' ] ) ;
WASHINGTON – The US Congress on Wednesday approved a $ 155 million arms package for Israel , aimed at the development of the Hetz and David mid-range defensive missile systems and for the development long - range defensive missile systems .
The arms package is still pending the approval of the US House of Representatives and President George W Bush .
The Israeli defense establishment was pleased with Congress ' decision , which effectively increases Israel 's missile development budget by 30 % .
With the allocation of these new funds , the US would be investing some $ 98 million in the development of the Hetz defensive missile system :
Thirty - seven million dollars will be directed towards the Hetz 's production in a Boeing factory in the US and by the Israel Aerospace Industries ( IAI ) , and $ 37 million for its continuing development .
The US will also allocate $ 37 million for the development of the David mid-range defensive missile system , which is supposed to neutralize threats within a 25 to 125 mile radius , covering both the Hizbullah and Syrian missiles .
The David missiles are not designed to fights Qassam or Katyusha rockets .
The remaining funds are to be allocated for the development of long - range missile defense systems aimed at fighting the Iranian threat .
So wait , what ?
The Earth … hollow ?
Yes , it ’s an insane theory , and yes it is as fictitious as the fairy tales that gave rise to it , yet at the same time it ca n’t be directly disproved .
Why ?
Because we have never actually dug more than about 15 miles below the surface of the Earth , so there is no 100 % direct evidence the Earth is solid through an through !
Does this mean Hollow Earth Theories could hold true ?
Sure , and Santa might actually drop by 6 billion houses a year on a sled pulled by a glorified pack of deer .
What may be most amazing about Hollow Earth theories is the fact that some people believe them even today .
One self - identified scientist and explorer is currently trying to raise two million dollars to mount a mission where no man has ever gone before : through a polar ice cap and into a supposed ‘ Inner Earth ’ with its own oceans , continents and of course its own sun .
What is strangest about his video presentation on the subject ( above ) is the deadpan , candid and intelligent - sounding way in which he presents his arguments .
Shocking as it may seem that some people still believe the world to be empty at its core this idea is unsurprisingly nothing new .
Early theorists held that there were a series of concentric spheres within the Earth while more recent models have posited a viable interior space or even that we occupy the center rather than the interior surface of sphere with everything else in orbits within this sphere .
While Alberto Gonzales ’s Justice Department was purging some of its most talented and upstanding prosecutors , it hired Rachel Paulose as United States attorney for Minnesota .
Ms. Paulose was not qualified , but she did have the right political connections .
The recent decision to remove her from the job is overdue and a hopeful sign that the new attorney general , Michael Mukasey , may be serious about fixing his department .
Ms. Paulose became the top Justice Department lawyer in Minnesota at the ripe age of 33 .
The position of United States attorney is generally reserved for lawyers who have years of prosecutorial experience or have distinguished themselves in private practice .
Ms. Paulose appears to have been appointed for her conservative ideology , her support for the Republican Party and her ties to Monica Goodling , Mr. Gonzales ’s former aide who admitted to improperly politicizing hiring .
Ms. Paulose ’s reign there is notorious .
Her harsh style with subordinates led three high - level supervisors to give up their management positions .
She has been accused of making racially insensitive comments about an employee and of mishandling classified documents .
She insists that she is the victim of a witch hunt , but both of Minnesota ’s United States senators , a Republican and a Democrat , say they are pleased that she is leaving .
The most publicized part of the United States attorneys scandal was the purge of men and women of independence and integrity , like Carol Lam in San Diego and David Iglesias in New Mexico .
Less recognized was the Bush administration ’s larding the top ranks of the department with “ loyal Bushies ” like Ms. Paulose , who undermined the values of impartiality that the Justice Department is supposed to uphold .
NAME
perldelta - what is new for perl 5.10.0
DESCRIPTION
This document describes the differences between the 5.8.8 release and the 5.10.0 release .
Many of the bug fixes in 5.10.0 were already seen in the 5.8.X maintenance releases ; they are not duplicated here and are documented in the set of man pages named perl58 [ 1 - 8 ] ? delta .
Core Enhancements
The feature pragma
The feature pragma is used to enable new syntax that would break Perl 's backwards - compatibility with older releases of the language .
It 's a lexical pragma , like strict or warnings .
Currently the following new features are available : switch ( adds a switch statement ) , say ( adds a say built - in function ) , and state ( adds a state keyword for declaring " static " variables ) .
Those features are described in their own sections of this document .
The feature pragma is also implicitly loaded when you require a minimal perl version ( with the use VERSION construct ) greater than , or equal to , 5.9.5 .
See feature for details .
New - E command - line switch
- E is equivalent to -e , but it implicitly enables all optional features ( like use feature " : 5.10 " ) .
Defined - or operator
A new operator // ( defined - or ) has been implemented .
The following expression :
$ a // $b
is merely equivalent to
defined $ a ? $ a : $b
and the statement
$ c //= $d ;
can now be used instead of
$c = $d unless defined $ c ;
The // operator has the same precedence and associativity as || .
Special care has been taken to ensure that this operator Do What You Mean while not breaking old code , but some edge cases involving the empty regular expression may now parse differently .
See perlop for details .
Switch and Smart Match operator
Perl 5 now has a switch statement .
It 's available when use feature ' switch ' is in effect .
This feature introduces three new keywords , given , when , and default :
given ( $ foo ) { when ( / ^abc / ) { $ abc = 1 ; } when ( / ^def / ) { $ def = 1 ; } when ( / ^xyz / ) { $ xyz = 1 ; } default { $ nothing = 1 ; } }
A more complete description of how Perl matches the switch variable against the when conditions is given in " Switch statements " in perlsyn .
This kind of match is called smart match , and it's also possible to use it outside of switch statements , via the new ~~ operator .
See " Smart matching in detail " in perlsyn .
This feature was contributed by Robin Houston .
Regular expressions
Recursive Patterns
It is now possible to write recursive patterns without using the ( ??{} ) construct .
This new way is more efficient , and in many cases easier to read .
Each capturing parenthesis can now be treated as an independent pattern that can be entered by using the ( ? PARNO ) syntax ( PARNO standing for " parenthesis number " ) .
For example , the following pattern will match nested balanced angle brackets : / ^ # start of line ( # start capture buffer 1 < # match an opening angle bracket (? : # match one of : ( ?> # do n't backtrack over the inside of this group [ ^ <> ]+
# one or more non angle brackets ) # end non backtracking group | # ... or ... ( ? 1 ) # recurse to bracket 1 and try it again ) * # 0 or more times . > # match a closing angle bracket ) # end capture buffer one $ # end of line /x PCRE users should note that Perl 's recursive regex feature allows backtracking into a recursed pattern , whereas in PCRE the recursion is atomic or " possessive " in nature .
As in the example above , you can add ( ? > ) to control this selectively .
( Yves Orton ) Named Capture Buffers
It is now possible to name capturing parenthesis in a pattern and refer to the captured contents by name .
The naming syntax is ( ?< NAME >.... ) .
It 's possible to backreference to a named buffer with the \ k < NAME > syntax .
In code , the new magical hashes %+ and %- can be used to access the contents of the capture buffers .
Thus , to replace all doubled chars with a single copy , one could write s/(?< letter >. ) \k< letter >/$+{letter}/g
Only buffers with defined contents will be " visible " in the % + hash , so it 's possible to do something like foreach my $ name ( keys %+ ) { print " content of buffer ' $ name ' is $ +{$ name}
" ; } The %- hash is a bit more complete , since it will contain array refs holding values from all capture buffers similarly named , if there should be many of them . %+ and %- are implemented as tied hashes through the new module Tie : : Hash : : NamedCapture .
Users exposed to the .NET regex engine will find that the perl implementation differs in that the numerical ordering of the buffers is sequential , and not " unnamed first , then named " .
Thus in the pattern /( A ) ( ? < B> B ) ( C ) ( ?< D>D ) / $ 1 will be ' A ' , $ 2 will be ' B ' , $ 3 will be ' C ' and $ 4 will be ' D ' and not $ 1 is ' A ' , $ 2 is ' C ' and $ 3 is ' B ' and $ 4 is ' D ' that a .NET programmer would expect .
This is considered a feature . :-) ( Yves Orton ) Possessive Quantifiers
Perl now supports the " possessive quantifier " syntax of the " atomic match " pattern .
Basically a possessive quantifier matches as much as it can and never gives any back .
Thus it can be used to control backtracking .
The syntax is similar to non-greedy matching , except instead of using a '?
' as the modifier the '+ ' is used .
Thus ?+ , *+ , ++ , {min , max} + are now legal quantifiers .
( Yves Orton ) Backtracking control verbs
The regex engine now supports a number of special - purpose backtrack control verbs : (* THEN ) , (* PRUNE ) , (* MARK ) , (* SKIP ) , (* COMMIT ) , ( * FAIL ) and ( * ACCEPT ) .
See perlre for their descriptions .
( Yves Orton ) Relative backreferences
A new syntax \g {N} or \gN where " N " is a decimal integer allows a safer form of back - reference notation as well as allowing relative backreferences .
This should make it easier to generate and embed patterns that contain backreferences .
See " Capture buffers " in perlre .
( Yves Orton ) \K escape
The functionality of Jeff Pinyan 's module Regexp : : Keep has been added to the core .
In regular expressions you can now use the special escape \K as a way to do something like floating length positive lookbehind .
It is also useful in substitutions like : s /( foo ) bar / $ 1/ g that can now be converted to s / foo\ Kbar / / g which is much more efficient .
( Yves Orton ) Vertical and horizontal whitespace , and linebreak Regular expressions now recognize the \v and \h escapes that match vertical and horizontal whitespace , respectively .
\V and \H logically match their complements .
\R matches a generic linebreak , that is , vertical whitespace , plus the multi-character sequence " \x0D\x0A " .
say ( ) is a new built - in , only available when use feature ' say ' is in effect , that is similar to print ( ) , but that implicitly appends a newline to the printed string .
See " say " in perlfunc .
( Robin Houston )
Lexical $_
The default variable $ _ can now be lexicalized , by declaring it like any other lexical variable , with a simple
my $ _ ;
The operations that default on $ _ will use the lexically - scoped version of $ _ when it exists , instead of the global $ _ .
In a map or a grep block , if $ _ was previously my'ed , then the $ _ inside the block is lexical as well ( and scoped to the block ) .
In a scope where $ _ has been lexicalized , you can still have access to the global version of $ _ by using $ ::_ , or , more simply , by overriding the lexical declaration with our $ _ . ( Rafael Garcia - Suarez )
The _ prototype
A new prototype character has been added .
_ is equivalent to $ but defaults to $ _ if the corresponding argument is n't supplied .
( both $ and _ denote a scalar ) .
Due to the optional nature of the argument , you can only use it at the end of a prototype , or before a semicolon .
This has a small incompatible consequence : the prototype ( ) function has been adjusted to return _ for some built - ins in appropriate cases ( for example , prototype ( ' CORE : :rmdir ' ) ) . ( Rafael Garcia - Suarez )
UNITCHECK blocks
UNITCHECK , a new special code block has been introduced , in addition to BEGIN , CHECK , INIT and END .
CHECK and INIT blocks , while useful for some specialized purposes , are always executed at the transition between the compilation and the execution of the main program , and thus are useless whenever code is loaded at runtime .
On the other hand , UNITCHECK blocks are executed just after the unit which defined them has been compiled .
See perlmod for more information .
( Alex Gough )
New Pragma , mro
A new pragma , mro ( for Method Resolution Order ) has been added .
It permits to switch , on a per-class basis , the algorithm that perl uses to find inherited methods in case of a multiple inheritance hierarchy .
The default MRO has n't changed ( DFS , for Depth First Search ) .
Another MRO is available : the C3 algorithm .
See mro for more information .
( Brandon Black )
Note that , due to changes in the implementation of class hierarchy search , code that used to undef the *ISA glob will most probably break .
Anyway , undef'ing * ISA had the side - effect of removing the magic on the @ISA array and should not have been done in the first place .
Also , the cache *:: ISA ::CACHE : : no longer exists ; to force reset the @ISA cache , you now need to use the mro API , or more simply to assign to @ISA ( e.g. with @ISA = @ ISA ) .
readdir ( ) may return a " short filename " on Windows
The readdir ( ) function may return a " short filename " when the long filename contains characters outside the ANSI codepage .
Similarly Cwd : : cwd ( ) may return a short directory name , and glob ( ) may return short names as well .
On the NTFS file system these short names can always be represented in the ANSI codepage .
This will not be true for all other file system drivers ; e.g. the FAT filesystem stores short filenames in the OEM codepage , so some files on FAT volumes remain unaccessible through the ANSI APIs .
Similarly , $ ^X , @INC , and $ ENV{PATH} are preprocessed at startup to make sure all paths are valid in the ANSI codepage ( if possible ) .
The Win32::GetLongPathName ( ) function now returns the UTF - 8 encoded correct long file name instead of using replacement characters to force the name into the ANSI codepage .
The new Win32:: GetANSIPathName ( ) function can be used to turn a long pathname into a short one only if the long one cannot be represented in the ANSI codepage .
Many other functions in the Win32 module have been improved to accept UTF - 8 encoded arguments .
Please see Win32 for details .
readpipe ( ) is now overridable
The built - in function readpipe ( ) is now overridable .
Overriding it permits also to override its operator counterpart , qx / / ( a.k.a. `` ) .
Moreover , it now defaults to $ _ if no argument is provided .
( Rafael Garcia - Suarez )
Default argument for readline ( )
readline ( ) now defaults to * ARGV if no argument is provided .
( Rafael Garcia - Suarez )
state ( ) variables
A new class of variables has been introduced .
State variables are similar to my variables , but are declared with the state keyword in place of my .
They 're visible only in their lexical scope , but their value is persistent : unlike my variables , they 're not undefined at scope entry , but retain their previous value .
( Rafael Garcia - Suarez , Nicholas Clark )
To use state variables , one needs to enable them by using
use feature ' state ' ;
or by using the - E command - line switch in one - liners .
See " Persistent variables via state ( ) " in perlsub .
Stacked filetest operators
As a new form of syntactic sugar , it 's now possible to stack up filetest operators .
You can now write -f - w -x $ file in a row to mean -x $ file && -w _ && -f _ .
See " - X " in perlfunc .
The UNIVERSAL class has a new method , DOES ( ) .
It has been added to solve semantic problems with the isa( ) method. isa( ) checks for inheritance , while DOES ( ) has been designed to be overridden when module authors use other types of relations between classes ( in addition to inheritance ) .
( chromatic )
See " $obj -> DOES ( ROLE ) " in UNIVERSAL .
Formats
Formats were improved in several ways .
A new field , ^* , can be used for variable - width , one - line - at - a - time text .
Null characters are now handled correctly in picture lines .
Using @# and ~~ together will now produce a compile - time error , as those format fields are incompatible .
perlform has been improved , and miscellaneous bugs fixed .
Byte - order modifiers for pack ( ) and unpack ( )
There are two new byte - order modifiers , > ( big- endian ) and < ( little - endian ) , that can be appended to most pack ( ) and unpack ( ) template characters and groups to force a certain byte - order for that type or group .
See " pack " in perlfunc and perlpacktut for details .
no VERSION
You can now use no followed by a version number to specify that you want to use a version of perl older than the specified one .
chdir , chmod and chown on filehandles
chdir , chmod and chown can now work on filehandles as well as filenames , if the system supports respectively fchdir , fchmod and fchown , thanks to a patch provided by Gisle Aas .
OS groups
$ ( and $ ) now return groups in the order where the OS returns them , thanks to Gisle Aas .
This was n't previously the case .
Recursive sort subs
You can now use recursive subroutines with sort ( ) , thanks to Robin Houston .
Exceptions in constant folding
The constant folding routine is now wrapped in an exception handler , and if folding throws an exception ( such as attempting to evaluate 0/0 ) , perl now retains the current optree , rather than aborting the whole program .
Without this change , programs would not compile if they had expressions that happened to generate exceptions , even though those expressions were in code that could never be reached at runtime .
( Nicholas Clark , Dave Mitchell )
Source filters in @INC
It 's possible to enhance the mechanism of subroutine hooks in @INC by adding a source filter on top of the filehandle opened and returned by the hook .
This feature was planned a long time ago , but was n't quite working until now .
See " require " in perlfunc for details .
( Nicholas Clark )
New internal variables
Miscellaneous
unpack ( ) now defaults to unpacking the $ _ variable .
mkdir ( ) without arguments now defaults to $ _ .
The internal dump output has been improved , so that non-printable characters such as newline and backspace are output in \x notation , rather than octal .
The - C option can no longer be used on the #!
line .
It was n't working there anyway , since the standard streams are already set up at this point in the execution of the perl interpreter .
You can use binmode ( ) instead to get the desired behaviour .
UCD 5.0.0
The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl 5 has been updated to version 5.0.0 .
MAD
MAD , which stands for Miscellaneous Attribute Decoration , is a still - in - development work leading to a Perl 5 to Perl 6 converter .
To enable it , it 's necessary to pass the argument - Dmad to Configure .
The obtained perl is n't binary compatible with a regular perl 5.10 , and has space and speed penalties ; moreover not all regression tests still pass with it .
( Larry Wall , Nicholas Clark )
kill ( ) on Windows
On Windows platforms , kill ( - 9 , $ pid ) now kills a process tree .
( On UNIX , this delivers the signal to all processes in the same process group . )
Incompatible Changes
Packing and UTF - 8 strings
The semantics of pack ( ) and unpack ( ) regarding UTF - 8 - encoded data has been changed .
Processing is now by default character per character instead of byte per byte on the underlying encoding .
Notably , code that used things like pack ( " a* " , $ string ) to see through the encoding of string will now simply get back the original $ string .
Packed strings can also get upgraded during processing when you store upgraded characters .
You can get the old behaviour by using use bytes .
To be consistent with pack ( ) , the C0 in unpack ( ) templates indicates that the data is to be processed in character mode , i.e. character by character ; on the contrary , U0 in unpack ( ) indicates UTF - 8 mode , where the packed string is processed in its UTF - 8 - encoded Unicode form on a byte by byte basis .
This is reversed with regard to perl 5.8.X , but now consistent between pack ( ) and unpack ( ) .
Moreover , C0 and U0 can also be used in pack ( ) templates to specify respectively character and byte modes .
C0 and U0 in the middle of a pack or unpack format now switch to the specified encoding mode , honoring parens grouping .
Previously , parens were ignored .
Also , there is a new pack ( ) character format , W , which is intended to replace the old C .
C is kept for unsigned chars coded as bytes in the strings internal representation .
W represents unsigned ( logical ) character values , which can be greater than 255 .
It is therefore more robust when dealing with potentially UTF - 8 - encoded data ( as C will wrap values outside the range 0..255 , and not respect the string encoding ) .
In practice , that means that pack formats are now encoding - neutral , except C .
For consistency , A in unpack ( ) format now trims all Unicode whitespace from the end of the string .
Before perl 5.9.2 , it used to strip only the classical ASCII space characters .
Byte / character count feature in unpack ( )
A new unpack ( ) template character , " . " , returns the number of bytes or characters ( depending on the selected encoding mode , see above ) read so far .
The $* and $ # variables have been removed
$* , which was deprecated in favor of the /s and /m regexp modifiers , has been removed .
The deprecated $ # variable ( output format for numbers ) has been removed .
Two new severe warnings , $ # /$ * is no longer supported , have been added .
substr ( ) lvalues are no longer fixed - length
The lvalues returned by the three argument form of substr ( ) used to be a " fixed length window " on the original string .
In some cases this could cause surprising action at distance or other undefined behaviour .
Now the length of the window adjusts itself to the length of the string assigned to it .
Parsing of -f _
The identifier _ is now forced to be a bareword after a filetest operator .
This solves a number of misparsing issues when a global _ subroutine is defined .
The :unique attribute has been made a no - op , since its current implementation was fundamentally flawed and not threadsafe .
Effect of pragmas in eval
The compile - time value of the % ^H hint variable can now propagate into eval ( " " ) uated code .
This makes it more useful to implement lexical pragmas .
As a side - effect of this , the overloaded - ness of constants now propagates into eval ( " " ) .
chdir FOO
A bareword argument to chdir( ) is now recognized as a file handle .
Earlier releases interpreted the bareword as a directory name .
( Gisle Aas )
Handling of .pmc files
An old feature of perl was that before require or use look for a file with a .pm extension , they will first look for a similar filename with a .pmc extension .
If this file is found , it will be loaded in place of any potentially existing file ending in a .pm extension .
Previously , .pmc files were loaded only if more recent than the matching .pm file .
Starting with 5.9.4 , they 'll be always loaded if they exist .
$ ^V is now a version object instead of a v-string
$ ^V can still be used with the %vd format in printf , but any character - level operations will now access the string representation of the version object and not the ordinals of a v-string .
Expressions like substr ( $ ^V , 0 , 2 ) or split // , $ ^V no longer work and must be rewritten .
@- and @+ in patterns
The special arrays @- and @+ are no longer interpolated in regular expressions .
( Sadahiro Tomoyuki )
$ AUTOLOAD can now be tainted
If you call a subroutine by a tainted name , and if it defers to an AUTOLOAD function , then $ AUTOLOAD will be ( correctly ) tainted .
( Rick Delaney )
Tainting and printf
When perl is run under taint mode , printf ( ) and sprintf ( ) will now reject any tainted format argument .
( Rafael Garcia - Suarez )
undef and signal handlers
Undefining or deleting a signal handler via undef $ SIG {FOO} is now equivalent to setting it to ' DEFAULT ' . ( Rafael Garcia - Suarez )
strictures and dereferencing in defined ( )
use strict ' refs ' was ignoring taking a hard reference in an argument to defined ( ) , as in :
use strict ' refs ' ; my $ x = ' foo ' ; if ( defined $ $x ) {...}
This now correctly produces the run-time error Ca n't use string as a SCALAR ref while " strict refs " in use .
defined @$foo and defined % $ bar are now also subject to strict ' refs ' ( that is , $ foo and $ bar shall be proper references there . ) ( defined ( @foo ) and defined ( % bar ) are discouraged constructs anyway . )
( Nicholas Clark )
(? p{} ) has been removed
The regular expression construct ( ? p{} ) , which was deprecated in perl 5.8 , has been removed .
Use ( ??{} ) instead .
( Rafael Garcia - Suarez )
Pseudo - hashes have been removed
Support for pseudo - hashes has been removed from Perl 5.9 .
( The fields pragma remains here , but uses an alternate implementation . )
Removal of the bytecode compiler and of perlcc
perlcc , the byteloader and the supporting modules ( B::C , B : : CC , B : : Bytecode , etc. ) are no longer distributed with the perl sources .
Those experimental tools have never worked reliably , and , due to the lack of volunteers to keep them in line with the perl interpreter developments , it was decided to remove them instead of shipping a broken version of those .
The last version of those modules can be found with perl 5.9.4 .
However the B compiler framework stays supported in the perl core , as with the more useful modules it has permitted ( among others , B:: Deparse and B:: Concise ) .
Removal of the JPL
The JPL ( Java - Perl Lingo ) has been removed from the perl sources tarball .
Recursive inheritance detected earlier
Perl will now immediately throw an exception if you modify any package 's @ISA in such a way that it would cause recursive inheritance .
Previously , the exception would not occur until Perl attempted to make use of the recursive inheritance while resolving a method or doing a $ foo - > isa ( $ bar ) lookup .
Modules and Pragmata
Upgrading individual core modules
Even more core modules are now also available separately through the CPAN .
If you wish to update one of these modules , you do n't need to wait for a new perl release .
From within the cpan shell , running the 'r ' command will report on modules with upgrades available .
See perldoc CPAN for more information .
Pragmata Changes
feature
The new pragma feature is used to enable new features that might break old code .
See " The feature pragma " above .
mro
This new pragma enables to change the algorithm used to resolve inherited methods .
See " New Pragma , mro " above .
Scoping of the sort pragma
The sort pragma is now lexically scoped .
Its effect used to be global .
Scoping of bignum , bigint , bigrat
The three numeric pragmas bignum , bigint and bigrat are now lexically scoped .
( Tels ) base
The base pragma now warns if a class tries to inherit from itself .
( Curtis " Ovid " Poe ) strict and warnings strict and warnings will now complain loudly if they are loaded via incorrect casing ( as in use Strict ; ) . ( Johan Vromans ) version
The version module provides support for version objects .
warnings
The warnings pragma does n't load Carp anymore .
That means that code that used Carp routines without having loaded it at compile time might need to be adjusted ; typically , the following ( faulty ) code wo n't work anymore , and will require parentheses to be added after the function name : use warnings ; require Carp ; Carp : : confess ' argh ' ; less less now does something useful ( or at least it tries to ) .
In fact , it has been turned into a lexical pragma .
So , in your modules , you can now test whether your users have requested to use less CPU , or less memory , less magic , or maybe even less fat .
See less for more .
( Joshua ben Jore )
New modules
encoding :: warnings , by Audrey Tang , is a module to emit warnings whenever an ASCII character string containing high - bit bytes is implicitly converted into UTF - 8 .
It 's a lexical pragma since Perl 5.9.4 ; on older perls , its effect is global .
Module : : CoreList , by Richard Clamp , is a small handy module that tells you what versions of core modules ship with any versions of Perl 5 .
It comes with a command - line frontend , corelist .
Math :: BigInt:: FastCalc is an XS - enabled , and thus faster , version of Math : : BigInt :: Calc .
Compress :: Zlib is an interface to the zlib compression library .
It comes with a bundled version of zlib , so having a working zlib is not a prerequisite to install it .
It 's used by Archive : : Tar ( see below ) .
IO : : Zlib is an IO : : - style interface to Compress :: Zlib .
Archive : : Tar is a module to manipulate tar archives .
Digest ::SHA is a module used to calculate many types of SHA digests , has been included for SHA support in the CPAN module .
ExtUtils :: CBuilder and ExtUtils :: ParseXS have been added .
Hash :: Util : : FieldHash , by Anno Siegel , has been added .
This module provides support for field hashes : hashes that maintain an association of a reference with a value , in a thread - safe garbage - collected way .
Such hashes are useful to implement inside - out objects .
Module : : Build , by Ken Williams , has been added .
It 's an alternative to ExtUtils : : MakeMaker to build and install perl modules .
Module : : Load , by Jos Boumans , has been added .
It provides a single interface to load Perl modules and .pl files .
Module : : Loaded , by Jos Boumans , has been added .
It 's used to mark modules as loaded or unloaded .

It 's a simple helper to list all constants declared in a given package .
Win32API :: File , by Tye McQueen , has been added ( for Windows builds ) .
This module provides low - level access to Win32 system API calls for files / dirs .
Locale :: Maketext :: Simple , needed by CPANPLUS , is a simple wrapper around Locale : : Maketext : : Lexicon .
Note that Locale :: Maketext :: Lexicon is n't included in the perl core ; the behaviour of Locale : : Maketext : : Simple gracefully degrades when the later is n't present .
Params :: Check implements a generic input parsing / checking mechanism .
It is used by CPANPLUS .

Selected Changes to Core Modules
Attribute :: Handlers Attribute :: Handlers can now report the caller 's file and line number .
( David Feldman )
All interpreted attributes are now passed as array references .
( Damian Conway ) B:: Lint B :: Lint is now based on Module : : Pluggable , and so can be extended with plugins .
( Joshua ben Jore ) B
It 's now possible to access the lexical pragma hints ( % ^H ) by using the method B:: COP :: hints_hash ( ) .
It returns a B:: RHE object , which in turn can be used to get a hash reference via the method B:: RHE ::HASH ( ) .
( Joshua ben Jore ) Thread
As the old 5005 thread threading model has been removed , in favor of the ithreads scheme , the Thread module is now a compatibility wrapper , to be used in old code only .
It has been removed from the default list of dynamic extensions .
Utility Changes
perl -d The Perl debugger can now save all debugger commands for sourcing later ; notably , it can now emulate stepping backwards , by restarting and rerunning all bar the last command from a saved command history .
It can also display the parent inheritance tree of a given class , with the i command .
ptar ptar is a pure perl implementation of tar that comes with Archive : : Tar .
ptardiff ptardiff is a small utility used to generate a diff between the contents of a tar archive and a directory tree .
Like ptar , it comes with Archive : : Tar .
shasum shasum is a command - line utility , used to print or to check SHA digests .
It comes with the new Digest : : SHA module .
corelist
The corelist utility is now installed with perl ( see " New modules " above ) .
h2 ph and h2xs h2ph and h2xs have been made more robust with regard to " modern " C code .
h2xs implements a new option -- use - xsloader to force use of XSLoader even in backwards compatible modules .
The handling of authors ' names that had apostrophes has been fixed .
Any enums with negative values are now skipped .
perlivp perlivp no longer checks for *.ph files by default .
Use the new - a option to run all tests .
find2 perl find2 perl now assumes - print as a default action .
Previously , it needed to be specified explicitly .
Several bugs have been fixed in find2 perl , regarding - exec and - eval .
Also the options - path , - ipath and - iname have been added .
config_data config_data is a new utility that comes with Module : : Build .
It provides a command - line interface to the configuration of Perl modules that use Module : : Build 's framework of configurability ( that is , *:: ConfigData modules that contain local configuration information for their parent modules . ) cpanp cpanp , the CPANPLUS shell , has been added .
( cpanp - run - perl , a helper for CPANPLUS operation , has been added too , but is n't intended for direct use ) .
cpan2dist cpan2dist is a new utility that comes with CPANPLUS .
It 's a tool to create distributions ( or packages ) from CPAN modules .
pod2html
The output of pod2html has been enhanced to be more customizable via CSS .
Some formatting problems were also corrected .
( Jari Aalto )
New Documentation
The perlpragma manpage documents how to write one 's own lexical pragmas in pure Perl ( something that is possible starting with 5.9.4 ) .
The new perlglossary manpage is a glossary of terms used in the Perl documentation , technical and otherwise , kindly provided by O'Reilly Media , Inc .
The perlreguts manpage , courtesy of Yves Orton , describes internals of the Perl regular expression engine .
The perlreapi manpage describes the interface to the perl interpreter used to write pluggable regular expression engines ( by Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason ) .
The perlunitut manpage is an tutorial for programming with Unicode and string encodings in Perl , courtesy of Juerd Waalboer .
A new manual page , perlunifaq ( the Perl Unicode FAQ ) , has been added ( Juerd Waalboer ) .
The perlcommunity manpage gives a description of the Perl community on the Internet and in real life .
( Edgar " Trizor " Bering )
The CORE manual page documents the CORE : : namespace .
( Tels )
The long - existing feature of /(?{...} ) / regexps setting $ _ and pos( ) is now documented .
Performance Enhancements
In - place sorting
Sorting arrays in place ( @a = sort @a ) is now optimized to avoid making a temporary copy of the array .
Likewise , reverse sort ... is now optimized to sort in reverse , avoiding the generation of a temporary intermediate list .
Lexical array access
Access to elements of lexical arrays via a numeric constant between 0 and 255 is now faster .
( This used to be only the case for global arrays . )
XS - assisted SWASHGET
Some pure - perl code that perl was using to retrieve Unicode properties and transliteration mappings has been reimplemented in XS .
Constant subroutines
The interpreter internals now support a far more memory efficient form of inlineable constants .
Storing a reference to a constant value in a symbol table is equivalent to a full typeglob referencing a constant subroutine , but using about 400 bytes less memory .
This proxy constant subroutine is automatically upgraded to a real typeglob with subroutine if necessary .
The approach taken is analogous to the existing space optimisation for subroutine stub declarations , which are stored as plain scalars in place of the full typeglob .
Several of the core modules have been converted to use this feature for their system dependent constants - as a result use POSIX ; now takes about 200K less memory .
PERL_DONT_CREATE_GVSV
The new compilation flag PERL_DONT_CREATE_GVSV , introduced as an option in perl 5.8.8 , is turned on by default in perl 5.9.3 .
It prevents perl from creating an empty scalar with every new typeglob .
See perl588delta for details .
Weak references are cheaper
Weak reference creation is now O ( 1 ) rather than O( n ) , courtesy of Nicholas Clark .
Weak reference deletion remains O ( n ) , but if deletion only happens at program exit , it may be skipped completely .
sort ( ) enhancements
Salvador Fandiño provided improvements to reduce the memory usage of sort and to speed up some cases .
Memory optimisations
Several internal data structures ( typeglobs , GVs , CVs , formats ) have been restructured to use less memory .
( Nicholas Clark )
UTF - 8 cache optimisation
The UTF - 8 caching code is now more efficient , and used more often .
( Nicholas Clark )
Sloppy stat on Windows
On Windows , perl 's stat ( ) function normally opens the file to determine the link count and update attributes that may have been changed through hard links .
Setting $ { ^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT} to a true value speeds up stat ( ) by not performing this operation .
( Jan Dubois )
Regular expressions optimisations
Engine de-recursivised
The regular expression engine is no longer recursive , meaning that patterns that used to overflow the stack will either die with useful explanations , or run to completion , which , since they were able to blow the stack before , will likely take a very long time to happen .
If you were experiencing the occasional stack overflow ( or segfault ) and upgrade to discover that now perl apparently hangs instead , look for a degenerate regex .
( Dave Mitchell )
Single char char - classes treated as literals Classes of a single character are now treated the same as if the character had been used as a literal , meaning that code that uses char - classes as an escaping mechanism will see a speedup .
( Yves Orton )
Trie optimisation of literal string alternations Alternations , where possible , are optimised into more efficient matching structures .
String literal alternations are merged into a trie and are matched simultaneously .
This means that instead of O ( N ) time for matching N alternations at a given point , the new code performs in O ( 1 ) time .
A new special variable , $ {^RE_TRIE_MAXBUF} , has been added to fine - tune this optimization .
( Yves Orton ) Note : Much code exists that works around perl 's historic poor performance on alternations .
Often the tricks used to do so will disable the new optimisations .
Hopefully the utility modules used for this purpose will be educated about these new optimisations .
Aho - Corasick start - point optimisation
When a pattern starts with a trie - able alternation and there are n't better optimisations available , the regex engine will use Aho - Corasick matching to find the start point .
( Yves Orton )
Installation and Configuration Improvements
Configuration improvements
- Dusesitecustomize Run-time customization of @INC can be enabled by passing the - Dusesitecustomize flag to Configure .
When enabled , this will make perl run $ sitelibexp/sitecustomize.pl before anything else .
This script can then be set up to add additional entries to @INC .
Relocatable installations
There is now Configure support for creating a relocatable perl tree .
If you Configure with - Duserelocatableinc , then the paths in @INC ( and everything else in % Config ) can be optionally located via the path of the perl executable .
That means that , if the string " .../ " is found at the start of any path , it 's substituted with the directory of $ ^X .
So , the relocation can be configured on a per- directory basis , although the default with - Duserelocatableinc is that everything is relocated .
The initial install is done to the original configured prefix . strlcat ( ) and strlcpy ( )
The configuration process now detects whether strlcat ( ) and strlcpy ( ) are available .
When they are not available , perl 's own version is used ( from Russ Allbery 's public domain implementation ) .
Various places in the perl interpreter now use them .
( Steve Peters ) d_pseudofork and d_printf_format_null A new configuration variable , available as $ Config{d_pseudofork} in the Config module , has been added , to distinguish real fork ( ) support from fake pseudofork used on Windows platforms .
A new configuration variable , d_printf_format_null , has been added , to see if printf - like formats are allowed to be NULL .
Configure help Configure -h has been extended with the most commonly used options .
Compilation improvements
Parallel build Parallel makes should work properly now , although there may still be problems if make test is instructed to run in parallel .
Borland 's compilers support Building with Borland 's compilers on Win32 should work more smoothly .
In particular Steve Hay has worked to side step many warnings emitted by their compilers and at least one C compiler internal error .
Static build on Windows Perl extensions on Windows now can be statically built into the Perl DLL .
Also , it 's now possible to build a perl - static .exe that does n't depend on the Perl DLL on Win32 .
See the Win32 makefiles for details .
( Vadim Konovalov ) ppport.h files
All ppport.h files in the XS modules bundled with perl are now autogenerated at build time .
( Marcus Holland - Moritz ) C++ compatibility Efforts have been made to make perl and the core XS modules compilable with various C++ compilers ( although the situation is not perfect with some of the compilers on some of the platforms tested . )
Support for Microsoft 64 - bit compiler Support for building perl with Microsoft 's 64 - bit compiler has been improved .
( ActiveState ) Visual C++
Perl can now be compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 ( and 2008 Beta 2 ) .
Win32 builds
All win32 builds ( MS - Win , WinCE ) have been merged and cleaned up .
Installation improvements
Module auxiliary files README files and changelogs for CPAN modules bundled with perl are no longer installed .
New Or Improved Platforms
Perl has been reported to work on Symbian OS .
See perlsymbian for more information .
Many improvements have been made towards making Perl work correctly on z /OS .
Perl has been reported to work on DragonFlyBSD and MidnightBSD .
Perl has also been reported to work on NexentaOS ( http://www.gnusolaris.org/ ) .
The VMS port has been improved .
See perlvms .
Support for Cray XT4 Catamount / Qk has been added .
See hints / catamount.sh in the source code distribution for more information .
Vendor patches have been merged for RedHat and Gentoo .
DynaLoader : : dl_unload_file ( ) now works on Windows .
Selected Bug Fixes
strictures in regexp - eval blocks strict was n't in effect in regexp - eval blocks ( /(?{...} ) / ). Calling CORE ::require ( ) CORE : : require ( ) and CORE : :do ( ) were always parsed as require ( ) and do ( ) when they were overridden .
This is now fixed .
Subscripts of slices
You can now use a non-arrowed form for chained subscripts after a list slice , like in : ( { foo => " bar " } ) [ 0 ] {foo}
This used to be a syntax error ; a -> was required .
no warnings ' category ' works correctly with -w Previously when running with warnings enabled globally via -w , selective disabling of specific warning categories would actually turn off all warnings .
This is now fixed ; now no warnings ' io ' ; will only turn off warnings in the io class .
Previously it would erroneously turn off all warnings .
threads improvements
Several memory leaks in ithreads were closed .
Also , ithreads were made less memory - intensive .
threads is now a dual - life module , also available on CPAN .
It has been expanded in many ways .
A kill ( ) method is available for thread signalling .
One can get thread status , or the list of running or joinable threads .
A new threads -> exit ( ) method is used to exit from the application ( this is the default for the main thread ) or from the current thread only ( this is the default for all other threads ) .
On the other hand , the exit ( ) built - in now always causes the whole application to terminate .
( Jerry D. Hedden ) chr ( ) and negative values chr ( ) on a negative value now gives \x {FFFD} , the Unicode replacement character , unless when the bytes pragma is in effect , where the low eight bits of the value are used .
PERL5SHELL and tainting On Windows , the PERL5SHELL environment variable is now checked for taintedness .
( Rafael Garcia - Suarez ) Using * FILE {IO} stat ( ) and - X filetests now treat *FILE {IO} filehandles like * FILE filehandles .
( Steve Peters ) Overloading and reblessing Overloading now works when references are reblessed into another class .
Internally , this has been implemented by moving the flag for " overloading " from the reference to the referent , which logically is where it should always have been .
( Nicholas Clark ) Overloading and UTF - 8
A few bugs related to UTF - 8 handling with objects that have stringification overloaded have been fixed .
( Nicholas Clark ) eval memory leaks fixed Traditionally , eval ' syntax error ' has leaked badly .
Many ( but not all ) of these leaks have now been eliminated or reduced .
( Dave Mitchell ) Random device on Windows
In previous versions , perl would read the file / dev/ urandom if it existed when seeding its random number generator .
That file is unlikely to exist on Windows , and if it did would probably not contain appropriate data , so perl no longer tries to read it on Windows .
( Alex Davies ) PERLIO_DEBUG
The PERLIO_DEBUG environment variable no longer has any effect for setuid scripts and for scripts run with - T. Moreover , with a thread - enabled perl , using PERLIO_DEBUG could lead to an internal buffer overflow .
This has been fixed .
PerlIO : : scalar and read - only scalars PerlIO : : scalar will now prevent writing to read - only scalars .
Moreover , seek ( ) is now supported with PerlIO : : scalar - based filehandles , the underlying string being zero - filled as needed .
( Rafael , Jarkko Hietaniemi ) study ( ) and UTF - 8 study ( ) never worked for UTF - 8 strings , but could lead to false results .
It 's now a no - op on UTF - 8 data .
( Yves Orton ) Critical signals
The signals SIGILL , SIGBUS and SIGSEGV are now always delivered in an " unsafe " manner ( contrary to other signals , that are deferred until the perl interpreter reaches a reasonably stable state ; see " Deferred Signals ( Safe Signals ) " in perlipc ) .
( Rafael ) @INC - hook fix
When a module or a file is loaded through an @INC - hook , and when this hook has set a filename entry in %INC , __FILE__ is now set for this module accordingly to the contents of that %INC entry .
( Rafael ) -t switch fix
The -w and -t switches can now be used together without messing up which categories of warnings are activated .
( Rafael ) Duping UTF - 8 filehandles
Duping a filehandle which has the :utf8 PerlIO layer set will now properly carry that layer on the duped filehandle .
( Rafael ) Localisation of hash elements Localizing a hash element whose key was given as a variable did n't work correctly if the variable was changed while the local ( ) was in effect ( as in local $ h{$x} ; ++$x ) .
( Bo Lindbergh )
New or Changed Diagnostics
Use of uninitialized value Perl will now try to tell you the name of the variable ( if any ) that was undefined .
Deprecated use of my ( ) in false conditional A new deprecation warning , Deprecated use of my ( ) in false conditional , has been added , to warn against the use of the dubious and deprecated construct my $x if 0 ; See perldiag .
Use state variables instead .
!=~ should be !~
A new warning , !=~ should be !~ , is emitted to prevent this misspelling of the non-matching operator .
Newline in left - justified string
The warning Newline in left - justified string has been removed .
Too late for " - T " option The error Too late for " - T " option has been reformulated to be more descriptive . " %s " variable %s masks earlier declaration
This warning is now emitted in more consistent cases ; in short , when one of the declarations involved is a my variable : my $ x ; my $ x ; # warns my $ x ; our $ x ; # warns our $ x ; my $ x ; # warns
On the other hand , the following : our $ x ; our $ x ; now gives a " our " variable %s redeclared warning .
readdir( ) / closedir( ) /etc. attempted on invalid dirhandle
These new warnings are now emitted when a dirhandle is used but is either closed or not really a dirhandle .
Opening dirhandle / filehandle %s also as a file / directory
Two deprecation warnings have been added : ( Rafael ) Opening dirhandle %s also as a file Opening filehandle %s also as a directory Use of - P is deprecated Perl 's command - line switch - P is now deprecated .
v-string in use / require is non-portable Perl will warn you against potential backwards compatibility problems with the use VERSION syntax .
perl - V perl - V has several improvements , making it more useable from shell scripts to get the value of configuration variables .
See perlrun for details .
Changed Internals
In general , the source code of perl has been refactored , tidied up , and optimized in many places .
Also , memory management and allocation has been improved in several points .
When compiling the perl core with gcc , as many gcc warning flags are turned on as is possible on the platform .
( This quest for cleanliness does n't extend to XS code because we cannot guarantee the tidiness of code we did n't write . )
Similar strictness flags have been added or tightened for various other C compilers .
Reordering of SVt_ * constants
The relative ordering of constants that define the various types of SV have changed ; in particular , SVt_PVGV has been moved before SVt_PVLV , SVt_PVAV , SVt_PVHV and SVt_PVCV .
This is unlikely to make any difference unless you have code that explicitly makes assumptions about that ordering .
( The inheritance hierarchy of B ::* objects has been changed to reflect this . )
Elimination of SVt_PVBM
Related to this , the internal type SVt_PVBM has been been removed .
This dedicated type of SV was used by the index operator and parts of the regexp engine to facilitate fast Boyer - Moore matches .
Its use internally has been replaced by SV s of type SVt_PVGV .
New type SVt_BIND
A new type SVt_BIND has been added , in readiness for the project to implement Perl 6 on 5 .
There deliberately is no implementation yet , and they can not yet be created or destroyed .
Removal of CPP symbols
The C preprocessor symbols PERL_PM_APIVERSION and PERL_XS_APIVERSION , which were supposed to give the version number of the oldest perl binary - compatible ( resp. source - compatible ) with the present one , were not used , and sometimes had misleading values .
They have been removed .
Less space is used by ops
The BASEOP structure now uses less space .
The op_seq field has been removed and replaced by a single bit bit - field op_opt .
op_type is now 9 bits long .
( Consequently , the B:: OP class does n't provide an seq method anymore . )
New parser
perl 's parser is now generated by bison ( it used to be generated by byacc . )
As a result , it seems to be a bit more robust .
Also , Dave Mitchell improved the lexer debugging output under - DT .
Use of const
Andy Lester supplied many improvements to determine which function parameters and local variables could actually be declared const to the C compiler .
Steve Peters provided new * _set macros and reworked the core to use these rather than assigning to macros in LVALUE context .
Mathoms
A new file , mathoms.c , has been added .
It contains functions that are no longer used in the perl core , but that remain available for binary or source compatibility reasons .
However , those functions will not be compiled in if you add - DNO_MATHOMS in the compiler flags .
AvFLAGS has been removed
The AvFLAGS macro has been removed .
av_ * changes
The av_ *( ) functions , used to manipulate arrays , no longer accept null AV * parameters .
$ ^H and % ^H
The implementation of the special variables $ ^H and % ^H has changed , to allow implementing lexical pragmas in pure Perl .
B : : modules inheritance changed
The inheritance hierarchy of B : : modules has changed ; B::NV now inherits from B::SV ( it used to inherit from B :: IV ) .
Anonymous hash and array constructors
The anonymous hash and array constructors now take 1 op in the optree instead of 3 , now that pp_anonhash and pp_anonlist return a reference to an hash / array when the op is flagged with OPf_SPECIAL .
( Nicholas Clark )
Known Problems
There 's still a remaining problem in the implementation of the lexical $ _ : it does n't work inside /(?{...} ) / blocks .
( See the TODO test in t/op/mydef.t. )
Stacked filetest operators wo n't work when the filetest pragma is in effect , because they rely on the stat ( ) buffer _ being populated , and filetest bypasses stat ( ) .
UTF - 8 problems
The handling of Unicode still is unclean in several places , where it 's dependent on whether a string is internally flagged as UTF - 8 .
This will be made more consistent in perl 5.12 , but that wo n't be possible without a certain amount of backwards incompatibility .
Platform Specific Problems
When compiled with g++ and thread support on Linux , it 's reported that the $!
stops working correctly .
This is related to the fact that the glibc provides two strerror_r ( 3 ) implementation , and perl selects the wrong one .
Reporting Bugs
If you find what you think is a bug , you might check the articles recently posted to the comp.lang .
perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at http://rt.perl.org/rt3/ .

With the invaluable assistance of regular blog contributor Sandra Kiume , I present to you 2007 ’s Best of the Web – Blogs for Depression .
Depression is a difficult category , because there are innumerable blogs that talk about depression , some even on a fairly regular basis .
But there are n’t many that are reliably engaging , post regularly , and keep up for months or years on end .
We scoured the web for those rare jewels , some of which you ’ll find below :
1. Depression Introspection
An anonymous “ 25 - year - old black female ” writing about her struggles with depression , suicidal thoughts and simply life , magnified .
It ’s quite personal and chatty , you can have dialogues with her .
Also , commentary on depression in the news , celebrities and research news .
She was first diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) but apparently that may have been a misdiagnosis , as she was recently diagnosed as having bipolar disorder instead .
The focus of her blog remains the depressive side .
Unfortunately , she has n’t blogged since September , but we hope to see her take up the keyboard again soon and continue her interesting writing on mental health topics and her own life .
2. Finding Optimism
It could have been on our Top Ten Bipolar Blogs list but is here instead since , although author James Bishop is bipolar , his posts are about general mental health , positive psychology and depression treatment topics .
A wee bit saccharine in its optimism at times , it ’s still interesting and he shares lots of great links .
Especially good at writing lists , he ’s done a Top Five Blogs on Depression list of his own .
Furious Seasons tops his list and we had it ranked highly as a bipolar blog , since Phil identifies as bipolar .
The lines can be so blurry …
3. Beyond Blue
Hosted at Belief.net , this popular blog by Therese J. Borchard is on spirituality and how it relates to depression , in “ a spiritual journey to mental health . ”
She has a warm , welcoming , mashed - potatoes - and - gravy style and writes with consumers in mind , with a CV full of books and articles in major magazines .
In this blog she comments on treatments , Bible scriptures and welcomes discussions like , “ The Depression Debate : Biological ?
Spiritual ?
Both ? ”
If you ’re looking for a regular spiritual read on depression and mental health topics in general , this is the blog for you .
4. Postpartum Progress
“ Most widely read blog ” on perinatal mood disorders and it ’s easy to see why .
Katherine Stone maintains a comprehensive , well - linked , and archive - heavy blog that seems to catch every news item and research article on the subject , including postpartum depression , postpartum obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , postpartum psychosis , and more .
This blog is brightly written , reliably updated , easy to read and very informative .
Kathleen is a former marketer turned advocate who is applying the blogging skills she developed with her award - winning first blog to this newer venture .
Although it ’s narrowly focused on a specialized field of mood disorders , Postpartum Progress definitely deserves to be recognized among all the top blogs .
5. Save Your Sanity
LiveJournal is home to thousands of personal blogs that delve into depression , but this one by early adopter Erika ( she began blogging nine years ago , when she was just twelve ) is consistently exceptional .
Powerfully written , intimate and evocative , we ca n’t help but be sucked into her life just as she is sucked in by depression .
Be forewarned , however , that her language more accurately reflects real life , profanity and all .
An example of her writerly prowess : “ Being severely depressed is having things in your brain randomly light on fire .
If you ’re severely depressed , these fires happen so frequently that all you have time to do is run around trying to get the fires to go out .
Sometimes you have water for the fires , sometimes all you can do is try to light a backfire .
Sometimes nothing works , and you want to die .
Sometimes nothing works , and you live .
You ca n’t tell what ’s going to happen , but you ca n’t ignore the fires because they ’re FIRES .
You have to put them out .
Trying to get back to normal is like building a house .
To build a house , you need blueprints , materials , labor , and know - how / experience .
I have some of these things , but not all at the same time .
And all my experience is in putting out fires .
Not building . ”
But , she is managing to build a brick house regardless .
6. A Beautiful Revolution
This is an outstanding creative writing blog filled with “ depressed doodles ” by Andre Jordan .
His blog is not so much about depression as maybe an extension of its emotional effects .
Talented and rare jewel in the blogosphere .
His doodles have been published in a hardcover book ( Amazon UK link , could n’t find the book on U.S. Amazon.com ) ; they are funny and poignant .
It is infrequently updated .
7. The Splintered Mind
A cheery blog from Douglas Cootey , who has anxiety alongside depression ( which is common ) .
Distilled news , funny anecdotes and images , all with an optimistic and practical viewpoint .
We enjoy his regular blogging and thoughtful insights .
His anecdotes paint a picture that you easily get lost in .
Using Ian McKellar ’s splendid and hilarious LOL Feed converter , Douglas also allows his blog entries on the The Splintered Mind with headlines as text over Flickr cat pictures .
One of his posts in September sums up his approach : “ Why Be Sad When You Can Be Silly ? ”
( This entry has been corrected to give proper attribution to the creator of the LOL Feed converter .
– Ed. )
8. Walking the Black Dog
Easy reading , generally optimistic posts about depression and depression news , with a bit of advice mixed in .
Anonymous mental health consumer blog .
I like his writing but like one the blog features even more : each post has a footer with details about the post .
Example : “ Read the full post ( 812 words , 2 images , estimated 3:15 mins reading time ) . ”
Very convenient !
9 . The Pursuit of Happiness
An anonymous blog by a presumably white hetero male , described as , “ My journey through self help techniques and herbal remedies for depression . ”
It ’s a new blog written by someone fairly new to treating his depression and social anxiety and it ’s nice to follow fresh eyes as he tries various treatments .
He ’s just started on St. John ’s Wort , for example .
Cheer him on .
10 . Depression : Art and Expression
Not exactly a blog , not quite a vlog ( no RSS ) , but oh so web 2.0 .
A YouTube group with about 40 members who submit creative projects , music and their personal experiences on video .
Cool mix of views and culture .
* * *
Did we miss one of your favorites ?
Let us ( and our readers know ) in the comments section and we ’ll be sure to include it in our next round of reviews .
( Because there are so many blogs that offer depression news posts ( and it ’s so easy to find depression news just about anywhere ) , we excluded such news - only blogs from our list . )

We 're running out of memory .
I do n't mean computer memory .
That stuff 's half - price at Costco these days .
No , I 'm talking about humanmemory , stored by the gray matter inside our heads .
According to recent research , we 're remembering fewer and fewer basic facts these days .
This summer , neuroscientist Ian Robertson polled 3,000 people and found that the younger ones were less able than their elders to recall standard personal info .
When Robertson asked his subjects to tell them a relative 's birth date , 87 percent of respondents over age 50 could recite it , while less than 40 percent of those under 30 could do so .
And when he asked them their own phone number , fully one - third of the youngsters drew a blank .
They had to whip out their handsets to look it up .
That reflexive gesture — reaching into your pocket for the answer — tells the story in a nutshell .
Mobile phones can store 500 numbers in their memory , so why would you bother trying to cram the same info into your own memory ?
Younger Americans today are the first generation to grow up with go - everywhere gadgets and services that exist specifically to remember things so that we do n't have to : BlackBerrys , phones , thumb drives , Gmail .
I 've long noticed this phenomenon in my own life .
I can't remember a single friend 's email address .
Hell , sometimes I have to search my inbox to remember an associate 's last name .
Friends of mine space out on lunch dates unless Outlook pings them .
And when it comes to cultural trivia — celebrity names , song lyrics —
I 've almost given up making an effort to remember anything , because I can instantly retrieve the information online .
In fact , the line between where my memory leaves off and Google picks up is getting blurrier by the second .
Often when I 'm talking on the phone , I hit Wikipedia and search engines to explore the subject at hand , harnessing the results to buttress my arguments .
My point is that the cyborg future is here .
Almost without noticing it , we 've outsourced important peripheral brain functions to the silicon around us .
And frankly , I kind of like it .
I feel much smarter when I 'm using the Internet as a mental plug - in during my daily chitchat .
Say you mention the movie Once : I 've never seen it , but in 10 seconds I 'll have reviewed a summary of the plot , the actors , and its cultural impact .
Machine memory even changes the way I communicate , because I continually stud my IMs with links , essentially impregnating my very words with extra intelligence .
You could argue that by offloading data onto silicon , we free our own gray matter for more germanely " human " tasks like brainstorming and daydreaming .
What 's more , the perfect recall of silicon memory can be an enormous boon to thinking .
For example , I 've been blogging for four years , which means I 've poured out about a million words ' worth of my thoughts online .
This regularly produces the surreal and delightful experience of Googling a topic only to unearth an old post that I do n't even remember writing .
The machine helps me rediscover things I 'd forgotten I knew — it's what author Cory Doctorow refers to as an " outboard brain . "
Still , I have nagging worries .
Sure , I 'm a veritable genius when I 'm on the grid , but am I mentally crippled when I 'm not ?
Does an overreliance on machine memory shut down other important ways of understanding the world ?
There 's another type of intelligence that comes not from rapid - fire pattern recognition but from slowly ingesting and retaining a lifetime 's worth of facts .
You read about the discoveries of Madame Curie and the history of the countries bordering Iraq .
You read War and Peace .
Then you let it all ferment in the back of your mind for decades , until , bang , it suddenly coalesces into a brilliant insight .
( If Afghanistan had stores of uranium , the Russians would 've discovered nuclear energy before 1917 ! )
We 've come to think of human intelligence as being like an Intel processor , able to quickly analyze data and spot patterns .
Maybe there 's just as much value in the ability to marinate in the seemingly trivial .
Of course , it 's probably not an either / or proposition .
I want both : I want my organic brain to contain vast stores of knowledge and my silicon overmind to contain a stupidly huge amount more .
At the very least , I 'd like to be able to remember my own phone number .

Rai stones .
Recycled coins .
The British guinea .
A guinea was £ 1 - 1s - 0d ( which is £ 1.05 ) and could be written as ' 1g ' or ' 1gn ' or , in the plural , ' 3gs ' or ' 3gns ' .
It was considered a more gentlemanly amount than £ 1 .
You paid tradesmen , such as a carpenter , in pounds but gentlemen , such as an artist , in guineas .
It was a tradition in the legal profession that a barrister was paid in guineas but kept only the pounds , giving his clerk the shillings ( they were all men then ) .
Canadian
Tire money .
Katanga crosses .
Siamese gambling tokens .
Kissi Money , the coin with a soul .
If an iron rod would accidentally break , it could no longer circulate and its value could only be restored in a special ceremony performed by the Zoe , the traditional witchdoctor – often the blacksmith – who , for a fee , would rejoin the broken pieces and reincarnate the escaped soul .
Therefore , it was said that Kissi money was ‘ money with a soul ’ .
Manchukuo fiber coins .
Space Quid .
Since the beginning of trade , communities have experimented with exchange mediums .
These may seem strange now , but they made sense to someone at the time and place they were in use .
Rai stones were once used as currency on the island of Yap in Micronesia .
The large stones , resembling millstones were quarried on nearby Palau , as there is no limestone on Yap .
The value of the circular stones with a hole in the middle depends on the size and weight of the stone plus the difficulty in transporting them .
Value was also affected by the history of a particular stone , such as how many people died transporting it !
They were placed in public places , and although ownership of a stone may change , the location rarely did .
The stone pictured is about eight feet in diameter .
Recycled money ?
It ’s been done .
Until the mid-19th century , several nations in the Caribbean had no currency or mint of their own .
So when they exchanged foreign money , they counterstamped it and made it their own .
The stamping would render the money unusable in the its country of origin , but legal tender on St. Kitts and Nevis , Antigua , St. Lucia , Montserrat , Grenada , Barbuda , St. Vincent and the Grenadines .
The island of Dominica used a heart - shaped cutout to recycle the pictured coin .
The guinea was once part of the British monetary system .
You know of pounds , shillings , and pence , but the gold guinea coin was a variable amount tied to the price of gold .
The original gold guinea coin was worth a pound ( 20 shillings ) , but as the price of gold rose , its worth creeped up .
Over a couple of hundred years , the amount of gold in the coin was adjusted several times .
During the Great Recoinage of 1816 , the guinea coin was retired in favor of the pound note .
But the amount of 21 shillings ( £ 1+1s ) was still referred to as a guinea .
In Victorian times , this disparity was used for class distinction .
While we ’re on the subject of British currency , the farthing was a coin worth a qurter of a penny .
They stopped minting it in 1956 .
Canadian
Tire money is a promotional coupon program issued by Canadian Tire which started in 1958 .
Tire money is given out as bonuses when purchases are made and can be redeemed at face value at any Canadian Tire store or gas station , including the amount for taxes .
Some merchants besides Canadian
Tire accept tire money , because after all , they buy gasoline , too .
Katanga crosses were used as currency in the copper mining region of what used to be Zaire , in Africa .
They are made of copper and range from about a half - pound to 2.5 popunds .
They are also associated with ritual , as they were buried with the dead .
The crosses predate Christianity in the area , but missionaries adapted the symbolism of the cross for their own purposes .
Katanga was an independent nation for a brief period , from 1960 - 1963 , during which time they issued new national coins , francs , with a picture of the Katanga cross on them !
Siamese porcelain tokens ( pees ) began as tokens used in a casinio game called Fantan around 1820 .
These were much easier to use than the bars of silver that was legal tender in Siam at the time .
The coins became so popular that they were used in trade throughout the kingdom until they were banned in 1875 .
Pees could be exchanged for silver coins , so unscrupulous businessmen ordered porcelain tokens from China at a discount .
To counter , the casinos changed designs on the tokens often , and there may now be as many as eight thousands different designs .
Despite the ban , pees were used as underground money well into the twentieth century , and can be found in antique shops and from coin dealers worldwide .
Kissi Money was used in the west African region that is now the nations of Liberia , Sierra Leone , and Guinea .
These twisted iron bars had a “ T ” shape at one end and a hoe - like spatula shape at the other .
The length varied from 9 to 15 inches , depending on the value .
Kissi money was gradually replaced by western currencies in the 20th century , and is now used only for ritual ceremonies , sacrifices , and to decorate graves .
Manchukuo was a puppet state in Manchuria created by the Japanese occupation in 1932 until the end of World War II .
The Manchukuo yuan was a currency unit instituted by the Japanese for use in the occupied area .
There were 100 fen in one yuan .
In 1944 and 1945 , the supply of metal was low due to the war , and 1 fen and 5 fen coins were made of “ red or brown fiber ” , resembling cardboard
The newest currency is strange because of it intended purpose .
Scientists from the National Space Centre and the University of Leicester have designed the QUID , short for Quasi Universal Intergalactic Denomination .
This money is designed to be used in space , where traveling distances can be too far for electronic transfers .
Quid coins have rounded edges , so they wo n’t damage anything if they float in zero gravity .

Investigative reporter Robert Dreyfuss discusses his view that the new Iran NIE has made it virtually impossible for the administration to start a war any time before 2009 , the State Department and U.S. military ’s undercutting of the accusations about Iran ’s involvement in Iraq , Iran ’s relationship with the Hakim and Sadr factions , the history of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council , why the Bush administration favors that faction ( which is the closest to Tehran ) over the Shi’ite nationalists , the danger to U.S. troops in Iraq in the event of war with Iran , why the U.S. occupation is the main obstacle to the creation of a multi-ethnic coalition government , the split within the Da’wa Party and various moves by the administration which have strengthened the hands of the Iraqi nationalists they oppose .

Today 's Word : " Basketball "
It 's widely believed that " basketball " gets it 's name from the basket - shaped goal .
In fact , the reverse is true .
Let 's start with the latin , " baskus " , which means " to sleep " or " to lie " .
" Bask lizards " get their name from this word , due to their lethargic behavior .
* Bask lizard shown resting *
In melbourne , Australia , where basketball was invented in 1824 , bask lizard skins provided the perfect covering for the game ball .
" Baskball " became popular very quickly .
Only later did the " basket " goal lend its name to other similar objects .
* fruit shown in a basket *
That thing that holds fruit on your table ?
It 's named after sleepy lizards .

Brown hailed the EU leaders ' decision yesterday to call a halt to further institutional reform " for the foreseeable future " .
The prime minister also said he had been happy to go to Lisbon for the signing ceremony on Thursday , and his influence had not been diminished by his late arrival .
He said he was " excited " that the EU had finally recognised the need to focus on the challenges of prosperity , terrorism , climate change and jobs .
He sought to play down the significance of the new group , to be chaired by the former Spanish prime minister Felipe González , saying it would not look at institutional change at all .
But Sarkozy , initial advocate of the 10 - strong group , claimed its members would consider how to reinvent the original dream of Europe 's founders , including political integration .
He made plain that the group would discuss " whether Europe should have frontiers or not , and what consequences this would have " .
The Conservatives claimed Brown had opened " a pandora 's box " by allowing an old - style socialist as the EU group leader .
The European commissioner , Peter Mandelson , also criticised Brown 's diplomatic efforts in Europe , saying : " In politics , you do n't win an argument by putting yourself on the back foot .
If you have a case , you make it confidently , you present it with conviction . "
One of the world 's most prominent cryptographers has issued a warning about a hypothetical incident in which a maths error in a widely used computing chip places the security of the global electronic commerce system at risk .
A professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel , Adi Shamir , circulated a research note about the problem to a small group of colleagues .
He wrote that the increasing complexity of modern microprocessor chips was almost certain to lead to undetected errors .
The risk had been revealed by incidents such as the discovery of an obscure division bug in Intel 's Pentium microprocessor in 1994 , and more recently in a multiplication bug in Microsoft 's Excel spreadsheet program , he wrote .
In one respect , at least , Cadillacs & Dinosaurs is a good example .
In fact , it 's pretty much a title - tells - all situation .
It 's about Cadillacs and dinosaurs , and that 's it .
But how creator Mark Schultz got both Cadillacs and dinosaurs into the same series is n't the sort of thing that can be explained in 25 words or less .
The series takes place several hundred years in the future , after a mostly - undescribed ecological upheaval resulted in the resurgence of many formerly - extinct species , especially large and exciting ones such as dinosaurs .
How did extinct species come back to life ?
Hard to say — but it should be noted that it's at least consistent with some pre-Darwin theories attempting to explain fossils , which hypothesized grand life cycles affecting world - wide ecology over millions of years .
Whatever .
It had dinosaurs .
And Cadillacs .
Handsome , strong , adventurous Jack Tenrec , adept in the ancient art of automobile mechanics , was the hero .
Technology had generally been set back by the upheaval , but bits and pieces of it survived here and there , including the fleet in Jack 's large garage , which leaned heavily toward Jack 's own favorite model — those big ol ' mid-20th century Cadillacs , which he acquired and restored with alacrity .
Oil was n't being refined anymore , but he was able to modify them to run on dinosaur guano .
" You get used to the smell , " he observed , which can also be said of gasoline .
Romance potential was provided by Hannah Dundee , who came to Jack 's locale ostensibly on a diplomatic mission , to persuade Jack to stop chasing criminals into his neighbors ' territory .
She also had an educational mission , to teach farming methods .
Her third mission was n't publicly known — it was to raid the carefully preserved local library for any knowledge she could get out of it .
She and Jack had a complicated relationship where they were sometimes allies and sometimes at odds .
If you saw it on TV , you 'd expect them to be an " item " by about the third or fourth season .
Cartoonist Schultz introduced the scenario in a 12 - page comic book story titled " Xenozoic ! " , which appeared in the eighth issue ( December , 1986 ) of Death Rattle , an anthology of non-series science fiction , fantasy and horror .
The word " xenozoic " is constructed like the names of geological eras such as paleozoic ( " old life " ) and mesozoic ( " middle life " ) .
Parsing it out yields " strange life " .
The publisher was Kitchen Sink Press , which started in underground comix , publishing the likes of Skip Williamson 's Snappy Sammy Smoot and Jay Lynch 's Nard ' n '
Pat , but by ' 86 had branched out into mainstream masterpieces like The Spirit and Steve Canyon .
" Xenozoic " moved immediately into a regular series of its own .
Xenozoic Tales # 1 had a cover date of February , 1987 .
It did n't come out as often as most comic books from major publishers , because Schultz , a meticulous illustrator with a style heavily influenced by such EC Comics stars as Al Williamson ( Flash Gordon ) and Wallace Wood ( T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents ) , did n't churn out the stories on a rigid monthly schedule , and he chose to do the main story in each issue .
( He did , however , let some of the back - page stories be drawn by Steve Stiles , whose work also appeared in Anarchy Comics and Commies from Mars . )
Still , 14 issues came out between 1987 and ' 96 , with a 3 - D edition in 1992 .
The blurb " Cadillacs and dinosaurs " , which was eventually to replace the title , was first seen on the cover of the second issue .
The first Xenozoic trade paperback , which collected issues 1 - 4 , plus the Death Rattle story , was published under the " Cadillacs & Dinosaurs " title .
It came out in 1989 and remained in print for several years .
In 1991 - 92 , Marvel Comics ' " Epic " imprint , which published creator - owned properties such as Groo the Wanderer , reprinted Xenozoic stories in a six - issue mini-series , again using the " Cadillacs & Dinosaurs " title .
That was also the name of the video game , which came out in 1992 .
By that time , " Cadillacs & Dinosaurs " was more - or - less the title everywhere but in the original Kitchen Sink series .
So when CBS aired 13 episodes of it in 1993 , naturally it was titled Cadillacs & Dinosaurs .
The series was produced by Nelvana Ltd. ( Eek ! the Cat , Beetlejuice ) , which was named after one of Canada 's first superheroes .
Jack 's voice was done by David Keeley , who is n't known for other voice work ; and Hannah 's by Susan Roman , who is also heard in Care Bears and Robocop .
The TV series was adapted back into comics by Topps , the bubble gum ( and , consequently , card ) manufacturer which also did comic books in the 1990s , adapting such properties as The Lone Ranger and Xena , Warrior Princess .
In addition to some artwork by Schultz , this series contained the work of Roy Thomas ( Infinity , Inc. , Iron Fist ) , Dick Giordano ( Friday Foster , Sarge Steel ) , Rich Buckler ( Deathlock , Reagan 's Raiders ) and others .
It lasted nine issues , February through November , 1994 .
Cadillacs & Dinosaurs is currently being kept in print , as graphic novels reprinting Schultz 's old comic book work , by Dark Horse Comics ( Usagi Yojimbo , American Splendor ) .

Today in Toons : Every day 's an anniversary !
But when she died suddenly in the custody of Iran 's morals and virtues police - an organisation empowered by the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , to enforce Islamic behavioural standards - officials reported it as suicide .
Now Baniyaghoub 's family are insisting her death was suspicious and have engaged the country 's most famous human rights lawyer , Shirin Ebadi , a Nobel peace prize winner , in an effort to prove she was murdered .
Baniyaghoub 's ordeal started on the morning of October 12 while sitting with her fiancé , Hamid Chitsaz , in a park in the western city of Hamedan .
Officers arrested the couple because they were not legally related and not entitled to be alone together under Islamic law .
Such treatment must have been galling for such a highly qualified couple .
Baniyaghoub , 27 , a graduate of Tehran University 's elite medical school , was a GP in a remote village in one of Iran 's poorest regions and had ambitions to qualify as a heart specialist or urologist .
Her fiancé worked as a radio presenter with the state broadcaster IRIB .
Nevertheless , they were sent before an Islamic judge who ordered their detention .
Chitsaz , who has since lost his job over the matter , was released after his family paid bail .
But Baniyaghoub was detained overnight following delays in informing her parents , who live in Tehran , more than 200 miles away .
By the time her father , Abolghasem , 61 - a retired clerical worker with the revolutionary guards - arrived to secure her release , Baniyaghoub was dead .
A medical report stated she was strangled .
Officials claimed Baniyaghoub , a devout Muslim who prayed every day , was consumed by shame over her crime and used a chair and a piece of textile to hang herself from a beam in her cell .
Baniyaghoub 's family say she would never have taken her own life , not least because of her strong Islamic faith , which taught her to regard suicide as a sin .
Moreover , they argue that she had a legal right to be with Chitsaz because the couple had undergone sigheh , a Shia custom of temporary marriage recognised by the Iranian authorities .
She would therefore have felt no shame in their relationship .
Baniyaghoub 's parents believe she died after being assaulted by one of her captors , and are calling for her corpse to be re-examined .
One theory is that she became involved in an argument with officers after her brother , Rahim , told her in a phone call that her father was on his way to collect her .
As evidence , they say blood started flowing from the nose and ears of her corpse while it was being prepared for burial , suggesting possible brain injuries .
The time of Baniyaghoub 's death was recorded as 9 pm , less than 20 minutes after she spoke to her brother .
' Zahra 's voice was calm when she spoke to her brother .
She was n't suicidal , ' a relative , who asked to remain anonymous , told The Observer .
' The family believe that , as a result of the phone call , she felt some mental support and told these guys they would find out who they were dealing with when her father arrived .
When we examined her body , we found bruises on her legs .
We think they started kicking and beating her and that she has died after her head knocked against something .
Zahra loved serving and saving people .
She was also deeply in love with her fiancé .
Why would she have committed suicide ? '
When her father turned up , he was not initially told of her death but instructed to return the next day , when he was finally informed .
' They humiliated Zahra 's father when he first arrived , telling him to wait in the street and saying , " Your daughter is not morally fit to be a doctor . "
They did all this when she was already dead , ' the relative said .
A detention centre report is said to contain a spate of inaccuracies , including a deliberate alteration to the date of Baniyaghoub 's arrest to make it coincide with that of her death .
Iranian law prohibits the detention of suspected morals offenders for more than 24 hours .
Ebadi is calling on Iran 's judiciary chief , Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi , to open an investigation and supervise it from Tehran because of a lack of co-operation from the authorities in Hamedan .
The call has been supported by a group of former MPs .
Prompted by the record of Baniyaghoub 's father as a former employee , senior revolutionary guard commanders have weighed in by asking Khamenei 's office to investigate .
Ebadi said the case raised disturbing questions about Iran 's treatment of women : ' How can it be that a 27 - year - old woman , a fully qualified doctor , does n't have the right to talk to her fiancé in a public park and the morals police have the right to arrest her ? '
She compared Beniyaghoub 's death to that of Zahra Kazemi , an Iranian - Canadian photojournalist who died in Tehran 's Evin prison four years ago , apparently after suffering a brutal beating by interrogators .
The Supreme Court last week ordered a new investigation into Kazemi 's death , citing ' flaws ' in an original investigation .
How to Rig an Election ?
Ask the Author
We ’ve covered the history of dirty politics in the U.S. here at Freakonomics .
But what about the modern state of affairs ?
Allen Raymond knows a thing or two about bending the rules in the electoral process .
A former G.O.P. political operative who served as chief of staff to a co-chairman of the Republican National Committee and supervised numerous election victories , he saw his political career fall apart when he was sentenced to 3 months in federal prison for jamming Democrat - run phone lines during the 2002 New Hampshire Senate primaries .
His new book , How to Rig an Election , co-written with Ian Spiegelman , details Raymond ’s shenanigans .
He kindly agreed to answer our questions .
Q : You discuss the “ spinning of truth ” that ’s common practice in modern politics .
What are the most frequent tactics employed ?
A : Instead of tactics , how about a lesson from the master of spin himself , President William Jefferson Clinton ?
As a graduate student in 1992 , I marveled when then - Governor Clinton spun a potential candidacy - killing story and outmaneuvered 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft during an interview about Clinton ’s alleged affair with Gennifer Flowers .
The masterstroke was n’t when he blamed it on checkbook journalism , saying , “ It was only when money came out , when the tabloids went down there offering people money to say they had been involved with me , that she changed her story . ”
No , it was when he immediately added , “ There ’s a recession going on . ”
In ten seconds , Clinton went from denying a sordid sex scandal to bashing President George H. W. Bush on the economy .
But more than that , he was actually pointing at Bush ’s recession as the reason poor Ms. Flowers had to debase herself in the press .
In this way , Clinton did all of the following simultaneously : got back to the message , “ It ’s the economy , stupid ; ” dismissed Flowers as a gold digger ; and delivered it all with an air of compassion for his accuser that would satisfy the liberal female voters he needed to win the Democratic nomination .
That kind of unparalleled spin talent deserves respect .
Spin is about bridging from the defensive to the offensive with a well - timed turn of phrase .
In every attack , the devil is in the details , and fortunes can turn on those devilish details when they are manipulated adeptly .
All too often , it is the overconfident who take it in the teeth , as Walter Mondale will attest ; he thought he had Ronald Reagan dead to rights on the age issue after Reagan ’s tired performance during their first presidential debate .
When the issue arose in the second debate , President Reagan left Mondale in the dust by answering , “ I will not make age an issue of this campaign .
I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent ’s youth and inexperience . ”
Of course , absent a deft turn of phrase , there ’s always the option of presenting an overwhelming amount of difficult - to - disprove data while persevering in the face of skepticism ( or even countervailing evidence ) to make voters disbelieve their lying eyes .
Perhaps the best known example of this tactic is the Michael Dukakis tank commercial aired by then - Vice President Bush ’s presidential campaign .
In the 1988 presidential election , the Bush campaign info - slammed reporters with facts about Governor Dukakis ’ position on a number of defense systems , thereby successfully defining the Democratic nominee as weak and capitulating .
Many of the facts were taken out of context , relying heavily on the assumption by the Bush campaign that reporters would grow lazy in the face of so much evidence , and that the Dukakis campaign would not engage on the issue for fear of proliferating coverage of the attack .
The Bush campaign was right .
The image of Dukakis in a tank helmet and tie only supplied credence to the attack that he was a wimp on defense .
Volume of data buries the truth just about every time .
Q : Research has shown that the amount of money spent on an election may actually make little difference to the outcome .
As someone who has spent a career dealing with campaign money , what ’s your response to this study ?
A : The three essential elements in a campaign are money , money , and money .
Politics is a cost - per - contact business ; the more money , the more voter contact , the higher probability of winning .
There are scores of elections in every level of government — local and national congress , gubernatorial races , and so on — and almost all of them are only about money .
If that were n’t true , incumbents would n’t make it ever more difficult for challengers to raise money — which is why 95 percent of incumbents win re-election .
So it ’s safe to assume the study referenced above was commissioned from an ivory tower , and not on the streets where the rubber meets the road .
Not coincidentally , the election where other elements beside money come into play is the most visible : the presidential election .
Those campaigns are partly determined by the news media , and are thus less affected by paid media ( e.g. , TV spots , radio ads , or direct mail pieces that rip an opponent ’s face off ) .
Money raised in presidential primary contests , and disclosed via the Federal Election Commission , has more value as a measure of the viability of the candidate than it does as a means to pay for message delivery and organization .
But in politics , money , like water , always finds a way .
There are over 65 lobbyists for every single member of congress , and they will find a way to make sure their money gets where it needs to be .
If money did not make a difference in the outcome , so many would not donate so much .
Q : After the Iowa caucus , John McCain said that the results showed the following : “ One , you ca n ’t buy an election in Iowa .
And two , negative campaigns do n’t work . ”
Is he right ?
A : Mitt Romney and Steve Forbes will confirm that the Iowa caucus cannot be bought — at least , not by inauthentic white men .
So the presidential primary elections in Iowa are the exception and not the rule .
But the effectiveness of negative political campaigns should never be questioned ; it ’s easier to get a voter to vote “ no ” rather than “ yes . ” Proof ?
Try 1988 ’s Willie Horton ad , the whispers of McCain ’s illegitimate black baby in South Carolina in 2000 , and 2004 ’s Swift Boat Veterans for Truth .
Q : Is there really a line between “ playing fair ” and “ cheating ” in the electoral process ?
Is illegality the only measure of what can and cannot be done ?
A : You do n’t win any prizes for running a moral campaign .
Success in politics is all or nothing : a candidate wins or loses , period , and either ends up with power ( and the extreme likelihood of retaining power ) or no power whatsoever .
So the “ right ” thing is simply defined as the “ winning ” thing .
The bright line of the law is really the only boundary .
The rule of law is the only deterrent against bad actors , whether it ’s in politics , business , government , or any other sector .
Anything more than that is legislating morality , the alleged domain of organized religion and cults .
But the other consideration beyond what ’s legal is what ’s effective : the best rule of thumb about a dirty trick is to consider how it will read in the newspapers if it ’s discovered .
That can be a pretty good deterrent as well — for some , anyway .
Q : Given your experience , do you see the modern electoral process as inherently flawed ?
If so , how ?
Is there a way to fix it ?
A : The system is fine ; it ’s the people within it that are the obstruction .
Politics is a business with its own graduate level degrees , which means student loans that need to be repaid and a need for big money to repay them .
How to Rig an Election is all about how election operatives ( such as myself , previously ) and the politicians who hire them have ensured that idealists can’t win elections .
Mostly it is the cynics making the laws : they win power , they stay in power , and they keep power .
The voters should have plenty of power in this mess , but they give it up during every election .
The electioneering tactics I write about it the book will only get nastier and more brutal , because the tricks of the trade are known , embellished upon , and passed forward by people like me to more people like me ( or , like the person I had been paid to be ) .
The competition is growing stiffer and the stakes are rising with every election .
The only real solution is a savvy , committed electorate .
Q : Would campaign finance reform eliminate some dirty tricks ?
A : The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act ( BCRA ) is little more than lawmakers creating new ways for K Street attorneys to charge higher fees to new clients looking to circumvent the law .
The current , most effective methods for getting around the spirit of the BCRA are the 527 committee and its cynical sibling , the 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) committee , neither of which are regulated by the Federal Election Commission .
The first is a kind of issue advocacy committee that can raise money in large chunks , usually from committed high - net - worth individuals , to advocate for an issue in a TV commercial .
Typically , the ad will say something like this : “ Congressman Smarmet hates clean air .
If you LIKE clean air , then call Congressman Smarmet at the number on your screen and tell him he ’s wrong ! ”
These ads usually air at 1,000 Gross Rating Points ( a viewer frequency measure ) seven days before an election .
The 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) has a slightly different dialect , but it has the same high - net - worth supporters , so the commercial might go something like this : “ Clean air is good , especially for kids and doggies like yours who enjoy breathing it .
But some people , like Congressman Smarmet , think clean air can be bad and dangerous because kids and doggies sometimes breathe too much and choke .
We hope this information is useful as you think about the importance of clean air . ”
I call the 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) cynical because , unlike its 527 sibling , it does n’t have to reveal where the money comes from to fund its commercials .
But both kinds subvert feel - good campaign reform measures like the BCRA , because money is advocacy and advocacy is free speech .
If money is equated to free speech , then all campaign finance reform efforts inevitably tangle with the Constitution , a resilient document that fortunately so far has never lost a challenge .
If you have a problem with this fact , hire a K Street attorney who will be glad to be grandly compensated to lose your appeal in the Supreme Court .
Otherwise , my advice on how to fix the system is to stop complaining and start donating to your cause of choice .
Q : Which party fights dirtier , the G.O.P. or the Democrats ?
Do both employ the same types of ethically questionable tactics ?
Are there any differences ?
A : All one needs to do to assess whether one side fights dirtier is to review the latest and best dirty tricks of the current election cycle .
In the blue trunks we have the Democratic Party : Hillary Clinton ‘s campaign accused Barack Obama of being a Madras [sa ] - educated Muslim .
( In all fairness , the responsible Clinton campaign staffers were fired . )
In the red trunks , the Grand Old Party , never to be outdone in the use of bigotry in the political dialogue : evangelicals in South Carolina were made aware that Romney ’s religion has a history of polygamy .
( Also in fairness , nobody took responsibility for this one . )
The most notorious recent dirty trick was the previously - mentioned allegation that Senator McCain ’s daughter was his illegitimate black love child , rather than the ultimate display of love that is adoption , which cost him South Carolina in 2000 and gave Bush his chance .
Neither side is lily white ; neither side is above dirty tricks .
Though recently , the G.O.P. has seen more felons blossom on its family tree .
Q : You went to prison for election crimes while a lot of other people did n’t .
How do you deal with that ?
A : In writing this book , I wanted to put out the story of what happened .
Once I started working on that , I realized I had an opportunity to do a lot more than just vent about what happened to me ; I could be completely candid and transparent about the whole political process , everything I had witnessed during my years in the machine .
I realized I could give voters the information to understand what they ’re getting the next time they receive a direct mail piece , hear a radio spot , or see a TV ad .
What reaction is expected of the voter by the campaign paying for the message ?
The campaign intends for the targeted voter to react in a certain way , so ask yourself if your initial reaction is honest or reactionary , and then go from there .
For me , the acts of getting it all out in the open and hoping that my knowledge and insight are helpful to people both ensure that I sleep well at night .
That , and knowing I accepted responsibility for my actions , while others continue to lie and deny .
Q : How are you spending your days now ?
And what became of your campaign business ?
A : Federal subpoenas are n’t so good for business .
When I got out of prison , I spent most of my time finishing the book , and at the moment I ’m a stay - at - home dad with an amazing knack for getting my kids to eat their vegetables .
( Hint : lemon makes anything green taste better . )
I ’m also pretty busy administering a philanthropic fund that my family started , so I ’m not exactly missing politics .
Q : You write that the R.N.C. abandoned Dole in the 1996 election ; which candidate /s can you foresee being abandoned this time around ?
A : John McCain .
He is the probable 2008 G.O.P. nominee after winning New Hampshire , and will have a terrifically difficult time taking control of the R.N.C. while George W. Bush continues to occupy the White House — Bush still has a significant voice in what ’s what at 310 First Street in Southeast Washington , D.C. I ca n’t speak to the Democratic National Committee , but I ’d bet that if Senator Obama is the nominee , there will be a lot of Clinton loyalists who are n’t so eager to do his bidding .
Q : In your view , how has the 2008 race played out so far ?
Any surprises ?
Who ’s your pick in the primaries , and in November ?
A : I ’m sticking by the conventional wisdom that Senator Clinton will be the Democratic nominee by virtue of having a presidential caliber organization ; it worked for George W. Bush , so it should work for Clinton too — after all , past is prologue .
I mistakenly dismissed McCain , thinking that Romney ’s money alone would carry him to the nomination .
I failed to weigh the importance of authenticity and seniority in that contest .
Having said that , it ’s all still up in the air , as it is with Clinton and Obama .
He is inspiring voters ( me included — I wish I had been so inspired when I began working in this dirty vocation ) in a way that has n’t been seen since Reagan in 1984 , and is reminiscent of Robert Kennedy .
The biggest surprise could be that both nominations are unresolved going into Super Tuesday .
If that happens , there ’s a good chance the typical television talking head will be thoroughly confused — just as they were the night of the 2008 New Hampshire primary .
Starting in about 40 minutes , I ’ll be liveblogging the Mythbusters episode where they take on the infamous airplane on a conveyor belt problem .
Updates will be reverse chronological ( newest at the top ) so do n’t scroll down if you ’re DVRing the episode for later viewing or otherwise do n’t want anything spoiled .
Fair warning ?
Ok here we go .

The plane took off so easily .
The laws of physics are proven correct once again .
But I ’m not sure this is going to settle anything .
I ’m getting email as we speak that the test was unfair .
Plane was too light .
Tarp was pulled too slowly .
Etc .
But the thing is , it does n’t matter how large the plane is …given enough runway and a strong enough conveyor belt , it will still take off .
Ditto for the speed of the treadmill … it does n’t matter how fast the treadmill is moving .
It could be going 300 mph in the opposite direction and as long as the bearings in the plane ’s wheels do n’t melt , it ’s gonna take off .
( For an explanation , try this one by my friend Mouser , who has a MIT Ph.D in Physics Sc.D. in Nuclear Science and Engineering . )

Cockroach mini-myth : cockroaches would survive a nuclear blast longer than humans but there were other kinds of bugs that fared better .
Another commercial .
9:47
p
Back to the shaving cream in the car prank .
Now they ’re going to use A - B foam … they ’re trying to fill all the space in the car and perhaps explode it .
Totally worked .
9:44
p
Expedia commercial .
Nice synergistic placement .
Good work , Discovery Channel ’s ad sales team .
9:43
p
Ok , to do the large - scale plane test , they ’re using a 2000 foot tarp and a 400 pound ultralight .
Tarp is pulled in one direction and the plane tries to take off in the other direction .
The wind is picking up and blowing the tarp runway all over the place .
They ’re also having problems with punching holes in the tarp .
They ’re going to try again after we hear some more about radioactive cockroaches .
Aaaand , another commercial .
9:36
p
Second mini-myth : if you freeze a can of shaving cream , cut it open , and then put the foam in a car , it will heat and expand to fill the car .
One can did almost nothing .
50 cans did n’t do too much either .
9:32

Off to commercial again .
Macbook Air ad .
I do n’t understand all the whining about how expensive and underpowered it is .
You ca n’t get by with an 80 GB hard drive ?
Come on .
9:30
p
Now a bit of explanation from the boys .
( Things are moving faster now , which is welcome . )
The thrust from the airplane acts upon the air so it does n’t matter too much what the runway is doing to the plane ’s wheels .
And then back to the roach thing .
They irradiated them ( and some other bugs ) and most of the roaches died .
Still pending …
9:25
p
Ok , they ’re dragging paper behind a Segway and trying to take off with the model airplane in the opposite direction .
IT JUST TOOK OFF .
9:19
p
Back to the roach thing .
More recapping and a little bit more setup .
I do n’t see how people can watch this show …it ’s sooooo slooooow .
And now another commercial break .
Hello picture - in - picture .
9:18
p
As expected , the model airplane “ flew ” off the end of the exercise treadmill .
It did n’t have enough room to take off , but if it stayed straight , it probably would have .
9:14
p
First recap …they took a solid minute to explain what they ’ve already done .
Ugh .
9:13
p
Going into the first commercial , we ’ve caught a glimpse of how they ’re going to test the main myth .
They ’re going to drag a huge plastic sheet long the ground and have the plane sit on the plastic and being going the other way attempting to take off .
A reasonable substitute for the treadmill .
9:08
p
They ’re starting off small with a model airplane on an exercise treadmill .
They ’re showing the two hosts learning how to fly the tiny airplane .
One of them is riding around on a Segway .
Oh , and they ’re also doing two other mini-myths during the episode .
They just switched gears to the first mini-myth : can a cockroach survive a nuclear blast ?
9:04
p
And we ’re off .
They ’re calling it “ the moment we ’ve all been waiting for ” .
My guess : the plane will take off .
8:58
p
I ’ve only watched one other episode of Mythbusters before today .
I found the show to be a little slow and very repetitive ; 8 minutes of material stretched into 45 minutes of show .
Unfortunately , this practice seems to be common among science programs on television .

Thanks to everyone who responded .
The FoML was on his first sleepover and my wife and I decided to take advantage by going of to a romantic getaway .
The Claremont in Berkeley is the local premiere romantic resort , so we decided to go there .
We were hoping for something like the Hotel Del Coronado , where we got married .
It certainly did n't live up to that reputation by any metric , least of all , fair treatment .
We reserved a " newly renovated large bay view room with a king size bed " .
We arrive right at checkin and after what seemes to be an unusual amount of clicka - clicka - clicka by the manager , we got keys for room 231 .
We get to the room and discover that it is a ) not newly renovated ( ungrounded plugs are the givaway ) , b ) faces a hill side beyond a parking lot and a dumpster , c ) is barely large enough to accommodate the queen sized bed .
So we go back down .
Now there 's a huge line .
We are a bit disturbed to see that the guy who had been checking in next to us is still there , and seems to be having some sort of animated discussion with the clerk .
After fifteen minutes , as we approach the same manager who originally checked us in , a woman who had just finished in front of us whispers " good luck " as we pass .
The conversation is simple :
Me : " We seem to have gotten the wrong room .
We reserved a newly renovated large bay view room with a king size bed .
Room 231 was none of these . "
Manager : [ looks confused ]
Me : " See , here " [ hands manager a printout showing the reservation ]
manager : " Oh , I 'm sorry sir !
Let me see what I can do . " [ goes clicka - clicka for another ten minutes ]
He gives us room 200 .
He is just about to toss our printed reservation in the trash when my wife demands it back .
Room 200 turns out to be just across the hallway from room 231 .
It also turns out to be identical to room 231 with the exception of the view , which does , actually , face the bay .
It is half obstructed by part of the building , but it does , at least , face the right way .
Now it is important to realize that no one has said anything about the fact that they are charging us for a room that is substantially better than we are in .
I call the front desk .
The first time , the phone rings for 10 - 15 rings before I give up .
The second time , it only rings seven times before the manager answers .
Me : " This is still not right .
It has a bay view , but it 's not newly renovated , large , nor does it have a king size bed .
I just want to find out what the cost of this room is . "
Manager : " I 'm sorry sir , I can see that you reserved one of our " distinctive " rooms and we were unable to put you in one . " [ more rambling explanation follows ]
Me : " I understand that .
I just want to know what this room rents for .
Manager : " Ok , I 'll tell you what , I 'll just give you your first night free . "
This is a bit unexpected .
Me : " Er ... we 're only staying one night . "
Manager : " There ya go ! " [ hangs up ] .
This obviously did not leave me with lots of confidence , but after spending an hour of our " romantic getaway " at this , we decided to enjoy ourselves for a while .
And we do .
The next morning , the bill is slipped under the door .
And , as expected , we are being charged the full rate for a large , renovated room with a king sized bed .
After another call , I get them to knock the price down to that of the actual room .
Obviously I checked at the desk to get a physical piece of paper confirming this .
What is so irksome is not the overbooking ... that 's annoying , but I could have dealt with that .
What is irksome is the blatant lying and fraud .
It 's one thing to screw up , and overbook .
An apology and a discount takes care of that .
But trying to out - and - out rip me off is quite another .
It crosses the line from " possibly annoying the customer " to " send customer to Better Business Bureau " .
Who needs a strip club when you can just ride the New York City subways ?
In March , four limber women took to the subway in a quest to win $ 10,000 from DareJunkies.com .
The website offered the prize to the best public pole dance .
The video features Laura Lee Anderson , Jessica Wu , Marissa Lupp , Isis Masoud , and regular subway riders as the four grind their way to the $ 10,000 prize .
The scantily clad women were hogging the poles for twirls and using the overhead handles for other dance tricks - one of them even did a split on the subway floor !
While there was at least one rider unhappy with the stunt , several other riders seem pleased with the dancing , especially one male rider who received a lap dance .
Some riders even missed their stops by six stations to continue watching the show !
The MTA was n't too pleased with the dancing quartet , who call themselves the " Pole- ite Girls " .
MTA spokesperson Paul Fleuranges told the Daily News , " The last thing we want is for anyone to turn our subways into roving burlesque stages for crude exhibitionists .
While the rules do n't specifically state lap or pole dancing ... what is depicted here is disorderly conduct . "
We 're unsure whether the riders tipped , but this could be a burgeoning form of panhandling in New York .
Just be sure to have plenty of dollar bills to tip your dancer .
One thing 's for certain , these ladies may be the dirtiest pole dancers in New York City .
Clearly the women do n't care about hogging the poles or what the violence it could lead to .
Researchers in New York believe they have solved one of the great mysteries of the flu :
Why does the infection spread primarily in the winter months ?
The answer , they say , has to do with the virus itself .
It is more stable and stays in the air longer when air is cold and dry , the exact conditions for much of the flu season .
“ Influenza virus is more likely to be transmitted during winter on the way to the subway than in a warm room , ” said Peter Palese , a flu researcher who is professor and chairman of the microbiology department at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and the lead author of the flu study .
Dr. Palese published details of his findings in the Oct. 19 issue of PLoS Pathogens .
The crucial hint that allowed him to do his study came from a paper published in the aftermath of the 1918 flu pandemic , when doctors were puzzling over why and how the virus had spread so quickly and been so deadly .
Two Australians have paddled themselves into the record books by successfully completing the first kayak crossing of the Tasman .
James Castrission and Justin Jones received a heroes ' welcome in the North Island port city of New Plymouth this morning .
The two young adventurers stood in the seats of their nine - metre kayak to salute the massive crowd of well - wishers that turned out on the New Plymouth foreshore .
They completed their epic paddle just after midday local time ( 10:00 am AEDT ) , 61 days after setting out from Forster on the New South Wales mid-north coast .
They completed the last few kilometres flanked by a huge flotilla of fellow kayakers , pleasure craft and two Maori war canoes , ahead of a triumphant reunion with family and friends on the beach .
Although a little unsteady on their feet , the pair seemed in remarkably good physical shape after two months in the cramped confines of the kayak , but have been taken to hospital for precautionary checks .
They have promised to party hard to celebrate their record - breaking accomplishment as soon as they get the all - clear from doctors .
Mr Castrission thanked supporters : " Thank you so much guys , we 're just going to go off to hospital now to get a check up , but we 're so , so happy . "
But it has not been plain sailing , with the wild stretch of water testing the two young adventurers ' mettle , their kayak , and its equipment to the limit .
They had hoped to reach New Zealand by Christmas , but unhelpful headwinds and swirling currents out in the Tasman added an extra 1,000 kilometres to the journey and saw their food supplies dwindle .
In the end , conditions for their arrival off the Taranaki coast were benign .
In February last year another Australian , Andrew McAuley , went missing while attempting a solo kayak crossing of the Tasman .
His capsized kayak was found floating off the New Zealand coast near Milford Sound .
He is presumed to be dead .
1 Mike , the Headless Chicken : Lived for 18 months with its head cut off
Mike the Headless Chicken ( April 1945 – March 1947 ) was a Wyandotte rooster ( cockerel ) that lived for 18 months after its head had been cut off .
Thought by many to be a hoax , the bird was taken by its owner to the University of Utah in Salt Lake City to establish its authenticity .
On Monday September 10 , 1945 , farmer Lloyd Olsen of Fruita , Colorado , had his mother - in - law around for supper and was sent out to the yard by his wife to bring back a chicken .
Olsen failed to completely decapitate the five - and - a - half month old bird named Mike .
The axe missed the jugular vein , leaving one ear and most of the brain stem intact .
Once his fame had been established , Mike began a career of touring sideshows in the company of such other creatures as a two - headed calf .
He was also photographed for dozens of magazines and papers , featuring in Time and Life magazines .
Olsen drew criticism from some for keeping the headless chicken alive .
In March 1947 , at a motel in Phoenix on a stopover while traveling back home from tour , Mike started choking in the middle of the night .
As the Olsens had inadvertently left their feeding and cleaning syringes at the sideshow the day before , they were unable to save Mike .
2 Oscar , the cat : predicted the impending death of terminally ill patients
Oscar was adopted as a kitten from an animal shelter and grew up in the third - floor dementia unit at Steere House Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Providence , Rhode Island .
The unit treats people with Alzheimer ’s , Parkinson ’s disease and other illnesses , most of whom are in the end stage of their illnesses ( where death is imminent ) and are generally unaware of their surroundings .
After about six months , the staff noticed that Oscar , just like the doctors and nurses , would make his own rounds .
Oscar would sniff and observe patients , then curl up to sleep with certain ones .
What surprised the staff was that the patients with whom Oscar would sleep would generally die within two to four hours after Oscar ’s arrival .
One of the first cases involved a patient who had a blood clot in her leg that was ice cold at the time .
Oscar wrapped his body around her leg and stayed until the woman died .
In another instance , the doctor had made a determination of impending death based on the patient ’s condition , while Oscar simply walked away , causing the doctor to believe that Oscar ’s streak ( 12 at the time ) had ended .
However , it would be later discovered that the doctor ’s prognosis was simply 10 hours too early – Oscar later visited the patient , who died two hours later .
Oscar ’s accuracy ( currently standing at more than 25 reported instances ) led the staff to institute a new and unusual protocol – once he is discovered sleeping with a patient , staff will call family members to notify them of the patient ’s ( expected ) impending death .
Most of the time the patient ’s family has no issue with Oscar being present at the time of death ; on those occasions when he is removed from the room at the family ’s request , he is known to pace back and forth in front of the door and meow in protest .
When present , Oscar will stay by the patient until he or she takes their last earthly breath – after which Oscar will sit up , look around , then depart the room so quietly that one barely notices .
Abilities aside , what makes his “ last hour ” companionship more puzzling is that Oscar is described by Dr. David Dosa as “ not a cat that ’s friendly to [ living ] people . ”
One example of this was described in his NEJM article .
When an elderly woman with a walker passed him by during his rounds , Oscar “ [ let ] out a gentle hiss , a rattlesnake - like warning that [ said ] ‘ leave me alone . ' ”
3 Tillamook Cheddarm , the dog : world ’s most successful animal painter
Tillamook Cheddar is a Jack Russell Terrier from Brooklyn , New York .
Widely regarded as the world ’s preeminent canine artist , she has already had seventeen solo exhibitions in the U.S. and Europe .
Tillie is eight years old .
In July 2005 the artist gave birth to six healthy puppies .
One of her sons , Doc Chinook Strongheart Cheddar , continues to live with her .
Thus far , Doc has not followed his mother in her artistic forays .
Her first official biography , Portrait of the Dog as a Young Artist by F. Bowman Hastie III , is published by Sasquatch Books ( 2006 ) .
The artist ’s primary process is a dynamic color transfer technique .
In preparation for each of Tillie ’s works , her assistants assemble a touch - sensitive recording device by affixing pigment - coated vellum to a sheet of lithograph paper backed by mat board .
The artist takes the prepared “ canvas ” in her mouth and brings it to her workspace .
Working on the outside surface , she applies pressure with teeth and claws in a methodic ritual marked by dramatic shifts in tempo and intensity .
The resultant sharp and sweeping intersecting lines complement the artist ’s delicate paw prints and subtle tongue impressions , composing an expressionistic image that is revealed on the paper beneath when she is finished .
She works with shocking intensity , sometimes to the point of destroying her creations .
4 Alex , the parrot : could count to six , identify colors and even express frustration
Alex ( 1976 – September 6 , 2007 ) was an African Grey Parrot and the subject of a thirty - year ( 1977 -2007 ) experiment by animal psychologist Irene Pepperberg , initially at the University of Arizona and later at Harvard and Brandeis University .
Pepperberg bought
Alex in a regular pet shop when he was about one year old .
The name Alex is actually an acronym for Avian Learning EXperiment .
Before Pepperberg ’s work with Alex , it was widely believed in the scientific community that birds were not intelligent and could only use words by mimicking , but Alex ’s accomplishments indicated that birds may be able to reason on a basic level and use words creatively .
Pepperberg wrote that Alex ’s intelligence was on a par with that of dolphins and great apes .
She also reported that Alex had the intelligence of a five - year - old human and had not reached his full potential by the time he died .
She said that the bird had the emotional level of a human two - year - old at the time of his death .
Alex ’s death came as a complete surprise ; the average life span for African grey parrots is fifty years .
He had appeared healthy the day before , and was found dead in the morning .
According to a press release issued by the Alex Foundation , “ Alex was found to be in good health at his most recent annual physical about two weeks [ before his death ] .
According to the vet who conducted the necropsy , there was no obvious cause of death . ”
According to Pepperberg , Alex ’s loss will not halt the research but will be a large setback .
The lab has two other birds , but their skills do not approach Alex’s .
On October 4 , 2007 The Alex Foundation posted the Pathology results : “ Alex died quickly .
He had a sudden , unexpected catastrophic event associated with arterosclerosis ( “ hardening of the arteries ” ) .
It was either a fatal arrhythmia , heart attack or stroke , which caused him to die suddenly with no suffering .
There was no way to predict his demise .
All of his tests , including his cholesterol level and asper levels , came back normal earlier that week .
His death could not be connected to his current diet or his age ; our veterinarian said that she has seen similar events in young ( < 10 year old ) birds on healthy diets .
most likely , genetics or the same kind of low - level ( impossible to detect in as yet ) inflammatory disease that is related heart humans was responsible . "
5 Washoe , the chimpanzee : knew sign language
Washoe ( around September of 1965 – October 30 , 2007 ) was a chimpanzee who was the first non-human to learn American Sign Language .
She also passed on her knowledge to three other chimpanzees , Loulis , Tatu and Dar .
As part of a research experiment on animal language acquisition , Washoe developed a modest ability to communicate with humans using ASL .
She was named for Washoe County , Nevada , where she was raised and taught to use ASL .
Washoe had lived at Central Washington University since 1980 ; on October 31 , 2007 , officials from the Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute on the CWU campus announced that she had died the previous day .
6 Oliver , the “ Humanzee ” : a human - chimp hybrid
Oliver was acquired as a young animal ( around 2 years old ) in the early 1970s by trainers Frank and Janet Berger .
Supposedly , the chimpanzee had been caught in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( then Zaire ) .
Some physical and behavioral evidence led the Bergers to believe Oliver was a creature other than a chimpanzee , perhaps a human - chimp hybrid :
Oliver possesses a flatter face than his fellow chimpanzees ( as his front teeth were removed young , he did not develop an exaggerated prognathus jaw ) ;
Oliver was habitually bipedal ( before being struck with arthritis ) , never walking on his knuckles like his chimpanzee peers ; and Oliver may have preferred human females over chimpanzee females .
During a recent Discovery Channel special , Janet Berger herself claimed that Oliver was becoming attracted to her when he reached the age of 16 .
He mounted her and tried to mate with her .
After he tried it several times it became apparent that Oliver was a threat to Janet , and had to be sold .
Still , Oliver was not the clownish performer his chimp peers were , and other chimps avoided him .
Some people claim he did not possess a typical odor common to chimpanzees .
7 Cacareco , the Rhino : won Sao Paulo ’s council elections with 100,000 votes
Cacareco , a rhinoceros at the São Paulo zoo , was a candidate for the 1958 city council elections with the intention of protesting against political corruption .
Electoral officials , of course , did not accept Cacareco ’s candidacy , but he eventually won 100,000 votes , more than any other party in that same election ( which was also marked by rampant absenteeism ) .
