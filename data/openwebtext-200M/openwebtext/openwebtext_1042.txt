CHICAGO  Ralph Medley , a retired professor of philosophy and English who is black , remembers the day he was arrested on his own property , a rental building here in Hyde Park where he was doing some repair work for tenants .
A concerned neighbor had called the police to report a suspicious character .
And that was not the first time Mr. Medley said he had been wrongly apprehended .
A call Mr. Medley placed to 911 several years ago about a burglary resulted with the police showing up to frisk him .
“ But I ’m the one who called you ! ” he said he remembers pleading with the officers .
Like countless other blacks around the country , Mr. Medley was revisiting his encounters with the police as a national discussion about race and law enforcement unfolded after the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr. , Harvard ’s prominent scholar of African - American history .
Professor Gates was arrested for disorderly conduct July 16 at his home in Cambridge , Mass . , as the police investigated a report of a possible break - in there .
The charge was later dropped , and the Cambridge Police Department said the incident was “ regrettable and unfortunate . ”
In interviews here and in Atlanta , in Web postings and on television talk shows , blacks and others said that what happened to Professor Gates was a common , if unacknowledged , reality for many people of color .
They also said that beyond race , the ego of the police officer probably played a role .
The chief executive of Apple , Steven P. Jobs , who has been on a medical leave since January for treatment of what he called a hormone imbalance , underwent a liver transplant two months ago at a hospital in Tennessee , The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday .
The newspaper said doctors had advised Mr. Jobs to return to work as planned at the end of this month , but on a part - time basis .
Mr. Jobs , through his wife , Laurene Powell , declined to comment on Saturday when reached at the couple ’s home in Palo Alto , Calif .
In 2004 , Mr. Jobs had surgery to remove a growth called an islet cell tumor from his pancreas .
That procedure , according to people briefed on his illness , created chronic digestive problems and contributed to severe weight loss .
Dr. Kara Fine , an endocrinologist in New York who has not treated Mr. Jobs , said the liver transplant might be related to the digestive problems , or to some unknown condition , and not to a spreading of his cancer .
Top Bush administration officials , including former CIA Director George J. Tenet and former Vice President Dick Cheney , opted not to brief Congress on a secret program belatedly disclosed to Congress last month by CIA Director Leon E. Panetta , according to an intelligence official with direct knowledge of the program .
The official , who asked not to be named because of the classified nature of the program , said that the decision to keep the details of the program secret in the past was made in part because the program remained “ in the capability stage , ” meaning it had been developed but not necessarily implemented .
“ These activities lasted , if you will , for years , ” this official said .
“ There were other conversations about whether this should be taken to Congress .
The same decision was made again by senior officials at the time . ”
The New York Times first reported on its Web site Saturday that the program was concealed from Congress at the direction of Mr. Cheney , who was and remains a strong proponent of harsh measures to prevent terrorist attacks .
The Associated Press , quoting an unnamed source , reported that Mr. Cheney had directed the CIA not to inform Congress about the program .
An official told The Washington Times that Mr. Cheney “ was one official out of a select few who was aware of the program . ”
Mr. Tenet was another , he said .
The exact nature of the program remains a mystery .
This official hinted that the secret program involved assassinations overseas but declined to provide further details .
Another intelligence official , who also spoke on the condition that he not be named , said the classified program was known as an SAP , or special access program .
SAPs are intelligence activities that are so secret that even officers with the highest intelligence clearances do not know about them , and their access is reserved for only the most senior officials and officers directly working on the activities .
CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano declined to comment on the program .
“ We have not commented on the substance of what this was , ” he said .
Efforts to reach the former vice president and Mr. Tenet on Saturday were not successful .
Mr. Panetta , upon learning of the program ’s existence on June 23 , immediately ordered it ended and briefed intelligence committees about it on June 24 .
Several Democrats have said that under U.S. law , the CIA is required to brief Congress about programs even if they have not been implemented .
A senior congressional Democratic aide , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic , said , “ The National Security Act of 1947 requires reporting not just of intelligence activities , but also anticipated intelligence activities .
There is no law or exemption anywhere that says if you already have the statutory authority you do not have to inform Congress of intelligence activities . ”
In a letter to Mr. Panetta dated June 26 , seven Democrats said the new CIA chief had acknowledged in his June 24 briefing that CIA officials during the Bush administration misled Congress about activities carried out after the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Republicans have countered that Congress was adequately briefed .
A third intelligence official who spoke on the condition that he not be named told The Washington Times on Thursday that Mr. Panetta , a former congressman from California , “ took decisive steps to inform the oversight committees of something that had n’t been appropriately briefed in the past .
He did n’t attribute motives to that .
He was n’t director at the time . ”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat , has accused the CIA of lying to her and said she was never told that several terrorist suspects were being subjected to a harsh interrogation technique known as waterboarding .

Of all the professional hubris I 've observed in software developers , perhaps the greatest sin of all is that we consider ourselves typical users .
We use the computer obsessively , we know a lot about how it works , we even give advice to friends and relatives .
We are experts .
Who could possibly design software better than us superusers ?
What most developers do n't realize is how freakishly outside the norm we are .
We 're not even remotely average -- we are the edge conditions .
I 've often told program managers : if you are letting me design your software , your project is in trouble .
In The Inmates Are Running the Aslum , Alan Cooper labels this phenomenon Homo Logicus :
Homo logicus desires to have control over things that interest them , and the things that interest them are complex , deterministic systems .
People are complex , but they do n't behave in a logical and predictable way , like machinery .
The best machinery is digital , because it can be the most complex , sophisticated , and easily changed by the programmer .
The price of control is always more effort and increased complexity .
Most people are willing to make a moderate effort , but what differentiates programmers from most people is their willingness and ability to master extreme complexity .
It is a satisfying part of the programmer 's job to know and manage systems composed of many interacting forces .
Flying airplanes is the archetypal programmer 's avocation .
The cockpit control panel of an airplane is packed with gauges , knobs , and levers , but programmers thrive on those daunting complexities .
Homo logicus finds it fun and engaging , despite ( because of ! ) the months of rigorous study required .
Homo sapiens would rather ride along as passengers .
For Homo logicus , control is their goal and complexity is the price they will pay for it .
For normal humans , simplicity is their goal , and relinquishing control is the price they will pay .
In software - based products , control translates into features .
For example , in Windows 95 , the " Find File " function gives me lots of control over the procedure .
I can specify which area of my disk to search , the type of file to search for , whether to search by file name or by file contents , and several other parameters .
From a programmer 's point of view , this is very cool .
For some extra up - front effort and understanding , he gets to make the search faster and more efficient .
Conversely , the user 's point of view is less rosy because he has to specify the area of the search , the type of file to search for , and whether to search by name or contents .
Homo sapiens would gladly sacrifice the odd extra minute of compute time if they did n't have to know how the search function works .
To them , each search parameter is just another opportunity to enter something incorrectly .
The probability of making a mistake and the search function failing is higher , not lower , with the added flexibility .
They would gladly sacrifice all that unnecessary complexity , control , and understanding in order to make their job simpler .
Homo logicus are driven by an irresistible desire to understand how things work .
By contrast , Homo sapiens have a strong desire for success .
While programmers also want to succeed , they will frequently accept failure as the price to pay for understanding .
There 's an old joke about engineers that gives some insight into this need to understand .
Three people are scheduled for execution : a priest , an attorney , and an engineer .
First , the priest steps up to the gallows .
The executioner pulls the lever to drop the hatch , but nothing happens .
The priest claims divine intervention and demands his release , so he is set free .
Next , the attorney takes a stand at the gallows .
The executioner pulls the lever , but again nothing happens .
The attorney claims another attempt would be double jeopardy and demands release , so he is set free .
Finally , the engineer steps up to the gallows , and begins a careful examination of the scaffold .
Before the executioner can pull the lever , he looks up and declares , " Aha , here 's your problem . "
Cooper goes on to list a few more traits of Homo Logicus :
trades simplicity for control
exchanges success for understanding
focuses on what is possible to the exclusion of what is probable
acts like a jock
Pity the poor user , merely a Homo Sapiens , who is n't interested in computers or complexity ; he just wants to get his job done .
Anybody can build a complex application that nobody can figure out how to use .
That 's easy .
Building an application that 's simple to use .. well , now that takes actual skill .
I 'm not sure you need high priced interaction designers to achieve this goal , but you do have to stop thinking like Homo Logicus -- and start thinking like Homo Sapiens .

OTTAWA–Canada 's outgoing information watchdog is threatening to seize documents after complaints that the bureaucratic wing of the Prime Minister 's Office is stonewalling some access - to - information requests .
The information commissioner served formal notice on the Privy Council Office this week , warning that commission staff would use their legal powers to seize the documents themselves if the paperwork was n't provided by today .
" I 'm about to walk into PCO next week ... for files they did n't give us .
We 're going to take them and they can't stop us , " Robert Marleau told the Star .
" I can not be denied access .
I can walk into any federal government premise without notice and take what I need . "
Marleau , who attracted some criticism for not being more forceful in defending access to information rights , could end his tenure as commissioner with an extraordinary move on the highest bureaucratic office in the federal government .
While it 's a rare step , a clearly frustrated Marleau says the Privy Council Office , which supports the Prime Minister 's Office and cabinet , is blocking his efforts to ensure Canadians have access to information .
" The powers are there for a reason so that where there is ... stonewalling or deliberate obstruction , we can break that jam .
By and large , I 'm here to serve Canadians .
So is the department that is being asked to give a response .
We should n't have to have a struggle , " he said .
Marleau is probing complaints about the PCO 's handling of access - to - information requests by Canadians .
In particular , he wants answers on 150 cases that involve " administrative " issues – complaints that could include the PCO 's demand for photocopying costs , other fees and time extensions .
Marleau , who announced his retirement this week , made clear there 's no reason why such complaints could not have been informally resolved long ago , saving the time and effort of a drawn - out investigation as well as the frustration of those making the requests .
" We should be able to lick administrative complaints at the early resolution stage , " he said , snapping his fingers for emphasis .
He hinted at one possible motivation – the government 's desire to tie up a file and delay the release of information .
" If you overcharge for photocopies and got a complaint , that file was parked for two years .
It takes the pressure off , " Marleau said .
" I wo n't let that happen any more . "
The Privy Council Office was unable to comment in time for deadline yesterday .
Under the Access to Information Act , Canadians can pay a $ 5 fee and request government records .
If they 're not happy with the response , they can complain to the information commissioner and have the file reviewed .
But to do that , the information commissioner needs the files in question – and that 's what the Privy Council has so far refused to provide .
Marleau says his office has " awesome , " though rarely used , powers to conduct investigations into those complaints .
" Without serving a subpoena , I can walk in anywhere and get the documents I want and keep them for 10 days , which allows the office here to photocopy and return , " he said .
In more than two years as commissioner , Marleau says he 's never had to exercise these powers .
And he's had to threaten to use them only two or three times , which he says has usually been enough to produce the documents .
" It should be rare .
We 're trying to serve Canadians , " he said .

The commission received 198 complaints in 2008 - 09 about the Privy Council 's handling of information requests , ranking fourth among federal agencies .
The Canada Revenue Agency attracted the most complaints with 302 .
In a February report card , Marleau rated the PCO 's performance on access to information as " average " but said its response to requests was improving .
Jan 17 , 2015 ; St. Petersburg , FL , USA ;
East head coach Mike Singletary points during the second quarter at the East - West Shrine Game at Tropicana Field .
Mandatory Credit : Kim Klement - USA TODAY Sports
San Francisco 49ers head coach Mike Singletary has some unique ways to motivate his team .
What are some out - of - the - box ways he may use this season ?
Niner Noise takes a look .
Remember when Mike Singletary dropped his pants during half - time against the Seahawks last year to motivate his team in his first game as coach ?
Well he is in full control now and entering his first training camp and first NFL season he has to top himself somehow .
Here are my predictions :
Singletary will hire former teammate William “ the Refrigerator ” Perry to roam the sidelines dressed only in a jock strap and any player who misses a play or does not give 100 % will face the ire of the Refrig when he returns to the bench .
Singletary will threaten to move any player to Santa Clara who does not give 100 % .
Singletary will threaten to trade any player to the Raiders who does not give 100 % .
Singletary will threaten to bring back Mike Nolan .
Instead of sending a player to the locker room when they get an unnecessary penalty he will instead send him to the upper -deck of Candlestick Park to watch the rest of the game .
They will have to take the escalators on the east side of the stadium which are known to break down .
Every time the secondary gives up a pass of 15 or more yards they will have to buy fans the cheaply priced $ 8 beers for the whole stadium .
If Singletary names Alex Smith the starter he will make him wear a headband and Ray - Ban ’s when he starts to make him feel more comfortable naming him the starter and to give Smith some swagger ala Jim McMahon .
What are your predictions ?

( CNN ) --
The FBI , in a rare response to rampant rumors on the Internet , said it is not investigating Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin on public corruption charges .
Alaska 's Sarah Palin is stepping down as governor at the end of the month .
" Normally , we do n't confirm or deny those kind of allegations out there .
But , by not doing so , it just casts her in a very bad light , " said FBI Special Agent Eric Gonzalez , who confirmed for CNN the statement he made to the Anchorage Daily News .
" There is just no truth to those rumors out there in the blogosphere . "
Gonzalez told The Los Angeles Times that there was " no wiggle room " in his comments for any kind of inquiry .
The speculation began almost immediately after Palin 's unexpected announcement on Friday that she would step down as Alaska 's chief executive with 18 months left in her term .
Palin , who was John McCain 's surprise vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election , said she already knew she would not seek a second term and decided against being a lame duck governor for the next 18 months .
She also said too much time and taxpayer expense were going toward fighting ethics investigations , and that the mainstream media were continuing with unfair attacks on her and her family .
Some analysts think Palin will seek the 2012 Republican presidential nomination , and that her resignation is intended to free her to prepare .
Immediate reaction to Palin 's resignation among fellow conservatives was not positive .
Karl Rove , the " architect " of George W. Bush 's successful presidential campaigns , said the resignation left many of Palin 's fellow Republicans " a little perplexed . "
" It 's a risky strategy , " Rove told " Fox News Sunday . "
" Astounding , " was the pronouncement by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa , and conservative columnist George Will said Palin was declaring herself a quitter .
" The one that rings most hollow is she does n't want to put Alaska through the terror of [ her ] being a lame - duck governor , " Will told the ABC program " This Week . "
" If she is just weary of it , one can understand that .
Still , she made a contract with them [ voters ] to serve out her term .
And she said , in her own words , she now is a quitter . "
" How sad that Washington and the media will never understand ; it 's about country , " Palin said in a statement attributed to her on her Facebook page .
" And though it 's honorable for countless others to leave their positions for a higher calling and without finishing a term , of course we know by now , for some reason a different standard applies for the decisions I make .
But every American understands what it takes to make a decision because it 's right for all , including your family . "

NINETIES indie heroes Blur have reformed as Blur Accountancy Ltd , offering fans a wide range of financial services .
Former singer Damon Albarn said the band had talked about getting back together for several months before the recession presented them with the ' perfect opportunity ' to do something involving money .
He added : " The music business can dazzle you with the tunes and the rhythms and the fancy guitars , but it 's always been about the money for us .
We like to see it move from one account to another .
We like to touch it .
" I 'll deal with taxation enquiries , while Alex handles the auditing side and Graham offers advice on VAT and payroll .
The drummer will be on reception and do the photocopying .
Clients can rest assured we 're efficient , flexible and 100 % off the charlie . "
Former bassist Alex James said : " Our shared experience of seven - figure coke debts has given us an excellent understanding of the necessity of effectively managing one 's personal , or indeed corporate , finances .
" And I find the varied functionalities of SAGE accounting software every bit as exciting as playing bass guitar to 30,000 screaming fans while completely ripped to the tits .
Just in a different way . "
Blur fan Christine Dawson , of Ludlow , who has become a client of the new firm , said : " At first I was disappointed that they were n't going to do a record or a stadium tour , but then I realised I did actually need some help with my VAT return .
" Damon was extremely helpful , giving a thorough but precise rundown of recent changes in tax legislation and how they might affect my business .
However after our meeting I could n't resist getting him to sign my tits with a marker pen . "
Belgium has been shaken in the last several months by a series of tragic disappearances of children .
Since August 1996 , five young girls who had been missing were found dead , victims of sex crimes .
The police are still searching for at least half a dozen other children who may also be victims of sexual abuse .
In February the Belgian government confirmed that for this case “ paranormal ” leads are being examined by the police .
The Disaster Victim Identification Team of the Belgian Gendarmerie has received the order to collect all tips coming from psychics .
This news created some commotion , since it is the first time in Belgian history that psychics have been used for official purposes .
( The professions of “ psychic ” and “ clairvoyant ” are theoretically prohibited in Belgium , although no one is ever prosecuted . )
A newspaper sarcastically asked if the Gendarmerie should also burn candles or make a pilgrimage to Lourdes .
One senator said that science is discredited by taking psychics seriously .
A well - known , free - thinking scholar compared this mixing of the rational and the irrational to a violation of the separation between church and state .
Belgian Justice Minister Stefaan De Clerck tried to moderate the news .
He emphasized that information coming from psychics should always be considered supplementary , never decisive .
Rumors that one or two psychics were selected as judicial experts were denied by De Clerck .
But the police and the parents of the children received hundreds of tips from psychics , and two university professors , presented as “ academic authorities concerning hypnosis and parapsychology , ” were commissioned to “ filter ” the reliability of those tips .
It is not clear what criteria will be used to “ filter ” the tips .
One of the two “ authorities ” told the press that he will not take into consideration psychics who ask for big money or who cannot tell more about the missing children than what one can find in the newspapers .
This “ authority ” is Jean Dierkens , emeritus professor of psychiatry at the University of Mons .
For more than twenty years , Dierkens has represented himself as an expert in parapsychology .
He claims to have conducted successful experiments in which tables were moved by spirits in his house .
The only critical remark I have ever heard him make is that he is hesitant about the value of astrology .
Minister De Clerck also confessed that the Belgian Gendarmerie “ has not had much experience with psychics ” but that a number of well - known foreign police forces , like the FBI , Scotland Yard , and the Dutch criminal police , have used the services of psychics .
The Gendarmerie even stated that Scotland Yard has psychics as official experts .
Asked for a reaction , the British skeptic Mike Hutchinson said that “ Scotland Yard does n’t have official [ psychic ] experts ” and that “ it is most unlikely that any police force has official psychics , although psychics do claim that this is the case . ”
The reference to the Dutch police seems to be to an article about missing persons and psychics published in a Dutch scientific police review .
While this critical paper states explicitly that “ the practical informative value of paranormal statements made by psychics can be neglected , ” it recommends verification of tips coming from a psychic if the family of a missing person requests it .
It seems indeed that the judicial authorities were embarrassed by the fact that the parents of the missing children were visited by numerous psychics .
Since the authorities were ( rightly ) criticized for not following all the possible leads to the children , they did not want to neglect the psychic tips completely .
But each time a child was found , it was obvious that the information coming from psychics was completely worthless .
The mother of Julie Lejeune confessed she consulted psychics , fortunetellers , and dowsers by her own initiative .
Not one of them came close to identifying the place where Julie was incarcerated for months and where she was buried after she died of starvation .
The father of An Marchal , another girl who was kidnapped and assassinated together with friend Eefje , said he was visited by at least eighty psychics .
“ They saw An and Eefje everywhere in the world , but never in the place where they were finally found . ”
Belgian skeptics were never consulted about the “ filtering ” of paranormal tips — neither about the criteria used in this filtering nor the “ authorities ” doing the filtering .
And it is not just the government that seems to be uncritical in this case .
Marc et Corine , a well - known private organization for tracing missing children that has done very good work , warned in its magazine against tips from psychics but published at the same time a very positive article about dowsing .
Toyota has no plans yet to add noise - making devices to their hybrid cars
Japan is considering the introduction of noise - making devices for near - silent hybrid cars following safety fears from vision - impaired pedestrians .
" Vision - impaired people feel that hybrid vehicles are dangerous " , a transport ministry official told AFP .
The top - selling hybrid vehicles run almost without any sound when they change from fuel to battery mode .
The ministry of transport has brought together a panel that will draw up a report by the end of the year .
The panel is considering forcing manufacturers of hybrid cars to introduce a sound - making function that alerts passersby to the presence of a vehicle .
" Blind people depend on sounds when they walk , but there are no engine sounds from hybrid vehicles when running at low speed , " the transport ministry official said .
The world 's most popular hybrid , the Prius , was launched by Toyota in 1997 .
Paul Nolasco , a spokesman for Toyota Motor in Tokyo , told the BBC it had no immediate plans to add noise - making devices to the hybrid vehicles .
" But if it becomes a social concern , it is something we will have to address " , Mr Nolasco added .

BIOS manufacturer Phoenix Technologies announced plans on Monday to launch a new version of its Linux - based HyperSpace environment that will use some components of Intel 's Moblin platform .
The move reflects Moblin 's growing traction among vendors , but it is also Phoenix 's response to the recent revelation that Google is building its own Linux operating system .
HyperSpace , which was first introduced by Phoenix in 2007 , is an " instant - on " Linux environment designed to run in a slim hypervisor that is part of the BIOS .
It uses its own power management framework that boosts battery life .
HyperSpace can be used by itself on a netbook or shipped alongside a conventional Windows installation .
It provides a simple user interface and an assortment of applications for common tasks , including a Web browser and ThinkFree 's Java - based office suite .
The rising popularity of low - cost netbooks has created demand for lightweight mobile platforms that can boot faster , run longer , and deliver nothing but ' Net .
Such platforms are intended to bring a more appliance - like Web experience to netbook devices .
With the emergence of Google 's Chrome OS as a possible contender in this space , other players are looking for ways to stay competitive .
Google says that Chrome OS will be distributed under an open source license and will be available to use at no cost .
This could seriously undermine the relevance of HyperSpace , which Phoenix commercially licenses to OEMs .
Phoenix is banking on the technical advantages and greater maturity of its platform , characteristics that the company believes will make its offering a better value for hardware manufacturers .
Phoenix CEO Woody Hobbs touts HyperSpace 's ability to seamlessly run side - by - side with other operating systems as a strong advantage and points out that HyperSpace could even potentially be shipped alongside Chrome OS in the future .
He suggests that Google 's announcement of Chrome OS can be viewed as validation of Phoenix 's instant - on computing vision .
He also suggests that it 's important for mobile Linux platforms to use a standardized stack , particularly at the kernel level .
This is why Phoenix is working with Intel and has aligned itself with the Moblin initiative .
It 's not clear , however , how much of the Moblin platform will show up in HyperSpace aside from Intel 's Atom - specific hardware optimizations .
Among the most compelling aspects of Moblin are its fast startup time and slick custom user interface shell , neither of which are of interest to Phoenix .
" Moblin provides OEMs with an optimized framework for Intel Atom processor - based systems , " Hobbs said in a statement .
" HyperSpace enhances this platform with a unique , easy - to - use and fun interface and the ability to bring any application to life instantly .
We enable PC OEMs to commercialize and bring the complete instant - on computing environment to market , with a variety of deployment models best suited for their needs and end user requirements . "
DeviceVM , the company behind an instant - on Linux platform called Splashtop , has also responded to Google 's announcement of Chrome OS .
Sergei Krupenin , senior director of marketing at DeviceVM , posted a blog entry with his thoughts about what the implications could be for lightweight Linux vendors .
Much like Hobbs , he suggests that Chrome OS validates the need for instant - on computing .
He also emphasizes the fact that Splashtop is available today whereas Chrome OS is still on the drawing board .
" The market has been moving towards instant - on computing for a while now , and DeviceVM has already seen tremendous success in the space : tens of millions of PCs already shipped with Splashtop , and our announced and shipping customers include HP , Acer , Sony , Lenovo , ASUS , and LG , " he wrote .
" By the end of 2010 , Splashtop will be in the hands of more than 150 M desktop , nettop , notebook , and netbook users . "
Although Google 's strong brand will give Chrome OS an advantage , Krupenin sagely points out that the search giant 's popularity is not a worldwide phenomenon .
In China and other regions , Google still lags behind native competitors .
DeviceVM will boost the competitiveness of Splashtop by partnering with " leading regional brands to bring more relevant web services to Splashtop users around the world . "
It seems likely that the market for instant - on Linux solutions will remain vibrant as Google joins the fray .
One clear winner in this fight is the open source Linux operating system , which is gaining widespread use in instant - on environments .

In 2007 , during his first trial , a jury failed to reach a unanimous decision Little more than two months since the US producer Phil Spector was sentenced to 19 years in jail , his publicist has said he 's not coping too well .
The Wall of Sound pioneer was convicted of murdering actress Lana Clarkson at his home in May 2009 , after a retrial .
" He 's doing fair , at best , if not worse than fair .
He 's not doing great , " said Hal Lifson about Spector 's state .
Spector is currently residing in a medical facility at the Corcoran State Prison , central California .
The 68 - year - old created some of the most memorable pop hits of the 60s for the likes of Ike and Tina Turner and The Ronettes .
" He 's in a horrible situation with virtually nothing to do all day , " explained Lifson to BBC 6 Music News , " Phil Spector was always a highly productive , creative person and now he's in a five by nine foot cell with no windows and maybe a half hour outside to walk around . "
Not unexpectedly , Lifson said Spector 's current existence is very limited .
" It 's essentially solitary confinement , " he said , " He does n't have computer access , he only recently got a little TV .
" It 's a terrible existence for a millionaire record producer who lived in mansions and most recently in a castle , a 35 - room home .
" It 's a huge , huge change of life for Phil Spector and a devastating turn in his life . "
Manson approach Meanwhile , Spector 's publicist said he was " shaken " by a recent request from notorious convicted murderer , Charles Manson , for a musical collaboration .
Manson is in another maximum security section of the Corcoran State Prison .
He [ Phil Spector ] is very worried that any association be made between himself and Charles Manson
Hal Lifson , Phil Spector 's publicist
The cult leader - who once worked with The Beach Boys - contacted the producer , who he revered as " the greatest who ever lived " , via a note which he gave to a prison guard .
Lifson said Spector has no intention of responding to the message .
" Phil Spector has been very , very alarmed and scared at the notion of Charles Manson contacting him for any reason , " he admitted , " He is very worried that any association be made between himself and Charles Manson .
" He [ Spector ] mentioned that he used to get phone calls from John Lennon and Tina Turner and now it 's Charles Manson calling , so he said , ' Go figure ' .
" It was kind of a dark humour comment . "
Spector is set to appeal in 2010 and if he fails at the state court of appeal , Lifson said Spector plans to go to the federal court of appeal in Washington .

What every successful farmer needs to know … he will learn from his consumer
by Guest Blogger , Mark McAfee , Organic Pastures Dairy
Consumer ’s needs are driving the demand for raw dairy
With the advent of the pasteurizer in 1893 ( first called the par boiler ) far more than bacteria were killed .
The pasteurizer killed personal responsibility .
The pasteurizer disconnected and marginalized the farmer and made his quality efforts irrelevant .
The pasteurizer killed enzymes and good bacteria and nutritional values .
The pasteurizer produced a dead partial food out of a once vital alive and complete whole food .
The pasteurizer started milk markets toward a 100 year long slow death as more and more people could not drink dead milk and became sick from it .
This was a death marked by dairy lies that covered its own demise and cover stories of its false benefits and a racist blame game against broad categories of people for their innate deficiencies from a pasteurized dairy invented deficiency called “ lactose intolerance ” or “ Lie ” ( abbreviated and very true in deed ) .
Literally no one has lactose intolerance … instead it is “ pasteurization intolerance ” and nearly anyone can drink raw milk just fine .
Yet the dairy industry has invented a blame game that tells Asians and blacks and American Indians that they are not white enough to drink milk .
That they have a deficiency .
This is a false science and a huge dairy lie .
It was their dead food product made toxic by their own shelf life extending technologies that was the problem .
It was not the consumer ’s fault , regardless of race .
The pasteurized milk industry has created a racist blame game and this is the very tip of the iceberg …. many more lies lay deep in the political and economic game of selling dead food from industrial farms that do not know any of their customers , personally .
Farmers benefit when they listen to their customers
Last month I was visited by a raw milk dairyman that for 30 years had milked a thousand cows but three years ago had decided to follow his daughters advice and started making raw goat cheese with many fewer animals .
He told me that listening to his daughter was the best thing he had ever done .
By making and selling raw goat milk cheese he connected himself to the markets , the people , their taste and the value .
He was no longer disconnected from the consumer , their money and choices as he once was for 30 years .
He was one very happy guy and sold his cheeses nationally under his own brand .
He was in California , visiting Cal Poly SLO .
The very university that had preached the mega dairy dogma , “ Get Big or Get Out ” to so many California dairyman ’s sons and daughters … was bankrupt and was now for sale .
Yes , the University dairy had failed when it followed its own land grant , BST hormone , Monsanto based advice .
The raw milk dairyman was going to visit the funeral and pick over the bones .
So goes the story of farm market systems in the USA .
Farmers fail when they disconnect themselves from their consumers and their consumers nutritional needs .
When pasteurizers and meaningless faceless brands get between the farmer and the consumer … there will be trouble and the trouble will rest on both the farmer and the consumers plates .
The farmer becomes irrelevant and the consumer becomes malnourished .
A bad food chain for all involved .
A new breed of farmer is beginning to emerge
What does this mean to the new farmer ?
This means that he must have marketing skills .
That means people skills and the ability to write , speak with , and connect with people and listen to their needs and respond to those needs .
This is radical speak .
Are n’t farmers supposed to be conservative red necks stuck down on the farm tractor ?… no way ….
this is the route to certain disaster .
Complaining at the coffee shop about the weather and the market is a pathway to losing the farm .
Pushing the flesh at the farmers market with your ears wide open and a smile on your face is the path to an agronomically sustainable business plan .
Practically anyone can learn to grow food but selling and education of others is a rare yet essential farmer ’s skill .
That ’s the culture in agriculture and it is missing in America .
When ever a farmer connects with people and goes about meeting their needs he starts a raw revolution and all kinds of hell breaks loose .
Look at the Amish that serve their communities with raw milk and other unprocessed whole foods .
They have listened to the consumer and know that there is no lactose intolerance with raw milk and people want it raw .
A case in point , Michael Schmidt of Canada
Look at Mike Schmidt in Canada .
He has been repeatedly beaten down by the politics of the Canadian milk system that bans raw milk not because of safety but because of market control .
Look at us here at Organic Pastures Dairy in Fresno CA , we have grown every year since 2000 and 50,000 California consumers love us …why ?
Because we have listened to what they say and we have responded by producing food that they can eat , food that nourishes the inner ecosystem and rebuilds the immune systems destroyed by antibiotics and sterile food .
We , just like Mike and the Amish know that people are literally sick of pasteurized milk … because it makes them sick and triggers allergies and asthma .
We listened and we are now connected to our consumers and bypassing the commercial dead food chain .
There is so much that surrounds this topic and it is getting hotter and hotter .
When ever money starts to change hands and the paradigm in power starts to lose control they scream bloody murder in their attempt to retain control .
They will use any means possible to keep their money and their power as it falls away like sand through their fingers .
The organic movement was corrupted when industry got a hold of biodiversity and killed it at the factory when it needed to fix shelf life issues .
Organic products are now some of the longest shelf life products on earth … they are ultra dead and they are not local at all .
Consumers , connect with your local farmers
As we pay respect and show our admiration for our farm leaders that include Mike Schmidt , Joel Salatin and others … remember that they produce living foods for living people that love them and connect to them .
These farmers do not work from behind a pasteurizer and or from behind a brand that takes the profits and the truth of their existence from them .
They stand proud and shake your hand and share the bounty directly with you and your gut says thank you with health and immune system integrity that can only come from the earth through the hands of a farmer that has a name and a family .
Go see the movie , FOOD Inc… it is mandatory viewing for everyone on spaceship earth .
You must all know the truth about what is happening on board this very small earthly space ship .
Someone is poisoning our limited supply of food and people are getting sick and business is profiting on both ends … the dead food and the illness it produces .
The voice of a small minority know exactly what is going on and now it is an act of political disobedience to speak of it .
It is radical speak condemned by the FDA and others in power .
Why are we relying on science from the 1890’s ?
Now our finest scientists at NIH ( the National Institutes of Health , which is performing the $ 143 million dollar , five year , human bio - genome project ) tell us that gut bacteria are essential to health and that using certain antibiotics destroy our gut immunity permanently ( Dr. Young ) .
So much for the killing technologies of 1893 being the saving grace of mankind .
Now we find out that the tremendous biodiversity of good bacteria found in raw milk are critically essential to our immune systems and our health .
Give your farmer a hug and heal yourself with real food .
Vote with your dollars and starve the paradigm in power .
Power to the people from the raw roots up .
Mark McAfee founded Organic Pastures Dairy Company in 2000 , the first organic dairy in Fresno County , California .
McAfee pioneered the concept of decentralized milking ( his Mobile Grade A Milk Barn goes out to the cows when it is milking time ) .
His cows graze on a pasture based integrated organic farm with closed nitrogen loop , no lagoons and no concrete , just “ clean and green pastures ” .
The operations now employ 40 people and provide retail ready raw organic dairy products to more than 400 California natural food stores including Wholefoods .
Sales are growing at 20 % or more per year and now exceed $ 5 million since being founded .
OPDC is the largest retail approved raw organic dairy products producer in North America .
Mark McAfee is regarded by many in the industry as a foremost expert in raw milk safety and raw dairy product markets and technology .
Mark is known for bold leadership and was the first milk producer to ever post sensitive bacteria count numbers on a website for the world to see .
Mark has made formal presentations on raw dairy issues to legislative bodies , national and international conventions in Canada and Melbourne Australia and or Universities ( including Stanford medical school and Rutgers ) , and fifteen of the United States .
Media credits include : ABC ’s 20 - 20 and CBS evening news with Katie Courick .
Mark and his wife Blaine have been married for 25 years and have two children , Aaron 24 and Kaleigh 21 , both are fully involved in the creamery and marketing operations .
Mark also helped found the RAWUSA.ORG raw milk production standards .
RAW USA.ORG was developed and founded to assist raw milk producers with producing safe raw milk and also allow the consumer to identify these living and safe foods .
In more than 100 million servings not one pathogen has ever been found in OPDC raw milk .

[ Edit : it appears that the Court struck out a preliminary motion to close down the site and rejected the original claim .
The Plaintiffs seem to have indicated that they will re-file the claim . ]
The good news is that yesterday , the Supreme Court struck out the ( $ 42 M ) defamation suit against the operator of ZGeek .
While we 're very thankful that this defamation action went no further , the fact that it got as far as it did shows a serious problem with a lack of certainty in Australian law .
The non -profit website operator had to expend significant funds donated by the site 's members in order to defend the action , and is now saying that the organisation will no longer be able to operate in Australia , given the stress and risk of further legal action :
But now , some even worse news .
ZGeek is abandoning Australia .
ZGeek as a company has been shut down and any future of the site conducting business in Australia is just not going to happen until the laws change as they offer no protection for internet content hosts based in Australia .
Basically , if you allow comment on your website and you live here , you are open for the same troubles as I am having .
Even if your site is hosted OS .
Got your own blog ?
Be very worried .
Even after we complied with their lawyers demands they are still coming after me and the Broadcasting Act allows them .
Unfortunately , this lack of certainty is a recurring theme in Australian internet laws .
Our copyright laws are unclear enough that companies like iiNet are exposed to risky litigation because the movie industry alleges that some of its customers infringed copyright and that iiNet has an obligation to disconnect subscribers based upon unsubstantiated allegations of infringement .
The safe harbours are complicated and their scope is unclear .
Our defamation laws provide only partial and uncertain protection for website operators , as this case demonstrates .
Our censorship laws hold Australian hosts who even link to potentially prohibited material liable for fines of up to $ 11,000 a day .
This level of uncertainty and risk is driving business off - shore and harming our competitive advantage , not to mention the ability of Australians to express themselves online .
The most basic principle of any democracy is that of majority rule , with minority rights running a clear but close second .
Simple though this precept may be , California seems to have gotten it backward .
The budget deal that emerged from Sacramento on Monday was the result of minority rule -- the consequence of a state Constitution that vests more power in the minority party than the constitution of just about any other state .
Under normal circumstances , this constitutional anomaly does n’t result in minority rule .
But during the budget impasse of the last several months , it did .
The provisions in California ’s Constitution that require a two - thirds vote to pass the state ’s budget and all tax increases were always something of a booby trap , and in the current crop of legislative Republicans -- a minority party with just over one - third representation in both houses -- it found its boobies .
During the steep recessions of the early ‘ 70s and the early ‘ 90s , Republican Govs .
Ronald Reagan and Pete Wilson worked with their legislative colleagues in both parties to make up the major budget shortfalls through a combination of higher taxes and spending cuts .
This generation of Republicans , however , decided to close a $ 26 - billion shortfall entirely through gimmicks and cutbacks , and the state ’s Constitution gave them the power to game the situation to their advantage .
Essentially , the Sacramento Republicans played the same game that Newt Gingrich ’s congressional Republicans played when they forced the closure of the federal government in the winter of 1995 - 96 in order to force Medicare cuts on a reluctant President Clinton .
But the Gingrichites did not prevail : Clinton called their bluff and let the government stay closed , and at the prodding of such relative moderates in their ranks as Bob Dole , they backed down .

Like the Gingrichites , the Sacramento Republicans began to close down the government -- in their case , by refusing to pass a budget unless it addressed the shortfall entirely through cuts .
But Sacramento 2009 has some signal differences from Washington 1996 .
For one thing , the Democrats have no well - known leader to argue their case -- both to legislators and to the public .
For another , there are no more moderates in the Republicans ’ shrunken ranks .
And crucially , the state Constitution gives the GOP the power to hold to its extremist views and nonetheless prevail .
Faced with a choice between badly diminished public services and , should the state continue to be budgetless , no public services at all , the Democratic leadership acceded to the Republicans ’ demands .
The consequences of those demands are stark .
Hundreds of thousands of children will lose their healthcare and tens of thousands of aged and disabled California will lose their in - home support services .
Public K - 12 schools will continue to lay off teachers and cut class offerings , and both the University of California and the state university system will have their state funding cut by roughly 20 % .
At a time when state business leaders are crying out for a better - educated workforce , the Republicans in the Legislature have pushed through policies that will make the state both sicker and dumber .
The cutbacks also will deepen the state ’s already deep recession .
Public employees will have less money to spend .
City and country redevelopment agencies , their funds impounded by Sacramento , will suspend their construction projects -- and there are precious few construction projects in the state today besides those that redevelopment agencies are funding .
Indeed , the cutbacks may trigger a vicious cycle :
By worsening the recession , they further reduce state revenues , which will lead to even more cutbacks as long as the Republicans continue to cling to one - third of the Legislature and to their distinctive brand of concern for the welfare of the state .
( They are concerned about California like the Visigoths were concerned about Rome . )

The Republicans ’ California is n’t a state that most Californians want to live in .
Given a choice between creating an extraction tax on oil companies ( a tax that every other state with oil already has , but which the Sacramento Republicans rejected ) and decimating the state ’s universities , I think Californians would opt to tax Exxon rather than reduce the number of science students .
But how do we stop the downward spiral before Republicans reduce the state to the status of an Oklahoma or Alabama or the other GOP garden spots ?
First , Democrats in the Legislature should consider calling the GOP ’s bluff and voting against the budget deal -- but they ca n’t make their case absent a public spokesman .
It ’s time for Jerry Brown and Gavin Newsom to rise to the challenge that Clinton did when he stood down Gingrich .
And second , Californians need to amend their state Constitution , in convention if need be , to end the practice of minority rule .
Democracy -- not to mention the future of the state -- depends on it .

WASHINGTON  Federal drug regulators warned Wednesday that patients taking two popular drugs to stop smoking should be watched closely for signs of serious mental illness , as reports mount of suicides among the drugs ’ users .
But officials emphasized that fear should not stop patients from taking the smoking - cessation medicines , Chantix , made by Pfizer , and Zyban , made by GlaxoSmithKline , which also sells it under the brand name Wellbutrin , for depression .
“ Stopping smoking is a goal we should all be working towards , ” said Dr. Curtis J. Rosebraugh , director of a drug evaluation office at the Food and Drug Administration .
“ We do n’t want to scare people off from trying a medication that could help them achieve this goal .
You should just be careful . ”
Pfizer will add a so - called black box warning  the F.D.A. ’s most serious caution  to the packaging information for Chantix .
Remember the disgusting video of some mysterious creature in the North Carolina sewers I posted yesterday ?

The crew at DeepSeaNews.com sent the video over to Dr. Timothy S. Wood , an expert on freshwater bryozoa and an officer with the International Bryozoology Association ( what fun parties they must have , eh ? ) , and he had this to say about it :
Thanks for the video – I had not see it before .
No , these are not bryozoans !
They are clumps of annelid worms , almost certainly tubificids ( Naididae , probably genus Tubifex ) .
Normally these occur in soil and sediment , especially at the bottom and edges of polluted streams .
In the photo they have apparently entered a pipeline somehow , and in the absence of soil they are coiling around each other .
The contractions you see are the result of a single worm contracting and then stimulating all the others to do the same almost simultaneously , so it looks like a single big muscle contracting .
Interesting video .

Not quite as horrifying , but still pretty gross .

The internet has made life better in an inconceivable number of ways , but at the same time there are still some things that spark nostalgia for pre-internet days .
Recently I got to thinking about the mail order catalog .
While it still exists , the catalog has definitely faded into the background of commercial activity a little bit .
It might be because I ’m a magazine junkie , and catalogs are essentially magazines that only contain ads , but I used to love subscribing to various catalogs .
I was never into the general item catalogs quite as much ; most of the fun came from learning more about a particular hobby or niche , or discovering entirely new products that you never even imagined existed .
And best of all of course , catalogs have , for the most part , always been cheap , at most costing a nominal shipping charge .
Most people have moved from buying from catalogs to online ordering , but the internet still has n’t managed to kill off all catalogs just yet .
Here are 16 that are still worth taking a look at :
McMaster - Carr
The McMaster - Carr catalog is basically everything you would need to build and run an industrial or commercial company in one giant catalog that contains nearly a half million products .
If you ’ve got an engineering fetish or are just curious to know more about how the industrialized world is built the McMaster - Carr catalog is for you .

To order a catalog you first need to make a purchase ( they only mail them to customers , and even then it can take awhile ) , but their website replicates their catalog .
Edmund Scientific

B&H
B&H Photo Video is the largest non-chain photo and video store in the United States .
They operate physical locations in New York city but also have a thriving website , despite the fact that it is shut down during Jewish holidays and once a week for Shabbat ( the company was founded and is run by Hasidic Jews ) .
The company puts out massive seasonal catalogs as well as niche catalogs on subjects like pro audio and pro video .

The Dutch Party for Freedom led by Geert Wilders tops opinion polls .
Wilders set off Muslim protests by making a movie linking Islam with terror .
The Dutch Party for Freedom ( PVV ) led by Geert Wilders is leading both of the nation 's major opinion polls .
While the party currently holds only nine seats of the 150 seats in the Dutch Lower House Parliament , both the Synovate Political Barometer and pollster Maurice de Hond say the party stands to be the largest in Parliament following the next national elections .
A Synovate poll released Wednesday shows PVV in a tight race with the Christian Democratic Alliance ( CDA ) , which currently holds 41 seats .
If elections were held this week , both parties would win 32 seats , Synovate pollsters found .
Maurice de Hond 's polls show PVV winning roughly 32 seats as well .
A third poll , the TNS NIPO , shows PVV winning 28 seats to 24 for the CDA .
If PVV were to win the plurality of Parliament seats , Wilders would be called to assemble the Netherlands ' next ruling coalition .
Wilders is known worldwide for his views on Islam .
He created the short movie Fitna , which links Koranic verses to modern terrorism , and has called the Koran “ fascist ” and Islam a “ totalitarian ideology . ”
He suggests that the right to religious freedom should not apply to Islam , and he has called for his country to ban the building of new mosques .
He is currently planning a sequel to Fitna that will document the effects of mass Muslim immigration to non-Muslim countries .
Backlash over Fitna and over Wilders ' controversial statements on Islam appears to have boosted his popularity .
PVV 's popularity rose in polls after an Amsterdam court decided to press charges against Wilders over his statements regarding Islam , and rose again after Wilders was denied entrance to Britain , where he planned to show his movie .
PVV won a significant victory last month , when it received four out of the Netherlands ' 25 seats in the European Union Parliament .
PVV got 17 percent of the vote , putting it just three percent behind the leading CDA .
Anti-Islam and anti-immigration parties won elsewhere in the EU as well : the whites - only British National Party won two seats for the first time , Austria 's Freedom Party gained seats , and the anti-immigration Jobbik party won three of 22 seats in Hungary .
Some research contends that many of the existing theories on crime and delinquency can be adapted to explain female behavior ( Figueria - McDonaough and Barton 1985 ) ( Sommers and Baskin 1993 ) Other research has indeed been adapted , sometimes in the most outrageous , if not senseless methods .
For example , some data is weighted .
In other words , each female 's response counts for 2.3 persons because fewer females have been interviewed in that or in past studies !
Thus , data are extrapolated based on the numbers of males surveyed and conclusions and recommendations are at least tentatively drawn based upon those deduced figures .
Unfortunately , Latina female gang members have been overlooked not only by researchers , but also by the designers and directors of programs developed to deal with problems of gangs ( Moore 1994:1124 ) .
This is a profoundly distressing oversight since it is the female gang members who more often than not end up with children to rear .
Statistically their babies will also be gang members one day -- an intergenerational duplication that might be curtailed by a suitable and timely program for young mothers .
Actually , the first truly large and intensive formal academic study on gang members involved 1,313 separate gangs -- Thrasher 's survey in l936 .
However , he summarily dismissed the girl gang members stating only that there were a half dozen female gangs out of the l,313 in his survey , and that participation in the gang culture for the young women was auxiliary in nature .
In other words , their involvement was purely for social and sexual activities , which at that time may very well have been the case .
Other research indicates that for a long time girls had little success gaining status in the gang world ( Bowker and Klein l983 ) .
This may still be partially true today , and may even be the reason for separate girl gangs .
Nevertheless , female gang - affiliation has grown and is in itself an established entity to be dealt with .
In the current study , the males did not want the females vigorously participating with them in gang - related activities .
As a matter of fact , many of the women nagged their boyfriends not to get involved in one incident or another , and many seemed always to be nagging their boyfriends about their gang - style way of life .
Some women reportedly nagged their boyfriends until they got out of the gang !
David : Sometimes a girl is in a car when something goes down , but it was n't supposed to be like that .
Somebody just happens to be there sometimes .
Usually - - well , I personally do n't want them around .
Alvaro : Speaking for myself , when I have to -- like -- it 's business you know ?
It 's not party time .
HOME LIFE
The female gang - affiliated members came from the same dysfunctional environment and noxious types of homes as the male members interviewed in this research .
They expressed a preference for gang affiliated males , and a good many voiced distaste for men who wore suits and ties .
Others said they were n't sure why they were attracted to the gang guys .
Many had not been treated right , yet they went back to the gang male , or became involved with another one .
On the positive , though satirical side , one female said , " They do n't let no one mess with them , " and this toughness was , at least for her , a desirable trait .
Many females had poor relationships with their parents .
Angela : " I hate my mother , and I hate my step - father even more .
Hijola ! "
Comments of this sort were commonplace .
Rebecca : " You can depend on the homies .
They 're like family to me .
They 're there for me .
Anything I need -- a place to stay . "
In several cases , disgusted parents had actually thrown the girls out of their houses -- literally casting them out to the street .
In the Latino neighborhoods surveyed , the parents word was consistently tested by gang - affiliated youths .
Fights and screaming bouts were common ; finally , one day the parent ( s ) literally seem to give up and kick the wayward youngster out .
Banishment from one 's parents ' home appears to have greater shame and stigma attached to it in the Hispanic community than it might in the mainstream culture , where youths leave the nest early usually to get an apartment and be on their own .
Here , the children remain with the family longer .
The Latino ( father especially ) tends to stick to his / her word and enforces banishment once it has been pronounced .
Unfortunately , with no place to go , the evicted individual goes to a friend 's house , or to a converted garage , to a friend 's apartment , or a sympathetic friend 's parents ' home .
Often they take in the dejected youth , who is also a close friend of their own daughter or son .
Other banished youths simply experience life on the streets for a few days and return home to make an uneasy peace .
Sometimes they challenge the parent (s ) and intimidate them , so they can come and go as they please .
Others simply promise to repent -- a penance which lasts until the next gang activity .
Other gang girls live on the streets most of the time , but have a place to go to when they so choose .
Some live with a male boyfriend .
In some of the latter situations , the girls appeared to act as virtual servants and valets to the male .
One said she liked a guy that tells her what to do and when to do it .
Others felt protected under this type of tyranny .
" He 's the boss , " said another live - in .
Still others hate males who are bossy and made derisive comments
about such women .
Elena :
She 's so " tapada , " he even tells her what to wear !
THIRTY - SOMETHING MOMS , FAMILY VALUES AND MEXICAN CULTURE
A good many gang women become hard - core drug abusers , i.e. heroine users who are referred to as " tecatas . "
When most reach the age of 30 , they have a child or two in tow and a good many fade out of gang life as a result .
Those that did not , often had expensive drug addictions to support .
They focused almost exclusively on drug getting , dealing , and such other related activities much to the misfortune and endangerment of the children both physically as well as psychologically .
Many younger gang girls said with contempt that their mothers were drug addicts .
Two different girls blatantly said , " My mother was a whore ! "
Clearly , these are the dysfunctional parents raising the future gang members of society who may , in turn , provide the future noxious homes , and on and on !
What Moore has called the " cholo , or street - oriented family " is one in which family members are engaged in illicit activity .
( Moore , 1994 : 1117 )
This " cholo " style family , as it were , generally fails to exercise very much control over its children .
Instead , " cholo " parents teach them to hustle and to operate like con-artists whenever the opportunity to swindle someone out of money or goods presents itself .
Children are often instructed to lie to social workers , law enforcement representatives , teachers and other authorities to cover for their wayward parents who know next to nothing about parenting .
These parents even dress their toddlers in gang attire , and doom their babies before they have so much as learned their first words !
In the traditional Mexican culture , it is undesirable but certainly more acceptable for boys to be out roaming the streets ; it is never appropriate behavior for females .
Therefore , Latinas who either join a gang or in any way affiliate themselves with the cholo lifestyle , are subsequently stigmatized by the more traditional Mexican community ( Moore l994:1117 ) .
The current study concurs .
In the present field investigation , parents and members of extended family who were interviewed had nothing but negative remarks concerning the " Cholas " -- the gang girls .
On the other hand , the young women had completely rejected the hardworking ethic , the good wife and mother role model so common among Hispanic women , for the Cholo lifestyle .
They , in turn , had nothing positive to say about the more traditional women either .
The term " Cholo , " which also refers to a fashion selection and make - up style , is used by the community members to refer to a type of Latina who more than likely is directly or indirectly affiliated with a gang or gang members .
There has been historically and frequently a good deal of bad blood between barrio residents and law enforcement .
Then if there is also friction at home , the gang subculture is skillful at socializing many youths to their value system .
For many of these teens -- not just the females -- their Mexican self - concept has already been altered .
They recognize that they do not belong to the mainstream Anglo culture , but they know they do not belong to the Mexican culture either .
Those who have ever travelled to Mexico to visit grandparents and other relatives have soon learned that they are considered outsiders in their ancestral land as well .
Their speech is ridiculed and they are called " pochos . "
Thus , Mexican values about home and family do not carry very much weight for some youngsters .
Different individuals experience varying degrees of cultural conflict .
Those who experience severe marginalization are easy targets for the gang paradigm , especially if parental influence is lacking or not respected by the youngster .
Young women living on the margins of both cultures are easy prey .
Frequently such young women are confronted with a double standard at home .
In many Mexican culture homes , it is normal for boys to be treated more leniently than girls , enjoying more privileges , being allowed to stay out later , and even dominating their sisters who must often iron their shirts to perfection and wait on them at the dinner table .
In the traditional Mexican family , the joys of motherhood and family security are highly prized .
Typically , Mom always seems happy and both she and Dad are primarily concerned with providing for the children .
The family is sacred .
In the traditional Mexican family , Mom also stays at home and cooks and sews -- even today with the economy virtually forbidding this practice any longer .
In some Mexican homes , Mom has to work ; nevertheless , she returns to the nest and puts in another shift cooking , washing , ironing , and nurturing .
Many young women are fed up with this double standard and expressed their exasperation vociferously .
Given a few other displeasures and grumblings about home , and with the pressures provided by poverty stricken environments , they become likely targets for gang recruitment .
In addition , in many of the homes , Dads were not always present and if they were , they were not necessarily able to provide very much of anything for their children .
Some Mom 's were not at all happy with cooking and sewing .
Others were themselves in gangs at one time .
Many of these youngsters have witnessed or experienced beatings , and a number of forms of parental violence .
Connie : " Mom always got between me and my Dad and she 'd catch the belt in her hand sometimes so it would n't hit me again .
Sometimes my Dad would get so mad he'd start swinging at both of us .
One time my older brother beat me up till I was black and blue "
In the traditional Mexican family , " spare the rod ; spoil the child , " is still very much in style .
The gang girls often reported other kinds of abuse as well .
Reina : " My Dad beat me so bad , I decided to forget it , man . "
Carmen : " She 's had black and blue marks all her life -- since I 've known her anyway . "
Interviewer : Did you ever get a beating like that too ?
Carmen : No -- my Dad left us when I was three and my Mom never hit us .
I got grounded a lot , but that 's all .
Reina : " I never go back there to see my folks .
I see my sister once in a while and I feel bad for her , but I never go back there .
I wo n't either .
No way . "
Perhaps we need healthy homes first to produce healthy children .
Instead , we have sick communities and noxious homes .
The double standard exists interestingly enough even among those parents who were either gang members or peripherally associated themselves .
Their restrictions for their girls are much greater than for the boys .
In other research , these restrictions sounded to other investigators like a litany of traditionalism , of parents trying to keep their daughters from being " bad " girls ( Moore 1995:94 ) .
Ironically even the young women who came from " cholo " families reported a number of traditional values imposed on them by parents who were themselves utterly out of sinc with Mexican culture .
A few gang girls had been run-aways at one time or another , but not in the sense commonly portrayed on the news wherein a girl from Nebraska runs away to the streets of Hollywood .
When these girls run-away , they generally go to a friend 's , relative 's , or boyfriend 's -- sometimes in another city , but nonetheless to a given destination with a place of refuge at the other end .
For many of the gang girls , having their own child leads them to rethink their objectives at least momentarily .
Many bow out of the gang at this juncture in their lives .
Collecting data on this aspect of girl gang life certainly warrants further study , but was beyond the scope of the interviews in the current investigation .
COMPARISON " CHOLAS " AND " BIKER " WOMEN
A very brief comparison of biker women and Latino girl gang members indicates that male gang members have far more characteristics in common whether African - American , Latino , Asian or White , than female gang members .
It should also be noted that not all " cholas " are necessarily gang affiliated .
Being a " chola " can be merely a fashion and / or sexually permissive lifestyle statement without meaning that the young woman is also gang affiliated .
However , studies on biker women show some interesting differences between them and Latina gang members .
Biker women are a bit older as a group , ranging in age from mid-20's going well into their 30's .
They are often " cash cows " or working women , taking jobs in topless bars , nude bars , beer bars and such ; and less commonly in regular jobs as secretaries and factory workers .
( Hopper and Moore , 1990 ) ( Sikes l994 ) .
A " cash cow " is a female who works to provide for herself and her children , but implicit in the term is a female who also provides for a male who is not steadily employed .
On the other hand , " Cholas " -- who are also referred to as " homegirls " -- are younger , live at home , with a boyfriend , or on the street from friend 's house to friend 's house .
If they work , they are employed in mini-malls , fast - food joints , small shops , as baby - sitters , as food and cocktail waitresses , and at other similar , but less exotic " regular " jobs .
If the " homegirls " continue to be associated with gang members into their 30's , they are less and less affiliated with the gang especially if they have children .
However , it is common for a young mother on welfare with children to be supporting a boyfriend with her welfare warrants .
As an important aside , " homegirls " as a term is also used to refer to young women from a particular barrio whether or not they are engaged in any kind of shady lifestyle .
For example , even those young women who are currently matriculated in colleges would be considered " homegirls " by other young people in their former neighborhoods .
Whereas biker women are generally more widely traveled , homegirls have usually not gone much beyond their city or county .
Some reportedly made an excursion to Mexico as children with other family members to visit relatives .
There they discovered their marginalization -- that they were neither acceptable to the U. S. mainstream culture , nor to the Mexican mainstream .
There they often got in touch with their feeling of disdain for traditional Mexican culture as well .
After that excursion most never seemed to go very far from their barrio again .
As the homegirls get older , they sometimes leave their children with a grandmother , aunt , or more stable sister freeing themselves up to tag along with a male companion .
The literature suggests that a good many biker women transport their off spring where ever they go .
( Hopper and Moore 1990 ) .
Also , some of the literature suggests that Latina gang affiliated women continue into their 20's and 30's ( Galindo 1993 ) .
However , in the current research , except for those with expensive drug habits to support , by the time the women interviewed in this sample were in their 30's they invariably had two or three children , at which point the Latino family value system seemed to kick in , at least to some extent .
( Women over the age of 24 were eliminated from the sample because the age variable was set at 14 to 24 although many participated in post - questionnaire discussions ) .
Ironically , many of the gang girls with children did not want their youngsters to be in a gang when they grew up , although statistically they probably will be .
Others did n't seem to care one way or the other !
Several said , " They can do whatever they want , " or " It 's up to them . "
Many women 30 years old and older , simply gave up the " cholo " and gang lifestyle to mind their kids ( not always well ) .
A few had actually been able to find full - time jobs ; others were receiving AFDC ( Assistance to Families with Dependent Children ) or welfare allotments .
But surprisingly enough fewer than stereotypically thought go on welfare at least among those interviewed in this sample .
Three " homegirls " who had continued into their 30's were referred to as " tecatas " ( heroin users ) by others in the neighborhood .
The number of Latina young women who actually join violent street gangs is , of course , unknown .
But ultimately gang membership for these young women becomes a harsh and abusive experience leading only to lowered self - esteem , degradation , and despair .
Choosing names like " Playgirls " for their gang , some women briefly find glamour , attention , friends and protection within the gang .
In the long run , they end up shattered by the episode according to their own testimony .
Other data concurs ( Sikes l994 ) .
In other research , many of the girls were experiencing posttraumatic stress disorder as well ( Guevara dissertation 1992 ) .
For some ex-cholas , a realization eventually guided them back to their families so that they might provide a better life for their children than they could as gang - girls .
However , in most cases their families continue to live in dysfunctional environments , many times in noxious homes .
Ironically , in most cases of this sort the very home that ravaged mom's early childhood and youth experiences is bequeathed to her children to ruin their lives as well .
Other young women stay away from the home in which they grew up and go on welfare making them the objects of derision among the majority of Latino tax - payers .
These women also perpetuate negative stereotypes concerning Latinas , their children , and the welfare syndrome .
Many younger gang member " girlfriends " who claimed to me gang members themselves did indeed seem to be little more than the sexual chattel of male gang members .
They also served as incentives in recruiting , and as previously mentioned , some were referred to as " party animals " by the males .
MOM AND FAMILY VALUES
Most of the " homegirls " have children ( 94 % ) and many will raise them alone without a husband , on the income of some other member of their family , or with AFDC warrants ( Campbell 1990:182 ) .
If they feel trapped and powerless , it is for good reason .
They have quadrupled their handicap via racial discrimination , class discrimination , gender discrimination , and as single mothers as well !
Cholas who had a child by a male gang member appeared to have no expectations of marriage .
Some said they did n't want to get married .
Ana : " Who wants to be a housewife in the projects ?
I 'd rather be alone . "
Perhaps they really do not desire a marriage to some of these men , but more than likely it is the men who are unwilling to make a commitment .
Some of the women 's conversations sounded a bit like " sour grapes " and may have been merely excuses to save face in an environment where reputation and maintaining the image of toughness are revered among the female gang members with as much fanaticism as among the male members .
A good deal of the current research also suggests that girl gangs are on the increase and not just as auxiliaries of male gangs , but as highly violent entities in their own right .
VIOLENCE AMONG FEMALE HOMIES
Violent crimes among women include terrorism , rape , murder , theft , prostitution and gang participation .
Many of the women interviewed admittedly participated in muggings and other thefts especially as their economic needs escalated because of loss of job , being thrown out of parents ' houses , and separating from or breaking up with a male boyfriend .
That women have gotten more violent was probably first brought to the public 's attention in an article entitled " You 've Come a Long Way , Moll " which appeared in the Wall Street Journal , January 25 , 1990 stipulating that the number of violent crimes had risen 41.5 % for women while only 23.1 % for men .
According to the article , young women were no longer committing crimes as accomplices to males , but as full - fledged criminals on their own initiative .
The types of crimes most frequently mentioned in that article were stealing clothes , dealing drugs , and weapons - related violations .
More girls are carrying guns and knives nowadays than ever before .
FBI data indicate that arrests of girls for murder are up as are arrests for robbery and aggravated assault .
In a study on African American women gang members , females were found to be more violent and more oriented to male crime than ever before ( Fishman 1988:28 ) .
Later substantiation of these findings appeared in " Sisters Doin '
It for Themselves . "
( Lauderback , Hansen & Waldorf l992 ) .
Similar outcomes among Latinas have also been established , at least in New York if not yet in the Los Angeles area ( Campbell 1990 ) .
In the current investigation , more female gang members used heroin than non-gang affiliated females .
However , both gang and non-gang affiliated had used various types of drugs .
Unfortunately , the extent of that drug abuse was beyond the range of issues being examined in the current study , but the topic came up incidentally in conversations frequently enough to warrant mention .
Certainly , the " cholo " lifestyle promotes drug use .
In the last year or two , television has featured female gang members but only shows like Larry King Live , Oprah , and Geraldo Rivera .
In the current study , no hyper - violent , amoral girls like those seen on TV came to the fore .
However , many admitted participating in fights often concerning a male , or in support of another member 's personal altercation with someone .
Daring someone to act out appeared to be a frequent development .
Endorsements such as " you just try it " and " avientate " or " go for it , " were uttered when one threatened to smack a beer bottle in the face of another .
Although some social scientists claim that girls are more violent today than they have been in the past , there is little quantitative or qualitative evidence supporting the new violent female offender hypothesis according ( Chesney - Lind 1993:339-340 ) .
Certainly for Latinas or " cholas " the data is not readily available .
What emerges is a more complex picture wherein girls solve their problems of gender , race and class through gang membership .
This concurs with other research as well ( Williams 1992:88 ) .
Possibly their violent behavior has in other decades been largely ignored , whereas today it may even be somewhat exaggerated by sensationalist journalism such as the daytime talk shows .
In this investigation , Latina gang and non-gang affiliated seemed to function in large measure as auxiliary , or as accomplices to males going along with criminal activity committed by the males .
Girls ' crimes appeared to be still largely " traditionally female " prostitution , shoplifting , running away , fighting with other girls , and drug related crimes .
Actual scuffles among these young women involved knife assaults and / or scratching and kicking types of fights which reportedly occurred frequently sometimes against other women and often against males as well .
The female 's path to gang membership appears to be a bit different from that of males .
Many of these young women adhere to a curious admixture of traditional values as well as gang values .
Some shun traditional values and deliberately behave in what appears to be the most diametrically opposed manner to that prescribed by traditional Mexican values .
But ironically most espoused traditional Mexican family values in what they wanted for their future even if that was not what they had in their present .
In the current research , most gang girls came from less conventional Mexican families .
They seemed to be from more dysfunctional families , sometimes from " cholo " families .
Many of their parents were at one time themselves gang - members , or associates of one kind or another .
Other gang - affiliated females came from homes with parents who have given up , or who never cared very much in the first place .
Much of the current study concurs with older studies ( Moore 1990 ) ( Vigil 1991 ) .
The gang has been and still appears to be a welcome source of support for " cholas " ( Harris l994 ) .
Ironically , in view of the ill treatment , the infidelities and abuses the women receive at the hands of the males , it is surprising that so many women , gang as well as non-gang affiliated , found the gang members so appealing .
CHIPS OFF THE OLD BLOCK
Research suggests that children of former gang girls , of cholos and cholas , are inclined to be chips off the old block and soon develop their mother 's and father 's cholo lifestyles ( Moore 1123 ) .
On the one hand traditional Mexican values mandate that young women not associate with the cholos ; thus , girls from cholo families or whose ties to the traditional family have been ruptured really have no place else to go for support , but to the gang .
The cholo family and lifestyle , thus , is encapsulated -- they are the " bad element " within the poor Mexican - community .
Yet the cholo look in apparel , hairstyle , and mannerisms is pervasive and copied by many youths who are non-gang affiliated .
On occasion , one sees an adorable three year old dressed in baggies , or a 10 year old girl with a chola hair - do and make - up .
Of course , the gang look is really only a l990's extension of the pachuco look , which while out of date , is a pervasive cholo / gang / drug subculture that tends to be inherited if a brother or sister , father or mother was once a part of it .
While the current barrio vernacular " cholos / cholas " or " homeboys " " homegirls " or " homies " may have changed , many other detrimental circumstances and events have not ( Galindo 1993 ) .

Japan 's love hotels are doing brisk business , despite the economic downturn
By Roland Buerk
BBC News , Tokyo
Japan 's love hotels are attracting interest from more than just couples looking for a place to spend a few private hours .
Investors are also interested ; this vast market seems to be proving more resilient to the recession than luxury business hotels .
There are about 25,000 love hotels in Japan which are visited an estimated 500 million times a year .
Clustered around train stations , they are doing a brisk business despite the worst recession in living memory .
People can check into the love hotels via touch screens Flamboyantly designed and exotically named - Hotel For You , Sunpalace , Asian P - Door - they offer rooms by the hour , euphemistically marketed as a short rest or a longer stay .
Contact with staff is kept to a minimum .
This is a business that runs on discretion .
Some have underground car parks and entrances , while others provide screens to shield visitors ' number plates .
Plenty of customers are using love hotels to indulge in affairs or to meet prostitutes , although many are couples looking to escape the narrow confines of Japanese apartment living .
Crowded country
At many hotels the reception desk has been replaced by a touch screen of pictures of the rooms , brightly lit if available , dimmed out if already occupied .
Love hotels offer time alone in a crowded country where privacy is rare .
Yuichi Ito and Kyoko Shio are typical of Japanese in their twenties , still living with their parents .
Yuichi Ito and Kyoko Shio both still live with their parents " My family is my Dad and my Mom , and I have two younger brothers , " says Yuichi Ito .
" But we only have four rooms , so it is a very crowded house . "
He adds that he and his girlfriend , who met while they were studying in the United States , visit love hotels to find somewhere to be alone .
Providing privacy is big business in Japan .
The love hotel industry is huge , estimated to turn over about £ 25 bn ( $ 40 bn ) a year .
And hotel owners claim they have been barely touched by the recession .
" Of course some hotels did [ suffer ] , but not love hotels , " says Joichiro Mochizuki , an executive with a company which runs a number of love hotels , including the Asian P - Door in Tokyo .
" Not like city hotels , not like business hotels - for this love hotel we had a 3 - 4 % drop but otherwise we have kept a 400 % occupancy rate . "
That means each room is , on average , used four times a day .
The sheer variety on offer for couples is huge .
There are mock castles , perched by motorway intersections .
One love hotel is decorated on a theme that combines soft toys and bondage .
In others , visitors can dress up as doctors and nurses .
The hotels cater for all , even fans of the film Titanic Some rooms look like school classrooms or train carriages .
There 's even a love hotel for fans of the film Titanic , shaped like a cruise liner with life - size statues of Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslett on the prow .
With 25,000 across Japan , there is one to suit every fantasy .
Seedy reputation British businessman Steve Mansfield sees great potential in the industry which has traditionally been shunned by big Japanese corporations put off by its seedy reputation .
The rooms in his hotels are rather straightforward .
He says he aims to create the ideal living area which people would have at home if money was no object .
There is a bed , of course , a flat screen television and a projector , a karaoke machine and an outdoor bathroom in the more expensive suites .
There are also payment machines by every door in case guests want to leave unseen .
Steve Mansfield is looking to invest in more love hotels Mr Mansfield 's company , Japan Leisure Hotels , listed on London 's AIM market , already runs six hotels , and he would like many more .
" When we looked at it and saw the fragmentation - 90 % of owners have five or fewer hotels - we thought this is interesting , " he says .
" Here is a massive industry that has no market leader and there is a great opportunity here for consolidation . "
Steve Mansfield does not like the phrase love hotels .
He prefers " leisure hotels " , pointing out that what goes on in his premises happens in every other hotel in the world .
Whatever they are called , Japan 's short stay hotels remain busy with customers .
The Japanese may have cut back on many things in the downturn - but not on a few hours to spend alone with a loved one .

I 'd actually love a subscription to Books Magazine .
Telling me the latest in new books , what 's good , what 's not , little reviews and such .
Keeping me abreast of the books situation , so I do n't find myself in Barnes and Noble going " What do I want , anyway ? "

“ The new Game Boy Pocket .
Seriously distracting . ”
Nintendo ’s advertising agency Leo Burnett ran this mature - targeted Game Boy Pocket ad in Loaded , FHM , and Viz , reasoning that it fit those UK magazines ’ audiences .
Several readers complained , however , and said the girl looked terrified and held against her will – Nintendo wanted to convey her frustration over her partner ignoring their bedroom bondage activities to play Tetris .
The Advertising Standards Authority asked Nintendo to remove the ads from future issues , and described the company as irresponsible for implying the restrained woman was “ subjugated and humiliated ” .
Is n’t that what sadomasochism is about ?

Did you know that a family court can order a man to reimburse the government for the welfare money , falsely labeled " child support , " that was paid to the mother of a child to whom he is not related ?
Did you know that , if he does n't pay , a judge can sentence him to debtor 's prison without ever letting him have a jury trial ?
Did you know that debtor 's prisons ( putting men in prison because they can't pay a debt ) were abolished in the United States before we abolished slavery , but that they exist today to punish men who are too poor to pay what is falsely called " child support " ?
Did you know that when corporations can't pay their debts , they can take bankruptcy , which means they pay off their debts for pennies on the dollar , but a man can never get an alleged " child support " debt forgiven or reduced , even if he is out of a job , penniless and homeless , medically incapacitated , incarcerated ( justly or unjustly ) or serving in our Armed Forces overseas , can't afford a lawyer , or never owed the money in the first place ?
Did you know that when a woman applying for welfare handouts lies about who the father of her child is , she is never prosecuted for perjury ?
Did you know that judges can refuse to accept DNA evidence showing that the man she accuses is not the father ?
What has been the impact of feminism on the nation ?
Do n't miss " The War on Fathers : How the ' feminization of America ' destroys boys , men – and women "
TRENDING : Alleged attacker behind carnage at pro-Trump event linked to ' Caravan 4 Justice ' group
Did you know that alleged " child support " has nothing to do with supporting a child because the mother has no obligation to spend even one dollar of it on a child , and in many cases none of the " support " money ever gets to a child because it goes to fatten the payroll of the child - support bureaucracy ?
These are among the injustices the feminists , and their docile liberal male allies , have inflicted on men .
The sponsor was former Democratic senator from New Jersey and presidential candidate Bill Bradley .
His name is affixed to the Bradley Amendment , a 1986 federal law that prohibits retroactive reduction of alleged " child support " even in any of the circumstances listed above .
The Bradley law denies bankruptcy protections , overrides all statutes of limitation and forbids judicial consideration of obvious inability to pay .
Most Bradley - law victims never come to national attention because , as " Bias " author Bernard Goldberg said , mainstream media toe the feminist propaganda line , among which is the epithet " deadbeat dads . "
But one egregious case did make the news this summer .
Frank Hatley was in a Georgia jail for more than a year for failure to pay alleged " child support " even though a DNA test nine years ago plus a second one this year proved that he is not the father .
The Aug. 21 , 2001 , court order , signed by Judge Dane Perkins , acknowledged that Hatley is not the father but nevertheless ordered him to continue paying and never told him he could have a court - appointed lawyer if he could not afford one .
Hatley subsequently paid the government ( not the mom or child ) thousands of dollars in " child support , " and after he was laid off from his job unloading charcoal grills from shipping containers and reduced to living in his car , he continued making payments out of his unemployment benefits .
But he did n't pay enough to satisfy the avaricious child - support bureaucrats , so Perkins ruled Hatley in contempt and sent him to jail without any jury trial .
With the help of a Legal Services lawyer , he has now been relieved from future assessments and released from jail , but ( because of the Bradley Amendment ) the government is demanding that Hatley continue paying at the rate of $ 250 a month until he pays off the $ 16,398 debt the government claims he accumulated earlier ( even though the court then knew he was not the father ) .
This system is morally and constitutionally wrong , yet all the authorities say the court orders were lawful .
Another type of feminist indignity is the use in divorce cases of false allegations of child sexual abuse in order to gain child custody and the financial windfall that goes with it .
Former Vancouver , Wash. , police officer Ray Spencer has spent nearly 20 years in prison after being convicted of molesting his two children who are now adults and say it never happened .
The son , who was 9 years old at the time , was questioned , alone for months until he said he had been abused in order to get the detective to leave him alone .
The daughter , who was then age 5 , said she talked to the detective after he gave her ice cream .
There were many other violations of due process in Spencer 's trial , such as prosecutors withholding medical exams that showed no evidence of abuse and his court - appointed lawyer failing to prepare a defense , but the judge nevertheless sentenced Spencer to two life terms in prison plus 14 years .
Spencer was five times denied parole because he refused to admit guilt , a customary parole practice that is maliciously designed to save face for prosecutors who prosecute innocent men .
For the past several decades , the crisis in Palestine has deepened and the suffering of the people of Palestine has increased without interruption under an ever - escalating series of Israeli military attacks and the never - ending expansion of illegal Israeli settlements .
Frustrated by the strictly cosmetic “ peace process ” , international solidarity activists have sought concrete ways to contribute to a resolution of this crisis .
Modelling their efforts on the international campaign which played an important part in ending the apartheid regime in South Africa , these activists have embraced the Palestinian call for a campaign of boycott , divestment , and sanctions in support of Palestinian rights .
This call originated in July 2005 , when it was issued by more than 150 Palestinian unions , associations , civil - society groups , and refugee - rights organizations .
The call explained the motivation for the campaign , noting that the International Court of Justice ’s 2004 advisory opinion had ruled that Israel ’s separation wall had been illegally built on occupied Palestinian territory ; that Israel continued to construct the wall in total disregard of the court ’s decision ; that for four decades Israel had continued to expand its illegal occupation of the Palestinian West Bank , including East Jerusalem , the Gaza Strip , and the Golan Heights , by building an ever - expanding series of Jewish - only settlements ; and that by means of building the separation wall , Israel had unilaterally annexed occupied East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights and large parts of the West Bank .
The call went on to explain that the State of Israel had been built mainly on land that had been ethnically cleansed of its Palestinian owners and that a majority of these people are living today as refugees .
Finally , the call pointed out that within Israel , the country ’s Palestinian citizens suffer systematic discrimination as a result of the country ’s system of laws and regulations , which favour its Jewish citizens .
It is in light of Israel ’s persistent violations of international law ; the fact that , since 1948 , hundreds of UN resolutions have condemned Israel ’s colonial and discriminatory policies ; that all forms of international intervention and peace - making have failed to convince Israel to comply with humanitarian law , to respect fundamental human rights , and to end its occupation and oppression of the Palestinian people ; and that people of conscience in the international community have a moral responsibility to fight injustice , that representatives of Palestinian civil society have asked international civil - society organizations and people of conscience all over the world to initiate boycotts and divestment campaigns focusing on Israel , similar to the campaigns that were mounted against South Africa in the apartheid era .
In addition , they have asked supporters to pressure their respective governments to impose embargoes and sanctions against Israel .
The plan is to pursue these nonviolent measures until Israel meets its obligation to recognize the Palestinian people ’s inalienable right to self - determination and complies with the precepts of international law .
In light of Israel ’s open disdain for international opinion , its disregard for international law , and its unceasing military aggression against its neighbours — most recently seen in its horrific attacks on the civilian populations and infrastructure of Lebanon in 2006 and Gaza in 2008 - 09 , as well as the ongoing siege of Gaza , which has created a humanitarian disaster there — it is increasingly clear that Israel will not change its ways without being compelled to do so by the weight of international pressure .
The growing realization that this is the case is the basis of the dramatic increase in international calls for boycott , divestment , and sanctions against Israel in recent months .
I am proud to say that our organization , Independent Jewish Voices ( Canada ) , recently joined this rising call for justice when it passed a boycott , divestment , and sanctions resolution at our annual general meeting in Ottawa .

Every once in the while , an athlete dies before he is done building on the positive legacy they have worked a lifetime to achieve .
Roberto Clemente was taken away from his family , the game of baseball , and the millions he reached out to before his time should have been up .
Few athletes cared about kids , about the human race , or world affairs like Clemente did .
Major League Baseball should pray for someone with this kind of attitude and natural ability to come along .
Let it be said , let it be written …
There will only ever be one Roberto Clemente .
Roberto Clemente was born in Puerto Rico in 1934 .
He grew up playing baseball and was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1954 .
Clemente played 18 seasons , all with Pittsburgh .
He was a 12 - time All - Star selection and won The MVP in 1966 .
He also won 12 golden gloves and won the NL batting title four times .
He was named the 1971 World Series MVP .
I can go on - and - on about his onfield accomplishments but the other side of Roberto Clemente needs discussed .
Clemente was very active in his charity work for Puerto Rico and other Latin American countries .
He often financed trips out of the money he made to provide baseball equipment and food to areas in need .
On December 31 , 1972 , the plane Clemente was traveling to Nicaragua in to provide food to earthquake victims crashed and Clemente was pronounced dead .
His body was never recovered .
In 1973 , the Hall of Fame voted Clemente in posthumously , meaning the mandatory 5 - year waiting period was waived .
To this day , Clemente is the only baseball player who did not have to wait five years to get in .
He was also the first Latin American elected to the Hall of Fame .
In his honor , Major League Baseball annually presents the Roberto Clemente Award , given to the player who is a great humanitarian .
He was also inducted into the Marine Corps Hall of Fame .
The right field wall at PNC Park is 21 ′ high in tribute to Clemente .
Few athletes in our time would have cared less about their next commercial or endorsement .
Few would have been courageous enough to get into a small plane for 16 hour rides to pass out food and supplies they paid for .
Thanks for the memories Roberto Clemente , there will never be another like you .
He was later raked over the coals in Congressional hearings about his huge compensation .
That most of it was in stock and options that he never cashed in seemed to be something most legislators could not comprehend .
As Congress moves to do something about executive pay , it is worth asking what would have happened if Mr. Fuld had somehow realized in 2005 that the mortgage business was a time bomb and had gotten Lehman out of it .
Within a year , its profits would have sagged and its share price collapsed .
Mr. Fuld would have been labeled a dunce , and might have lost his job .
The same can be said of Jimmy Cayne of Bear Stearns and Stan O’Neal of Merrill Lynch , the two runners - up in the richest bank C.E.O. sweepstakes of 2006 .
President Obama has proposed legislation to deal with many aspects of the financial crisis , and it is no surprise that this bill is the one that seems to be having the easiest road to passage , even though every Republican voted against it in the House Financial Services Committee .
The banks probably realize it wo n’t make much difference and are doing their most intensive lobbying elsewhere .
I asked Professor Stulz what he thought of the bill .
“ It is hard to believe that regulators will be better at devising compensation plans with proper incentives , ” he said .
“ Properly designed capital requirements are a much more efficient approach to regulate the risk of financial institutions than fiddling with compensation . ”
Indeed , much of the financial “ innovation ” of recent years consisted of bankers coming up with ways to evade capital requirements .
The regulators are now trying to deal with that , but their efforts are handicapped by bankers warning that they will maker fewer loans if capital rules are tightened .
That said , the bill could help some .
The Sarbanes - Oxley law , passed in 2002 , does seem to have resulted in board audit committees taking their jobs much more seriously .
It would be good if the same happened at compensation committees .
Perhaps it will do some good to tie compensation to long - term results , or to force executives to hold stock rather than sell it quickly when options vest .
Still , as Alan Blinder , the Princeton economist and former vice chairman of the Fed , wrote recently in The Wall Street Journal : “ The executives , lawyers and accountants who design compensation systems are imaginative , skilled and definitely not disinterested .
Congress and government bureaucrats wo n’t beat them at this game . ”

Liquidating Nortel has more troubles to add to its plate .
Not only is the Canadian firm seeing a major push back to its liquidation plans by recently notorious private equity firm MatlinPatterson , which refuses to go gently into that good night and write off its $ 400 million investment in the failed telecom maker , but now it has to deal with its own employees who have threatened to blow up a French plant unless they get preferential layoff terms .
The Globe and Mail reports that " workers had placed gas cylinders in front of the plant in the Yvelines area near Paris , where 480 jobs are set to be axed following bankruptcy proceedings . "
From the article :
In the second threat by French workers to blow up a factory in a week , the paper said the workers had threatened to stage an explosion as early as Wednesday if their demands were not met , but said the gas cylinders were empty .
No immediate comment was available from Toronto - based Nortel , once the largest North American telecommunications equipment manufacturer but which filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada and the United States in January .
The workers were also bitter about the way the authorities handling the case in France were proceeding , the paper said .
“ We are exasperated by the practices of the administrator .
A meeting was planned yesterday , but it was cancelled at the last minute , ” the paper cited one union member as saying on Tuesday .
“ It is not the first time .
They have been stringing us along for four days .
They have no respect for us , ” the union member said .
Speaking on LCI television , Labour Minister Xavier Darcos pledged to find solutions for the workers .
“ We are going to speak to each other , we will find solutions that do not require resorting to extreme violence , ” he said .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
They 've been dubbed boomerang kids and a recent poll by collegegrad.com shows that 80 % of 2009 college graduates moved back in with their parents .
That 's up quite a bit from recent years .
So whether kids are home for just an extended summer or until they find a job , its important to set up some guidelines before they settle in .
Consider drawing up a written agreement between you and your child .
Outline a time frame as well as responsibilities , both financial and around the house .
Some parents charge rent while others wo n't even consider the idea .
Whichever you choose , make sure to make clear exactly what the child is responsible for when it comes to other expenses like groceries .
Keep credit cards and cell phones separate .
Johnny can pay for that himself .
These are financial responsibilities your child needs to learn to take on .
But do consider keeping your child on your health insurance plan .
If your health plan is employer - based it probably offers lower premiums than individual health insurance .
Twenty - five states give graduates the option to be covered under their parent 's policy , but state laws vary , so the age cutoff could be 24 , 25 or 26 .
New Jersey has the highest age limit at 30 .
Check out the Kaiser Family foundations
Web site at statehealthfactsonline.org to learn about your state 's rules .
The reality is , if your child is too old to qualify , you 'll need to find individual health insurance and decide who will pay for it .
Do n't forget about auto insurance either .
If your child plans on driving the family car , your payments will go up .
So figure out who is going to pay what .
The bottom line is , you do n't want to risk your own financial health .
You should n't feel like you 're on the hook for things you used to pay for when your child was younger .
Food and shelter for one extra person costs thousands of dollars each year .
So laying everything out on the table ahead of time and establishing a plan of action is key .

WASHINGTON  Plunging squarely into one of the most sensitive issues in the Middle East , Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. suggested on Sunday that the United States would not stand in the way of Israeli military action aimed at the Iranian nuclear program .
The United States , Mr. Biden said in an interview broadcast on ABC ’s “ This Week , ” “ cannot dictate to another sovereign nation what they can and cannot do . ”
" Israel can determine for itself  it ’s a sovereign nation  what ’s in their interest and what they decide to do relative to Iran and anyone else , " he said , in an interview taped in Baghdad at the end of a visit there .
The remarks went beyond at least the spirit of any public utterances by President Barack Obama , who has said that diplomatic efforts to halt Iran ’s nuclear program should be given to the end of the year .
But the president has also said that he is “ not reconciled ” to the possibility of Iran possessing a nuclear weapon  a goal Tehran denies .
Family First Senator Steve Fielding has written to senators on both sides of politics urging them to demand more proof from the Government that carbon emissions are the main driver of climate change .
Senator Fielding remains unconvinced that human activity is causing climate change and says there is evidence to show that over the past 15 years global temperatures have not risen in line with escalating carbon emissions .
His letter to senators appeals to them to consider the issue before casting their vote , which he says is too important to take along party lines .
He also believes there are Labor senators who do not agree that carbon emissions are responsible for climate change .
" There are a number of them I believe that also are n't convinced that carbon dioxide is the major cause of climate change , and that 's the reason why I 'm writing to both Labor senators and Liberal senators , " he told ABC News Online .
" I would say that there are , on both sides of Parliament , those people who do n't believe that carbon dioxide is the major driver of climate change .
" So what I 'm doing is asking each senator to consider an inconvenient fact ; the issue of air temperatures and why they have n't risen over the last 15 years . "
In June Senator Fielding met with climate change scientists and sceptics during a fact - finding trip to the USA .
On his return he met with Australia 's chief scientist Penny Sackett , but says she failed to convince him that human activity is pushing up global temperatures .
However , despite his doubts the senator says he still has not decided how he will vote on the legislation , which is due before the Senate in August .
But he maintains he is not a climate change sceptic , and attended a breakfast speech by climate change guru Al Gore this morning .
The Government wants its emissions trading legislation passed before the Copenhagen talks , but its future is uncertain .
Late last week Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said he was pessimistic that an international deal on global emissions would be struck at talks in Copenhagen in December .
Senator Fielding says that only strengthens the case for Australia to hold off on an emissions trading scheme until other major economies act .
The Coalition also wants to wait until after December .
The Greens , who hold the balance of power with Senator Fielding and Independent Senator Nick Xenophon , will vote the scheme down unless emissions reduction targets are dramatically lifted .
The Government has committed to emissions cuts of between 5 to 25 per cent of 2000 levels depending on the strength of agreement reached at the Copenhagen talks .
A New York City woman has been accused of burning her 6 - year - old daughter during a voodoo ritual , ignoring her cries for help and sending her to bed .
Prosecutors say Marie Lauradin poured a flammable liquid over her daughter during a Haitian practice known as " loa " and made her stand naked in a ring of fire , engulfing her in flames .
Queens District Attorney Richard Brown says Lauradin and the girl 's grandmother washed her and put her to bed despite life - threatening burns over 25 per cent of her body .
He says another relative found her the next day .
Lauradin was ordered held on $ US50,000 ( $ A62,546.91 ) bail at Thursday 's arraignment on assault and child endangerment charges related to the February 4 incident .

A New York District Judge has ordered the Federal Reserve to disclose the destination of around $ 2 trillion dollars in bailout funds after the Fed failed to convince the Judge that the records should be exempt from the Freedom of Information Act .
“ Manhattan Chief U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska rejected the central bank ’s argument that the records are n’t covered by the law because their disclosure would harm borrowers ’ competitive positions .
The collateral lists “ are central to understanding and assessing the government ’s response to the most cataclysmic financial crisis in America since the Great Depression , ” according to the lawsuit that led to yesterday ’s ruling , ” reports Bloomberg , the news outlet that originally filed the lawsuit .
Citing the fact that the US taxpayer is an “ involuntary investor ” in the nation ’s banks , Bloomberg argued that the risks behind the $ 2 trillion in lending needed to be made public .
[ efoods ]
“ When an unprecedented amount of taxpayer dollars were lent to financial institutions in unprecedented ways and the Federal Reserve refused to make public any of the details of its extraordinary lending , Bloomberg News asked the court why U.S. citizens do n’t have the right to know , ” said Matthew Winkler , the editor - in - chief of Bloomberg News .
“ We ’re gratified the court is defending the public ’s right to know what is being done in the public interest . ”
The Federal Reserve and Ben Bernanke in particular have attempted to hide the destination of the bailout funds at every step of the way since Bloomberg first filed the lawsuit over nine months ago .
During a hearing on Capitol Hill last month , Congressman Alan Grayson confronted Bernanke on which foreign banks had received around half a trillion dollars in credit swaps .
Bernanke responded , “ I do n’t know . ”
“ Half a trillion dollars and you do n’t know who got the money ? ” asked Grayson .
It ’s no surprise that the Fed is reticent to disclose who got the bailout funds , since the man appointed by Henry Paulson to dole out the ill - gotten gains was none other than his fellow ex-Goldman Sachs executive Neel Kashkari .
This level of cronyism undoubtedly ensured that Bernanke and Paulson ’s bankster gangster friends were well looked after .
“ President elect Barack Obama , who in a September 22 campaign speech promised to “ Make our government open and transparent so that anyone can ensure that our business is the people ’s business , ” refused to comment on the story when contacted by Bloomberg , which is no surprise considering the fact that the man who guaranteed “ change ” has indicated he will not only follow the Bush administration policy of a socialized financial system , but radically expand it , ” we wrote in our original story on the lawsuit back in November .
That foresight has now manifested itself again today , with Obama set to nominate Ben Bernanke , one of the main architects of the bailout under Bush , as Fed chief for a second term .

Google announced its Chrome operating system on July 7 and developers have been weighing in on what it means for the developer ranks ever since the company said it was building an OS based on its Chrome browser .
Developer reaction has ranged from excitement over Google adding energy to delivering Google for the masses , to indifference over the Chrome OS being Yet Another Delivery Mechanism that does n't really impact developers ' use of the Web as the real platform for development , to skepticism .
Indeed , one prominent developer , who asked to remain anonymous , shared what seemed to typify the skeptical developer 's view .
Said this developer : " Is this just another door into Google 's roach motel strategy , where they let me in easily but make it impossible to get out ?
In other words , the question I ask is ' what does Google get out of this ? '
And I 'd suspect that their motives are not exactly pure .
Altruism has its limits , and at the core , Google is just another company whose primary motive is to preserve and grow Google . "
However , Kevin Hakman . an Asynchronous JavaScript and X M L ( AJAX ) expert , said , " The browser as the foundation for an OS makes great sense and goes hand in hand with Internet connected devices and phones .
Web - based software apps just keep getting better and better and there are millions of web developers who will be able to create more and more web apps for these devices .
It 's going beyond a 90/10 kind of thing .
Today , 90 percent of what I need to do I can do in a browser .
An OS with a browser at its core will move that towards 95/5 with the five being left to things like Photoshop , video editing and 3D gaming for the traditional desktop OS . "
Meanwhile , like some others , Mik Kersten , creator of the open source Mylyn project and CEO of Tasktop Technologies , said he sees the chrome OS as a bit of a " back to the future " move .
Said Kersten :
" " On one hand , it 's history repeating itself from the Network Computer that Oracle and Sun were pushing in the 90's .
On the other , the current combination of HTML and AJAX in web apps has been validated as a way more successful programming model to what existed on the thin clients of the 90's .
And with netbooks needing to offload computation to the cloud , due to their limited processor and power limitations , this seems like a sensible business move if Google can pull it off . " "
Andrew Brust , chief of new technology at Twentysix New York , a consulting firm , tended to agree with Kersten .
" It appears that Chrome OS will be little more than a Linux - distro ' with a tightly integrated Chrome browser , and that the apps it will run will be the relatively simple applications in the Google Docs suite , and ostensibly other Web - based applications that conform to specific APIs , " Brust said .
Moreover , Google Gears will provide offline cache / storage capabilities , and everything will continue to run on a platform - the Web -- that was designed for rich documents rather than actual applications , Brust said .
However , " the various technologies that allow apps to run in the browser are essentially hacks and do n't constitute a stable , cohesive platform , much less an operating system , " Brust said .
" And even if people think the browser as a platform provides ' enough ' for ' most ' users , the reality is that people rely on at least a few client - based applications and they need the kind of device / display / printer / other peripheral compatibility that Windows offers , " he added .
" So this really looks like yet another Google side show , that 's not aimed at the enterprise , and it wo n't even be out until the end of next year .
We already tried this in the 1990s with the ' NC ' ( Network Computer ) and Netscape 's campaign to be the next OS .
It did n't work then , so where 's the threat with netbooks and Chrome now ? "
For his part , Kersten said he believes one plus for developers from Chrome OS is that the Google " stack " will become more of a consideration .
Google could make it easier to write Google Web Toolkit ( GWT ) applications , leverage Gears on the netbook for applications that need some offline persistence , and provide developers with other technologies that allow them to build full - featured applications that only require the Chrome OS to run .
" But what confuses me is that , for any value that Google adds to Chrome and the Chrome OS , they would fragment web developers even further , " Kersten said .
" For example , if Gears runs better on Chrome OS , a web app developer would need to figure out whether to primarily target the Chrome OS instead of optimizing everything for the still dominant IE browser .
There 's already so much pent annoyance with needing to debug and develop for every browser that developers could shy away from leveraging any special features Google adds to their ' stack . '
To address this Google could invest more in GWT to insulate the developer from the particulars of the browser , and have that be an on - ramp to using more advanced features in Chrome / OS . "
The top figure of Iran ’s nascent political reform movement , opposition presidential candidate Mir-Hossein Mousavi , will launch a political party to pursue his goals , a reformist newspaper reported Sunday .
Iranian officials , meanwhile , released a jailed European journalist and the lawyer of an imprisoned employee of the British Embassy in Tehran said he was confident that his client ’s case would be resolved .
Beleaguered President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad reiterated calls for a live “ debate ” with President Obama late Saturday in a possible sign Iran was seeking to ease diplomatic strains over his disputed reelection and its violent aftermath .
Iran continues a wide - ranging crackdown on opposition figures and reformists after the June 12 election , on Sunday blocking the website of a small reformist clerical bloc in the holy city of Qom .

The group sharply criticized the recent vote and subsequent recount effort by the Guardian Council , whose members are appointed directly and indirectly by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who supports Ahmadinejad .
“ A council , whose jurist and jurisprudent members had disproved their impartiality months ahead of the election , is not competent to rule on the cleanness and accuracy of the vote , ” said the proclamation by the Qom Assembly of Instructors and Researchers .
The group , somewhat prominent during the heyday of former President Mohammad Khatami , is now far less influential than the similarly named but far more important Qom Seminary Teachers Society which is pro-Khamenei and controls more than 80 % of the holy city ’s 50 or so seminaries .
The spokesman for Iran ’s Foreign Ministry on Sunday announced the release of freelance journalist Iason Athanasiadis , a citizen of Britain and Greece , who was arrested as he tried to leave the country through Tehran ’s international airport last month , state television reported .

The lawyer for British Embassy employee Hossein Rassam denied reports that his client had been formally charged , saying he was optimistic the Iranian national would be released in the coming days .
Rassam , 44 , is the top political analyst at Britain ’s mission in Iran , where he headed a staff of eight or nine who were all arrested on suspicion of promoting or taking part in recent clashes between supporters of Mousavi and government security forces .
“ I think his situation will be fixed soon , ” said Rassam ’s lawyer , Abdul - Samad Khorramshahi , who also represented jailed journalist Roxana Saberi .
“ I think that in the next few days I will get good news . ”
Khorramshahi said he visited the Revolutionary Court to discuss Rassam ’s case .
Authorities have not yet formally lodged a complaint against him , but could decide to do so in a week .

The arrest of Rassam and his colleagues heightened the confrontation between Iran and the West over the election and its aftermath , in which images of baton - wielding plainclothes militiamen beating demonstrators were broadcast around the world .
Tehran , which has accused London of planning and fomenting the unrest , has sought to depict Iran ’s greatest domestic political challenge in 30 years as a foreign plot .
Even as Mousavi ’s supporters described plans for a political party in the daily newspaper Etemad - e - Melli , a campaign against the movement continued .
An editorial to appear in today ’s editions of Sobh Sadegh , a newspaper close to the Revolutionary Guard , argues that the Guardian Council should bar “ liars and rabble - rousers who were running for president ” from taking part in electoral politics .
Several well - known Iranian actors have been banned from state television because of their support for Mousavi , according to the Khabar Online news website .

Authorities say that many of those swept up in the postelection unrest have been released from prison .
The pro-government Basiji militia said it had released all but 100 of the 1,000 people it had arrested .
But some independent observers put the number of those detained much higher .

As long as we as Christians are willing to tolerate or overlook duplicity in our self - identified party , it will be clear to the world that our allegiance is to a party and not the truth , regardless of what we claim .
. . .
[ T ]he evangelical movement has been guilty of preferring access over accountability .
All too often evangelicals have tolerated major breaches of character or competence within the Republican Party or certain " pet " conservative groups .
But if we are ever to speak as the moral conscience of the nation , we must consistently stand for a clear set of values and principles , no matter if that leads to a temporary loss of political power .
Unfortunately in the world of sports , some athletes pass away before it is really time .
I was stunned to learn about the death of Steve McNair earlier today .
As I watched the ESPN coverage , I could not help to think back to a time when I got to see McNair play in person .
The year was 1994 , and Alcorn State was visiting Youngstown State in the I - AA Playoffs .
The game was played on a frigid Friday at Stambaugh Stadium .
As a college student at YSU , I was assured admittance to a game that was sold out .
This was the time in YSU football history that a change for the better was taking place under new coach Jim Tressel .
YSU had a regular season record of 10 - 0 - 1 that year and Alcorn State , with McNair at QB was 8 - 2 - 1 .
( I feel like I ’m showing my age with each team having a tie in their record ) .
McNair was on the cover of Sports Illustrated about a month before the game and was a Heisman Trophy finalist .
The buzz around Youngstown was unbelievable going into that Friday playoff game .
As expected , the place was jammed at gametime .
Never one to really drink , I remember several tailgate parties and a new atmosphere for YSU football being taken to an extreme level on this day .
It marked the start of a YSU football game being a celebration of Youngstown .
Once the game started , it was over .
YSU completely pressured McNair throughout the game and never really let the Alcorn State offense get going .
YSU ended up winning by something like 40 points and that was Steve McNair ’s last college game , a landmark date in YSU football .
Thank you Steve McNair , not for coming to Youngstown and losing a playoff game , but for being a fine NFL quarterback , and an ambassador of goodwill in your time spent here .
For years the RIAA has defended the use of DRM , much to the dislike of millions of honest customers who actually paid for their music .
Now , in a shocking turnaround , the outfit seems to have come to the realization that DRM does more harm than good and has officially declared its death .
The digital music landscape is evolving continuously .
Just two years ago RIAA chairman and CEO Mitch Bainwol defended the use of DRM on digital music because customers would benefit from it .
“ DRM serves all sorts of pro-consumer purposes , ” he said at the time , without going into detail about the alleged benefits .
However , in the year that followed the numbers of consumers calling for DRM - free music increased and more labels and music services started to offer music without digital restrictions .
Still , the RIAA was not convinced that there could be a future without it , and predicted a comeback for DRM last year .
Quite the opposite happened .
Although DRM is still present in the majority of the legal music stores , most of the big players have decided to ditch it .
Most importantly Apple announced in early 2009 that all music sold via the iTunes store would be free of DRM .
This time even the RIAA does n’t believe that it can be resurrected .
Jonathan Lamy , chief spokesperson for the RIAA declared DRM dead , when he was asked about the RIAA ’s view on DRM for an upcoming SCMagazine article .
“ DRM is dead , is n’t it ? ” Lamy said , referring to the DRM - less iTunes store and other online outfits that now offer music without restrictions .
Update July 20 : Yes , it seemed to good to be true and it is .
We just learned the the RIAA never used the word dead in its reply to the reporter .
Lamy told TorrentFreak that he only said that there is almost no DRM on ( downloaded ) music anymore nowadays .
In other ( our ) words : it ’s an endangered species , not extinct .
When the most vocal forefighters of DRM say so , it must be for real .
Although this is the first time that the RIAA have actually said on record that DRM is dead , other players in the music industry have seen the light before them .
Most notable IFPI , who said earlier this year that stripping DRM would “ significantly boost download sales . ”
In this we have to agree with them .
All DRM has ever done is annoy consumers who actually paid for their music .
No single piece of DRM has ever stopped anyone from pirating music , it ’s quite the opposite as the music industry now realizes .

Science Does n't Explain Everything So The Answer to All Questions Must Be God , Right ?
A question thrown out often in debate between Christians and atheists is " If you ca n't explain the origin of the universe and the origin of life then why do n't you just believe in God ? "
It is often followed up with , " Does n't it make more sense to believe in God because all those questions are answered in the Bible .
All science has is theories but the Bible has the Truth . "
I have answered this question so frequently that I decided to write an article about why the lack of complete and perfect explanations of the origin of life and the universe do not make it seem logical for me to just believe in God instead of seeking answers .
I accept the fact that I do n't know the answers to the questions of how exactly the universe came about and how exactly , life came to be .
There are many good , scientific theories supported by tangible evidence .
It seems likely that eventually , scientists will come closer to answering such big questions as the origin of life and the universe with a great degree of accuracy and certainty .
Demanding an absolute answer right now is much like asking a child to explain exactly how a rocket flies to the moon with complete technical details .
The child does not know the answer but it does n't mean he never will or never can .
Nor does it mean that if the child said , " God makes the rocket go to the moon " he'd be correct .
As a race , we are still children ; your question is just a little too far beyond us as yet .
So my answer is that I accept that I am not all - knowing .
Only through reason will we find the beautiful truth .
Imagination is great but it does n't compare to reality .
The wonder and power of reality is so great I am a little saddened by those who think they already have the explanations for everything in a tidy package called God .
Life is n't tidy and easily understood .
It 's messy and strange and mysterious .
One tiny shred at a time we 're figuring it out ; tiny bits of reality are stacking up .
I do n't think you need to know what caused the universe to exist to say " I do n't believe the universe was created by magic . "
Historically , everything people have claimed to be caused by magic has turned out to have a logical explanation .
People used to think that maggots just came out of raw meat and turned into flies by magic .
Later we learned that flies laid eggs in the meat which hatched into maggots that turned into flies ; no magic involved , just flies laying eggs .
People once believed that illness came from demons inhabiting the body or as punishment from God for their sins .
We learned that illnesses are caused by germs , exposure to harmful elements , parasites , genetic problems and various other things unrelated to demons or gods .
People used to think that lightning and thunder had something to do with Gods throwing temper tantrums ; they blamed them on magic .
We now know that there are rational explanations ( involving no angry Gods ) that explain thunder and lightning .
We have yet to reach the pinnacle of knowledge and I doubt there even is such a thing .
We do n't know everything , we probably wo n't ever know everything but we are learning .
Just because we do n't have all the answers it does n't mean we have to accept an illogical answer like " it 's magic " or " God did it . "
Just because there is a question there is not always a ready answer and even if there is an answer it may never be found in our lifetimes .
It 's OK to admit ignorance , especially when every human that ever lived shares that ignorance .
Most folks require something more than , " I ca n't answer all the questions in the universe " to convince them God is real .
Of course we can't answer all the questions in the universe , we 're only human .
As job losses accelerated in June , the unemployment rate ticked up 0.1 percentage point to 9.5 % , the highest level since August 1983 .
But another more comprehensive gauge of unemployment also continued to tick up .
The government ’s broader measure , known as the “ U - 6 ” for its data classification , hit 16.5 % in June , 0.1 percentage point higher than March .
The comprehensive measure of labor underutilization accounts for people who have stopped looking for work or who ca n’t find full - time jobs .
The index had posted a 0.6 percentage point jump in May .
The pace of increase has begun to mirror the rise in the headline rate after soaring at higher pace earlier this year , possibly signaling that more workers are starting to look for jobs again .
Though the pace may be moderating , the figure still is the highest since the Labor Department started this particular data series in 1994 .
It ’s also above a discontinued and even broader measure that hit 15 % in late 1982 , when the official unemployment rate was 10.8 % .
( That data series goes back to the 1970s . )
The 9.5 % unemployment rate is calculated based on people who are without jobs , who are available to work and who have actively sought work in the prior four weeks .
The “ actively looking for work ” definition is fairly broad , including people who contacted an employer , employment agency , job center or friends ; sent out resumes or filled out applications ; or answered or placed ads , among other things .
The U - 6 figure includes everyone in the official rate plus “ marginally attached workers ” — those who are neither working nor looking for work , but say they want a job and have looked for work recently ; and people who are employed part - time for economic reasons , meaning they want full - time work but took a part - time schedule instead because that ’s all they could find .
Many forecasters expect the official unemployment rate to top 10 % by the end of this year .
The two indexes have begun to move closer in tandem as improving sentiment amid widespread talk of “ green shoots ” of recovery were bringing job seekers back to the market .
However , this month that trend appears to be reversing as the participation rate declined .
Meanwhile , the number of long - term unemployed continues to rise , with 4,381,000 out of work for over 27 weeks , up from 3,948,000 last month .
If those job seekers continue to be discouraged and stop looking for work they wo n’t be counted in the headline unemployment number .
However , the broader jobless rate would move higher , and could easily top 18 % .
For people in this group , comparisons to the Great Depression ( when 25 % of Americans were out of work ) may not look so wild even if overall economic activity is holding up better .

The main rumor stemming from a PS3 Slim announcement is actually much bigger than a redesign of the console , and hints at Sony aiming to rebrand the entire PlayStation lineup .
Further proof of these plans stem from a surprising redesign of a familiar game ’s box art .
The updated box art for Eye Pet , Sony ’s newest game to take advantage of the PlayStation Eye , showcases a more subtle design approach , with the subtle box engraving serving as the only indication of this title being a PS3 game .
The cleaner look also allows more room for the actual game art , which is a nice improvement .
Whether these changes will carry over to PS2 and PSP titles has yet to be seen , but we expect the official announcement to take place at GamesCom .

Taking a Rational Look at Iran Editor ’s Note : A dangerous habit of the U.S. political / media system is to exaggerate foreign threats and to demonize selected leaders , a pattern that ’s led the United States into bloody conflicts in places as diverse as Daniel Ortega ’s Nicaragua and Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq .
Now , the target is Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s Iran , with the chattering classes on TV news and in the U.S. print media jumping to conclusions about rigged elections and baiting President Barack Obama to join Israel in taking a hard line .
In this guest essay , the Independent Institute ’s Ivan Eland urges a more rational view of the crisis :
One election in Iran will not significantly change U.S. - Iran relations — only a change in U.S. thinking and policy will do so .
Email
Printer friendly Historically , the U.S. government , under both Republican and Democratic presidents , has painted relatively poor third world regimes that do n’t toe the empire ’s line as “ evil ” — Moammar El - Gadhafi ’s Libya in the 1980s , Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq in the 1990s , North Korea ’s Hermit Kingdom since the 1950s , and Islamist Iran since the Iranian Revolution in 1978 .
Most of these faraway lands have n’t provided — or will be unlikely to provide — much of an actual threat to U.S. territory or Americans in it .
But during and after the demise of the Soviet Union , to justify the bloated U.S. world - girdling empire and bloated military establishment , these minor autocratic regimes had to be demonized and their threats elevated .
The problem is the U.S. then begins to believe its own overheated rhetoric and decides that the threat from these pathetic countries requires drastic military action .
In 1950 , after North Korea invaded South Korea — then a poor non-strategic country ( believe it or not , although now much wealthier , it ’s still not very strategic to the United States ) that the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff believed would come under the natural influence of the nearby Soviet Union — the United States panicked , sent troops to South Korea , and became involved in a stalemated war .
In the 1980s , needing an enemy to justify big increases in the U.S. defense budget , Ronald Reagan began harassing Libya , which only resulted in blowback terrorist attacks against U.S. targets .
Of course , the U.S. build up of the Saddam monster had been long forgotten after the monster turned ugly and invaded the tiny nation of Kuwait .
Although even if Saddam had taken Saudi Arabia , oil would have flowed because the commodity is valuable , Saddam was in dire financial straits , and he would have had to sell it .
After the United States severely crippled the much smaller and poorer Iraq in the first Gulf War — removing any remaining hyped threat to Persian Gulf oil — the U.S. just could n’t restrain itself from taking advantage of 9/11 to get rid of the wicked Saddam once and for all .
As the U.S. government has done with the authoritarian regimes of all of these countries , it has excessively demonized Iran ’s fundamentalist rulers , but unlike with the others , it has never gone directly to war with Iran .
Many feared that the George W. Bush administration would attack or invade Iran , but one of the silver linings of the horrible quagmires in Iraq and Afghanistan was that Bush did n’t have many military resources to spare to go after Iran ’s nefarious mullahs .
After the U.S. demonizes a country ’s rulers , it then regularly generates excessive hopes for change in those countries .
With President Obama ’s overture to Iran and the Iranian election , naive hopes have already begun to set in of genuine change in Iran and in its relations with the United States .
The real problem is that even though Obama wants to negotiate with Iran , he still shares Bush ’s unrealistic concept of where he wants Iran to go .
The United States would like Iran to become more democratic , help stabilize Afghanistan and Iraq , give up its nuclear program , and stop its support for Hamas and Hezbollah — Israel ’s enemies .
Although its elections are not perfect , Iran has been — and still is — the most democratic country in the Middle East other than Israel .
The United States is embarrassed that its diabolical foe is much more democratic than its autocratic and repressive allies of Saudi Arabia and Egypt .
Hating the Taliban in Afghanistan , Iran , in the past , has quietly worked with the United States in Afghanistan to stabilize that nation .
In Iraq , although the U.S. and Iranian interests sometimes diverge , both countries have an interest in stability there ( it ’s right next door to Iran ) , and both countries are supporting the Shi ’i - dominated government .
Iran is unlikely to give up its nuclear program , because the entire political spectrum — from fundamentalists to reformers — supports it .
Although Iran is moving toward obtaining the ability to make a nuclear weapon and a long - range missile that could deliver it as far as the United States , it still has a way to go and also has to engineer the warhead so that it is small enough to fit on the missile .
Even if Iran accomplishes all of those objectives , it would still have only a few measly warheads for any attack on the United States , which could be deterred with the thousands of warheads in the most powerful nuclear arsenal in the world .
The Iranian government would be unlikely to give any nuclear weapons to the militant groups it supports — Hamas and Hezbollah — because it paid much money to develop the warheads , and because if the groups used the weapons , it would invite sure catastrophic retaliation against Iran if traced back there .
Like all autocratic rulers , Iran ’s fundamentalist leadership ’s most important objective is staying in power , and getting nuked into cinders does not facilitate that goal .
The real reason that the U.S. government is so concerned about Iran is not its threat to the United States but its threat to Israel — both nuclear and non-nuclear through support for the militant groups .
But frankly , that should not be the U.S. taxpayer ’s problem .
The American Constitution allows for the U.S. government to “ provide for the common defense ” of the United States , not to provide a defense for Israel .
In short , the United States could get along better with Iran — no matter who is president in the United States or Iran — if U.S. expectations for change in Iran were more realistic and the U.S. government ’s threat perceptions of Iran were diminished through rational thought .

The Mayor of London Boris Johnson has fallen into a river while launching a drive to urge Londoners to volunteer .
While helping to clear up the River Pool in Lewisham , south - east London , he tripped and fell in , getting wet up to his chest before stumbling away .
Mr Johnson , who was helping remove litter and plants from the river , was aided to his feet by volunteers - one of whom jumped in after him .
He described his unexpected dip as " the ultimate sacrifice " .
Mr Johnson said : " We have been out and about in London to discover the joys of volunteering .
" I think it is a fantastic thing to clean up our rivers .
" And of course in order to promote this to the max , I made the ultimate sacrifice - I decided to fall in , in a very spectacular way . "
' Reap rewards '
Mr Johnson and members of the Quaggy Waterways Action Group , were removing litter and Himalayan balsam , an invasive plant species that prevents native vegetation and wildlife from thriving .
There are more than 8,500 volunteer organisations registered with London 's network of volunteer centres - they estimate an additional 16,000 people sign up each year .
Mr Johnson earlier said : " Volunteering is good for individuals and great for London in tough economic times .
" By giving your time , whether a one - off few hours or a regular commitment , we can both help to make the capital a more civilised , pleasant place and reap the rewards of putting something back into the communities in which we live . "
After the river clean - up the mayor launched a website containing a one - stop - shop of opportunities to give their help for free .

Scientists have long suspected that the sex chromosome that only males carry is deteriorating and could disappear entirely within a few million years , but until now , no one has understood the evolutionary processes that control this chromosome 's demise .
Now , a pair of Penn State scientists has discovered that this sex chromosome , the Y chromosome , has evolved at a much more rapid pace than its partner chromosome , the X chromosome , which both males and females carry .
This rapid evolution of the Y chromosome has led to a dramatic loss of genes on the Y chromosome at a rate that , if maintained , eventually could lead to the Y chromosome 's complete disappearance .
The research team , which includes Associate Professor of Biology Kateryna Makova , the team 's leader , and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow Melissa Wilson , will publish its results in the 17 July 2009 issue of the journal PLoS Genetics .
" There are three classes of mammals , " said Makova , " egg- laying mammals , like the platypus and the echidna ; marsupials , like the opossum and the wallaby ; and all other mammals -- called eutherians -- which include humans , dogs , mice , and giraffes .
The X and Y chromosomes of marsupials and eutherians evolved from a pair of non-sex chromosomes to become sex chromosomes . "
Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes , which are the structures that hold our DNA , but just one pair of these chromosomes are sex chromosomes , while the others are referred to as non-sex chromosomes .
" In eutherian mammals , the sex chromosomes contain an additional region of DNA whereas , in the egg - laying mammals and marsupials , this additional region of DNA is located on the non-sex chromosomes , " said Makova .
" At first , bits of DNA within this additional region were readily swapped between the X and Y chromosomes , but some time between 80 and 130 million years ago , the region became two completely separate entities that no longer swapped DNA .
One of the regions became specifically associated with the X chromosome and the other became specifically associated with the Y chromosome . "
By comparing the DNA of the X and Y chromosomes in eutherian mammals to the DNA of the non-sex chromosomes in the opossum and platypus , the team was able to go back in time to the point when the X and Y chromosomes were still swapping DNA , just like the non-sex chromosomes in the opossum and platypus .
The scientists then were able to observe how the DNA of the X and Y chromosomes changed over time relative to the DNA of the non-sex chromosomes .
" Our research revealed that the Y - specific DNA began to evolve rapidly at the time that the DNA region split into two entities , while the X - specific DNA maintained the same evolutionary rate as the non-sex chromosomes , " said Makova .
Once the biologists determined that the Y chromosome has been evolving more rapidly and has been losing more genes as a result , they wanted to find out why the Y chromosome has not already disappeared entirely .
" Today , the human Y chromosome contains less than 200 genes , while the human X chromosome contains around 1,100 genes , " said Wilson .
" We know that a few of the genes on the Y chromosome are important , such as the ones involved in the formation of sperm , but we also know that most of the genes were not important for survival because they were lost , which led to the very different numbers of genes we observe between the once - identical X and Y .
Although there is evidence that the Y chromosome is still degrading , some of the surviving genes on the Y chromosome may be essential , which can be inferred because these genes have been maintained for so long . "
The team then decided to test the hypothesis that some of the genes on the Y chromosome are being maintained because they are essential .
The team 's approach was to compare the expression and function of genes on the Y chromosome with analogous genes on the X chromosome .
" If the genes ' expressions and / or functions were different , then it would make sense that the genes on the Y chromosome would be maintained because they are doing something that the genes on the X chromosome can't do , " said Makova .
" This hypothesis turned out to be correct . "
Although some of the genes on the Y chromosome have been maintained , most of them have died , and the team found evidence that some others are on track to disappear , as well .
" Even though some of the genes appear to be important , we still think there is a chance that the Y chromosome eventually could disappear , " said Makova .
" If this happens , it wo n't be the end of males .
Instead , a new pair of non-sex chromosomes likely will start on the path to becoming sex chromosomes . "
In the future , the team plans to use its newly generated data to create a computer model that tracks the degeneration of the Y chromosome .
The scientists hope to determine how long it will take for the Y chromosome to disappear .
They also hope to identify the processes that are most important for degeneration of the Y chromosome .
This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health , Penn State , and the National Science Foundation .
MEXICO CITY --
On the day of last week 's World Cup qualifier between the United States and Mexico , a Mexico City newspaper polled citizens asking if they felt the country 's national pride was at stake .
Seventy - six percent said yes .
Think about that for a second .
Americans are obsessed with sports .
We currently sustain four major professional sports leagues , as well as NASCAR , the MLS , MILS , the WNBA , every conceivable NCAA sport , dozens of golf and tennis events , boxing and UFC cards , the WWE and even the Little League World Series .
Can you remember a sporting event making us feel as if our national pride was at stake ?
Me neither .
Bill Simmons
Yes , that 's barbed wire atop the fence that circles the field .
Take all the sports we care about here , mix that passion together , condense it into one mega - sport , and you 'd have soccer in Mexico .
Had the U.S. crushed Mexico's Cup chances in the legendary Estadio Azteca last week -- that 's right , the U.S. , the big bully to the north , a country that does n't care about soccer even 1/100th as much as Mexico does -- it would have been a national tragedy .
Maybe it's not amazing that 76 percent of the people felt as though their pride was at stake because the number was n't higher .
II .
I flew down to see our suddenly promising U.S. national team tested by an antagonistic crowd .
This was n't a must - win by any stretch ; more of a litmus test .
Could the Americans keep momentum going after the team 's astonishing performance in the Confederations Cup ?
Should we start getting legitimately excited about South Africa next summer ?
Beyond that , what the hell was happening to me ?
Why was I starting to get hooked by soccer -- a sport I have never totally liked and even actively hated at times ?
Was this an extremely early midlife crisis ?
And if so , why soccer of all things ?
Could n't it have been a Porsche or an 18 - year - old Starbucks barista ?
Wait , am I saying that out loud ?
The good news ?
My trip to Mexico quickly morphed into one of those " I 'm going to remember everything that happened 40 years from now . "
I stood on the field at Azteca , grabbed a few strands of grass and put them in my wallet .
I rode in SUVs with bulletproof windows and security guards .
I asked a hotel concierge if there was a good place to get coffee , followed by him pointing me toward a Starbucks to our left , then saying , " Whatever you do , do n't go right . "
I got trapped in one of Azteca 's oppressively hot elevators and saw my life briefly flash before my eyes .
I watched one of my bosses get nailed by a flying burrito after the game .
I drank enough tequila to kill Salma Hayek .
I got rocked by Montezuma 's revenge on the way home , which was strange because I am absolutely positive I have never done anything to Montezuma .
None of those memories matched the game .
The Americans were a sterling 0 - 22 - 1 in Mexico before Wednesday 's match ... and with reason .
The stands hug the field , shoot straight up and could n't be more intimidating , especially in the corners , where fans shower opponents with beers , sodas and LTYDEWTKWTA ( Liquids That You Don't Even Want To Know What They Are ) on every corner kick .
The lower section of the stadium is fenced , with a guarded , waterless moat ( seriously , a moat ! ) with a second fence above it that prevents fans from racing onto the field .
Atop the stadium , an uneven half - roof leads to eerie shadows and goofy lighting that seem to change by the minute .
Opponents never feel safe .
Inside the bowels of the stadium , the players walk down a concrete tunnel that feels like it was built in 1362 .
Emerge from the tunnel , and Mexican fans are suddenly right there , wearing green jerseys , yelling obscenities and pounding the fence in front of them .
The venom starts immediately -- booing and hissing , horn blowing , various " Meh - hee - CO ! Meh - hee CO ! " chants -- and never really stops .
The Mexican fans had no problem drowning out " The Star - Spangled Banner " with jeers .
They tossed drinks and debris at the U.S. bench for most of the second half ... which did n't matter because Azteca 's opposing bench has an impenetrable plexiglass roof , but still .
During a corner kick in extra time , they showered Landon Donovan with such a staggering amount of debris that he briefly staggered back toward the field in disbelief , shrugging his hands as if to say , " How could anyone act like this ? "
Bill Simmons
The brave souls known as Sam's Army were n't exactly given the best seats in the stadium .
You can't even call it just a hostile environment ; it 's more primal than anything .
I have only attended two other games in which the crowd 's collective loathing was palpable -- Game 6 of the 1986 NBA Finals ( Boston fans heaping hatred on Ralph Sampson , who had punched two Celtics in the previous game ) and Game 5 of the 1987 Eastern finals ( the same treatment for Bill Laimbeer , who had decked Larry Bird the previous game ) -- and neither approached USA - Mexico .
Michael Vick could crash a PETA rally and get a friendlier reception than the Americans did at Azteca .
On the worst days in Mexico City , opponents deal with high altitude , intense heat and oppressive smog that makes their lungs burn .
( The famous Azteca story that sounds like an urban legend but is actually true : Eric Wynalda once coughed up black blood after a game there . )
Mexico passed up a more lucrative prime - time telecast for a mid-afternoon start , hoping humidity , altitude and pollution would wear the Americans down .
Nope .
The weather settled in the mid-70s .
There was a breeze .
The skies were so clear you could glimpse the mountains .
The U.S. team will never have better conditions for a game in Mexico City .
Normally with international soccer games ( especially Cup qualifiers ) , a few sections are reserved for the opposing team 's fans .
Not in Azteca .
The U.S. was allotted about 500 seats for Sam's Army ( a traveling band of American fans ) ; they were crammed in the upper deck in one corner with armed police officers flanking both aisles .
Fans tossed drinks , batteries and rocks at them , then berated them in Spanish , which was n't a surprise because this was " Throw Drinks , Batteries and Rocks at American Fans and Berate Them in Spanish " Day .
According to one account by a photographer who attended the game , Sam's Army was advised to flee the premises immediately after the final whistle .
You know , just to be safe .

The fans went crazy after Mexico scored to tie the game .
Of course , I thought about sitting with Sam's Army before remembering , " Wait , I have two kids ; that 's an absolutely horrible idea ! "
I landed in a modified suite with a few ESPN bosses , a few more U.S. Soccer higher - ups and my buddy Hopper ( the biggest soccer fan I know ; I had to bring him ) .
In adjoining suites , Mexican fans were eyeballing us the same way a drunk college football player would stare down someone hitting on his ex-girlfriend .
Drinks would crash down on our roof like golf - ball - sized pieces of hail .
Did I love it ?
Of course !
Why do you think I wanted to go in the first place ?
Have you ever gone on a trip where your wife said to you beforehand , " I think you should make a will " ?
Have you ever been told in explicit terms , " Do not leave your hotel and walk around at night ? "
Have you ever had someone tell you in all seriousness , " We do n't want to sit in the stands , we would get hit by bags of urine " ?
Ever mention wanting to wear your team 's jersey into another team 's stadium and have someone answer without a trace of humor , " You should just wear a jersey that says ' KILL ME ' " ?
This was like a cross between a Raiders game and the Pistons crowd at the tail end of the Artest melee , only if it had lasted three straight hours .
III .
Nobody thought the Americans could win for obvious reasons .
( You know , like " 0 - 22 - 1 " and " they 're better at soccer than us . " )
But nine minutes in , Donovan created some room for himself at midfield , gained a little speed , then found a streaking Charlie Davies with a gorgeous pass , and ... ( wait a second , is this a breakaway ? ) ... ( hold on , can he get a shot off here ? ) ... gooooooooooooooal !!!!!
( Hold on , I ca n't resist . )
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have attended all kinds of sporting events :
Never have I heard a crowd more stunned than the Mexican crowd after Davies ' goal .
All traces of sound vanished from the stadium .
Like someone pointed a remote control at Azteca and pressed " mute . "
It was one of those sports moments when you wish they could have stopped the proceedings right there for 20 minutes , just so we could soak in what happened and dream about all the possibilities .
Estadio Azteca .
United States 1 , Mexico 0 . ( Pause . )
Hold on , just a little bit longer .
One more second .
Just let me keep enjoying this .

Plexiglass protection did n't prevent fans from tossing debris at the U.S. bench .
Even if Mexico 's fans did n't rally right away , its players did .
The Mexicans dominated the next 80 - plus minutes , finding a flaw in our defense ( left side , back middle of the field ) and picking it apart much like a basketball offense would exploit an undersized defender in the low post .
They claimed this specific piece of turf and made it their own .
The Mexicans play a deliberate style , similar to how a football team controls time of possession with a bruising running game and short passes , but they do it with crisp passing and by exploiting mismatches .
Their goal ?
To make the defense overreact .
It 's almost like war : attack one piece of turf to open up another .
Watch Mexico play , and you end up thinking , " Why does n't everyone play that way ?
It looks so easy ! "
It comes down to a catalyst and a mindset ; if you 're missing both , you can't pull it off .
In basketball , think of the teams that play beautifully together ( like Duncan 's Spurs or Nash 's pre-Shaq Suns ) versus stagnant offenses that stand around watching their best player go one - on - four ( like LeBron 's Cavs ) .
You might win going one - on - four ; you 're just making it harder on yourself , that 's all .
Same goes for soccer ... and unfortunately , the Americans lapse into soccer 's equivalent of the one - on - four offense too often .
You know it 's happening when they lose patience and forget about controlling the ball ; you know it 's happening when they repeatedly sail passes downfield with no rhyme or reason ; and you definitely know it 's happening when the defenders seem jumpy .
The best soccer defenders clear out a play , then hold the ball for that extra second or two as they size up the field for a counterattack .
In Mexico , the jumpy Americans handled these situations like they were dumping a hand grenade .
I gotta get rid of this thing !
That guy 's coming right at me !
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !
And so our " offense " became a series of three - second possessions in which we just kicked the ball downfield as far as possible .
The Americans sorely needed someone like Blanco , the aging Mexican star who controlled the first 55 minutes Wednesday .
Blanco might be 73 for all we know ; he moves like the " South Park " guys are animating him .
Did n't matter .
He 's magical .
I am just starting to figure out soccer , but one of the first things I noticed is it 's all about the subtleties .
Not the goals as much as someone spotting a teammate 40 yards away , making a telepathic connection with him , starting a long kick for him just as his teammate starts streaking , then somehow landing the ball on his teammate 's foot as though it were on a yo - yo .
These moments set Blanco apart .
The Mexican fans even bless them by screaming " Olé , " which basically means , " Beautiful play , I love what you just did . "
Thanks to Blanco and some shaky officiating ( the Americans could n't get a call for two hours ) , the Mexicans seized control and eventually scored on a hellacious 25 - yard bomb from Israel Castro .
The crowd regained its swagger .
Liquids started flying .
We headed into halftime with everyone in my group thinking , " I 'd take a tie . "
Secretly , we knew how it would play out .
Rattled by the crowd and the referees , the Americans played a tentative , sloppy second half that came back to haunt them at the 81 - minute mark , when Donovan ( battling the swine flu , although nobody knew it at the time ) got badly beaten on a relatively simple streak down the field .
His guy ended up creating the winning goal from Miguel Sabah .
Game over .
[+]
Enlarge Jaime Lopez / Getty Images Miguel Sabah celebrates his goal that gave Mexico a 2 - 1 lead late in the game .
That 's not what I will remember .
I will remember the reaction afterward : Complete and utter delirium .
Everyone just threw whatever drink they had as far as they could .
It was like watching a new Pixar movie called " A Snowstorm of Drinks " crossed with a full - fledged prison riot .
Then and only then did we realize exactly how much that game meant to the Mexicans .
As Hopper said right after the final whistle ( Mexico 2 , USA 1 ) , " I guess the upside is that we 're going to live . "
IV .
The good news for U.S. fans ?
Our boys hung for two hours in Mexico without disgracing themselves .
The bad news ?
The defeat reinforced some basic problems with our soccer program .
We have only a few world - class players ( Donovan , Oguchi Onyewu , Clint Dempsey and goalie Tim Howard ) and lack a franchise guy who could swing any game , even one being played in Estadio Azteca .
For instance , I watched Sunday 's Liverpool - Tottenham battle , and Steven Gerrard was so ridiculously , dominantly good in so many different ways -- some overt , some subtle -- that I could n't get over it .
He makes difficult plays seem effortless ; you never forget he's on the field .
America does n't have anyone like that .
Just like in basketball , you can't win championships in soccer without a LeBron / Kobe - type player .
Which brings us to a simple conundrum : America has the best athletes in the world , but only a handful of them play soccer .
Had Gerrard grown up here , he would be playing third base or middle linebacker .
It 's just a fact .
Of the current American stars , only Onyewu ( the anchor of the defense ) qualifies as something of a physical specimen .
That 's what makes forward Jozy Altidore so fascinating .
Only 19 years old and built like someone created him in a " FIFA 2010 " game , you watch Jozy and think , " Man , that guy could have played any sport he wanted . "
Have we ever had a guy like that before ?
Jozy made his bones in the Confederations Cup , where he posted up a Spanish defender like Tim Duncan , hauled a long pass into his body , shielded the same defender , whirled around ( and inadvertently flung the defender to the ground by sheer force ) , then whipped a bullet by Spain 's goalkeeper for a game - altering goal .
If you saw it , you remember it , a LeBron - like , uber - athletic moment for an American team normally habitated by realistically talented , ultimately forgettable athletes .
If he can make a splash in South Africa , what will that mean for the future of American soccer ?
For the first time , there 's real hope .
You can see it in the eyes of the people running USA Soccer ; every time Jozy 's name gets brought up , you see a twinkle , followed by the usual round of " I do n't want to jinx it , and it 's so early , and we do n't want to put any pressure on him " qualifiers .
[+]
Enlarge Kevork Djansezian / Getty Images Jozy Altidore , pictured here playing against Spain , is the rare American player gifted enough to play any sport .
That 's the right way to play it .
But if you do n't think the next five years of Jozy 's career could potentially swing the future of soccer , you 're insane .
Even when he entered last week 's Mexico game with 20 minutes to play -- thanks to injury , he was too banged up to play the full 90 -- it felt like the axis of the contest shifted .
America 's broken - down , " let 's kick the ball ahead 70 yards and hope for a miracle break " offense did n't seem so farfetched anymore .
Jozy was noticeably bigger and stronger than everyone playing for Mexico 's team .
U.S. fans found themselves clinging to the same hope : " Maybe Jozy will make a play .
Maybe . "
Nothing happened , but the Americans finally have a player whom you can't take your eyes off when he's on the soccer field .
Whether Jozy Altidore is ready for that responsibility remains to be seen .
Whether there are more Jozys on the way remains to be seen .
At least it 's a discussion now .
When the Americans play El Salvador next month in Salt Lake City , both Donovan and Altidore should be healthy .
Maybe Mexico was n't a must - win , but this game is .
You can't give away Cup qualifiers on your own turf .
Whatever happens , the stars seem to be aligning for soccer in the United States .
Subtle factors have made soccer a potential breakout sport for the next decade : high definition ; few commercial breaks ; games that almost always end within two hours ; improved camera angles ; increased exposure to international play ; a generation of adults weaned on the 1994 World Cup ; even the near - death of passing in basketball , which led people like me to gravitate toward soccer simply because I miss seeing telepathic connections between teammates and will take it any way I can get it .
I do n't think I 'm alone .
Like with succeeding in the game itself , the big- picture situation in America requires patience .
It 's not about launching those 70 - yard kicks downfield and hoping something happens -- aka the Beckham signing -- but building something from within and trusting the process .
For the first time , it feels like American soccer might get there .
Looking back , the most interesting thing about last week 's game was n't whether the U.S. won or lost , but that so many Americans were furious that they could n't see the game .
When was the last time THAT happened ?
As for the Mexicans , they averted a national disaster and reignited their Cup chances .
On the way back to our hotel , driving in our bulletproof car , we passed under a bridge on the highway and noticed one lone Mexican man happily swinging a flag back and forth .
He had to have been 45 minutes from the stadium .
There was nobody around him .
He just kept swinging that flag with a joyous grin on his face .
I remember thinking to myself , " Nobody in America will ever care about a sport that much . "
And we wo n't .

Nonetheless , a little - noticed study the Labor Department released several months ago found that the benefits of the biggest federal job training program were “ small or nonexistent ” for laid - off workers .
It showed little difference in earnings and the chances of being rehired between laid - off people who had been retrained and those who had not .
In interviews , the authors of the study and other economists cited several reasons that retraining might not be effective .
Many workers who have lost their jobs are older and had spent their lives working in one industry .
In need of a job right away , many pick relatively short training programs , which often have marginal benefits .
Job retraining is also ineffective without job creation , a point made by several economists who have long cautioned against placing too much stock in it .
Finally , workers trying to pick a new field cannot predict the future of the labor market , especially in a time of economic upheaval .
“ I ca n’t tell you with any degree of certainty , and I ’ve been doing it for 20 years , what the hot jobs are going to be , ” said one of the authors , Kenneth R. Troske , an economics professor at the University of Kentucky .
An examination by The New York Times of one group of laid - off workers  36 people who finished their retraining at Macomb Community College just outside Detroit at about the same time as Mr. Hutchins , from May to August 2008  found that at least 60 percent appeared either not to be working or to be in jobs unrelated to their training .
Several had jobs but then lost them later , according to state wage records and interviews .
And a review of wages for several employed workers before and after training showed that almost all had lost ground .

I do n’t remember what brought it up the other day , but we had a good laugh when we realized that in a house with 2 Christians and an Atheist that it was the Atheist who was the only one who was baptized .
( It turned out , however , that two of us are baptized , so not as ironic as originally thought )
I thought it would still be amusing though to post about my baptism though because I have photos !
Not to be confused with David Smalley ’s book , Baptized Atheist
Jehovah ’s Witnesses do not baptize at birth , they require it to be a conscious decision .
I chose to be baptized at the age of 12 .
When you are considering baptism as a Jehovah ’s Witness , the Elders in your congregation will ask you a bunch of questions to determine why you ’ve made the decision and if you ’re ready .
If they give you the thumbs up , then your baptism is scheduled for the next big assembly ( a church event where a bunch of congregations all gather today for a multi- day meeting ) .
I was baptized at a 2 - day Circuit Assembly ( a Circuit is about 20 + congregations , and then Circuits make up Districts , and the hierarchy continues … ) in Norco , CA .
All of the baptismal candidates are required to sit in the front rows of the large assembly hall because the sermons that morning are directly aimed at them .
Then they are asked to stand and verbally shout “ YES ! ” to a couple of questions which are essentially “ Do you dedicate yourself to God … ” or “ Do you accept Jesus died for your sins … ” etc .
( This was how they did it 25 years ago .
If you ’re a Jehovah ’s Witness currently , let me know if the process has changed ! )
At these large Assembly halls , they have baptismal pools built into the floor .
Even though Jehovah ’s Witnesses consider the water to be a symbolic part of the event , they still believe you should be fully submerged .
After the sermons and questions , they slide back the cover to reveal the baptismal pool and the candidates go into the changing rooms behind the stage to change from their nice suits and dresses into appropriate ( AND MODEST , LADIES ) swim wear .
Hundreds of people gather around the pool to watch , take photos and such .
So … here you go , my baptism .
The Cleveland Cavaliers got some bad news followed by some potentially terrific news on Sunday .
In a last - ditch effort to recruit Trevor Ariza away from the Houston Rockets , LeBron James told Ariza he would remain with the Cavaliers past 2010 , according to a person close to Ariza .
Even that was n't enough to get Ariza , who verbally committed to join the Rockets last Thursday , to change his mind and go to Cleveland .
But the Cavaliers will gladly settle for the consolation prize ; if indeed James ' statement to Ariza was more than an empty sales pitch .
" Trevor asked LeBron if he would be in Cleveland after next season , " the source said .
" And LeBron said , ' I 'll be there .
Of course , I 'll be there . ' "
James could not be reached for comment on Monday .
James ' conversation with Ariza was part of the Cavaliers ' attempt to make the free agent swingman the next Hedo Turkoglu , who backed out of his promise last week to join Portland and instead accepted a deal with Toronto .
Cavs general manager Danny Ferry and head coach Mike Brown flew to Los Angeles and met with Ariza on Sunday , according to several sources with knowledge of the situation .
Christian players in Brazil ’s football team have been ordered to stop making displays of their faith during matches .
Several of the national side ’s players , including Real Madrid star Kaka , wore T - shirts bearing slogans such as ‘ I belong to Jesus ’ underneath their shirts during the Confederations Cup final last month .
But football ’s governing body , FIFA , has now reminded the team that such displays on the pitch are against the rules .
FIFA wrote to the Brazilian Football Federation “ to remind them of the relevant regulations , so that such incidents do not recur in the future ” .
Brazil players prayed openly after their win against the USA last month and many wore Christian T - shirts in subsequent team photographs .
Their actions prompted calls from the Secretary General of the Danish Football Association for a ban on all religious statements from the game .
Jim Stjerne Hansen said : “ Just as we reject political manifestations , we should also say no to religious ones .
There are too many risks involved in clubs , for example , with people of different religious faiths . ”
FIFA rules say : “ Players must not reveal undergarments showing slogans or advertising .
The basic compulsory equipment must not have any political , religious or personal statements . ”
As mcjoan noted earlier , someone , somewhere is floating the idea of an executive order to implement a system of " prolonged detention " for the Obama administration .
Joan certainly covered all the bases in her approach to the story , but I do have my own angle to add .
I was particularly struck by one passage in the Washington Post / Pro Publica article :
One administration official suggested the White House was already trying to build support for an executive order .
" Civil liberties groups have encouraged the administration , that if a prolonged detention system were to be sought , to do it through executive order , " the official said .
Such an order can be rescinded and would not block later efforts to write legislation , but civil liberties groups generally oppose long - term detention , arguing that detainees should either be prosecuted or released .
It 's not stated explicitly , but since the story goes on to cite the President 's speech of May 21st just three sentences later , I do n't think it 's out of the question to guess that the unnamed administration official above had in mind the President 's meeting of May 20th with civil liberties activists and legal scholars when he or she said that the administration was encouraged to adopt any such system through an executive order .
The only problem with that is , I do n't recall anyone encouraging any such thing .
My memory of that meeting , of course , is by no means the definitive record .
But given the specific focus of my own participation in that meeting , it seems rather unlikely that I would have missed anyone 's suggestion that such a policy be implemented by unilateral action of the President .
In fact , my comments at the meeting began with the specific warning that any new policies put in place by this administration would undoubtedly survive it , only to be abused by some succeeding administration , no matter what President Obama 's intentions in implementing them .
So while I see the point in arguing that an executive order can be more easily rescinded , it also seems obvious that it can be reissued just as easily .
Or more likely , that a new and more draconian one can be issued in its place , with President Obama 's serving as precedent .
I doubt that would have escaped notice or comment .
And indeed , as mcjoan noted ( via TPM ) , Shane Kadidal of the Center for Constitutional Rights did comment :
Another thing that 's odd about this is the idea that this detention authority would somehow be more transient if it were authorized through executive order ( which can be reversed at the stroke of the president 's pen ) rather than a statute ( which could sit on the books indefinitely ) .
If the last eight years have taught us anything , it 's that executive abuses , left to continue unchecked for many years , have a tendency to congeal into precedent .
Indeed , that was another part of my focus : that tendency for unchecked executive power to congeal into precedent , for which I relied as I frequently do on Justice Frankfurter 's opinion in the Youngstown steel seizure case .
Lo and behold , it is also the focus of today 's " told you so " from the right :
The world sure looks different after you take that oath of office , does n't it ?
How easily campaign declarations of outrage are forgotten !
I bet there 's not a president since Truman who has n't learned to loathe the Supreme Court 's decision in the Steel Seizure Case .
So is it just a trial balloon ?
I do n't know .
But someone certainly went out of their way to try to manufacture a justification that can lean on the supposed advice ( albeit reluctant ) of civil liberties groups .
And the denial has its own problems :
" There is no executive order .
There just is n't one . "
That is , it depends on what the meaning of the word " is " is .
There is no executive order .
But that was n't the story .
The story was that there was a draft .
Which , of course is n't an executive order .
It just is n't one .
But whether there 's a draft or not , I think it 's worth pointing out that I 'm not so sure there was any civil liberties group that encouraged the President to act by executive order , either .
( CNN ) -- Changing winter conditions are causing Scotland 's wild Soay sheep to get smaller , according to a study that suggests climate change can trump natural selection .
Ca n't see me now : Climate change could be shrinking Soay sheep in Scotland .
The authors of the study published in " Science " believe that it highlights how wide - ranging the effects of global climate change can be , adding further complexity to the changes we might expect to see in animal populations in future .
" It 's only in the last few years that we 've realized that evolution can influence species ' physical traits as quickly as ecological changes can .
This study addresses one of the major goals of population biology , namely to untangle the ways in which evolutionary and environmental changes influence a species ' traits , " said Andrew Sugden , deputy and international managing editor at Science .
The researchers analyzed body - weight measurements and life - history data for the female members of a population of Soay sheep .
The sheep live on the island of Hirta in the St. Kilda archipelago of Scotland and have been studied closely since 1985 .
They selected body size because it is a heritable trait , and because the sheep have , on average , been decreasing in size for the last 25 years .
According to the findings lambs are not growing as quickly as they once did as winters have become shorter so do not need to put on as much as weight in the first months of life to survive .
The results suggest that the decrease is primarily an ecological response to environmental variation over the last 25 years .
Evolutionary change , the report says , has contributed relatively little .
" Sheep are getting smaller .
Well , at least the wild Soay sheep living on a remote Scottish island are .
But according to classic evolutionary theory , they should have been getting bigger , because larger sheep tend to be more likely to survive and reproduce than smaller ones , and offspring tend to resemble their parents , " said study author Tim Coulson of Imperial College London .
" Our findings have solved a paradox that has tormented biologists for years -- why predictions did not match observation .
Biologists have realized that ecological and evolutionary processes are intricately intertwined , and they now have a way of dissecting out the contribution of each .
Unfortunately it is too early to tell whether a warming world will lead to pocket - sized sheep , " said Coulson .

June 29 , 2009  --
The mother of a 555 - pound , 14 - year - old boy in South Carolina was charged with neglect last week for allegedly failing to control her son's weight .
Before fleeing town with her son , Jerri Gray had been contacted by the local Department of Social Services previous times about her son's weight and was even issued a treatment plan to turn around Alexander Draper 's morbid obesity , Gray 's attorney Grant Varner told ABCnews.com .
But when Gray failed to bring Alexander in for some of his medical treatment appointments recommended by the department and he continued to gain weight , the state sent notice that Gray would lose custody of her only child .
" She panicked , " Varner said .
" She had no lawyer , she could n't afford a lawyer and they took off .
They had no destination really .
They stopped in Baltimore to do laundry , which is where they were found . "
Alexander has been placed in foster care and Gray of Travelers Rest , S.C. , will appear in court to face two felony charges -- custodial interference , which carries a 5 - year sentence , and child neglect , which carries a 10 - year sentence .
" I have not heard a case involving parents charged in neglect with obesity , " said Thomas L. Hafemeister , associate professor of law at the University of Virginia Law School in Charlottesville .
But Hafemeister said state interference with children for health care reasons has become an increasing problem in the past 20 years .
Take , for example , the case of Daniel Hauser , whose Minnesota family initially refused chemotherapy treatments for his Hodgkin 's lymphoma in May .
" Certainly , there are cases out there where parents are facing neglect and abuse charges for failing to provide needed medical care , in this case nutritional care , " Hafemeister said .
" But this is a very unusual case . "
Jane Spinak , a professor at Columbia University Law School in New York , said that in many cases of medical neglect , public health officials are expected to offer help to a parent .
" I think the question is when is the outreach sufficient that a court could then say , ' Look , we 're giving you all these opportunities to better care for your child ? "
Spinak said .
" The state has to decide at what point is not accepting that voluntary assistance neglect . "
Sometimes at issue , however , is whether child welfare officials can expect parents to show up to an appointment they reasonably cannot make .
Defining Neglect of an Obese Child
" The offers have to be realistic , " Spinak said .
" They have to be things that [ a mother ] and her child can actually take advantage of .
If they want her to take him every day to something and she 's working two jobs , that 's not really realistic . "
Only in the case of life - and - death situations do state officials normally intervene , family law experts say .
" If the child 's life is at risk , the state can intervene :
If it is a relatively non-life threatening situation , the state stays out , " Hafemeister said .
" With regard to obesity , in general , I do n't think you 're going to see a lot of interventions . "
But in the case of a 550 - pound teenager , pediatricians with an expertise in obesity say Alexander 's health could be an issue of life or death .
If not immediately , the extra weight may result in death 40 years down the road .
" At this weight , you can't sit in seats , " said Dr. Keith Ayoob , director of the Nutrition Clinic and assistant professor of pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City .
" You 're talking about three , 150 - pound people , and then put a 100 - pound , 10 - year - old in their lap . "
" He 's at high risk , " Ayoob said .
" The point is to get this kid help .
Otherwise , he 's at a very high risk for an early death .
He wo n't make it until 50 . "
Ayoob said a 14 - year - old 's skeleton may suffer significant damage under the extra 400 pounds .
That pressure would likely lead to hip and knee problems .
Being morbidly obese also puts children at high risk for hypertension , which puts the them risk for heart troubles .
At that weight , Ayoob said , there is a high risk for Type 2 diabetes , which puts a person at risk for a slew of other health complications .
" With Type 2 diabetes , he is at risk for a heart attack , and he's at risk for kidney failure , and he's at risk for circulation problems meaning he may lose fingers and toes and sometimes limbs , " said Dr. Reginald Washington of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the chief medical officer for the Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children in Denver .
Added to that laundry list are sleep apnea and a fatty liver , with risk of liver failure , Washington said .
But obesity , as much of a public health issue as it its , is not always a proven grim health sentence .
Obese Children Open Up Family and Health Questions
Dr. Marc Jacobson , of the American Academy of Pediatrics , Obesity Leadership Workgroup , said a sizable fraction of obese people do n't have co-morbid health problems .
" He could have orthopedic complications like bowed legs , " he said , " It 's called Blount 's disease , he could have metabolic complications ... breathing complications .
But he could also conceivably not have any of those . "
" Believe it or not , there are people who are quite overweight who do n't have any medical complications , about 1 out of 3 , " he said .
" But that data comes from adults . "
But even if an obese child were lucky enough to not face any medical problems , those who treat childhood obesity say there are frequently co-morbid psychological problems or family dynamic issues .
" There 's a chance that he has one of the genetic problems that can cause massive weight gain , " Washington said .
" When we see a child , especially at that age who is massively obese , we test him for that , but often they 're negative .
The [ genetic ] problems are very rare , but they 're known .
" But you have to imagine that a 14 - year - old probably does n't have the resources to eat that much .
Someone had to enable that to happen . "
Ayoob , who treats morbidly obese patients on a regular basis , agreed .
" If he 's eating like a typical 14 - year - old , he would lose weight , " Ayoob said .
" The heaviest patient I had was 675 pounds .
That man was put in the hospital on 2,000 - calories a day and he was losing six pounds a day at first . "
Ayoob said the first question he often asks of his obese pediatric patients is , " Where is the food coming from , " because there is often an enabler .
Ayoob also insists on psychological treatment and family counseling .
" It has nutritional consequences but it 's a mental health issue , " Ayoob said .
" I could put someone on all the right foods and nutrition but then you 're just going to have a normal - weight person with an eating disorder .
You work together with a counselor . "
Gray 's lawyer declined to give details about what kind of therapy Alexander and his mother were offered by the court .
At the moment , he said , Gray cannot afford health insurance , but Alexander does have health care .
" She basically is on a very limited income and there were often appointments she could not make it to , " said Varner , who mentioned a difficulty paying for gas money .
Varner said a local bond agency , Trotter Bail Bonds , volunteered to pay Gray 's $ 50,000 bond .

Americans , and others who have followed the path of individual desire to democracy , consumerism and the nanny state , have no idea why they are loathed .
They assume it ’s from bad results of our interference in other nations .
I ’d suggest it ’s from the reasons we interfere .
Because our society is based in the revolutions of 1789 and 1968 , we a dichotomy between “ free ” and “ not - free ” with no shades of gray .
In other words , either you ’re on board with our agenda — path of individual desire , democracy , consumerism , egalitarianism — or you ’re the new Hitler , Stalin and Pol Pot , rolled into one .
We must have our moral superiority .
This goes back to our own Revolution .
The English were bad because they taxed us did n’t allow us to do whatever screwy stuff we wanted to , and they also taxed us , which made us mad .
Ever since then , the pattern repeats .
The Confederacy owned slaves .
Nazi Germany tortured Jews .
The North Vietnamese killed civilians .
Saddam Hussein gassed Kurds .
Kim Jong
- Il feeds his citizens dead baby birds and makes them watch patriotic movies .
Whatever it is , they ’re not - free , but we ’re free , so we have the moral right to do whatever we want to them .
This is why the world dislikes us : we ca n’t stop judging them by our standards , which may be a little off , if you look closely enough .
Even more , it seems as if we ’re trying to draw them into our system of civilization — even with its vast problems — so that they cannot have a competing style of government that might prove better .
If this modernity thing is going to kill us , we want everyone else to go down , too , or someone got ahead and — and that ’s unfair !
Exhibit A :
The Iranian government has accused the U.S. and Britain of interfering in its election .
Both countries have government - funded broadcasters that offer Persian - language reports .
BBC Persian launched television programming in January to supplement its longtime radio and Internet services .
The TV service quickly developed a following in Iran Afagh said Thursday that the service had found a new satellite that would not be vulnerable to jamming from within Iran .
VOA ’s Persian News Network offers eight hours of Persian programming daily .
Like BBC Persian , it has been inundated with images and messages from Iranian civilians .
The Iranian government has intermittently jammed Persian News Network ’s broadcasts , often by using microwave trucks to disrupt signals .
In anticipation of that , the network sought additional satellite paths for its broadcasts before the election .
LA Times
So let me get this straight :
Both the US and UK fund media that broadcasts into Iran in the style of our own media .
Iran has been jamming these stations , and we ’re counteracting the jamming .
These stations do n’t consider what they ’re doing to be wrong because , hey , it ’s how we do things back home
That ’s the very archetype of cultural clash : we ’re assuming they ’re just like us , and they want to do things their own way .
Now look at our unbiased coverage :
Iran ’s ambassador to London was summoned to the Foreign Office this morning after the country ’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , singled out Britain as Iran ’s foremost enemy .
“ The outstanding diplomats of some western countries who have talked to us with diplomatic courtesy up to now , have , during the past few days , taken the masquerade away from their faces and are showing their true image .
“ They are showing their true enmity towards the Iranian Islamic state and the most evil of them is the British government . ”
Brown intensified his criticism of Iran ’s handling of the election dispute today .
“ We are with others , including the whole of the European Union unanimously today , in condemning the use of violence , in condemning media suppression , ” he told a news conference after a European Union summit in Brussels .
“ It is for Iran now to show the world that the elections have been fair â€¦ that the repression and the brutality that we have seen in these last few days is not something that is going to be repeated , ” he said .
The Guardian
This is classic passive - aggression .
We accuse them of doing things all wrong , according to our standards .
Then when they point out we ’re attacking them , we take cover under the mantle of moral superiority and call them the aggressor .
But they ’re not the ones broadcasting propaganda past our jamming .
They ’re not the ones telling us that our government is wrong .
They ’re the ones trying to , within their country , settle their own issues .
And we wo n’t let them because like neurotic aunts playing matchmaker , we have to assume we know better — presumably because we are sealed off from reality in a world of ourselves .
Nearly half of teachers believe the health and safety culture in schools is damaging children ’s learning and development , a survey suggests .
When questioned by Teachers TV , teachers complained about a five - page briefing on using glue sticks and being told to wear goggles to put up posters .
Others said pupils were not allowed to enjoy the sun or snow without taking health and safety precautions .
BBC
What kind of a neurotic place is this — stay out of the sun ?
Do n’t play because someone might get hurt ?
While on the surface we ’re lands of plenty and freedom , an insightful observer might see big problems beneath the surface , starting with an inability to accept personal mortality .
Let ’s look at signs of difficulties :
Our country is irreconcilably divided between left and right .
At least one in 15 citizens is depressed .
At least one in 16 citizens is alcoholic .
Suicide is the 11th leading cause of death .
Our cities are ugly , covered in advertising , full of businesses that pander to fools .
We ca n’t decide whether climate change is for real or not , and we ca n’t act either way .
Up to a quarter of our children are sexually abused
We have plenty of crime , graft and incompetence .
Our sense of social isolation is widespread
We often lump our smart people in with our dumb ones , resulting in the smart people being bored and alienated
Does this sound like a society few problems ?
No society is perfect — but this sounds like a society that by avoiding conflict , has deferred its problems and made them more potent , more internal .
Iran might not want to follow us down that path , but our mindset prevents us from seeing how our way is not the only way .
Our moral justification gives us a shield of good intentions to hide behind , but at the end of the day , it ’s just an advanced case of confirmation bias , the Dunning - Kruger effect and competitive altruism .
In the meantime , Iran fits a standard pattern dating to before WWII .
When we find someone obstructing our interests , we round of millions of useful idiots to begin clamoring for “ freedom , ” and use that to passive - aggressively unseat the regime .
All while we are increasingly banning our own freedoms here in the West , and might be better off with a goal of “ an organized , thoughtful society ” instead of the nebulous “ freedom . ”
Update : Counterpunch.org asks the question “ Are the Iranian Protests Another US Orchestrated ‘ Color Revolution ’ ? ” :
The claim is made that Ahmadinejad stole the election , because the outcome was declared too soon after the polls closed for all the votes to have been counted .
However , Mousavi declared his victory several hours before the polls closed .
This is classic CIA destabilization designed to discredit a contrary outcome .
It forces an early declaration of the vote .
The longer the time interval between the preemptive declaration of victory and the release of the vote tally , the longer Mousavi has to create the impression that the authorities are using the time to fix the vote .
There is a power struggle among the ayatollahs .
Many are aligned against Ahmadinejad because he accuses them of corruption , thus playing to the Iranian countryside where Iranians believe the ayatollahs ’ lifestyles indicate an excess of power and money .
In my opinion , Ahmadinejad ’s attack on the ayatollahs is opportunistic .
However , it does make it odd for his American detractors to say he is a conservative reactionary lined up with the ayatollahs .
Commentators are “ explaining ” the Iran elections based on their own illusions , delusions , emotions , and vested interests .
Whether or not the poll results predicting Ahmadinejad ’s win are sound , there is , so far , no evidence beyond surmise that the election was stolen .
However , there are credible reports that the CIA has been working for two years to destabilize the Iranian government .
Counterpunch.org
Roberts does n’t really go for the kill , which is to point out how Western media interests are dependent on government for access to information , and thus are easily induced to attack an enemy with the usual diatribe about “ rights and freedoms , ” and how all of these attacks mimic our WWII / Cold War propaganda where it ’s the Free World versus the evil , personally corrupt , authoritarian Hitler / Stalin figure .
Notice how little time it took them to tie Slobodan Milosevic to ethnic cleansing , and how they also tied Saddam Hussein to not only gassing ethnic minorities ( an abuse of the Holocaust memory , if you ask me ) but also to dictatorial ambitions .
They did the same thing to Muammar Qaddafi , a sensible man who wrote a lengthy treatise on environmentalism 20 years before the West even cared , and now they ’re doing it to Iran .

The heart of the intelligence business is the an illegal enterprise : the surreptitious theft of state secrets from other nations .
The surreptitious part of the equation is crucial since it provides unexpected knowledge .
This endeavor also requires air - tight secrecy because the usefulness of the intelligence derived from this data depends on the other side not realizing that it is missing or compromised .
Once an adversary realizes that a particular secret is known , it can take effective action to diminish its value .
For example , if a nation finds out that one of its diplomatic codes has been broken , it can either change the code or use it as a channel to transmit messages it wants its adversary to read .
To maintain their flow of unexpected secrets , intelligence service have a double job .
First , they must steal secrets of value , which is the easy part .
Second , they must conceal all traces of the theft for as long as they want the information to remain valuable .
To meet this latter requisite , espionage agents are instructed to photocopy documents in place rather than tampering with them or removing them ; and , in situations where this is not possible , intelligence services employ technical staffs of experts to obliterate any clues that the documents gave been tampered with , or temporarily removed to be copied .
The security problem does not end , however , with hiding the original theft .
Intelligence services must protect the secret that they have stolen valuable information , such as a code , even after it is put to use -- so it can be of future use .
This final task of intelligence often requires the creation of a set of alternative false , through plausible sources , to prevent the adversary from figuring out from the use of the intelligence what -- or who -- could possibly have compromised or supplied it .
The protection of sources and methods involves not only keeping a secret but also fabricating " red herrings " to divert , confuse and overload enemy investigations with extraneous and false information .
When British intelligence learned of German military operations in the second world war through its intercepts of coded signals , it protected the secret by creating fictional human agents who could be plausibly assigned the credit for the coup .
In the same manner , human sources are often hidden by behind a screen of fictional scientific devices .
This necessary practice of intelligence services protecting truths with bodyguards of lies or red herrings has also resulted in the systematic pollution of public knowledge about espionage through deliberately - planted fictions .
Intelligence services employ entire covert actions staffs to muddy the waters around important cases by leaking selected bits of information .
For example , the " story " of Oleg Penkovskiy , a Soviet GRU officer in contact with British intelligence in the mid 1950s and then again in the early 1960s , has been put out in different versions by three intelligence services -- the CIA , the KGB and the British .
The CIA indeed fabricated a diary for him which became a best - selling book in the United States .
Although both CIA and British counterintelligence had grave suspicions about the information Penkovskiy supplied , especially during his latter career , the CIA 's public version gave him credit for events to which he had no connection .
While such sprinklings of untruths into the historic record may be justifiable from the point of view of protecting sources and methods , and therefore vital to the integrity of the intelligence organization , the distortions that they produce may it virtually impossible for outsiders to understand the intelligence business ( which may not be entirely unintentional ) .
Indeed , even in the United States , except for the rare glimpses provided by Congressional hearings , such as those of the Church Committee , the public perception of the secret world of intelligence has always been closely controlled by the intelligence services themselves either through contract employees who write books they submit for review or defectors , under contract to the CIA , FBI or DIA , who , after being briefed , contact journalists or Congressional staffs .
This was the situation up until November 1979 when Iranian students seized an entire archive of CIA and State Department documents , which represented one of the most extensive losses of secret data in the history of any modern intelligence service .
Even though many of these documents were shredded into thin strips before the Embassy , and CIA base , was surrendered , the Iranians managed to piece them back together .
They were then published in 1982 in 54 volumes under the title " Documents From the U.S. Espionage Den " , and are sold in the United States for $ 246.50 .
As the Teheran Embassy evidently served as a regional base for the CIA ,
The scope of this captures intelligence goes well beyond intelligence reports on Iran alone .
They cover the Soviet Union , Turkey , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and Iraq .
There are also secret analysis of arcane subjects ranging from the effectiveness of Israeli intelligence to Soviet oil production .
Presumably , these thousands of documents , which include cryptnyms and routing instructions from and to concerned agencies of the United States government , have been extensively analyzed by the KGB and other intelligence service interested in the sources and methods used by the CIA .
The most revealing documents are the CIA 's own internal directives that span a twenty year period .
When these are read in chronological order , they trace a remarkable conceptual changes in the way the CIA conceived of its job -- and enemy .
It indeed casts an entirely new light on the bitter battles that tore the CIA apart in the mid-1970s , and it explains some of its more recent failures to properly evaluate intelligence defectors .
The watershed year was 1973 -- just after the retirement of Richard Helms .
That year there was an 180 degree switch in the crucial policy concerning the recruitment of Soviet Bloc officials , called appropriately RED TOPS .
At issue , was the way that these RED TOPS , primarily Communist diplomats , intelligence officers , or military attaches stationed abroad , were to be treated if they " walked in " , and surreptitiously approached American officials and offered either to defect or to remain in place and supply U.S. intelligence with Soviet secrets .
Would they assumed to be sincere defectors , and enrolled in American espionage ?
Or would they be suspected of being KGB disinformation agents , and held in limbo ?
This conceptual determination is central to the spy business .
Up until 1973 , the CIA had assumed that Soviet intelligence services commonly used " provocations " as a technique to test and manipulating its opponents in the intelligence game .
As bait in these provocations , the KGB would order Soviet embassy officials to make contact with U.S. officials and feign disloyalty .
In fact , over the years , the CIA had found that a large number of RED TOP officials who contacted the CIA , ostensibly to defect , turned out to be under the control of the KGB ; and used to confuse American intelligence with disinformation , lead it on a wild goose chase , expose its sources or methods , or simply embarrass it by contriving an incident .
As early as 1959 , to guard against KGB - controlled provocateurs , the CIA had insisted that the bona fides of a RED TOP walk - in be established through a counterintelligence investigation before he is treated as a source of intelligence .
This procedure was explicitly defined in " Director of Central Intelligence Directive 4/2 " , signed by Allan Dulles .
It states :
The establishment of bona fides of disaffected persons will be given particular attention because of the demonstrated use of defector channels by hostile services to penetrate or convey false or deceptive information to U.S. Intelligence services .
( Volume 53 , p.8 )
The responsibility for making this determination of " bona fides " had been assigned to the chief of the counterintelligence staff , James Angleton , and it obviously gave him great power over the recruitment of REDTOPS .
It also led to considerable rivalries within the CIA , and especially with the Soviet Russia Division , which wanted to control its own recruitments among Soviet officials .
In 1973 , William E. Colby , the son of a Jesuit missionary , whose main experience in the CIA had been in paramilitary and political activities , became first the comptroller , then Director , of Central Intelligence .
It was the beginning of a revolution .
As he explains in his autobiography , he rejected the complicated view of KGB strategic deception .
Instead of worry about such enemy tricks , he saw the job of the CIA as a straight forward one of gathering intelligence for the President .
And , to accomplish this , he believed " walk in " defectors should be encouraged and given the benefit of the doubt , rather than suspected .
He complained that in the past the CIA " spent an inordinate amount of time worried about false defectors and false agents . "
What now emerges from the Teheran archive was how far Colby went in abruptly revising this doctrine on REDTOPS .
A top secret order , entitled " Turning Around REDTOP walk ins " , which went out to all CIA stations in 1973 , advised : Analysis of REDTOP walk - ins in recent years clearly indicates that REDTOP services have not been seriously using sophisticated and serious walk - ins as a provocation technique .
However , fear of provocations has been more responsible for bad handling than any other cause .
We have concluded that we do ourselves a disservice if we shy away from promising cases because of fear of provocation ... We are confident that we are capable of determining whether or not a producing agent is supplying bona fide information .
( Volume 53 , p.32 ) Instead of holding in abeyance REDTOPS until their bona fides could be established , this new doctrine gave case officers in the Soviet Bloc Divisions carte blanc to recruit " producing agents " on the assumption that their worth would be established after the fact by the quantity and quality of information they furnished .
This new order changed the entire philosophy of the CIA in a single swoop .
By effectively eliminating the prior task of establishing bona fides , it undermined Angleton 's position in the CIA , and made superfluous his counterintelligence staff .
In light of this change , it is not surprising that Angleton , after bitterly fighting this new policy , which contradicted the empirical findings of the past 20 years , was forced out .
Although Angleton was fired in December 1974 , after Colby first planted a Pulitzer Prize news leak with the NY Times , the full dimensions of this power struggle only became known through the documents in the Teheran archive .

Give Ritalin to healthy people to boost their brain power , says medical expert
Healthy people should be allowed to take Ritalin to boost their brain power , a medical expert has argued .
Professor John Harris said it was unethical to stop the controversial drug being used for this purpose - as students have been known to at exam time .
He said that Ritalin , which is prescribed for hyperactivity in the young , is safe and offers ' significant advantages ' to the healthy .
Mainstream ?
Professor John Harris believes healthy people should be allowed to take Ritalin to enhance mental performance
It is known to boost academic performance , focus and concentration .
Professor Harris , bioethics professor at the University of Manchester , writes in an article today on bmj.com that ' it is not rational to be against human enhancement ' .
He said : ' Humans are creatures that result from an enhancement process called evolution and moreover are inveterate self - improvers in every conceivable way .
' Many healthy students are thought to use Ritalin and other chemical cognitive enhancers to improve academic performance .
The arguments against their being permitted to do so have not been persuasive . '
The drug is routinely used on the Health Service to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder .
Around 400,000 British children aged five to 19 years with ADHD are believed to be on drugs including Ritalin .
Professor Harris said it had been deemed ' safe enough ' to give to young people .
His comments were part of a debate in the journal .
He was opposed by Professor Anjan Chatterjee from the University of Pennsylvania , who argued there are too many risks in taking Ritalin unless people are actually ill .
He said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration labelled it with the most alarming of warnings because of its high potential for abuse , dependence , risk of sudden death and serious adverse effects on the heart .
If it became widely available , he questioned whether pupils would take Ritalin in ' epidemic proportions ' .
There was the danger that pilots , police officers and on - call doctors would be pressured into taking the drug to perform better in their jobs .
He also mentioned possible cognitive trade - offs involved in taking Ritalin , such as a loss in creativity .
He said : ' Being smarter does not mean wiser .
The fact that very smart people generating complicated models to distribute financial risk contributed to the current global economic crisis should at least give us pause . '
How to describe Teletext to the Twitter generation ?
Imagine a clunky internet with an insufferably slow dialup connection , only less interactive and with a strictly limited amount of content .
Except in many regards , Teletext ( like its ITV predecessor Oracle and the BBC 's equivalent , Ceefax ) was way ahead of its time .
Up - to - the minute news and weather , real - time scoreboards from football , cricket and snooker , cheap last - minute holidays and on Channel 4's text service , 4 - Tel , something called Debbie 's Diary , the daily diary of a nobody which had me and my fellow students completely addicted .
It was a bit like Bellede Jour but without the sauce .
What 's not to like ?
Well , quite a lot , actually .
If it was like the web , then it was the web played out on a Sinclair ZX81 ( do n't ask me to explain one of those as well ) .
Part of the unique experience of Teletext was waiting for the next page , and boy could they take a long time to load .
The urge to change channels was overwhelming , only occasionally abated by the option of merging the text with your television picture .
Back when I was watching Oracle during the long school summer holidays in the early 1980s , this had the advantage of enabling you to watch the Sullivans at the same time on ITV , but the disadvantage of rendering most of the text illegible .
Press the wrong button and you had to start all over again .
Gah !
Every now and again , waiting to find out the local cinema times ( when is Superman II showing at the ABC Sidcup ? ) it felt like it would have been quicker to go to the shops and buy a local newspaper instead .

Thank you .
As Intelligent Design thrusts ahead with startling evidence we put together the current requirements toin science class .
This is in no way meant to be a definitive guide but will positively expand science education in our schools and leave sufficient time for , say , a short daily prayer session in the average school 's week .
One whole half - hour period per term should be set aside to discuss the merits of bananas , the amazing fact that there are still monkeys and that watches do n't breed quite like they should do .
Critics have argued that this will leave little time for mundane subjects such a the 3 R's or history , but fail to appreciate the massive increase in religious revenue ( the industry for the new millennium ) .
INTELLIGENT DESIGNERS IN BRIEF : We at the Creation Indoctrination Institute and the Campaign for Understanding Natural Truth in Science invite further additions and comments to Thank you .
H3LL , I love this .
In my opinion , you are a Superstar !
All of these various cultures , religions , belief systems , wow , you did a great job .
How did it all get started ?
The Big Bang ?
Even the brightest minds can only guess about all this , right ?
I still can't get anyone from the " non-intelligence " , mechanistic / materialistic evolution side of the argument to give me a reasonable explanation for their belief that such things as DNA did n't require any intelligent direction ?
I do n't care about all the organized religions , government education policies , etc .
I 'm not even asking anyone to classify this directing form of intelligence as God .
Just tell me why ORDER does n't require intelligent direction .
The reason people use the example of a dis- assembled wrist watch reassembling itself , without intelligent direction is because it points out the insanity of the evolution without intelligent direction argument .
I bless you with love and joy .

A metre-long section of the fossil shows the size of the hadrosaur 's scales
A remarkably well - preserved fossil of a dinosaur has been analysed by scientists writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
They describe how the fossil 's soft tissues were spared from decay by fine sediments that formed a mineral cast .
Tests have shown that the fossil still holds cell - like structures - but their constituent proteins have decayed .
The team says the cellular structure of the dinosaur 's skin was similar to that of dinosaurs ' modern - day descendants .
A member of the duck - billed hadrosaur family , the fossil was found in North Dakota in the US and has been nicknamed " Dakota " .
Phil Manning of the University of Manchester and his collaborators have been employing a number of techniques to tease out as much information as they can from the fossil .
' Clean science '
They believe that the dinosaur fell into a watery grave , with little oxygen present to speed along the decay process .
Meanwhile , very fine sediments reacted with the soft tissues of the animal , forming a kind of cement .
You slice through this and you 're looking at the cell structure of dinosaur skin .
That is absolutely gobsmacking
Phil Manning
University of Manchester
As a result , the 66 million - year - old fossil still retains some of the organic matter of the original dinosaur , mixed in with the minerals .
The team found that although the proteins that made up the hadrosaur 's skin had degraded , the amino acid building blocks that once made up the proteins were still present .
" We 're looking at the altered products of proteins from the skin of this animal , locked within the three dimensional mineralised skin , " Dr Manning told BBC News .
" You 're looking at cell - like structures ; you slice through this and you 're looking at the cell structure of dinosaur skin .
That is absolutely gobsmacking . "
A study of the cell structures show that , like modern - day crocodiles and birds , the skin was made up of two layers : a surface epidermis against a deeper dermis layer made up of dense connective tissue .
Although that finding is what might have been expected based on the presumed lineage of the modern animals , Dr Manning said it is " clean science " .
" If you 've got a hypothesis and you can't test it , it remains a hypothesis .
Now we 've had an exceptionally preserved dinosaur which has allowed us to ask that question and answer it for the first time , " he said .
Microprobe studies showed tendon structure , preserved with silicon Studies of the skin from across the fossil show that the skin was thinner toward the flanks , between the tail and the hips , where other hadrosaur fossils have shown bite marks .
Dr Manning said that region may have been the dinosaur 's " Achilles heel " .
" If you understand the distribution of these structures in the skin of a prey animal , you can understand something about predator - prey interactions , and it might explain some of the hadrosaur fossils we see with these bite marks , " he said .
Derek Briggs , a palaeontologist at Yale University and an expert in exceptionally preserved fossils , praised the work , saying that the important step was elucidating the mechanism by which such fossils could be preserved .
" One ca n't be certain , but I suspect that in many cases these kinds of skin impressions have gone unnoticed and people have gone after the skeleton , which is of course what you 'd expect to be preserved , " he told BBC News .
" This kind of discovery just demonstrates very clearly that soft tissue does survive , that the processes involved are unusual but not absolutely extraordinary - so there 's no reason why this kind of material wo n't be discovered again . "
Dr Manning said that studies on Dakota were continuing apace on a fossil he described as a pleasure to work with .
" Whereas most of us have to deal with disjointed sentences and occasional fractured words to reconstruct the volumes of the fossil record , you 've got a whole chapter lying there and you can flick through the pages at your leisure , " he said .

The Republican Party issued a new salvo in the health debate Monday with a " seniors ' health care bill of rights " that opposed any moves to trim Medicare spending or limit end - of - life care to seniors .
Intended as a political shot at President Barack Obama , the Republican National Committee manifesto marks a remarkable turnaround for a party that had once fought to trim the health program for the elderly and disabled , which last year cost taxpayers over $ 330 billion .

BEIJING  China , which executes more people than any other country , says it will show more leniency to those given death sentences , state media reported Wednesday .
In a series of interviews , the vice president of the Supreme People ’s Court said that China was not ready to abolish capital punishment but that the penalty should be reserved for a small number of serious crimes , particularly those that threaten social stability .
More than 60 crimes can draw the death penalty in China , including tax evasion , embezzlement and drug trafficking , but the government does not release figures on the number of executions , many of which take place immediately after trials that legal experts say are unfair and lack transparency .
“ Judicial departments should use the least number of death sentences as possible , and death penalties should not be given to those having a reason for not being executed , ” Zhang Jun , the court ’s vice president , was quoted as saying in the newspaper China Daily .
Welcome to Luffa.info .
Here is information , photos and video about the amazing Luffa sponge gourd .
What is a Loofah
A loofah is a fibrous plant seed pod .
The luffa plant is a cucurbit , a group of plants including gourds , pumpkins , and cucumbers .
It grows as a flowering annual vine .
The pollinated flowers grow cylindrical green fruits that eventually develop into a seed pod filled with many intertwined cellulose fibers .
The outer skin is removed to reveal the " loofah " inside .
Sea sponges are members of the animal kingdom .
They grow on the sea floor and filter food out of the water .
The word sponge is often used to describe loofah and man made " sponges " with absorbent properties like sea sponges .
Luffa sponge gourds have many names , both common and scientific .
They are known as loofah , smooth loofah , loofah sponge , loofa , luffa , loufa , loufah , luffah , sponge gourd , Chinese okra , elephant okra , dishrag gourd , towel gourd , and other common names in many different languages .
The scientific name for the plant I grow is Luffa aegyptiaca .
It may also be known as Luffa cylindrica .
There are other cultivated fiber - producing species within the Luffa genus including Luffa acutangula and Luffa operculata .
Angled luffa or ridged luffa are common names for acutangula .
Luffa operculata is known as the ball luffa or sponge cucumber .
Humans have propagated these cultivated plants across the tropical to temperate regions of the earth .
Luffa fiber is a green renewable resource with many uses .
I have been growing and enjoying natural homegrown luffa fiber since the 1990s here in Carter County Tennessee .
I switched to organic growing methods in the 21st century .
Uses for Luffa / Loofah Sponges
When fully matured the fruits become a tough mass of fiber that makes a great scrubbing sponge .
These natural cellulose fiber wonders of the vegetable world have many uses .
They can exfoliate loose cells from your skin and make you squeaky clean or shine up your dirty dishes .
Loofahs are most excellent in the bath or shower .
The exfoliating action leaves your skin feeling the cleanest and tightest it could possibly be .
Scrubbing your back with a luffa sponge in the bath or shower is an incredibly pleasurable experience .
Soap and luffa fibers are a natural cleaning combination resulting in wonderful loofah soap .
Home and professional artisan craft soap makers include slices of luffa fiber in their creations to add an extra cleaning boost to their soaps .
A loofah section can be placed in a cylindrical mold , filled with soap , cured , and sliced .
Shredded or powdered luffa fibers can also be mixed into a soap base before pouring into a mold .
Luffa sponges are great for washing items like large pots and other containers .
I use them for cleaning almost everything , including cars , boats , plastic buckets , and anything that needs scrubbed but can't withstand steel wool .
Non stick cookware is one example .
A large loofah or a smaller piece on a handle or rope makes a great back scratcher .
They can be cut into many shapes for scrubbing pads , padding , and other craft uses .
The loofahs can be cut lengthwise with the core removed to make sheets of sponge material .
These sheets of luffa material can be sewn into items like table hot pads , sandals , bath mats , hats , or anything else you can imagine .
A piece of loofah can be used to apply paint for artistic effect .
It can also impart texture to painted walls or plaster .
Place the long side into a paint pan with paint barely covering the bottom .
Rub excess paint off the loofah on newspaper or cardboard .
The best effect is achieved with the smallest amount of paint .
Too much and it looks like a blob .
Simply push on to the surface and lift straight off .
The final result may resemble a wallpaper pattern .
Luffa fiber is a green alternative to rock wool as a root medium in hydroponic plant growing systems .
It is environmentally friendly and may be produced on site by the grower .
The fibers work well to maintain proper moisture levels for seedling growth .
It 's another amazing luffa application that someone told me about .
The luffa buds , flowers , and soft young fruits are cooked and eaten like squash or okra .
I sometimes eat small luffa fruits when in season but disclaim any legal responsibility for any bad reactions anyone might have from consuming luffa .
Eat at your own risk .
Those with sensitivities to certain foods should proceed with caution .
Unknown allergy potential .
That said , millions of people around the world eat parts of the plant .
Luffa has been an important food source in many cultures .
The tough fibrous vines are not edible , but leaves and roots may be eaten by some people depending how bitter they are .
Sap in the luffa vines and leaves contains a bitter compound with a musky smell that seems to repel insects and animals .
It can have a bitterness similar to that sometimes found in cucumbers , a close plant relative also in the Cucurbitaceae family .
The edible size fruits taste something like a cross between a zucchini and a cucumber .
Some luffa varieties may produce fruits that are too bitter to eat .
Peeling the skin off reduces bitterness but is not usually necessary .
If it tastes bad , do n't eat it .
The many varieties we 've grown have all tasted good to us , with some being better than others .
Many commonly cultivated varieties are edible .
Luffa of several different species are consumed by people around the world , especially in Asia and Africa .
Edible luffa can sometimes be found in markets with Asian style vegetables .
I like them sliced in a stir - fry or just sauteed in a little olive oil .
Seasoning with a dash of soy sauce and cayenne pepper makes a tasty appetizer .
The big yellow flowers have a crunchy green flavor similar to celery or cucumber .
Luffa flowers make a colorful and unique salad .
Luffa , like many plants , contains a variety of substances .
Parts of the plant and seeds have been used for the medicinal properties .
Powdered luffa fibers have been an ingredient in traditional Chinese herbal medicine .
One Egyptian study found the seeds of luffa reduced blood glucose levels in animals .
More medicinal references can be found on the links page .
Large whole loofahs are a conversation starter .
People tend to find them very interesting and useful .
Some of the loofah sponges end up as gifts for family and friends .
I sell the rest to an artisan soap maker .
If you are looking for loofahs or seeds you can find them at the sources I have listed on the luffa sources page .
Care and Maintenance of Luffa Sponges
New unused luffa fiber can be stored for years if it is kept dry .
It needs to be covered where dust wo n't settle on the surface .
Working luffa sponges will last a surprisingly long time if they are allowed to dry between uses , usually a few months .
When they stay wet all the time they tend to deteriorate more .
Hanging on a hook or placing on end may help your loofah to dry .
A luffa sponge can hold some dirt and should not be used for different purposes .
If you scrub your cooking grill with it , then do n't use it on your skin .
It is probably difficult to fully sterilize a loofah .
Enough heat applied long enough would do it but might damage the luffa fibers .
A short soak in a mild bleach solution gets close , certainly killing off a vast majority of surface germs .
A wash with antibacterial hand soap should quickly remove many germs too .
The acidity of vinegar can clean out a lot of bacteria in a loofah .
Sunlight can help keep your loofah in top shape by drying it faster and irradiating the surface with natural ultraviolet light .
The drying UV rays will make it harder for germs , mold , or mildew to grow .
Some commercial luffa sponges are a light color from being bleached .
Natural mature sponges can be any shade of dark brown to bright white in color .
Most loofahs are fine in their natural state without any bleaching .
If you want to lighten luffa fibers , they can be soaked in a weak chlorine bleach solution for about an hour or so .
Some commercial growers may also use a hydrogen peroxide or caustic solution .
Bleaching them for too long can weaken the fibers .
Bleached sponges may look better for commerce .
They are cleaner and less likely to contain insects or other organic matter .
Green and / or dark stained luffa can benefit from bleaching .
Exposure to sunlight can also lighten the color but not as dramatically as bleach .
Leaving them in the sun for a day gives the loofah a rougher slightly scratchier feel .
Leaving a loofah outside for longer periods will tend to break down the fibers .
Luffa Varieties
Some garden varieties of luffa are coarser , less dense , and more flexible than the thicker pieces of commercial loofah .
They are typically hardy fast growing types that give the average gardener a better chance at success than the high fiber ones .
The commercial loofah is grown for consistent size and fiber density .
Most are grown in a hot climate and have the benefit of a long growing season .
Denser loofah is better for uses that require strength and durability .
A less dense loofah is often flexible and more easily molded into things like luffa soap .
Any loofah can be made more flexible by getting it wet .
The thickness and number of the individual fibers can vary greatly among loofahs .
A hard or soft sponge can have thin or thick fibers .
Usually the more fiber , the stiffer the loofah , but finer fibers can result in more flexibility .
There are also varieties that are grown primarily for eating and these may produce less fiber .
Luffa can cross pollinate with nearby vines so it might be difficult to grow different varieties together .
Whatever characteristics the luffa have , they can be altered somewhat by careful selection of the seeds .
The plants have a lot of natural variability among different plants grown from the same seeds and even between luffa pods grown on the same vine .
One vine could grow several different sizes and shapes .
I started with a typical garden variety and kept saving the best seeds .
Over time , the quality and quantity of the sponges improved .
I saved seeds from the earliest large sponges with good fiber .
After a few seasons , they were arriving sooner and larger .
I tried growing seeds from many sources and did find some thicker fiber that would still reach maturity in this climate .
Generally the higher the density of the fiber , the longer it takes to reach maturity .
Luffa pods can grow arrow straight , slightly curved , or very curved .
One luffa variety grows very short and wide sponges .
These are typically used for pot scrubbers .
Another type , grown more often for food , produces extremely thin long fruits .
Seeds from straight ones tend to grow more straight ones , but a few curved ones usually appear .
The curved ones make good back scratchers in the shower .
When small , the fruits are very flexible and will conform to whatever shape they are against .
This can result in some unusual shapes .
Loofahs can also be much wider on one or both ends , usually the bottom .
The ridged or angled luffa ( Luffa acutangula ) is a different species of luffa .
It produces a coarse fiber and is mostly used as a food crop .
It can be identified by the pronounced ridges that run along the skin lengthwise .
It tends to be thinner , bent or curved , and more elongated than the Luffa aegyptiaca .
Edible luffa found in markets is probably more often acutangula than the aegyptiaca species .
Luffa acutangula is also commonly known as Patola in the Tagalog language of the Philippines .
Luffa foetida is another scientific name for the angled luffa .
The ball luffa or sponge cucumber ( Luffa operculata ) is another cultivated species .
It is native to South America and produces rounded sponge pods with a spiky exterior skin .
The other Luffa species , including aegyptiaca and acutangula , are natives of Asia or Africa .
They have been cultivated in the Middle East since ancient times .
Growing Your Own Luffa Sponges
Growing your own loofahs is fun and rewarding .
The plants are quite vigorous once they get established .
They grow on vines that can reach 30 feet ( 9 m ) in length .
A strong supporting trellis is a must .
Chain link fence and lattice works great .
The more support points the better .
The fruits get very heavy .
Luffa can be grown as a ground vine but it must be a weedless well drained area .
The pods will tend to grow curved and deformed but may still get large .
Luffa can often survive in partial shade with some direct sunlight but grow better in full sun .
In a very hot dry climate they will need some watering as they tend to wilt if it gets too dry .
Yearly rainfall here is typically 50 inches ( 127 cm ) and the vines do n't normally need extra water after the roots have developed .
If the leaves are wilting noticeably they may need additional water .
Luffa plants grow as an annual with subtropical growth characteristics .
They need a long hot growing season .
Places like the US Gulf Coast and much of the southern US are plenty hot .
Starting the plants indoors may work for cooler climates .
I live around 36 degrees north latitude at 1700 ft ( 520 m ) altitude , USDA zone 7a .
Find your zone here .
My outdoor season is long enough to produce some mature sponges planted outside from seed but later ones are often lost to frost .
Starting them indoors and moving them outside after the last frost normally gives us a few more loofahs in the fall .
Planting directly into the ground is almost as good for my location .
One year cool weather stunted the transplanted seedlings while seeds I planted in the ground sprouted and surpassed the older plants .
Warm weather is necessary for growth .
Germination rates may be slightly lower for outside plantings .
Putting the seeds in a moist environment before planting helps increase germination rates .
There can be a lot of variability in the time needed for germination .
It could be 3 days or over 3 weeks !
Usually it is about 7 to 10 days in ideal conditions .
The drier and harder the seeds are , the longer they take to germinate .
The time it takes for luffa growth , flowering , and maturity can vary widely between plants .
It usually requires around 160 days or more , but it could be anywhere from 130 to 220 days or more .
Some of the sources on the luffa links page also have botanical and growing information .
The small seedlings grow slowly while the roots become established .
Once they begin to make a vine the increase in growth rate is phenomenal .
After 1 to 2 months of growing , the flower clusters appear .
The flowers bloom in an orderly progression as the vine lengthens .
Typically there is a larger solitary female flower on a thick stem and a thinner stem with a cluster of male flowers .
When the vines are blooming , the bright yellow flowers attract many pollen gathering creatures including butterflies , ants , and bees .
Bumblebees love luffa flowers and will travel great distances to reach them .
Ants enjoy cruising all over the vines and cause little or no harm while assisting in pollination .
Some female flowers will wilt and fall off while the pollinated ones will form a luffa seed pod .
The male flowers fall off after they bloom in sequence up the stalk .
The bright yellow flowers are quite pretty and abundant .
See the luffa photos for some examples .
When the flowers get pollinated , slender cucumber - like vegetables appear .
The fruits stay soft until the skin thickens .
Then the fiber and seeds begin to form .
The vines continue to grow and produce new fruits while the older loofah pods mature .
They can be harvested whenever they feel ready .
The earlier ones can be picked while the vine is still growing .
Typically they turn a yellow / brown color and become lighter in weight from drying out .
Mature luffa pods can be any color from green to nearly black .
Very small sponges can be mature and very large ones may not be ready .
Size and color does n't matter much .
The important thing is that they start to lose water weight .
Time to maturity varies considerably as the sponges are picked from early September to late November .
The last of the loofahs are harvested after a frost occurs and the vines quickly die off .
The more mature they are , the better the sponge fiber quality .
Some smaller ones may mature more quickly yielding a small soft sponge good for washing delicate skin .
Harvesting and Preparing Luffa Sponges
When the loofahs are ready for harvest they can be peeled .
The skin loses green color and becomes looser when mature .
The mature sponges begin to dry and lose water weight .
If the sponges have reached full growth and feel light , they will be ready to peel .
If they are green , the loofah may contain some fiber but be much harder to peel .
If it falls apart when you try to peel , it does n't have enough fiber and is not mature enough .
It is always best to peel them as soon as possible if the vine has died .
The longer the skin stays on , the darker the sponges will get .
Peeling greener luffa is difficult but can be done if needed .
Throwing the loofah at the ground is one trick .
It 's good exercise for relieving your stress too .
The bad ones will break apart , while the good ones will crack and loosen the skin .
Letting the luffa pods freeze and thaw once on the vine also makes them easier to peel .
If they have matured they are usually easy to get open .
Getting them wet or soaking in water may help the opening process but is optional .
After peeling , high water pressure from a hose sprayer can remove much of the remaining green and brown coloration .
Wash them well , squeeze out excess water , lay out to dry , rotate occasionally as the water settles in the lower side .
Placing them outside in the sun and wind dries them quickly .
The sun also tends to lighten the color .
Hanging or placing the loofahs on a screen works well for drying too .
If they are stained , a soak in some bleach and water will lighten them considerably .
A wet harvest season tends to cause more decay and brown spots in the sponges .
One year an unusually dry fall yielded loofahs that were very light in color , an almost fluorescent white , while late wet weather sponges can be very dark .
Getting all the seeds out can be a challenge , but the drier the sponges are , the easier the seeds will fall out .
Save the best ones for next year .
You can also cut open the sponges in any shape you want to remove seeds or make a loofah fiber mat
Seeds should be allowed to dry enough so they wo n't rot or mold and then stored in a cool place .
Refrigerate or freeze in a sealed airtight container for long term storage .
We 've had reports of seeds as old as ten years still germinating .
If the seeds are allowed to get too hot and dry they become hard .
Some hard seeds can still germinate but may take a month to sprout .

Sarychev Peak on Matua Island is one of the most active volcanoes in the Kuril Island chain , northeast of Japan .
Astronauts took this photo of an eruption on June 12 .
The plume appears to be a combination of brown ash and white steam .
The vigorously rising plume gives the steam a bubble - like appearance ; the surrounding atmosphere has been shoved up by the shock wave of the eruption .
An amazing new picture from space reveals a volcanic eruption in its earliest stage , with a huge plume of ash and steam billowing skyward and creating a shock wave in the atmosphere .
Sarychev Peak on Matua Island is one of the most active volcanoes in the Kuril Island chain , northeast of Japan .
The new photo was taken June 12 from the International Space Station .
NASA says volcano researchers are excited about the picture " because it captures several phenomena that occur during the earliest stages of an explosive volcanic eruption . "
The main plume appears to be a combination of brown ash and white steam , according to a NASA statement .
The vigorously rising plume gives the steam a bubble - like appearance
The surrounding atmosphere has been shoved up by the shock wave of the eruption , scientists said .
Volcano plumes are so chaotic that they produce lightning , as revealed in pictures for the first time earlier this year .
The smooth white cloud on top may be water condensation that resulted from rapid rising and cooling of the air mass above the ash column .
This cloud is probably a transient feature , scientists say , with the eruption plume is starting to punch through .
The cloud casts a dark shadow to the northwest of the island .
Often , winds high in the atmosphere sheer a volcano 's plume and flatten it out .
That did n't happen with this one .
The photo also shows a ground - hugging plume of light gray ash , probably a mix of hot gas and ash in what volcanologists call a pyroclastic flow , descending from the volcano summit .
Pyroclastic flows — deadly to anything or anyone in their paths — are known to be up to 600 degrees and rush across the land at 130 mph .
Commercial airline flights are being diverted away from the region to minimize the danger of engine failures from ash intake .
The last explosive eruption from Sarychev Peak was in 1989 .
If you like controversy there ’s nothing that will bring you more joy than yelling “ stem cell research ” in a mixed crowd and then sadistically sneaking out of the room .
The debate over the use of the extremely potent little cells has led to massive regulation in all realms of stem cell transplants in the United States .
That ’s why stem cell research for diabetes has been centered in Brazil , and why your dog or horse can receive the newest stem cell treatments now , while you ’re likely to have to wait years or decades .
What are these treatments promising ?
According to anecdotes , the results are amazing .
Old dogs with bad hips frolic like puppies .
Race horses with injuries come back to become world class winners .
One such racehorse , Be A Bono , won 16 out of 24 starts , earned more than 1.3 million in prize money , and was the 2004 World Champion Quarterhorse .
All after a stem cell treatment .
The success stories with dogs are equally remarkable , if a little tinted by emotion ; check out the video from Vet - Stem after the break .
Most animals that have been treated with stem cells suffer from joint ailments .
Damage to cartilage , tendons , ligaments , or arthritic inflammation top the list .
Stem cells are seen as a way to provide almost magical regenerative healing to combat these ailments .
The process is actually pretty simple .
Rather than embryonic stem cells , adult stem cells are used .
These adult stem cells are harvested in a veterinary office from fat cells in the animal , and then sent to a lab .
Processing separates out the stem cells from other cells , and a concentrated dose is sent back to the vet ( The turn around time for processing is only a day ) .
The adult cells are then injected into the animal in the area that needs regeneration .
Regulation does not necessarily stop research , but it tends to slow it down as it navigates bureaucracy .
That ’s where the helpful word “ autologous ” comes into play .
An autologous transplant is one where the donor and the patient are the same organism : like a fat transplant from your buttocks to your lips , or like the horse and dog treatments we just discussed .
Autologous transplants of stem cells in animals are not regulated by the federal government and this has led two competing companies , Vet - Stem and Vet - Cell , to specialize in providing veterinarians with stem cells for their equine and canine patients .
From the Horse ’s Mouth
The anecdotal results may be hyperbolic , but the clinical numbers are no less noteworthy .
In clinical trials by Vet - Stem , 66 horses were treated and 77 % saw marked improvement and a return to racing .
Vet - Cell ’s trials used 82 horses and had a success rate of 78 % .
Critics are quick to point out that company run experiments are a far cry from double - blind clinical trials , but both companies have treated thousands of horses and are making huge strides into the small animal market ( read here : dogs ) .
Of the 1500 veterinarians that Vet - Stem has trained to perform autologous stem cell transplants , more than 60 % specialize in small animals .
That means that most of the transplants have moved from equine athletes to canine companions .
With a price tag less than $ 3000 , the stem cell treatment is actually cheaper than many hip replacements surgeries for larger dogs ( as much as $ 10 k or so ) .
As Vet - Stem and Vet - Cell promote the efficacy of the treatment , you can expect more and more dog owners to be stepping up and demanding it for their pets .
Considering the attachment between pet and owner , it ’s an easy sell .
The harder sell would be to convince academia to validate the clinical findings … or so you would think .
But of the four U.S universities that have veterinary stem cell projects ( UC Davis , Colorado State University , U Penn , and Cornell ) all have expressed cautious optimism about the success of treatments on their test subjects .
CSU treated 15 race horses and saw 10 return to active competition .
Not quite the 78 % success rate of Vet - Cell , but still impressive .
The UC Davis Regenerative Medical Laboratory is expanding to accommodate more work in the area as well .
Which is n’t to say that anybody really knows how these autologous stem cell treatments actually work .
There ’s a large debate between scientists whether the stem cells are actively reassigning to become mature cells of different types ( bone , ligament , etc ) or whether their presence promotes healing by releasing cytokines ( cell to cell communication chemicals ) .
There ’s even argument over which kind of adult stem cells to use .
Vet - stem favors fat cells , while most of the universities favor bone marrow cells .
Fat cells are more plentiful , but perhaps less potent .
Marrow cells are more potent , but have to be cultured to provide enough for treatment .
Definitive answers to these debates may take years to resolve , but that has n’t stopped animals from being treated today .
It Really Gets My Goat
The first equine autologous procedure was performed around 1995 by Douglas Herthel DVM .
He was reporting regular success by 2001 .
Be A Bono was treated and then became a champion in 2004 .
It ’s now half way through 2009 and Vet - Stem and Vet - Cell are going strong .
They train new veterinarians every year in the procedure and they can process dozens of sample each week .
This is amazing technology , which still needs more testing , but right now is one of the more miraculous cures in veterinary medicine .
Similar treatments for humans do n’t exist yet .
So your horse or dog can benefit , but you can’t .
There ’s a lot of really great reasons why this is so .
Human test subjects are not animal test subjects , and clinical trials for humans have to be more rigorous and take longer .
Collecting and isolating adult stem cells in humans still needs more time to be perfected .
This technology is largely focused on joint ailments , which are important for humans , but not life threatening as they are for horses and dogs .
There are also a lot of stupid reasons why autologous transplants are years behind in humans , mainly bureaucracy , debate , and fear .
I ca n’t help but look at these veterinary treatments and feel disappointed and angry that similar treatments are not available for humans in the U.S. Perhaps that ’s an ignorant reaction .
Look at the progress being made in the animal trial stages for organ replacement , or even the madcap use of stem cells in other countries , however , and you get the feeling that caution in the United States is stifling our development .
Still , progress is being made .
The British parent company of Vet - Cell is starting Med - Cell , and hopes to bring the autologous treatment to humans suffering from problems in the achilles tendon .
The National Institute of Health is funding programs that will focus on bone marrow stem cell treatments for arthritis , and musculoskeletal and skin diseases .
ABC news Nightline recently did a report on the veterinary treatments that raised awareness and sparked a lively debate on stem cells once again .
Most of the controversy on stem cells seemed to stem from the use of embryonic cells .
George W. Bush banned such research in 2001 , Barack Obama opened the research again in 2009 both with great hullabaloo .
The use of embryonic stem cells , however , is just one option .
Adult stem cells are also viable for treating illnesses as autologous veterinarian joint treatments show .
As the success of stem cell treatments continue , I hope that the bureaucracy works to adapt ( or minimize ) regulation so that it can promote research while still maintaining the safety of the public .
That public is clamoring for better , faster , and cheaper treatments that stem cells could provide .
Throw us a frikin’ bone here .
INDUSTRY , Calif . —
A 40 - year - old woman has been found dead in a machine at a Southern California food processing plant that is a major supplier for McDonald ’s restaurants .
Los Angeles County sheriff ’s detectives say the woman ’s body was found early Tuesday at Golden State Foods in the City of Industry .
Investigators believe her death was accidental .
No other details were given about her death or about the woman except that she was an employee .
The Irvine - based company has distribution centers across the nation .
Its Web site says the company supplies McDonald ’s and developed the sauce for the restaurant ’s Big Mac in the 1960s .
Abstract
It is argued that a programming style based on higher order techniques --- the use of procedures that have other procedures as arguments and / or results --- can be most effectively employed if ffl it is driven by abstraction from real algorithms , rather than attempting to work with a fixed set of functional forms ; and ffl the use of imperative forms and mutative procedures is permitted ( even encouraged ! ) , rather than restricting to a purely applicative style .
A sequence of examples is presented illustrating a number of higher order techniques --- operators , iterators , accumulation , reduction , parallel reduction --- and their effective use in conjunction with mutative procedures .
The examples culminate with an interesting family of sorting algorithms , illustrating how higher order techniques can lead naturally to new algorithms .
1 Introduction
The central idea of higher order programming is the use of higher order procedures ; i.e. , procedures that take other procedures as arguments and / or r...

Kyle Sandilands and Jackie O host the breakfast radio show An Australian radio show has been pulled off air after a lie detector stunt saw a 14 - year - old girl say she had been raped .
The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Sydney 's 2Day FM was put " into recess " pending a review over the incident last week .
The move follows public outrage over the segment , which saw the girl quizzed about whether she was sexually active .
Host Kyle Sandilands has also been sacked from his role as a judge on Australian Idol over the row .
The radio show saw the girl strapped to a polygraph machine as her mother - who had volunteered to be on air - quizzed her despite apparently knowing she had been assaulted when she was 12 years old .
Sandilands was accused of further insensitivity when after the revelation he asked : " Right , and is that the only sexual experience you 've had ? "
Co-host Jackie O'Neil put an end to any further discussions when she realised the conversation had crossed a line .
Controversy Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd led the criticism against the radio show , saying : " This is a young girl and I am , as I think most Australians are , really distressed at the way in which the young person has been treated . "
Child welfare officers and police have now been ordered to investigate the teenager 's claims .
The Ten Network , which produces Australian Idol , said Sandilands had been axed as it was concerned about the conflict between his TV and radio persona .
" It has become increasingly clear that as Idol has remained a family focused show , his radio persona has taken on a more controversial position , " it said in a statement .
" The recent controversy surrounding Kyle 's radio programme has highlighted more than ever the conflicting attitude of the two careers . "
The Kyle and Jackie O Show is the highest - rating breakfast radio programme in Sydney .
A statement from 2Day FM said Sandilands was " unable to perform his on - air duties at this time " , while the station is also reviewing its audience interaction policy .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Wednesday 22 July 2009
" Light years before the internet revolution … " , the article below began .
A light year is a measure of distance , not time .
In a time Light years before the internet revolution , Teletext 's clunky , often derided , television text news service reigned supreme as the interactive experience of choice in UK households .
But time has finally caught up and the core news service will disappear from TV screens after 17 years , a victim of declining profits and the internet , although other branches will continue .
It will switch off in January , putting 70 jobs at risk .
When Teletext launched in 1993 it replaced the ITV - run Oracle , which started in 1974 and provided news , sport and weather information , as well as TV schedules .
The BBC has run a similar Ceefax service since 1974 .
" We investigated and researched every means to keep the news service going , but in the end we could n't find a viable option , " said Mike Stewart , the group managing director at Teletext .
" The continued fragmentation of television audiences and the boom in online use for news , information and commercial services have contributed to a significant reduction in Teletext 's viewing figures . "
Stewart said Teletext 's TV news and information operation had been making a loss for three years .
Revenue had fallen 50 % since 2003 .
Teletext , owned by the Daily Mail 's parent company , Daily Mail & General Trust , is available on ITV , Channel 4 , Channel Five and some Sky and Freeview channels .
DMGT said Teletext Holidays , which is broadcast on Freeview , would continue , as would the increasingly profitable Teletext web operation , which includes teletextholidays.co.uk , thisistravel.co.uk and villarenters.co.uk .
" The company will focus on these assets .
The removal of loss - making TV activities will allow investment in these businesses to accelerate , " Stewart said .
DMGT partly blamed the media regulator Ofcom for the closure of the service .
In January Ofcom said Teletext might lose its public service licence after 2014 , meaning it would have to pay for the signal carrying its text - based news service .
Teletext had previously said its public service obligation , to provide a minimum of 30 pages of national news and a minimum 12 of regional news , was " unsustainable " .
In February Teletext cut its news output , axing 16 jobs , and outsourced content to the Press Association news agency .
Teletext had revenues of £ 41 m in its last full financial year , to 28 September .
While its TV business declined 13 % , its online operation moved into profit .
A BBC spokesman said its analogue Ceefax service would be phased out as the digital switchover is completed in 2012 .
The Ceefax name will disappear after 38 years , but the digital text services will be moved to the BBC 's red button service .
The BBC has offered interactive services through the red button for 10 years .
The latest innovation will be " maestro cam " , introduced for the BBC Proms to allow viewers to get a close - up of what conductors are doing at each performance .
“ Lenin ” and “ Death ”
these words are enemies .
“ Lenin ” and “ Life ”
are comrades . . .
Lenin
lived .
Lenin
lives .
Lenin
will live .
– Vladimir Mayakovsky , 1924
Vladimir Ilich Lenin turned 139 last month making him the oldest living person on Earth .
However , Lenin does not live like his eulogizers had imagined .
When some mourners proclaimed that “ Lenin has ceased to be an individual - Lenin belongs to the millions , ” or that “ Lenin has not died .
Lenin lives .
There is not a corner in the world . . . where Lenin is absent , ” they imagined a transhistorical Lenin , whose spirit marched through time and space .
His body may have died , but his essence continued to haunt the world .
“ And when Ilich was no more , we still had Lenin , ” declared the Bolshevik jurist Peter Stuchka .
And this transfiguration of the spiritual Lenin from the corporal Ilich even defied the empirical sensitivity of the human eye .
“ This metamorphosis went on before our eyes imperceptibility , ” the jurist added .
Yet , this metaphysical Lenin met his demise years ago .
No longer does his spirit serve the “ world proletariat ” as source of inspiration or defiance .
Yet , ironically , while Lenin is dead , Ilich still lives .
Perhaps it is wrong to say that Ilich lives .
It might be more correct to say that he straddles the line between life and death .
Ilich ’s mummy state makes him undead .
He is , as the wiki definition of undead states , “ deceased yet behave [s ] as if alive . ”
Granted , Ilich does n’t wonder the streets of Moscow , attend restaurants , shits , pisses , or fucks .
He has n’t added to his oeuvre .
“ Better Fewer , But Better ” remains the last article penned by his own hand .
Ilich simply lies in state , motionless , in an eternal state of sleep .
Mummy
Ilich patiently waits for a time when science would revive him , and his two bodies , the corporal Ilich and the spiritual Lenin , would be a reunited whole .
There is , however , one way Ilich lives just like the rest of us .
Every few years he ’s given a new suit .
Or , he usually gets a new suit .
Thanks to the economic crisis , Ilich ’s attendants ca n’t afford to furnish him the threads he ’s become accustom to .
Lenin is supposed to get a new suit every three years , though his handlers admit it ’s more like every 8 - 10 years .
“ There are hardly enough funds for the preservation works , ” says Yuri Denisov - Nikolsky , deputy head of the Russian Institute for Healing and Aromatic Herbs .
“ Since 1992 , the mummy has been sponsored by charity funds alone .
And now we ’ve got this crisis . ”
There is no doubt that Ilich ’s suit costs a hefty buck .
It ’s tailor - made in Switzerland out of lustrine , a soft silky fabric that Lenin preferred when he was more mobile .
And if Ilich does rise again , he ’ll be in fashion .
His suit is a modern cut , which Pravda says “ is still popular nowadays in men ’s fashion . ”
But alas , he will remain in the suit , though recently steam cleaned and pressed , he was fitted in 2003 .
Perhaps this is a testament to capitalism ’s true universalization .
It even dogs the indefatigable , albeit undead , Lenin .
One might say that the fact Lenin does n’t acquire a new suit himself is a sign that he is indeed gone .
After all , if Lenin truly lives , could n’t he put in the order to the Swiss himself ?
Could n’t he just say , “ Bah !
Suits are for the bourgeois .
Their self worth is always wrapped in fine threads to mask their internal wretchedness and degradation .
Give me something simple .
Like a tracksuit . ”
But the truth of the matter is that if there is one constant in Lenin ’s life and Ilich ’s undeath , is that he rarely picked out his own clothes .
Someone else always did it for him .
“ [ Lenin ] was no dandy , ” writes his biographer Robert Service .
“ While wanting to remain tidy , he did not enjoy shopping for clothes ; he got others to do this for him–or rather he wore his clothes until such time as one of his relatives became sufficiently exasperated to buy a new suit or a pair of shoes for him . ”
Indeed , a read through Lenin ’s correspondence shows that his mother and sisters were always furnishing his wardrobe .
In 1896 , in letter to his sister Anna , Lenin wrote , “ You can put a few clothes in there , too - an overcoat and suit , a hat .
The waistcoat , frock coat and rug that were brought for me can be taken back . ”
Or to his mother in 1901 , “ If I have to spend the next winter in these parts [ i.e. Munich ]
I shall write for a quilted coat .
Without it you either have to wear a woolen jersey or put on two sets of underclothes ( as I do ) . ”
In another letter from 1897 , Lenin reassured his mother that he had enough winter clothes .
“ As far as my winter clothes and other things ( which you ask about ) are concerned , I have ample .
I have already bought many winter things in Minusinsk and will buy some more . ”
Lenin appeared somewhat frustrated with shopping in Minusinsk .
In the same letter he complained that there “ was practically no choice ” in the village shops .
“ It is difficult for one accustomed to city shops to find anything in them , ” he complained .
Though he made a promise to rid himself of these “ big city habits ” when it came to shopping , he still thought in “ the St. Petersburg way . ”
That is , “ you have only to go into a shop and get what you want . . . ”
Despite , his apparent love for Swiss lustrine , Lenin was never much of a flashy dresser .
A lover of hunting , he tended to wear mountain boots , sometimes with a sheepskin coat to protect him from the cold .
A 1970 photo of his clothes on display in the Lenin Museum shows that the Bolshevik leader at one time owned a bowler hat , suit jacket , and half boot shoes .
Lenin was apparently somewhat vain .
His early baldness concerned him , so much that he even asked his sister Maria if there was a way to reverse the process .
He kept his beard and remaining hair trim and neat .
According to Service , Lenin was a bit of a neat freak .
“ He hated untidiness–and he admonished family members if they failed to keep their buttons neatly sewn and their shoes repaired . ”
Lenin left his own dress in other people ’s hands .
One such person was Karl Radek .
During the journey from Switzerland to join the Revolution in Petrograd , Lenin and his entourage stopped in Stockholm to meet the city ’s mayor , Karl Lindhagen .
Also present was a reporter from the newspaper Politiken who was writing a profile on the émigré revolutionaries .
The incident would n’t have been significant , except that it was Lenin ’s first audience with an important politician , and perhaps more importantly , the first time his photograph was published in a newspaper .
Having a keen eye for the importance of image in politics , Radek recognized that Lenin could n’t present himself to the public in the shabby clothes .
Radek recalled ,
Probably it was the decent appearance of our solid Swedish comrades that was evoking in us a passionate desire for Ilich to resemble a human being .
We cajoled him at least to buy new shoes .
He was traveling in mountain boots with hug nails .
We pointed out to him that if the plan had been to ruin the pavements of the disgusting cities of bourgeois Switzerland , his conscience should prevent him from traveling with such instruments of destruction to Petrograd , where perhaps there anyway were now no pavements at all .
Radek quickly rushed Lenin to a department store and fitted him with a new suit and shoes .
Now properly dressed , as Service sardonically writes , “ he was judged appropriately dressed to lead the struggle against the Russian Provisional Government .
Lenin ’s dress markedly changed after arriving in Russia to lead the “ proletarian ” Revolution .
Gone were the worn , heavy mountain boots .
He often donned the suit purchased in Switzerland , but added the worker ’s cap to his attire .
The cap actually was n’t the one popular among the Russian working class , but rather the cover worn by turn of the century painters .
Regardless , Lenin ’s suit and cap combo became his signature .
It was a class statement that “ distinguished him from [ other politicians ] and their solemn Homburg hats . ”
The suit and cap also complimented his wild oral gesticulations .
Lenin had a habit of rocking when he spoke .
He shoved his thumbs in his waistcoat , and with his left foot forward and the right slightly back , he would bend his body back and forth as if in some Talmudic trance .
When beads of sweat tickled down his brow , he would pull out a white handkerchief to dry his shiny dome , giving an almost Pentecostal flare to his theatrics .
In his hagiography of Lenin , Lev Trotsky relayed this description from an eye witness :
[ Lenin ] got up on the platform .
He was wearing a dark , I think , a black suit , a short with a turn - down collar and a tie , and a cap on his head .
He pulled a white handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his bald head .
I do not remember what he said .
I was really paying more attention to how he was speaking .
Sometimes he kept bending down quite low from the platform , stretching his arms in front of him ; he had his handkerchief in his hand and often wiped his forehead .
He often smiled .
I was watching his face , his nose , his lips , and his small beard .
His speech was often interrupted by clapping and shouting .
And so I also shouted .
While Lenin ’s cap and rousing sermons skillfully distinguished him from the “ bourgeois ” politicians , after the Civil War , his suit distinguished him the style of ardent Bolshevik .
The latter was a lover of the leather jacket , military tunic , cap , and jackboots .
The leather jacket in particular was a sign of an “ iron Bolshevik . ”
For example , the writer V. F. Panova noted in her memoirs that beginning of the 1920s , her husband , a youth from the intellectual family , “ forged ” himself as an iron Bolshevik .
Like other young militants of his time , he spoke with a echoing base , worked at a furious pace , and his main compliment to these was a leather jacket .
The iron Bolshevik was a fashion ascetic who considered neckties symbols of the hangman ’s noose or a reminder of the slavery of a bygone “ bourgeois ” era .
Many Bolsheviks of Lenin ’s generation mocked this fetishism of the leather jacket as “ faux proletarian ” and a symbol of “ communist arrogance , ” though there are scattered photos of Lenin in such militarist dress .
Despite the ridicule from Bolshevik moralists , the style of the iron Bolshevik persisted throughout the 1920s and into the 1930s where it experienced a revival under Stalin .
In the end , Lenin ’s conservative and proper tastes contrasted with the Stalin generation , who , though not completely opposed to suits , were more comfortable in their military tunics .
When the Lenin Mausoleum opened on 1 August 1924 , mourners passed by an iron gated courtyard of flowers and bushes as they approached two guards standing with fixed bayonets at the entrance .
The tomb ’s opening was fortified with lacquered wooden beams with a huge sign that read LENIN in black letters above it .
Lenin ’s new home was decorated in somber communist regalia .
A red carpet lined the stairs to his chamber .
The walls were covered with a red and black geometric pattern .
The ceiling was painted red with a large hammer and sickle in the center .
The sarcophagus was padded with red fabric , perhaps velvet , and covered with glass .
Inside was Lenin lying peacefully with his hands crossed above his waist .
His lower extremities were covered with black and purple satin .
And what was the leader of the proletarian revolution wearing , this so - called symbol of “ Marxism in action ” as one slogan claimed ?
Lenin was not dressed in his signature Swiss made suit .
Nor did his legendary Lenin cap cover his shiny dome .
Rather , Lenin was dressed in the old Bolshevik style : a khaki military tunic with the Order of the Red Banner and the badge of the Central Executive Committee pinned to his breast .
And perhaps in an ode to Lenin ’s supposed vanity or maybe his obsession with order and cleanliness , Ilich looked as natural as could be .
As the American journalist Walter Duranty noted , “ The embalmers have even contrived to impart a smile to [ his ] face . ”
Clothes , it is said , make the man .
And though afoul to his personal tastes , Ilich would wear his khaki military tunic until the outbreak of WWII .
It was then , according to Denisov - Nikolsky , “ someone decided that the uniform symbolized Lenin ’s militant character and totalitarian policy , and he was immediately dressed in civilian clothes . ”
A new Lenin for a new era .
He has been wearing the same style ever since .
But not the same suit .
He currently awaits another one not unlike he did when he penned those letters to his mother and sisters requesting clothes .
Perhaps proves more than anything Vladimir Mayakovsky ’s verses that “ Lenin even now is more alive than the living . ”

High - speed video has revealed that the incredible variety of fantastic forms taken by fungal spores helps them catapult themselves into the air .
For hundreds of years , scientists have described the spectrum of spore shapes — a different one for each of 15,000 known varieties of fungi , an assortment so astounding as to have sprung from the mind of Willy Wonka rather than Charles Darwin .
But for all their observations , they ’ve known relatively little about why spores took those shapes .
Some mycologists suspected it was merely evolutionary noise .
But the first comparative analysis of fungal spore form and reproductive dispersal shows that shapes are no evolutionary accident .
" What people have done for 200 years is volume after volume of taxonomic work with descriptions of spore shape and size , without reference to why it ’s there .
You ’ve just got these weird and wonderful forms , but nothing about why , " said botanist Nicholas Money of Miami University in Ohio .
Money ’s team used high - speed video analysis to study spores thrown into the air by a biomechanical process as elegant as it is miniscule .
A single bead of water condenses on a spore ’s surface ; when the bead touches a film of water on another part of the spore , the bead pours into it , like raindrops merging on a windowshield .
The resulting shift in weight distribution is so sudden and massive as to hurl the entire conglomeration — called the ballistospore — airborne .
That process is part of the asexual reproduction of fungi , and the many different shapes may serve to help different species grow and reproduce in different conditions .
A single mushroom can launch 31,000 ballistospores per second , adding up to some 2.7 billion spores per day .
This process is already understood , but Money and his colleagues are among the first researchers to break it down in frame - by - frame resolution .
What made their paper special , said Money , is their description of variation in this mechanism .
They found that tiny changes in spore shape produced profound alterations in water droplet shape .
Changes in water droplet shape then affected the the trajectory of dispersed spores .
At one level , the findings are literally microscopic ; at another , they ’re universal .
" Mushrooms are masterpieces of natural engineering , " said Money , " and we are just beginning to understand how they work . "
The research , published Thursday in Public Library of Science ONE , was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health .
They are interested in using Money ’s insights to develop methods of fungal control .
That , however , will be done by others ;
Money ’s focus is purely on the magic of mushroom biomechanics .
Asked whether spore trajectories could be scaled up to thrown baseballs or other reader - friendly terms , Money replied that mushroom spores do n’t go far at all .
" If the viscous drag of air acted upon a baseball with the same intensity that it impedes the flight of a mushroom spore , you would see the pitched ball slow after an arm ’s length of motion , stop dead , and fall vertically to the ground , " he said .
" In my seminars I refer to this flight path as the Wile E. Coyote trajectory . "
This makes sense , Money said , because it ensures that spores will fall cleanly downward from the densely packed gills where they originate .
" Speaking technically , this is a **** ing beautiful mechanism , " he said .

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal , Sen. John McCain spoke about Sarah Palin .
McCain said that “ To the liberal left , particularly the feminists , she is their worst nightmare . ”
McCain was trying to compliment Palin , and he was correct Palin is their worst nightmare , because she sets the cause of women ’s rights back 100 years .
McCain said to The Wall Street Journal , “ Let ’s face it .
She galvanized our base in a way that I could n’t .
Everywhere she went she drew enormous and enthusiastic crowds like a rock star .
He says his only regret in selecting the Alaska governor was that no one on the campaign predicted the ferocity of the assaults against her .
“ To the liberal left , particularly the feminists , she is their worst nightmare . ”
It is interesting that McCain admitted that he could n’t bring the Republican Party together last year .
In large part this was due to the fact that he was n’t far enough to the right for them .
By the way , the myth of Palin ’s rock star status is greatly overblown .
As a candidate , Palin could n’t draw half the crowds that Obama was drawing on a regular basis .
Palin is nowhere near Obama ’s level in terms of campaigning .

McCain was trying to compliment Palin , but his comment brings up a point worth discussing .
Women who dislike Palin seem to have their distaste rooting in the image she projects .
Palin does n’t come off as a strong intelligent woman with leadership and ideas .
Instead , she is happy to be the empty headed eye candy of the Republican Party .
She is completely devoid of ideas and substance .
Palin ’s positions such as making women pay $ 300 - $ 1,200 for their rape kits while she was the mayor of Wasilla .
Her views on women ’s issues caused any female Hillary Clinton supporters who may have been on the fence about Obama to flock to the Democratic nominee .
Republicans may comfort themselves by thinking that Democrats are afraid of Palin , but the truth is that Sarah Palin is a great fund raising and mobilization tool for the Democrats .
Many Democrats are quietly hoping that the Republicans finish off their path of self destruction by nominating Palin in 2012 .
Palin is unelectable , and her oddball decision to quit as Alaska governor , did n’t help her cause .
No one fears Sarah Palin , but dutiful Republicans like McCain continue to sell her as a force , because their party has nothing else .
A father charged with reckless homicide for not taking his dying daughter to a doctor told police that he believed God would heal her and that he thought she was simply sleeping when she became unconscious .
Madeline Neumann died on March 23 , 2008 , on the floor of the family 's rural Weston home as people surrounded the 11 - year - old girl and prayed .
Someone called for help when she stopped breathing .
Prosecutors contend her father , Dale Neumann , had a legal duty to take his weakened daughter to a doctor .
A videotape of his interview with police after her death was shown to jurors during his trial Wednesday .
In the interview with Everest Metro Police Department detective Scott Sleeter , Neumann described the weeks leading up to Madeline 's death , when he said she was a " little weak and a little slower , " something he attributed to puberty .
Her condition deteriorated , and by the day before her death , he said , Madeline could not walk or talk .
" We just trusted the Lord for complete healing , " he said .
" We did n't really sense it was like a life - and - death situation .
We figured there was something really fighting in her body .
We asked people to join with us in prayer agreement . "
Ritz and Oreo go retro
2009 is turning out to be the year of retro food packaging .
We 've already seen Pepsi and General Mills try it out , now Nabisco is following suit with vintage renditions of Ritz crackers and Oreo cookies .
The vintage - inspired packaging , from Kraft - owned Nabisco , focuses on a clean minimal aesthetic — gone are the countless gradients , glows , and warped type .
While simple , it is a breath of fresh air on supermarket shelves typically stuffed with over - designed products .
A nice way to reinvent a couple of otherwise boring products .
The before ( seriously , how many outlines can you put on a logo ? ) and after Oreo packages :
Both Ritz and Oreo are sporting a simple new logo ( 4 letters placed inside circles ) , echoing the round shape of the product .
The Ritz package seems to build on the design sensibility of the acclaimed ( and unexpected ) ' Open for Fun ' campaign seen last year from advertising agency EuroRSCG :
Currently , the new packaging is being tried out at Target stores , there is no word on whether the look will spread elsewhere or stick around .
Here they are on the shelves spotted by Luke Dupont on Twitter :
UPDATE : The new packages were designed by Baker .
Exclusive to Target , the retro look will only be around for the summer .
( June 12 , 2009 )
In a political victory for the Obama administration -- and a surprising defeat for some lawmakers in both parties -- the Senate voted Tuesday to halt further production of the Air Force ’s F - 22 Raptor fighter jets .
The 58 - 40 vote on an amendment to the $ 680 - billion defense authorization bill called for stripping out the $ 1.75 billion set aside for construction of seven more of the jets .
The F - 22 , which has not been used in Iraq or Afghanistan , has come under particular scrutiny for its price tag .
The Pentagon has invested an estimated $ 65 billion in the program since it began , and each aircraft costs an estimated $ 44,000 per hour to operate .
If the Senate ’s action is sustained in the House - Senate conference version of the bill , F - 22 production would cease at 187 planes .

In April , Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates announced plans to invest more defense funds in intelligence and personnel and to shift money away from big weapons systems like the F - 22 .
And President Obama had lobbied intensely against funding the planes , threatening what would have been his first veto .
The administration plans to shift funding to the single - engine F - 35 Joint Strike Fighters , which also would be available to the Navy and Marine Corps and which Gates said would be superior to the F - 22s in combat .
The Pentagon also has proposed adding 22,000 troops to the Army .
A statement issued by the Pentagon said that Gates understood that the vote was difficult for many lawmakers , but that he believed “ the Pentagon cannot continue with business as usual when it comes to the F - 22 or any other program in excess of our needs . ”
But proponents of the F - 22 argued that the twin- engine , missile - eluding Raptor fighter jet was important for defense .
The aircraft originally was designed to counter a potential Soviet threat , and some now suggest that China and Russia are developing aircraft to compete with the F - 22 .

In addition , supporters of the F - 22 cited the need to protect aerospace and other defense - related jobs in a poor economy .
The fighter jets are manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corp. at a plant in Marietta , Ga . According to the company , 25,000 people are directly employed in building the F - 22 , and an additional 70,000 have indirect links .
The jets ’ engines are made by Pratt & Whitney in Connecticut .
The state ’s two senators -- Democrat Christopher J. Dodd and independent Joe Lieberman -- opposed the amendment .
Subcontracting work on F - 22s and F - 35s is done in Los Angeles and Orange counties .
Democratic California Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein also opposed the amendment .

Boxer criticized the timing of Tuesday ’s vote , arguing that it ignored the next Quadrennial Defense Review , the Pentagon ’s outline for national security strategy , due in early 2010 .
“ The United States has made a significant investment in the F - 22 program , ” Boxer said in a statement .
“ Before terminating it , I believe we must see in unequivocal terms how the defense planning process has determined that requirements and threats have changed to stop production at 187 . ”
Republican Sens. Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson of Georgia also voted against the amendment , and Isakson has vowed to push to keep money for the plane in the recently passed House version of the bill .
Rep. Howard P. “ Buck ” McKeon of Santa Clarita , the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee , expressed his disappointment Tuesday with the Senate vote .

“ The decision to terminate the line . . . cannot be easily reversed , and could cost Southern California thousands of high - paying jobs , ” he said .
Lockheed Martin has said that about a third of the F - 22 ’s suppliers are in California , providing as many as 6,500 jobs .
But Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) , whose own state has endured massive job losses within the auto industry , called the vote “ a significant victory for our men and women in uniform , for the taxpayers and for reforming the way we do business in Washington . ”

From Maine to Florida , the Atlantic seaboard has experienced higher tides than expected this summer .
At their peak in mid-June , the tides at some locations outstripped predictions by two feet .
The change has come too fast to be attributed to melting ice sheets or anything quite that dramatic , and it's a puzzle for scientists who 've never seen anything quite like it .
" The ocean is dynamic .
It 's not uncommon to have anomalies like this but the breadth and the intensity and duration were unique , " said Mike Szabados , director of the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration 's tide and current program .
The unexpected tidal surge is subsiding , has reduced its reach from the entire coast , and is now concentrated just in the mid-Atlantic states .
NOAA is rushing to study the data in an effort to understand what happened .
Szabados ' office is already putting the finishing touches on a report that will be released next month on the wind and current patterns that appear to be correlated with the tidal surge .
Szabados said that two main factors appear to have contributed to the extra high tides .
First , there were steady winds out of the northeast throughout this anomaly .
Second , the ocean current running from Florida up along the coast weakened .
While the associations between these phenomena and the tides are provocactive , it 's too early to tell how fully they explain this unexpected tidal event .
" I 'm quite sure that there will be more intensive analysis of this event .
By no means will this report be the definitive answer to anything , " Szabados said .
" Further assessment of this event should be encouraged to better understand the phenomena . "
One thing is for sure :
The tidal rise is strange .
Kevin Trenberth , head of the climate analysis section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research , looked over June climate data on wind , atmospheric pressure and the ocean .
June was — high tides aside — " nothing to write home about " in Trenberth 's estimation .
" It 's a bit of a mystery , " he said .
Szabados ' team was initially puzzled that there were no major wind anomalies accompanying the tides , but his team 's wind expert figured out it was n't the magnitude that was anomalous .
" He said there 's no significant anomalies in the magnitude of the wind , it 's the persistence of the winds , " Szabados said .
An even bigger mystery is why such winds would suddenly appear and why the current running up the Atlantic coast would weaken .
Was it a freak coincidence , some jitter in the data , or part of a long - term trend or cycle ?
John Boon , professor emeritus of oceanography at Virginia Institute for Marine Studies , thinks it could be part of a long - term global trend that 's tied in with the Pacific region 's El Niño weather pattern .
" When I 'm comparing these decadal cycles , I see that some of the highs in these decadal cycles coincide with El Niño events , " He said .
" It 's not to say that one is caused by another , but the degree of association is somewhat surprising . "
But long - term tidal patterns can be hard to spot , Boon said .
" It 's such a long time scale that 's working in this process that we do n’t sense it going on like we sense a hurricane coming and going , " he said .
" A subtle but persistent pattern that affects the whole North Atlantic ocean :
It 's acting without giving any immediate clues that it 's going on until we see , ' Whoops , the sea levels are higher than normal . ' "
Boon and a team of other researchers are crunching data now on the phenomenon and hope to put out a paper later this year .
Szabados would n't rule out the strange tide as an indication of a larger trend , but he was n't ready to make that leap just yet .
" Is this part of a long decadal variation ?
Potentially , yes , " Szabados said .
" But it 's premature to make that linkage . "

If there is a right to health care , someone has the duty to provide it .
Inevitably , that “ someone ” is the government .
Concrete benefits in pursuance of abstract rights , however , can be provided by the government only by constant coercion .
People sometimes argue in favor of a universal human right to health care by saying that health care is different from all other human goods or products .
It is supposedly an important precondition of life itself .
This is wrong :
There are several other , much more important ...
Russia and China have served notice that as the US continues to struggle with crippling deficits and a rapidly growing debt , the two countries intend to take a far more active role in shaping international finance .
According to figures supplied by Russia , trade with China was the highest ever last year at $ 57 billion .
This pales in comparison to the $ 409 billion traded between the US and China but there is little doubt that China and Russia intend to change this over the next two decades .
A goodly percentage of this growing trade will be in the form of oil which according to Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ who just happens to be Chairman of RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s largest oil company Ã¢â‚¬â€œ will surpass the $ 100 billion mark over the next twenty years .
But this is where this gets interesting .
Russia wants China to pay for this oil in rubles not US dollars as is the practice now .
Receiving payment directly in rubles would serve two strategic goals for Russia Ã¢â‚¬â€œ first and foremost , it would help support the ruble which ever since Russia first opened its economy to capitalism , has struggled against the major currencies .
In exchange for RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s oil , China would have an expanding market for its exports that Ã¢â‚¬â€œ presumably Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Russia could pay for in rubles or rubles converted to yuan .
Whatever the payment arrangement , there would no longer be the need for Russia to convert weak rubles to dollars in order to buy ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s products .
Add to this the likelihood that China will continue to protect the yuan from significant appreciation to ensure strong markets for its exports , and you can see why eliminating the dollar from the equation appeals to both countries .
Secondly , this will reduce overall exposure to the US .
Currently , Russia holds $ 400 billion in US debt and cash , while China has nearly $ 2 trillion in its foreign currency reserves .
Both countries have been critical lately with respect to US economic policy hurting the value of these reserves and have even suggested that an alternative to the American buck is needed as the worldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s currency of choice for foreign reserves .
What could all this mean for the US dollar ?
Initially , not that much .
It will take several years for current contracts to be rewritten to cut out the dollar altogether and weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re still talking a relatively small amount .
But it is the message this sends that really has the potential to be a game - changer .
It signals that two of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s largest economies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ despite holding nearly two and half trillion in US funds between them Ã¢â‚¬â€œ intend to reduce their dependence on the dollar .

" I am married , rather begrudgingly , to a man who no longer makes me feel anything , " writes Shelly in her blog , Confessions of a Wayward Wife .
" Things are OK between us .
Maybe that 's the problem – things are fine .
But it is n't exciting or even interesting any more .
Our love - making is performed mostly out of habit .
If he leaves the dishes expectantly in the sink , it makes me furious .
Even the way he moves in bed makes me want to stab myself in the eye with a fork . "
Fork - induced eye injuries notwithstanding , these admissions do n't necessarily mark Shelly 's marriage out as unusual .
Even happily married couples might wince in recognition at those moments of irrational fury that can accompany long - term relationships .
Marriages that have gone off the boil are also not a rarity – therapist Shirley P Glass states in her book Not Just Friends that one or both parties in 50 per cent of all couples will be unfaithful , and adultery remains the most common reason cited by divorcing couples .
What makes Shelly distinct is the fact that she is cheating on her husband and writes candidly about it online ( at confessionsofawaywardwife.blogspot.com ) under a pseudonym .
And she 's not alone .
Shelly 's blog is one of a growing number of " infidelity blogs " which attract a loyal online following .
Infidelity blogging is part of a bigger confessional blogging scene .
Sites like Post Secret ( postsecret.com ) , which publishes people 's anonymous confessions in postcard form , might have started the trend as far back as 2005 but the internet is now awash with places for the guilt - ridden to unburden their virtual souls .
Secret Tweet ( secrettweet.com ) enables users to post anonymous confessions to Twitter , Second Chance ( secondchance online.blogspot.com ) publishes people 's regrets anonymously , and True Wife Confessions ( truewifeconfessions.blogspot.com ) is a forum for women to post their real - life relationship confessions .
One post reads : " I know this is hypocritical but since you 've gained so much weight , I 'm just not that attracted to you any more . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Dawn Rouse , the founder of True Wife Confessions , admits to writing the first 20 confessions – including less shocking revelations such as " I know where your belt , glasses or wallet are .
I just think it 's funny to watch you run around like a crazy person looking for them " and " Sometimes you only have to make me laugh to change my mood .
It is not a strategy you use enough " .
But now she has more than enough posts to keep the site refreshed .
Rouse offers some insights into why women are so keen to write about acutely personal issues in such a public sphere .
" I feel there is a definite lack of space for women to say the unsayable ; the things that we as humans need to say or lose our minds , " she explains .
" I may say these things in a therapist 's office .
Others may only have access to a blog like this .
You get it out .
Then it dissipates , gives you the impetus to say it to your partner , or confirms that you have some different choices to make in life . "
Callie , a wife and mother who blogs anonymously about her affair with a married man , agrees .
" Most of my friends know my husband so I could n't talk to them about my affair , " she confides .
" Blogging was a safe way to find people who could relate to my circumstances without it affecting my ordinary life . "
For her , infidelity blogging is n't a brazen attempt to flaunt unfaithfulness but is instead inspired by the need to know you 're normal , and not alone .
" The thing that has amazed me most about other bloggers is that they are all just ordinary people trying to make the most of their situations , " she says .
" In one way or another , their marriages no longer work but they do n't want to leave because of the broader implications .
Having a community of people in similar circumstances makes it less isolating . "
Blogging also gave Amy , the author of My Married Life ( marriedwifeblog.blogspot.com ) , a much - needed emotional outlet to talk about her affairs .
" The prevailing attitude towards infidelity is : ' Work it out at home , ' " she says .
" People wrongly assume that someone who cheats does n't love their spouse . "
Amy began blogging to explore whether other people shared her view that loving her husband and having affairs were equally legitimate parts of her life , and she soon found a virtual community of supportive , like - minded bloggers .
Tuesday Malone , a married mum who writes about her affair with a married man at insidetheaffair.com , blogs for similar reasons .
" Infidelity is an extremely isolating experience , " she says .
" Apart from the moments of intensity you share with your lover , you are unable to share the experience with anyone else in your life , including those closest to you . "
Tuesday 's regular readers range from people having affairs to those whose partners have been unfaithful .
" Others are just interested in infidelity or they like the writing , " she says .
" Many of us are going through the same experiences and emotions – it's like having your own personal ' cheer squad ' on the sidelines . "
Petal , a wife and mother in her thirties who has an open marriage following her husband 's discovery of her affair , admits that she also enjoys the attention bestowed on her by her readers .
" I suppose some of the comments feed my ego a bit , " she admits .
" Having people give me feedback is a bit heady . "
Blogging , like infidelity , can become an addiction in itself – and for some , infidelity blogging can become something of a demanding mistress too .
Tuesday Malone admits this .
" There is no doubt that discovery would ruin my life in many ways , " she reflects .
" But like some perverse drug I can not seem to give it up . "
Bloggers do sometimes hang up their boots , of course .
Amy thinks she 'll eventually lose interest in blogging because finding opportunities to write is n't easy .
Tuesday Malone agrees that her blog would be brought to a swift conclusion if her husband found it , although she takes steps to avoid that , using a proxy server , only blogging when she 's alone in the house and always deleting her browsing history .
She claims she 's equivocal whether discovery would actually be a good thing – but she hesitates and I can't decide if the implication is that it might free her to keep blogging without subterfuge , or that being exposed might in itself be good blog material .
For many anonymous bloggers the risks of being found out are outweighed by the benefits that blogging brings , despite concern that discovery could hurt loved ones .
Kimberly describes the dangers in her blog , The Errant Wife ( www.yourerrantwife.blogspot.com).
" We know we could be caught , but the needs are such that they are worth the risk , " she writes .
" In the cost / benefit analysis our destruction does n't seem so bad when compared to our craving ... and we all think we are too smart to get caught . "
Serial Mistress , a divorcee who dates married men and writes about her experiences at serialmistress .
blogspot.com , sees things differently .
" People are real , and very important to me , " she says .
" My blog would never be written to the detriment of a relationship . "
Of course , it 's difficult to overlook the fact that somewhere there are unwitting wives whose husbands ' extra-marital exploits provide much of the content for such blogs .
There 's an argument that says infidelity blogs are written to the detriment of relationships .
But does guilt exist in virtual reality ?
Opinion is divided .
Ms Scarlett , a fortysomething married mum , writes about her affair with a married man at msscarlettletter.blogspot.com .
She does n't feel guilt about her affair or her blog , and argues that 's common among infidelity bloggers .
" Why ?
Not sure .
Maybe we 've been pushed far enough in our real lives that it just does n't feel wrong , " she muses .
In contrast , Callie feels guilty on both counts .
" I have tried to be fairly respectful of my husband and to avoid writing about him .
But just learning about what I have done would be devastating to our relationship , " she admits .
" I do n't think he could ever understand why I felt the need to do it . "
Tuesday Malone says guilt is inevitable but describes it as a twinge rather than a full - on assault .
" Guilt should pervade my life at every turn , " she acknowledges .
" I am betraying my husband by having the affair .
I am betraying my lover by writing my blog .
But somehow I have blocked the guilt and not allowed myself to feel it .
The thing I feel most guilty about is not feeling guilty . "
At heart , infidelity blogging appears to be an effort to give concrete reality to relationships that often have their roots in unreality ; to legitimise something that society mostly denounces .
An infidelity blogger might not be able to hold the hand of her lover in public but she can create an online persona around their affair and write in intimate detail about illicit hours spent together .
Still , writing online about infidelity could be seen as a harder betrayal to understand than the adultery itself .
After all , while an affair can be unintentional , or at least unpremeditated , there 's nothing unwitting about blogging .
It 's hard not to feel pangs of pity for the partners who know less about the person with whom they exchanged vows than scores of virtual strangers .
But it 's not always easy , either , to condemn the choices of those for whom adultery and the internet offer a release from the realities of difficult relationships .
Either way , whether they are seeking virtual absolution or just attention , the new infidelity bloggers seem to be having their cake and writing about it too .
The serial mistress by ' Karen Marley '
I blog about my experiences as a single woman , dating married men .
I started blogging to help people understand that mistresses are n't all home - wreckers and unpaid hookers .
I 'll always be in the firing line regarding my life as a serial mistress but even if my blog came under criticism I would n't stop .
The typical mistress has always been portrayed as a damaged woman who falls for a man she can't have , and spends the rest of her time either pining over him or trying to wreck his marriage .
I 'm not interested in wrecking homes or destroying lives and I make no demands of the men I date , so I have nothing to be ashamed of .
I refuse to hide just because that 's what society says the " scarlet woman " should do .
I love being single and I enjoy the company of successful , charismatic men who have other lives to go to when they 're not with me .
I love living alone and I enjoy close relationships with attached men , without it becoming mundane , without having to pick up pants off the floor , and without the grief and hassle most relationships endure .

The yummy mummy by ' Betty Walker '
I am a mother , a partner , a businesswoman , a friend and a lover .
The real me never really sees the light of day until I blog .
My blog allows me to share my experience with a like - minded community .
I did n't realise there were so many of us out there until I started this journey .
My personal feelings are usually hidden beneath a veneer .
As a mum and businesswoman I 'm required to be on my best behaviour but sometimes you just need an outlet to say the things you can't normally say .
Mums have it hard – society still expects us to be virtuous and homely , and we do n't have the equality in the home that we do in business .
We lose all sense of sexuality and self .
I think this is why we are seeing a rise in female bloggers .
Just to say out loud what you feel is a form of therapy .
I feel guilty everyday but I 'm not doing anything that has n't been done before , it 's just wrapped up in a different package .
I would n't want to hurt anyone and that 's always in the back of my mind .
Maybe I 'll stop when my story is told .

The unfaithful wife by ' Amy S '
I 've been married for almost seven years and I have slept with quite a few other men .
My husband is not aware .
I looked on the web to see if there were other women in the same situation and all I found were people being shot down by the moral police .
So I started my blog as an experiment ; a place to order my thoughts and talk at my own pace , and to connect with others in similar circumstances and find out if they felt the same things .
I love my hubby dearly ; I do n't think I love him any less than someone who is faithful .
My blog is not a place for evangelists against cheating , although I do listen to good advice .
Maybe blogging is a justification .
Maybe it's a desire for community .
I write about my infidelities from an emotional and physical perspective .
I love my sexuality and want to connect with others like me .
Besides my friends , the people who read my blog are mostly spectators and voyeurs like me .
I like reading about people who love their spouses but have discreet sexual fun with others .

The secret affair by ' Tuesday Malone '
I am a thirtysomething married woman having an affair .
I started blogging because I felt isolated from both my husband and my married lover .
I did n't feel I could confide in a friend as I was afraid of being judged or misunderstood , so I went to an internet café in a different part of the city , started a blog and wrote my first post .
The feeling of liberation was immediate .
My blog is my journey through the moral and emotional minefield of infidelity , as well as its social and personal consequences .
I write about my experiences of reading between text - message lines and having to explain why one 's knickers are in one 's handbag and not on one 's person .
Blogging enables me to share my experiences with a like - minded , non-judgemental community , who provide a surprising level of emotional support and analysis .
It 's extremely comforting to know I am not alone .
I began writing for myself , but I now write with my " commenters " in mind .
I find it inspiring to write " to " this community because I know I have a sympathetic and encouraging audience .
Part of the attraction is also the element of danger surrounding writing an anonymous public blog .
insidetheaffair.blogspot.com
The Scarlett woman by ' Ms Scarlett '
I started blogging because I needed somewhere to get my thoughts down without fear of judgement .
I also needed an outlet before I started talking about my other life to people in my real life .
I write about my relationship with my lover – its ups and downs , as well as about relationships in general .
I do n't really consider it public .
I do n't write under my own name , and there 's no way anyone I know would identify me as the writer even if they found the blog .
It started as an outlet , somewhere to talk about my life , but it has turned into a community , a sharing of ideas with people I 've never met but who I consider friends .
They know exactly what I 'm talking about – we 've all been through a lot of the same things .
As one of them said just today , " Whoever said pen-pals are a thing of the past never tried blogging " .
I write for myself ; it 's the cheapest therapy I 'll ever get .
I would be stunned if my family ever found my blog and connected it to me , so I do n't really worry about being caught .

Tamarins recognise when a word does not match a familiar order of syllables
Studies on monkeys have revealed clues about the evolution of language .
In the journal Biology Letters , researchers said that cotton - top tamarins are able to spot if the order of syllables in a word is " wrong " .
They familiarised the monkeys with two - syllable terms , and recorded their reaction to words that were not consistent with that syllable pattern .
The team says the work illustrates how many animals use patterns that have become intrinsic to human language .
And this provides evidence of the " non-lingual " origin of certain aspects of language , the group told BBC News .
In the experiment , the monkeys were played a series of different words that all shared either the same first syllable or second syllable .
The idea was to investigate the origins of the prefixes and affixes used in many languages to indicate tense .
In English , for example , the past tense of a verb can be composed using the suffix " - ed " - " walk " becomes " walked " .
Listening test
The monkeys were not trained to respond to specific words , but they were familiarised with a pattern - a particular prefix , or a suffix .
" In the prefixation condition , they heard ' shoy - bi ' , ' shoy - la ' , ' shoy - ro ' and so on , " explained Ansgar Endress , lead author of the study .
" The idea is that they get used to the pattern if you play it long enough . "
The " suffixation " group heard words with a changing first syllable , this time with the suffix , " shoy " , kept consistent - such as " bi-shoy " and " la-shoy " .
The team played recordings of these " familiarisation " words to the animals for half an hour .
The following day , the monkeys were tested .
The researchers played them " new " words that were either consistent with the pattern they had heard before - with " shoy " in the right place - or inconsistent with the familiar pattern .
In bird song or whale song , there 's a temporal ordering to the notes and that 's critical for communication
Marc Hauser , Harvard University
" We simply measured how often the monkeys looked to the speaker when we played the items , " said Dr Endress .
" If they got used to , or bored by , the pattern , then they might be more interested in items that violate ( it ) - because they are something new - than in items that are consistent with the pattern . "
Marc Hauser , who was also involved in this study , told BBC News that the results showed how human language had incorporated memory processes that were not " language - specific " .
" Simple temporal ordering is shared with non-human animals , " he said .
" This has an important role .
In bird song or whale song , for example , there 's a temporal ordering to the notes and that 's critical for communication . "
And it goes beyond that .
" In primates , this ordering is vital for learning , " explained Professor Hauser .
" In tool use , primates learn from each other that you do this first , then you do that , then it 's that . "
Professor Hauser described how evident this innate ability is when a child learns language .
" As a child learns to use the past tense , " he said , " they may generalise and use a suffix wrongly , but they will never generalise in the wrong direction .
" You never hear them say ed - walk instead of walked . "

The card details were allegedly stolen from three firms , including 7 - Eleven US prosecutors have charged a man with stealing data relating to 130 million credit and debit cards .
Officials say it is the biggest case of identity theft in American history .
They say Albert Gonzalez , 28 , and two un-named Russian co-conspirators hacked into the payment systems of retailers , including the 7 - Eleven chain .
Prosecutors say they aimed to sell the data on .
If convicted , Mr Gonzalez faces up to 20 years in jail for wire fraud and five years for conspiracy .
He would also have to pay a fine of $ 250,000 ( £ 150,000 ) for each of the two charges .
' Standard ' attack SQL INJECTION ATTACK
This is a fairly common way that fraudsters try to gain access to consumers ' card details .
They scour the internet for weaknesses in companies ' programming which allows them to get behind protection measures .
Once they find a weakness , they insert a specially designed code into the network that allows them to access card details .
There is little consumers can do to protect themselves from the effects of this type of attack .
The general advice to cardholders is to check bank statements carefully and report any suspicious transactions immediately .
How secure is your card info ?
Mr Gonzalez used a technique known as an " SQL injection attack " to access the databases and steal information , the US Department of Justice ( DoJ ) said .
The method is believed to involve exploiting errors in programming to access data .
Edward Wilding , a fraud investigator , told the BBC that this method was " a pretty standard way " for fraudsters to try to access personal data .
He added that this case probably " involved extremely well researched , especially configured codes , not standard attack codes downloaded from the internet " .
Mr Wilding said there was little consumers could do to protect themselves against this kind of fraud .
Internet and telephone transactions using credit cards were most vulnerable , he said , though added it was a failure of corporations , not customers .
Michelle Whiteman , from anti-fraud organisation Financial Fraud Action UK , said that consumers must check their bank statements regularly and flag up any suspicious transactions to their bank .
She said that online , telephone and mail order fraud were on the increase , along with fraud committed abroad on UK cards , according to figures released in March .
But she stressed that any victim of fraud would " always be refunded in full " .
Further charges FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from Today programme Mr Gonzales ' corporate victims included Heartland Payment Systems - a card payment processor - convenience store 7 - Eleven and Hannaford Brothers , a supermarket chain , the DoJ said .
" We are pleased that the authorities have aggressively pursued this case to be in a position to bring an indictment against the alleged perpetrators of the crime , " said Michael Norton , spokesperson for Hannaford Brothers .
Meanwhile , 7 - Eleven said the attack affected cash machines operated by a third party inside its stores , and had lasted for 12 days in 2007 .
According to the indictment , the group researched the credit and debit card systems used by their victims , attacked their networks and sent the data to computer servers they operated in California , Illinois , Latvia , the Netherlands and Ukraine .
The data could then be sold on , enabling others to make fraudulent purchases , it said .
Mr Gonzalez , who had once been an informant for the US Secret Service helping to track hackers , is already in custody on separate charges of hacking into the computer systems of a national restaurant chain and eight major retailers , including TJ Maxx , involving the theft of data related to 40 million credit cards .
Mr Gonzales is scheduled to go on trial for these charges in 2010 .
This latest case will raise fresh concerns about the security of credit and debit cards used in the United States , the BBC's Greg Wood reports .

The 2009 Lamborghini Gallardo's spun off another new edition , and the latest version 's a little bit of heresy for the normally four - wheel - driven brand .
The newest Gallardo LP550 - 2 is a rear - driver -- while all other Gallardo models offer standard four - wheel drive .
It 's a spin on the usual drivetrain that Lamborghini 's done before with the Murcielago , as a special edition to add a little more luster to the supercar 's performance image .
The LP550 - 2 also wears a tag for Valentino Balboni , Lamborghini 's retired test driver who helped define the brand 's handling characteristics since 1973 , and acts as an ambassador for the brand .
Tech specs for the new Gallardo include the 550 - horsepower engine ( hence the name ) , and rear - wheel drive ( the " 2 " on the new badges ) .
New suspension settings have been mandated , the traction control system 's been retuned for more entertaining driving , and the rear differential and e-gear sequential transmission have been adapted for use in the new rear - drive edition .
Lamborghini promises a 0 - 60 mph time of 3.9 seconds , and a top speed of 199 mph .
The bespoke gold and white paint job is unique to the new model ; seven other colors are offered .

Tomboy , a popular open source note - taking application , is coming to the Internet .
The Tomboy team is creating a Web application called Snowy that will allow users to keep their notes synchronized in the cloud .
It also offers a rich interactive Web interface , enabling users to seamlessly access and edit their notes through a Web browser .
Novell developer Brad Taylor created Snowy in his free time as an experiment .
It matured recently when Tomboy developer Sandy Armstrong teamed up with Taylor during one of Novell 's Hack Weeks in an effort to accelerate progress on the project .
A preview of the new Web synchronization feature has landed in the latest version of Tomboy .
Snowy is built with Python and uses the open source Django framework .
One of the most compelling aspects of Snowy is that it is open source software , which means that users can self - host their own note servers .
To facilitate synchronization with Snowy , the Tomboy developers created a REST API that uses the JSON interchange format to convey note textual content and metadata .
The REST API is documented so that third - party developers can create interoperable software .
The implication is that anyone can build alternatives to Snowy or integrate Tomboy note synchronization support into existing Web services .
It 's also possible to create alternative client software that can use the service for note storage .
The open REST API is already attracting some interest from developers who are looking to add Tomboy note synchronization capabilities to their own software .
Henri Bergius , for example , added support for the Snowy REST API to the Midgard open source content management framework .
Canonical is also exploring the Snowy API and is considering the possibility of adding support for Tomboy note synchronization to its Ubuntu One web service .
Software freedom in the cloud
Snowy is distributed under the terms of GNU 's Affero General Public License ( AGPL ) , a copyleft license that is intended for Web software .
Much like the conventional GPL , it guarantees the freedom to study , modify , and redistribute program source code .
Unlike the GPL , it broadens the scope of these freedoms to encompass Web users and not just the recipients of a program .
This means that individuals who access a remote instance of a program that is distributed under the AGPL are entitled to the rights that are granted by the license .
Web application providers are consequently compelled to disclose the modifications that they make to AGPL software that they host for public access .
The AGPL is largely a response to the emergence of the Software as a Service ( SaaS ) model and the growing popularity of cloud computing .
The license aims to adapt traditional copyleft principles so that they can be properly applied to modern Web software .
The trend towards hosted Web applications poses a significant challenge for the open source software community .
Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman insists that rejecting the entire concept of hosted Web applications is the only acceptable course of action , but that short - sighted approach is ultimately self - defeating because it will only serve to marginalize open source software .
It 's becoming increasingly clear that tight integration with Web services will be needed in order to ensure that Linux remains a competitive platform on the desktop relative to proprietary alternatives .
Incited by that revelation , the community of software developers behind the open source GNOME desktop environment have discussed at length the prospect of creating open Web services that can be leveraged by GNOME software .
Such discussions , which have been going on for years , have generated a lot of intriguing ideas but very little practical software .
The Snowy Web service is a very big step in the right direction .
It demonstrates how a truly open Web application can be used to empower users of open source software and give them the freedom and flexibility in the cloud that they enjoy today on the desktop .
Users can freely choose their provider or deployment environment and can maintain full control over their data .
Building rich Web applications with Open standards
Snowy is an ideal showcase of the open Web in other ways , too .
Its rich user interface takes advantage of emerging standards - based Web technologies to provide support for interactive editing .
Specifically , it uses the contentEditable property which is introduced in the HTML 5 draft and is already supported by all major browsers .
This property makes the contents of an HTML element editable by the user and supports a number of style commands that can alter the markup and apply various formatting elements .
The contentEditable property makes it easier for Web application developers to build WYSIWYG rich text editors .
Snowy is an excellent example of a practical usage scenario for this especially useful feature of HTML 5 .
For more details about contentEditable , you can check out an overview of at the WHATWG blog .
HTML 5 is gaining a lot of momentum as prominent Web service providers embrace the parts of it that are supported widely in browsers .
Many features in HTML 5 can be used to build sophisticated Web applications without having to rely on proprietary browser plugins .
The contentEditable feature is only one of many that will power the next generation of Web software .
Conclusion
Snowy is still under heavy development and the developers are working on a multitude of additional features .
According to Taylor , other plans include creating a mobile version of the Web interface that will work well with smartphone browsers and adding support for note sharing and collaboration .
Support for the REST synchronization API could also potentially be added to Tomdroid , a native Android port of Tomboy .
Taylor intends to launch a free hosted version of Snowy called Tomboy Online that will be available for users who are n't interested in hosting their own Snowy instance .
Much work will be required , however , before Snowy is ready to be deployed for large - scale use .
Taylor and Armstrong hope that additional developers will participate in the effort and contribute to the Snowy project .
Although Snowy is relatively new and still has some limitations and rough edges , it 's an impressive project that brings a lot of value to Tomboy users .
Snowy is also a significant contribution to the ongoing discussion about how to translate the ideals of open source software to the Web while bringing the Web to the desktop .
This sunrise was photographed with a handheld camera by astronauts during space shuttle mission STS - 127 on July 17 , 2009 .
Astronauts orbiting Earth see a lot more sunrises and sunsets that those of us stranded on the surface .
They circle the planet every 90 minutes , and the sun just keeps coming .
A new picture of a sunrise from space was taken with a handheld camera by astronauts Friday on the day the Space Shuttle Endeavour docked with the International Space Station during shuttle mission STS - 127 .
Earth 's atmosphere appears as a thin crescent shape ranging from white to blue to purple , while the planet in the foreground is a black as the void beyond .
From the surface of Earth , the sun rises because of Earths endless , 24 - hour rotation .
From here , sunrises and sunsets are often orange or red because the light has more atmosphere to pass through to get to your eye when the sun is near the horizon , and only the red light , with a longer wavelength then blue light , can make it .
The astronauts see little of that from their perch more than 200 miles up , but the effect is still beautiful .
The health care industry is just as evil as the energy industry .
In fact , there ’s a good argument to be made that these people are far worse .
From the LA Times :
Invoking an argument used by President George W. Bush , the Obama administration has turned down a request from a watchdog group for a list of health industry executives who have visited the White House to discuss the massive healthcare overhaul .
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington sent a letter to the Secret Service asking about visits from 18 executives representing health insurers , drug makers , doctors and other players in the debate .
The group wants the material in order to gauge the influence of those executives in crafting a new healthcare policy .
The Secret Service sent a reply stating that documents revealing the frequency of such visits were considered presidential records exempt from public disclosure laws .
The agency also said it was advised by the Justice Department that the Secret Service was within its rights to withhold the information because of the “ presidential communications privilege . ”
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics said it would file suit against the Obama administration as early as today .
The group already has sued the administration over its failure to release details about visits from coal industry executives .
LAS VEGAS – There 's no honor among thieves , nor apparently among hackers .
A malicious ATM kiosk was positioned in the conference center of the Riviera Hotel Casino capturing data from an unknown number of hackers attending the DefCon hacker conference before someone noticed something suspicious about the kiosk .
An organizer for the conference said security authorities seized the device .
It 's not known how long the ATM was in the hotel or whether it was placed there by a DefCon attendee to catch his fellow hackers or simply by an outside criminal group trying to target conference attendees .
Witnesses say the kiosk was well - placed to avoid surveillance cameras .
" In any casino anything that is considered that high value has a camera , " said Brian Markus , CEO of Aries Security who saw the machine , " and they placed it where there were no [ hotel ] cameras visibly watching that exact spot where the ATM was . "
Markus said it was clear to him the ATM was fake when he looked at the smoked glass on the front of the machine and noticed something funny about it .
When he beamed a flashlight through the glass , instead of seeing a camera behind it , he saw the PC that was set up to siphon card data .
The ATM had been placed right outside the hotel 's security office .

Zazcar became the 1,000th city in the world to offer car - sharing services .
Let ’s commemorate this milestone with a holiday !
Our good friends at World Streets today highlight a huge milestone for sustainable mobility : Sao Paulo ( 19.6 million metro population ) became the planet ’s 1,000th car - sharing city on Wednesday , launching Zazcar .
Make that two huge milestones : Zazcar also became the first company in Latin America to share cars by the hour , opening potentially a whole new continent to sustainable urban autos .
Zazcar ’s rates start at 22 reais / hour or 179 reais / day ( about $ 11.40 / hour or $ 92.75 / day ) , including gas , insurance , maintenance , and reserved parking — “ all in a Zaz ! ”
For car - sharing aficionados like me , the impressive milestone makes me feel proud of how grassroots community efforts can change the world .
Car sharing thrives at the local level — from its informal origins in 1940s Switzerland , to the big Swiss and German co-ops of the ’80s and ’90s , to today ’s non-profits and commercial ventures pushing the envelope around the globe .
Most new car - sharing organizations rely on the tireless dedication of a few social entrepreneurs who love their city , and who invest their time , money , and sweat round - the - clock , sometimes for years with hardly a pause .
Perhaps we should mark July 15th — the day we reached 1,000 — as a car - sharing holiday , to thank the literally tens of thousands of social entrepreneurs , staff , and volunteers who have dedicated themselves endlessly to building this exciting movement .
Congratulations to Zazcar .
Congratulations to Mobility Switzerland .
Congratulations to Go Get in Sydney .
Congratulations to City CarShare in the San Francisco Bay Area .
Congratulations to Victoria Car -Share Co-op in British Columbia .
Congratulations to 995 more .
Thank you for the social change .
You ’re making it happen .

Mark Steyn has an excellent and very funny piece on the stimulus , which he sees as stimulating only one thing : itself ( i.e. the stimulus - promotion industry , the stimulus - coordination industry , and the stimulus - supplementary - funding industry ) .
As he puts it : “ But , if you want to stimulate bureaucracy , dependency and the metastasization of approved quasi - governmental interest - group monopolies as the defining features of American life , then ARRA is the way to go . ”
His harsh words about California ’s state government ( “ The gangster regime in Sacramento is an alliance between a corrupt and / or craven political class wholly owned by a public sector union - bureaucracy extortion racket . ” ) could , unfortunately , be applied to other places in the U.S. where unions and other interest groups have come to dominate local politics in order to increase their pay and pensions at the expense of the general working public .
A few years ago , I was very optimistic about the so - called " Tax and Spend Revolution " in the U.S. that started in the 1970s in California ( of all places ) with Proposition 1 under Ronald Reagan in 1973 and then the famous Proposition 13 in 1978 .
What happened in the last 30 years ?
Well , most states have now statutory rules to limit taxation , spending , and debt , in addition to balance - budget requirements .
Governors have also more say in the matter and can independently cut spending through line - item veto power .
Some states have even constitutional rules ( such as Colorado ) .
The latter has worked to a good extent , but for the most part , the tax and spend revolution has come a halt .
I believe the culprits are not the states ( although most of the statutory rules seem to have been mostly useless ) , but the federal government , which has opened the road to absolute fiscal profligacy and is now widely engaged in deficit spending .
In such circumstances where states are awash with cash , it seems hard for the system to resist .
Federalism is on its way out .
Next stop : Western Europe .
 Paper money eventually returns to its intrinsic value  zero .  ~ Voltaire
 The Federal Reserve in collaboration with the giant banks has created the greatest financial crisis the world has ever seen .
The foolish notion that unlimited amounts of money and credit created out of thin air can provide sustainable economic growth has delivered this crisis to us .
Instead of economic growth and stable prices , ( The Fed ) has given us a system of government and finance that now threatens the world financial and political institutions .
Pursuing the same policy of excessive spending , debt expansion and monetary inflation can only compound the problems that prevent the required corrections .
Doubling the money supply didnt work , quadrupling it wont work either .
Buying up the bad debt of privileged institutions and dumping worthless assets on the American people is morally wrong and economically futile . 
~ Representative from Texas Ron Paul questioning Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
Ive read and witnessed various pundits during the Presidential campaign describe Ron Paul as crazy .
The corrupt tax and spenders in Congress know their days would be numbered if they followed his vision of government .
After reading his tremendously sane rebuke of Ben Bernanke and the policies of his Federal Reserve , Im reminded of a classic scene from Seinfeld .
Jerry : " Ah , you ’re crazy . "
Kramer : " Am I ?
Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind ? ! "
Jerry : " It ’s impossible ! " Kramer : " Is it ?
Or is it so possible that your head is spinning like a top ? ! "

Ron Pauls scathing assessment of the Federal Reserves primary role in creating the financial crisis and his raking of Chairman Bernanke over the coals is so accurate , truthful and sane that it should blow your mind .
Mr. Bernanke must have felt like his head was spinning like a top while Ron Paul gave him a tutorial in basic economics .
Mr. Pauls noble efforts to Audit the Fed ( HR 1207 ) and eventually to rid the country of its insidious control over our lives will bring the pillars of the Federal Reserve building crashing down upon Mr. Bernanke in his mahogany paneled , gold plated boardroom with ornate chandeliers .
The worldwide financial system experienced a 6.8 magnitude earthquake in September 2008 .
The very foundations of our economy were shaken to their core .
The fear exhibited by government officials , politicians , and the public was palpable and real .
For a few weeks there was the distinct possibility that the system would come crashing down .
A massive printing of dollars by the Federal Reserve , the clandestine buying up of toxic assets by the Federal Reserve , behind the scenes deals with the biggest banks , covert currency swap deals with foreign Central Banks , and forcing the FASB to change accounting rules to allow banks to fraudulently value bad loans , temporarily staved off the final chapter in the 96 year old diabolical experiment in currency manipulation .
The moment when the system stopped functioning was our  Minsky Moment .
Hyman Minsky was an American economist and professor of economics at Washington University .
Dr. Minsky put forward theories linking financial market vulnerability , in the normal life cycle of an economy , with speculative investment bubbles produced by financial markets .
Minsky declared that in good times , when corporate cash flow rises beyond what is needed to pay off debt , a speculative bubble develops , and soon thereafter debts exceed what borrowers can pay off from their incoming revenues , which in turn produces a financial emergency .
As a result of such dangerous debt bubbles , banks tighten credit availability , even to companies with good credit , and the economy enters recession .
This movement of the financial system from stability to crisis is the  Minsky Moment " .
At this point , a major selloff begins due to the fact that no counterparty can be found to bid at the asking prices previously quoted , leading to a swift and steep collapse in markets and a dramatic drop in market liquidity .
What Dr. Minsky failed to address was that the Federal Reserve has been responsible for every financial crisis in the United States since 1913 .

Creation
The history of the Federal Reserve is shrouded in mystery , with bankers and corrupt politicians calling the shots from the very outset .
On the evening of November 22 , 1910 , Senator Aldrich and A.P. Andrews ( Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Department ) , Paul Warburg ( a naturalized German representing Baron Alfred Rothschild ’s Kuhn , Loeb & Co. ) , Frank Vanderlip ( president of the National City Bank of New York ) , Henry P. Davison ( senior partner of J.P. Morgan Company ) , Charles D. Norton ( president of the Morgan - dominated First National Bank of New York ) , and Benjamin Strong ( representing J. P. Morgan ) , left Hoboken , New Jersey on a train with a mission to gain complete control over the currency of the United States .
Forbes magazine founder Bertie Charles Forbes described the meeting on Jekyll Island , South Carolina that brought about the Federal Reserve :
 Picture a party of the nation ’s greatest bankers stealing out of New York on a private railroad car under cover of darkness , stealthily riding a hundred of miles South , embarking on a mysterious launch , sneaking onto an island deserted by all but a few servants , living there a full week under such rigid secrecy that the names of not one of them was once mentioned , lest the servants learn the identity and disclose to the world this strangest , most secret expedition in the history of American finance .
I am not romancing ; I am giving to the world , for the first time , the real story of how the famous Aldrich currency report , the foundation of our new currency system , was written …
The utmost secrecy was enjoined upon all .
The public must not glean a hint of what was to be done .
Senator Aldrich notified each one to go quietly into a private car of which the railroad had received orders to draw up on an unfrequented platform .
Off the party set .
New York ’s ubiquitous reporters had been foiled …
Nelson ( Aldrich ) had confided to Henry , Frank , Paul and Piatt that he was to keep them locked up at Jekyll Island , out of the rest of the world , until they had evolved and compiled a scientific currency system for the United States , the real birth of the present Federal Reserve System , the plan done on Jekyll Island in the conference with Paul , Frank and Henry …
Warburg is the link that binds the Aldrich system and the present system together .
He , more than any one man , has made the system possible as a working reality . 
On December 19 , 1913 Congress had two versions of a Federal Reserve bill with forty major differences .
Many Senators left town for the Christmas break and President Wilson didnt anticipate a final bill until January .
In a matter of hours , the forty differences were reconciled and the bill was voted on with 22 of the 88 Senators not in town .
It passed and was on Wilsons desk for signature by December 22 .
He refused to sign it , until convinced by Bernard Baruch , a major contributor to his campaign and Wall Street millionaire .
The passage of the Federal Reserve Act became known as " the Christmas massacre "
During the legislative process Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Sr. wisely pointed out the bleak future we would endure by giving bankers control over our destiny .
 The powers vested in the Federal Reserve Board seem to me highly dangerous especially when there is political control of the Board .
I should be sorry to hold stock in a bank subject to such dominations .
The [ Federal Reserve ] bill as it stands seems to me to open the way to a vast inflation of the currency .
I do not like to think that any law can be passed that will make it possible to submerge the gold standard in a flood of irredeemable paper currency . 
Congressman Charles A. Lindbergh Sr. had this to say after the passage of the bill :
 This [ Federal Reserve Act ] establishes the most gigantic trust on earth .
When the President signs this bill , the invisible government of the monetary power will be legalized …. the worst legislative crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking and currency bill .
The financial system has been turned over to the Federal Reserve Board .
That Board administers the finance system by authority of a purely profiteering group .
The system is Private , conducted for the sole purpose of obtaining the greatest possible profits from the use of other people ’s money .
From now on , depressions will be scientifically created .
Mandate(s )
The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 created the Federal Reserve Bank with the following mandate :
An Act To provide for the establishment of Federal reserve banks , to furnish an elastic currency , to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper , to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States , and for other purposes .
The original mandate was clearly limited .
The idea was that a Central Bank would be able to keep the periodic panics like the Panic of 1907 from ever happening again .
It appears that four innocuous words opened up Pandoras Box and unleashed evils upon all mankind  and for other purposes .
The bankers who control the Federal Reserve along with their politician protectors have dramatically expanded the scope , authority and influence of the Federal Reserve with each scientifically created crisis that has occurred in the last 96 years .
They are attempting to grab more power as we speak .

The group already has sued the administration over its failure to release details about visits from coal industry executives .
A White House spokesman , Ben LaBolt , said , “ We are reviewing our policy on access to visitor logs and related litigation . ”
As a candidate , President Obama vowed that in devising a healthcare bill he would invite in TV cameras -- specifically C- SPAN -- so that Americans could have a window into negotiations that normally play out behind closed doors .
Having promised transparency , the administration should be willing to disclose who it is consulting in shaping healthcare policy , said an attorney for the citizens ’ group .
In its letter requesting the records , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics asked about visits from Billy Tauzin , president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America ; Karen Ignagni , president of America ’s Health Insurance Plans ; William Weldon , chairman and chief executive of Johnson & Johnson ; and J. James Rohack , president of the American Medical Assn. , among others .

“ It ’s extremely disappointing , ” said Anne Weismann , the group ’s chief counsel .
Obama is relying on a legal argument that “ continues one of the bad , anti-transparency , pro-secrecy approaches that the Bush administration had taken .
And it seems completely at odds with the president ’s commitment . . . to bring a new level of transparency to his government . ”
PhRMA , which represents the nation ’s drug companies , said it had taken part in two meetings with senior White House officials in the Roosevelt Room .
Participants , according to Tauzin , included White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel , along with the CEOs of some major drug companies .
Both meetings were closed to the public .
In an interview , Tauzin said most of the “ real negotiations ” took place with the Senate Finance Committee .
At its meetings with the White House , the drug industry reported on progress made with the Senate and got a briefing from Obama officials “ about how they saw ” healthcare reform unfolding , Tauzin said .

New GI Bill Brings College Benefits to New Vets New GI
Bill will provide thousands in tuition funding for post - 9/11 vets .
Aug. 25 , 2009  --
Among my many life experiences , I can not count a moment of military service .
Neither in peace nor in war did I serve .
Over the years , however , I 've come to know a number of military families , including some who lost loved ones in Iraq or Afghanistan .
As a result , I 've come to the conclusion that there 's not enough we can do to recognize the sacrifices of these folks , from the parents to the spouses to the service members themselves .
Looking for financial advice ?
Click here to send David your questions and they might end up as a topic for his next column .
Quite frankly , it sometimes astounds me what they have given up .
That 's why I think the Post - 9/11 GI Bill is one of the best things to come out of Washington in years .
It 's about time we came close to matching the original GI Bill that sent millions of World War II veterans to college and paved their way to the middle class .
The new GI Bill took effect Aug. 1 , meaning many of its first beneficiaries will begin their academic careers in the weeks ahead .
Applications for the program are being taken now by the Department of Veterans Affairs .
You can also find several publications and detailed explanations for many different scenarios .
The basic benefits of the Post - 9/11 GI Bill :
Tuition and fees up to a maximum of the most expensive in - state tuition at a public college or university in the given state where an eligible recipient decides to attend school .
A monthly housing allowance .
And an annual stipend of up to $ 1,000 for books and supplies .
These are the basic benefits for veterans who completed their military service .
The benefits are somewhat different for active duty personnel , including no cap on tuition payments but an exclusion from the monthly housing allowance .
GI Bill Good at State , Private Schools
The basic eligibility requirement for the program begins with at least 90 days of active duty service beginning on or after Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The maximum benefit kicks in at 36 months of active duty .
The 90 days of service earns 40 percent of the maximum education benefit , and the percentage increases as the service period increases until the 100 percent benefit level is reached at 36 months .
In addition , individuals may be eligible after 30 days of active - duty service if they were discharged honorably as a result of a service - connected disability .
In that case , they are eligible for the maximum benefit right away .
The new GI Bill provides up to 36 months worth of full - time education benefits , allowing a veteran to earn a four - year undergraduate degree based on a nine - month academic year .
But the benefits are not limited to undergraduate degrees .
They also may be applied to graduate training .
Though the basic education benefits are capped at in - state tuition rates for public colleges and universities , military veterans are not limited to state higher - education institutions .
They can also use them at private colleges and universities .
And more than 1,100 private schools have agreed to participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs ' Yellow Ribbon Program .
Under the program , the VA will provide additional tuition benefits by agreeing to match contributions made by participating schools .
For instance , suppose the highest in - state undergraduate tuition rate in a given state is $ 15,000 and then the school itself provides an additional $ 3,000 in funding to the student .
The VA will match that $ 3,000 , meaning the student will receive $ 21,000 in benefits instead of the $ 15,000 .
Keep in mind there are limits to how much the VA will match .
Schools that participate in the Yellow Ribbon do so voluntarily .
A list of the participating schools is available on the VA 's Post - 9/11 GI Bill Web site .
Phil Dyer , a Towson , Md. - based financial planner and former U.S. Army officer , said one of the biggest advantages of the Post - 9/11 GI Bill is the ability of active duty personnel to transfer their benefits to family members , including spouses or children .
GI Bill as a Retention Tool
" It 's really a major retention tool , " said Dyer , who is the deputy director of financial education for the Military Officers Association of America .
To qualify for the transfer of benefits , a service member must serve at least 10 years on active duty , Dyer said .
The transferability of the education benefits may appeal to older military personnel who have already completed their educations or have children approaching college age .
The ability to help finance a child 's or spouse 's education with these benefits should encourage many active - duty personnel to continue serving a few extra years , he said .
Of course , as with any federal government program , there are provisions that can be difficult to follow and a few pitfalls to avoid .
One of the pitfalls involves when to transfer eligibility benefits to a family member .
Dyer said at least one month of benefits must be transferred before a service member is discharged .
Additional months can be added later on .
One easy way to learn more about benefits offered under the Post - 9/11 GI Bill is to download a presentation produced by the Military Officers Association of America .

Obama Faces Carter / Clinton Parallels
After six months in office , Barack Obama ’s presidency reveals striking parallels not only to Bill Clinton ’s troubled first term , but to Jimmy Carter ’s only term .
And , how those dangers are reappearing show that the Democrats and American progressives have learned little over the past 30 years .
Email
Printer friendly Many analysts already have noted the eerie similarities between Obama ’s troubles and Clinton ’s political woes 16 years ago .
In both cases , the Democratic presidents started off by rebuffing calls for serious investigations of abuses committed by their Republican predecessors .
However , instead of showing reciprocity , the Republicans went on the offensive ginning up “ scandals ” and challenging the legitimacy of the two Democrats , for instance , by spreading rumors linking Clinton to “ mysterious deaths ” and by winking at slurs about Obama not being born in the United States .
Republicans also voted solidly against major policy initiatives advanced by Clinton and Obama .
Faced with that unified GOP resistance , the Democratic majorities started to splinter , especially over the key issue of health - care reform which became Clinton ’s first - term “ Waterloo ” much as Republicans hope it will be for Obama .
Yet , arguably , the parallels to Jimmy Carter ’s one - term presidency may be even more on point .
Unlike Clinton whose reckless sexual behavior fueled the Republican campaigns against him , Carter and Obama are viewed as men of personal discipline and morality .
Carter and Obama – unlike Clinton – also showed a readiness to pressure Israel into making important concessions for peace in the Middle East .
That interest in playing the “ honest broker ” contributed to Carter ’s undoing and now might do the same for Obama .
Indeed , it was Carter ’s tenacity in pushing Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to agree to the Camp David peace accords in 1978 – returning the Sinai to Egypt in exchange for what has turned out to be a lasting peace – that prompted a brazen Israeli intervention into U.S. presidential politics .
By spring 1980 , an angry Begin had privately sided with the Republicans , whose fall campaign was to be led by right - wing candidate Ronald Reagan .
Though hidden from the American people both then and now , this alliance was well known at the senior levels of both the Israeli and U.S. governments .
Begin – who had led a Zionist terrorist group before Israel ’s independence in 1948 and founded the right - wing Likud Party in 1973 – decided he must take steps to prevent Carter from pushing for a broader Israel - Arab peace deal in a potential second term .
Begin ’s views were described by Israeli intelligence and foreign affairs official David Kimche in his 1991 book , The Last Option .
Kimche wrote that Begin ’s government believed that Carter was overly sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and was conspiring to force Israel to withdraw from the West Bank .
“ Begin was being set up for diplomatic slaughter by the master butchers in Washington , ” Kimche wrote .
“ They had , moreover , the apparent blessing of the two presidents , Carter and [ Egyptian President Anwar ]
Sadat , for this bizarre and clumsy attempt at collusion designed to force Israel to abandon her refusal to withdraw from territories occupied in 1967 , including Jerusalem , and to agree to the establishment of a Palestinian state . ”
Kimche continued , “ This plan – prepared behind Israel ’s back and without her knowledge – must rank as a unique attempt in United States ’s diplomatic history of short - changing a friend and ally by deceit and manipulation . ”
Begin particularly dreaded the prospect of a second Carter presidential term .
“ Unbeknownst to the Israeli negotiators , the Egyptians held an ace up their sleeves , and they were waiting to play it , ” Kimche wrote .
“ The card was President Carter ’s tacit agreement that after the American presidential elections in November 1980 , when Carter expected to be re-elected for a second term , he would be free to compel Israel to accept a settlement of the Palestinian problem on his and Egyptian terms , without having to fear the backlash of the American Jewish lobby . ”
October Surprise Begin ’s fear of Carter ’s reelection – and alarm over Carter 's perceived bungling in Iran where Islamic extremists took power in 1979 – set the stage for secret collaboration between Begin and the Republican presidential campaign , according to another Israeli intelligence official , Ari Ben-Menashe .
In his 1992 memoir , Profits of War , Ben-Menashe said the view of Begin and other Likud leaders was one of contempt for Carter .
“ Begin loathed Carter for the peace agreement forced upon him at Camp David , ” Ben-Menashe wrote .
“ As Begin saw it , the agreement took away Sinai from Israel , did not create a comprehensive peace , and left the Palestinian issue hanging on Israel ’s back . ”
Ben-Menashe , an Iranian - born Jew who had immigrated to Israel as a teen - ager , became part of a secret Israeli program to reestablish its intelligence network in Iran after it had been decimated by the Islamic revolution .
Ben -Menashe wrote that Begin authorized shipments to Iran of small arms and some spare parts , via South Africa , as early as September 1979 .
In November of that year , events in Iran took another troubling turn when Islamic radicals seized the U.S. Embassy and took 52 Americans hostage , prompting a U.S. trade embargo .
By April 1980 , however , Carter had learned about the covert Israeli shipments , which included 300 tires for Iran ’s U.S. - supplied jet fighters .
That prompted an angry complaint from Carter to Begin .
“ There had been a rather tense discussion between President Carter and Prime Minister Begin in the spring of 1980 in which the President made clear that the Israelis had to stop that , and that we knew that they were doing it , and that we would not allow it to continue , at least not allow it to continue privately and without the knowledge of the American people , ” Carter ’s press secretary Jody Powell told me .
“ And it stopped , ” Powell said .
At least , it stopped temporarily .
Carter ’s Judgment Questioned by congressional investigators a dozen years later , Carter said he felt that by April 1980 , “ Israel cast their lot with Reagan , ” according to notes I found among the unpublished documents in the files of the so - called October Surprise investigation by a House task force .
Carter traced the Israeli opposition to his reelection to a “ lingering concern [ among ]
Jewish leaders that I was too friendly with Arabs . ”
Carter ’s National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski also recognized the Israeli hostility .
Brzezinski said the Carter White House was well aware that the Begin government had “ an obvious preference for a Reagan victory . ”
Extensive evidence exists , too , that Begin ’s preference for a Reagan victory led Israelis to join in a covert operation with Republicans to contact Iranian leaders behind Carter ’s back and delay release of the 52 American hostages until after Reagan defeated Carter in November 1980 .
In his book and in sworn testimony about this so - called “ October Surprise ” controversy , Ben-Menashe asserted that then - GOP vice presidential candidate George H.W. Bush personally participated in a key meeting in October 1980 in Paris .
Bush denied that claim at two press conferences in 1992 but was never questioned under oath in any formal government inquiry .
One of the reasons I have devoted so much time over the years to this October Surprise mystery is that Election 1980 represented a key turning point for the United States and the world .
That such a moment may have turned on a near - treasonous dirty trick represents not only an outrageous American political scandal , but an Israeli one as well .
Indeed , it appears that a key factor in the successful cover - up of this scandal was that the full story might not only have hurt the Republicans but could have alienated Americans from Israel – if it were known that Likud had intervened to usher out of office a U.S. President who was deemed insufficiently supportive of the Israeli cause .
When Israel ’s secret roles in the Iran - Contra scandal ( as well as its prequel , the October Surprise case ) were threatened with exposure , influential neoconservatives in the U.S. news media – especially at The New Republic – mounted fierce counterattacks against journalists , investigators and witnesses who tried to pull back the curtain .
Allied with powerhouse Republicans , like Rep. Dick Cheney of Wyoming and Henry Hyde of Illinois , the neocons successfully beat back any full accounting of the two inter-related arms - for - hostages scandals , Iran-Contra and October Surprise .
That success was aided and abetted by bipartisan - seeking Democrats , such as Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana .
[ For details , see Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ]
Today ’s Parallel
The parallel between the Carter experience and what is now facing Obama is that Israel ’s current Likud government sees Obama as someone , like Carter , who might approach peace talks evenhandedly rather than with the pro-Israeli bias that has prevailed over the past three decades .
Reagan ’s Inauguration – which coincided with the release of the 52 hostages in Iran – also marked the opening for many neoconservatives to be credentialed into the Executive Branch and from those positions to advocate hard - line pro-Israeli policies .
Many of those same neocons returned in force under George W. Bush .
For instance , Bush put Elliott Abrams in a key Middle East policy role for eight years .
despite his Iran- Contra conviction ( and pardon from President George H.W. Bush ) .
Abrams served on the National Security Council and became an architect of the Iraq War .
The broader neocon strategy was to use U.S. military might to compel “ regime change ” in Middle Eastern nations considered hostile to Israel .
First on the list was Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq to be followed by Syria and Iran , with the ultimate goal of starving close - in enemies , like Lebanon ’s Hezbollah and Palestine ’s Hamas , of outside financial support .
Then , the thinking went , Israel could consolidate its control of the best Palestinian lands seized in 1967 and dictate peace terms to the Arabs .
But the grand neocon plan encountered greater than expected trouble in Iraq ( leading to the deaths of more than 4,300 American soldiers as well as estimated hundreds of thousands of Iraqis ) .
Now , after the crushing Republican defeat in 2008 , the new neocon game appears to be to help Israel wait out the Obama presidency .
Central to that strategy will be to harass and wound Obama enough so that he will lack the political clout to force any significant concessions on Israel ’s Likud government headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
That appears to be one of the reasons why leading neocons like The Weekly Standard ’s William Kristol have surfaced so prominently in the health care debate .
Normally , neocons are relatively moderate on social issues , reserving their intensity for foreign policy fights .
But Kristol urged the Republicans to “ go for the kill ” on Obama ’s embattled health - care plan .
“ With Obamacare on the ropes , there will be a temptation for opponents to let up on their criticism , and to try to appear constructive , or at least responsible , ” Kristol wrote on July 20 .
“ My advice , for what it 's worth : Resist the temptation .
This is no time to pull punches .
Go for the kill . ”
If Obama suffers what Sen. Jim DeMint , R - South Carolina , hopes will be his “ Waterloo ” on health care , the President will be weakened when it comes to other challenges .
Rather than take on the formidable Israel Lobby , Obama might be more inclined to accede to Netanyahu ’s demands related to a military strike against Iran .
Even if a weakened Obama wo n’t acquiesce to such an extreme action , Israel would stand a better chance at stalling peace talks with the Palestinians for the next 3 ½ years – until a more agreeable Republican might take the White House , much as Reagan replaced Carter .
‘ Hussein ’ Obama Already , pro-Likud elements in the Israeli media have been riling up the population for a prolonged battle with Obama – and some of that anti-Obama animosity is spilling over into the American press as well .
On Tuesday , the New York Times devoted half its op - ed page to an article by Israeli journalist Aluf Benn complaining that Obama , as President , had not yet traveled to Israel to deliver a speech , although he has made a major address in Cairo to the Islamic world and has spoken elsewhere , such as Europe , Russia and Africa .
“ But he has n’t bothered to speak directly to Israelis , ” Benn wrote , without bothering to note that Obama did visit Israel during the 2008 presidential campaign and , while there , denounced the rocket attacks that Hamas militants were firing into southern Israel .
Nor did Benn note that Obama has n’t addressed the people of China , India and many other countries .
Nevertheless , Benn ’s article offered a window into how the Israeli media is reacting to Obama .
“ Israeli rightists have – in columns , articles and public statements – taken to calling the president by his middle name , Hussein , as proof of his pro-Arab tendencies , ” Benn wrote .
Benn even cited criticism of Obama for his visit to the Nazi concentration camp at Buchenwald .
“ Here [ in Israel ] we are taught that Zionist determination and struggle – not guilt over the Holocaust – brought Jews a homeland , ” Benn wrote .
“ Mr. Obama ’s speech , which linked Israel ’s existence to the Jewish tragedy , infuriated many Israelis who sensed its closeness to the narrative of enemies like Mahmoud Ahmedinejad . ”
Given the hostility that Obama has engendered among right - wing Israelis and the continued influence of neocons in the U.S. political / media system , Obama , like Carter , appears surrounded by powerful adversaries , also including many business interests and social conservatives .
Obama is further disadvantaged by the fact that over the past three decades since Carter ’s presidency , the American Right has invested tens of billions of dollars to construct a vast media machine that disseminates its coordinated messages instantaneously all across the United States via print , radio , TV and the Internet .
Meanwhile , over that same period , American liberals and progressives essentially chose to ignore the need for a media infrastructure .
Even old - time liberal outlets , like The New Republic and The Atlantic , were taken over by neocon moneymen .
So , the stage is set for a sustained war against Obama and his presidency , with what is likely to include both the ugliness of the personal assault on Clinton and the secret maneuvering that proved so devastating against Carter .

DOJ will not appeal transgender veteran's $ 491,190 award against the Library of Congress
The US Department of Justice ( DOJ ) has decided not to appeal a federal district court ruling awarding transgender veteran Diane Schroer a total of $ 491,190 for the discrimination she suffered because of her sex after being refused a job with the Library of Congress .
The deadline for seeking an appeal was June 30 , 2009 .
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) has represented Schroer in her case ( Schroer v Billington , DDC , No 1:05 - cv-01090 - JR ) .
The Obama Administration 's decision whether to appeal the final ruling in the case has been closely watched , said the ACLU in a July 1 press release , and is consistent with the Administration 's campaign promises to not only protect transgender workers against discrimination and the Administration 's recent order taking steps to bar gender identity discrimination in federal employment .
" I am grateful that the court took the time to examine the case in detail and come to a fair and unbiased decision .
In that same light , I am gratified that the current administration saw this for what it was , a case of sex discrimination focused against transgender people , and recognized that it must end in this country , " said Schroer , an Army Special Forces veteran with 25 years service .
" The important signal that the Administration 's decision sends to all LGBT individuals gives me renewed hope and restores some of my shaken faith in what our country stands for . "
Background .
On April 29 , 2009 , the District Court for the District of Columbia awarded Schroer a total of $ 491,190 , including $ 183,653 for back pay and benefits , $ 300,000 for emotional pain and suffering , and $ 7,537.80 for other out - of - pocket expenses that were incurred as a result of the Library 's discriminatory conduct .
Schroer had applied for a terrorism specialist position at the Library of Congress .
Schroer was well - qualified for the job , having served in the US Armed Forces and having directed an organization that tracked and targeted international terrorist organizations .
At the time she applied for the position , Schroer was undergoing the process to transition from male to female , but had not yet reached the stage of presenting herself as a woman .
When she interviewed for the job , she used her legal , male name and presented herself to the decisionmaker with a male appearance .
The Library of Congress offered her the job .
After the hiring paperwork had been submitted , but before she actually started work , Schroer told the decisionmaker that consistent with her treatment , she would present herself at work as a woman , change her name and begin dressing in traditionally female clothing .
In part to allay any concerns the decisionmaker might have , she brought photographs of herself dressed as a woman .
The next day , the decisionmaker withdrew the job offer , stating that Schroer would not be a " good fit " for the Library of Congress .
With the help of the ACLU , Schroer filed suit under Title VII .
The Library moved to dismiss the case on different occasions , claiming that transsexuals were not covered under Title VII .
The motions were denied ( See 87 EPD ¶42,334 & 90 EPD ¶ 43,028 ) .
After a bench trial in August 2008 , District Court Judge James Robertson found that the Library of Congress had violated Title VII by discriminating against Schroer because of sex ( 91 EPD ¶ 43,333 ) .
While the court found that the Schroer 's gender identity made her Title VII sex bias claim under the sex stereotyping theory " difficult " because it " may look a great deal like discrimination based on transsexuality itself , " which nearly all federal courts have said is unprotected under Title VII , the court held that she was entitled to judgment on her claim .
The record revealed that the decisionmaker who evaluated her did so based on sex stereotypes .
The decisionmaker admitted that when she viewed the photographs of Schroer in traditionally feminine attire , with a feminine hairstyle and makeup , not only did she see a man in women 's clothing , but she believed that others at the Library would not take her seriously .
The decisionmaker also stated that she had difficulty understanding the Schroer 's decision to " transition " because of her prior Army and Special Forces background " as a particularly masculine kind of man . "
The court found that it did not matter for purposes of Title VII liability whether the Library withdrew its job offer because it perceived the applicant to be " an insufficiently masculine man , an insufficiently feminine woman , or an inherently gender - nonconforming transsexual " -- the comments of the decisionmaker could be parsed out each way .
The court also ruled that the Schroer was entitled to judgment " based on the language of the statute itself , " as the Library 's refusal to hire her " was literally discrimination ' because of ... sex . ' "
Drawing an analogy to religion , the court explained that an individual who changes religions from Christianity to Judaism cannot lawfully be fired by an employer that professes to harbor no bias toward Christians or Jews , but only " converts . "
" That would be a clear case of discrimination ' because of religion . '
No court would take seriously the notion that ' converts ' are not covered by the statute , " wrote the court .
Such should be the case where a plaintiff has changed her sex and faces discrimination as a result , the court reasoned .
" The Library refused to hire [ Schroer ] because she was changing her physical sex through surgery .
Likewise , it falls within the literal definition of ' because of ... sex . ' "
" We are pleased and relieved that the Obama Administration has decided to bring an end not only to years of hard - fought litigation but also to a painful chapter of Ms. Schroer 's extraordinary life , " said Sharon McGowan , a staff attorney with the ACLU LGBT Project .
" The Administration 's decision not to challenge this important civil rights ruling is a welcome sign that it intends to live up to its commitment to help end transgender discrimination in the workplace . "
" This case put employers on notice that discrimination against transgender individuals is like any other form of discrimination - counterproductive and against our principles as a nation , " added Schroer .
" But this case alone wo n't end the rampant discrimination that transgender people face throughout the country .
That 's why we need Congress to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination
Act that was introduced last week . "
In addition to McGowan , the legal team consisted of Ken Choe , Senior Staff Attorney for the ACLU LGBT Project , James Esseks , Litigation Director for the ACLU LGBT Project and Arthur Spitzer , Legal Director of the ACLU of the Nation 's Capital .

Taking a new hard line that news articles should not turn up on search engines and Web sites without permission , The Associated Press said Thursday that it would add software to each article that shows what limits apply to the rights to use it , and that notifies The A.P. about how the article is used .
Tom Curley , The A.P. ’s president and chief executive , said the company ’s position was that even minimal use of a news article online required a licensing agreement with the news organization that produced it .
In an interview , he specifically cited references that include a headline and a link to an article , a standard practice of search engines like Google , Bing and Yahoo , news aggregators and blogs .
Asked if that stance went further than The A.P. had gone before , he said , “ That ’s right . ”
The company envisions a campaign that goes far beyond The A.P. , a nonprofit corporation .
It wants the 1,400 American newspapers that own the company to join the effort and use its software .
“ If someone can build multibillion - dollar businesses out of keywords , we can build multihundred - million businesses out of headlines , and we ’re going to do that , ” Mr. Curley said .
The goal , he said , was not to have less use of the news articles , but to be paid for any use .

New Car Czar Deese Does n't Drive American
Obama 's new " car czar " Brian Deese .
( Bloomberg News )
Anyone interested in knowing what Brian Deese , the wunderkind tapped with revamping the nation 's dying automotive industry , drives to work ?
We were very interested to learn what Deese does n't drive .
His nicely worn car is n't a Chevy .
Or a Ford .
Or a Dodge .
Or any Big Three auto for that matter .
Nope .
Deese , the 31 - year - old tour de force behind President Obama 's Auto Task Force , has been seen tooling around town in a car that might make board members of General Motors shudder :
He drives a Honda , whose manufacturer is based in Japan .
One source describes Deese 's car as an " old , old , old silver Honda Civic two - door hatchback . "
Another tells us Deese 's two - toned Honda was never properly repainted after the new auto whiz got into an accident a few years ago .
The car still has Connecticut plates , a relic of his recent days at Yale Law School .
So , how did a young man who drives a Japanese car and has " never set foot in an automotive assembly plant " became the president 's so - called car czar ?
The irony does n't seem lost on Deese .
( To be fair , Honda has manufacturing plants in the United States . )
Meg Reilly , a Treasury Department spokeswoman who speaks on behalf of Deese , joked to the Sleuth , " Considering the amount of time he spends in his office , Brian may start saving gas money by sleeping in the back of his 11 - year - old Honda full time . "
The New York Times , in a recent profile of the sometimes bearded car czar , described his exhausting drive to Washington ( with his dog ) from Obama 's campaign headquarters in Chicago .
The Times quoted Deese as saying , " I slept in the parking lot of the G. M. plant in Lordstown , Ohio . "
( The article noted that the Lordstown plant produces the Pontiac G5 , a car that under Deese 's plan will disappear . )
But there was no mention of what kind of car he drove from Chicago to Washington .
A source close to Deese initially said , when contacted for comment , that " it sort of confounds us that anyone is all that interested " in what he drives .
But believe us , American autoworkers will care .
What do you think of America 's new automotive empresario showing up to work in his Japanese car ?
Sound off in the comments section .
Travelling with mind - boggling speed , a gleaming unidentified flying object zooming in from the boundless deep space , penetrates the Earth 's atmosphere , landing smoothly in Cold War - Washington , D.C. Encircled by large yet feeble military forces , the peaceful intergalactic ambassador , Klaatu , emerges from the mysterious vessel accompanied by the silently dangerous robot of incomprehensible power , Gort , only to witness firsthand the earthlings ' hospitality .
The sophisticated humanoid declares that he comes in peace ; however , he needs to assemble the world 's greatest minds to hear his merciful warning and a definitive ultimatum .
Is Klaatu the messenger of humanity 's doom ?
Written by Nick Riganas
Recently I read a discussion on an internal mailing list on whether or not it would be worthwhile to add a null dereferencing operator to C# .
For example , one proposed idea would allow the following expression .
object a = foo .? bar .? baz .? qux ;
This would assign the variable a the value null if any one of foo , bar , or baz is null instead ofthrowing a NullReferenceException .
It ’s a small , but potentially helpful , mitigation for the billion dollar mistake .
Sure enough , it did not take long for someone to claim that this syntax would be unnecessary if the code here was not violating the sacred Law of Demeter ( or LoD for short ) .
I think this phenomena is an analog to Godwin ’s Law and deserves its own name .
Let ’s call it the “ LoD Dot Counting Law ” :
As a discussion of a code expression with more than one dot grows longer , the probability that someone claims a Law of Demeter violation approaches 1 .
Count the dots and win a prize !
What is wrong with the claim that the above expression violates LoD ?
To answer that let ’s briefly cover the Law of Demeter .
I ’m not going to cover it in detail but rather point to posts that describe it in much better detail than I would .
The Many Forms of Demeter
The formal object form of the law can be summarized as :
A method of an object may only call methods of :
The object itself .
An argument of the method .
Any object created within the method .
Any direct properties / fields of the object .
A general formulation of the law is :
Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units : only units “ closely ” related to the current unit .
Or : Each unit should only talk to its friends ;
Do n’t talk to strangers .
This of course leads to the succinct form of the law :
Do n’t talk to strangers
In other words , try to avoid calling methods of an object that was returned by calling another method .
Often , people shorten the law to simply state “ use only one dot ” .
One of the key benefits of applying LoD is low coupling via encapsulation .
In his paper , The Paperboy , The Wallet , and The Law of Demeter ( PDF ) ( it ’s a relatively quick read so go ahead , I ’ll be here ) , David Bock provides a great illustration of this law with an analogy of a paperboy and a customer .
Rather than having a customer hand over his wallet to pay the paperboy , he instead has the paperboy request payment from the customer .
In answer to “ Why is this better ? ” David Bock gives these three reasons .
The first reason that this is better is because it better models the real world scenario …
The Paperboy code is now ‘ asking ’ the customer for a payment .
The paperboy does not have direct access to the wallet .
The second reason that this is better is because the Wallet class can now change , and the paperboy is completely isolated from that change …
The third , and probably most ‘ object - oriented ’ answer is that we are now free to change the implementation of ‘ getPayment ( ) ’ .
Note that the first benefit is an improvement not only in encapsulation but the abstraction is also improved .
Dot Counting Is Not The Point
You ’ll note that David does n’t list “ 50 % less dots in your code ! ” as a benefit of applying LoD .
The focus is on reduced coupling and improved encapsulation .
So going back to the initial expression , does foo.bar.baz.qux violate LoD ?
Like most things , it depends .
For example , suppose that foo is of type Something and it contains properties named Bar , Baz , and Qux which each simply return this .
In this semi- contrived example , the expression is not an LoD violation because each property returns the object itself and according to the first rule of LoD , “ you do not talk about LoD ” … wait … sorry … “ a method is free to call any properties of the object itself ” ( in a future post , I will cover the class form of LoD which seems to indicate that if Bar , Baz , and Qux return the same type , whether it ’s the same object or not , LoD is preserved ) .
This pattern is actually quite common with fluent interfaces where each method in a calling chain might return the object itself , but transformed in some way .
So we see that counting dots is not enough to indicate an LoD violation .
But lets dig deeper .
Are there other cases where counting dots leads do not indicate an LoD violation ?
More importantly , is it always a bad thing to violate LoD ?
Are there cases where an LoD violation might even be the right thing to do ?
Go Directly to Jail , Do Not Pass Go
Despite its name , violating the Law of Demeter will not get you on an episode of Cops nor is it some inviolable law of nature .
As the original paper points out , it was developed during design and implementation of the Demeter system ( hence the name ) and was held to be a law for the developers of that system .
The designers of the system felt that this practice ensured good Object - Oriented design :
The motivation behind the Law of Demeter is to ensure that the software is as modular as possible .
The law effectively reduces the occurrences of nested message sendings ( function calls ) and simplifies the methods .
However , while it was a law in the context of the Demeter system , whether it should hold the weight that calling it a Law implies is open to debate .
David Bock refers to it as an idiom :
This paper is going to talk about a particluar ( sic ) ‘ trick ’
I like , one that is probably better classified as an ‘ idiom ’ than a design pattern ( although it is a component in many different design patterns ) .
Martin Fowler suggests ( emphasis mine )
I ’d prefer it to be called the Occasionally Useful Suggestion of Demeter .
Personally , I think most developers are guilty of bad encapsulation and tight coupling .
I ’m a bit more worried about that than applying this law inappropriately ( though I worry about that too ) .
Those who have deep understanding of this guideline are the ones who are likely to know when it should n’t be applied .
For the rest of us mere mortals , I think it ’s important to at least think about this guideline and be intentional about applying or not applying it .
I Fought The Law and The Law Won
So what are the occasions when the Law of Demeter does n’t necessarily apply ?
There ’s some debate out there on the issue .
In his post , Misunderstanding the Law of Demeter , Daniel Manges argues that web page views are n’t domain objects and thus should n’t be subject to the Law of Demeter .
His argument hinges on a Rails example where you send an Order object to the view , but the view needs to display the customer ’s name .
<%= @order.customer.name %>
Counting two dots , he considers the change that would make it fit LoD :
<%= @order.customer_name %>
He then asks :
Why should an order have a customer_name ?
We ’re working with objects , an order should have a customer who has a name .
… when rendering a view , it ’s natural and expected that the view needs to branch out into the domain model .
Alex Blabs of Pivotal Labs takes issue with Daniel ’s post and argues that views aredomain objects and an order ought to have a customer_name property .
It ’s an interesting argument , but the following snippet of a comment by Zak Tamsen summarizes where I currently am on this subject ( though my mind is open ) .
because they do n’t .
the primary job of the views ( under discussion ) is to expose the internal state of objects for display purposes .
that is , they are expressly for data showing , not data hiding .
and there ’s the rub : these kind of views flagrantly violate encapsulation , LoD is all about encapsulation , and no amount of attribute delegation can reconcile this .
The problem as I see it with Alex ’s approach is where do you stop ?
Does the Order object encapsulate every property of Customer ?
What about sub-properties of the Customer ’s properties ?
It seems the decision to encapsulate the Customer ’s name is driven by the view ’s need to display it .
I would n’t want my domain object ’s interface to be driven by the needs of the view as that would violate separation of concerns .
There ’s another option which might be more common in the ASP .
NET MVC world than in the Rails world , I ’m not sure .
Why not have a view specific model object .
This would effectively be the bridge between the domain objects and the view and could encapsulate many of the these properties that the view needs to display .
Another case where an LoD violation might not be such a bad idea is in cases where the object structure is public and unlikely to change .
While in Norway , I had the opportunity to briefly chat with Michael Feathers about LoD and he pointed out the example of Excel ’s object model for tables and cells .
If LoD is about encapsulation ( aka information hiding ) then why would you hide the structure of an object where the structure is exactly what people are interested in and unlikely to change ?
Use It or Lose It
When I learn a new guideline or principle , I really like to dig into where the guideline breaks down .
Knowing where a guideline works , and what its advantages are is only half the story in really understanding it .
When I can explain where it does n’t work and what its disadvantages are , only then do I feel I ’m starting to gain understanding .
However , in writing about my attempts at understanding , it may come across that I ’m being critical of the guideline .
I want to be clear that I think the Law of Demeter is a very useful guideline and it applies in more cases than not .
It ’s one of the few principles that can point to an empirical study that may point to its efficacy .
In a Validation of Object - Oriented Design Metrics as Quality Indicators , the authors of the study provide evidence that suggests The Law of Demeter reduces the probability of software faults .
Still , I would hope that those who apply it do n’t do it blindly by counting dots .
Dot counting can help you find where to look for violations , but always keep in mind that the end goal is reducing coupling , not dots .
And yet we ’ve embraced it , asserting that there are people who are far too dangerous to even think about releasing but who cannot be put on trial because we have no real evidence that they have committed any crime , or because we ’ve tortured them and therefore the evidence would not be admissible , or whatever .
President Obama is O.K. with this ( he calls it “ prolonged detention ” ) , but he wants to make sure it is carried out  here comes the oxymoron  fairly and nonabusively .
Proof of guilt ?
In 21st - century America , there is no longer any need for such annoyances .
Human rights ?
Ha-ha .
That ’s a good one .
Also distressing is the curtain of secrecy the Obama administration has kept drawn over shameful abuses that should be brought into the light of day .
Back in April , the administration rightly released the “ torture memos ” detailing the gruesome interrogation techniques unleashed by the Bush crowd .
But last month , Mr. Obama apparently tripped over his own instincts and reversed his initial decision to release photos of American soldiers engaged in the brutal abuse of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Image Bob Herbert
We saw the profound effect of the disclosure of the photos from Abu Ghraib in 2004 .
Imagine if they had never been released .
Now , in an affront to a society that is supposed to be intelligent and free , the Obama administration is trying to sit on photos that are just as important for Americans to see .
The president ’s argument for trying to block the court - ordered release of the photos is a demoralizing echo of the embarrassingly empty rhetoric of the Bush years :
“ The most direct consequence of releasing them , I believe , would be to further inflame anti-American opinion and to put our troops in danger . ”
Here ’s a truism :
The wealthiest 1 percent have never had it so good .
According to government figures , 1 - percenters ’ share of America ’s total income is the highest it ’s been since 1929 , and their tax rates are the lowest they ’ve faced in two decades .
Through bonuses , many 1 - percenters will profit from the $ 23 trillion in bailout largesse the Treasury Department now says could be headed to financial firms .
And , most of them benefit from IRS decisions to reduce millionaire audits and collect zero taxes from the majority of major corporations .
But what really makes the ultrawealthy so fortunate , what truly separates this moment from a run -of - the - mill Gilded Age , is the unprecedented protection the 1 - percenters have bought for themselves on the most pressing issues .
To review : With 22,000 Americans dying each year because they lack health insurance , Congress is considering universal health care legislation financed by a surcharge on income above $ 280,000 — that is , a levy almost exclusively on 1 - percenters .
This surtax would graze just 5 percent of small businesses and would recoup only part of the $ 700 billion the 1 - percenters received from the Bush tax cuts .
In fact , it is so minuscule , those making $ 1 million annually would pay just $ 9,000 more in taxes every year — or nine - tenths of 1 percent of their 12 - month haul .
Nonetheless , the 1 - percenters have deployed an army to destroy the initiative before it makes progress .
The foot soldiers are the Land Rover Liberals .
These Democratic lawmakers secure their lefty labels by wearing pink - ribbon lapel pins and supporting good causes like abortion rights .
However , being affluent and / or from affluent districts , they routinely drive their luxury cars over middle - class economic interests .
Hence , this week ’s letter from Boulder , Colo. , dot - com tycoon Rep. Jared Polis , D , and other Land Rover Liberals calling for the surtax ’s death .
Echoing that demand are the Corrupt Cowboys — those like Sen. Max Baucus , D - Mont. , who come from the heartland ’s culturally conservative and economically impoverished locales .
These cavalrymen in both parties quietly build insurmountable campaign war chests as the biggest corporate fundraisers in Congress .
At the same time , they publicly preen as jes ’ folks , make twangy references to “ voters back home , ” and now promise to kill the health care surtax because they say that ’s what their communities want .
Cash payoffs made , re-elections purchased , the absurd story somehow goes that because blue - collar constituents in Flyover America like guns and love Jesus , they must also reflexively adore politicians who defend 1 - percenters ’ bounty .
That fantastical fairly tale , of course , could n’t exist without the Millionaire Media — the elite journalists and opinion - mongers who represent corporate media conglomerates and / or are themselves extremely wealthy .
Ignoring all the data about inequality , they legitimize the assertions of the 1 - percenters ’ first two battalions , while actually claiming America ’s fat cats are unfairly persecuted .
For example , Washington
Post editors deride surtax proponents for allegedly believing “ the rich alone can fund government . ”
Likewise , Wall Street Journal correspondent Jonathan Weisman wonders why the surtax “ soak (s ) the rich ” by unduly “ lumping all of the problems of the finances of the United States on 1 percent of ( its ) households ? ”
And most brazenly , NBC ’s Meredith Vieira asks President Obama why the surtax is intent on “ punishing the rich . ”
For his part , Obama has responded with characteristic coolness — and a powerful counterstrike .
“ No , it ’s not punishing the rich , ” he said .
“ If I can afford to do a little bit more so that a whole bunch of families out there have a little more security , when I already have security , that ’s part of being a community . ”
If any volley can thwart this latest attack of the 1 - percenters , it is that simple idea .

Recounts a fable of a pop rock band formed a year after the Beatles took America by storm in early 1964 .
Jazz aficionado Guy Patterson , unhappily toiling in the family appliance store , is recruited into the band the Oneders ( later renamed the Wonders ) after regular drummer Chad breaks his arm .
After Guy injects a four / four rock beat into lead singer Jimmy 's ballad , the song 's undeniable pop power flings the Wonders into a brief whirlwind of success , telling the tale of many American bands who attempted to grab the brass ring of rock and roll in the wake of the British Invasion .

Obviously the issue is that the phone becomes useless after a day or so during an extended power outage .
I believe the 8 hour limit is without phone usage .
If one is on the phone the backup power reserve drops significantly , perhaps to as low as two hours .

That is correct .
The 8 hour battery kicks in the minute the power goes out , and is used to power the ONT .
After the initial 8 hours is up you are out of luck , unless you have a generator or some other setup at your house .

I am not sure how many different ONT 's Verizon has deployed , or the differing features of each .
However as nice as 2 extra hours is , during a lengthy emergency its almost pointless .
The real issue is that 99 % of Verizon subs have no idea what you just said .
When they install FIOS at a house , the take away the copper ( in most cases ) and run the phone service through the ONT .
The average person wont know that anything is different , that is until the power goes out for a few hours and the battery backup craps out on them .....

I lost power for over 4 days after a Hurricane .
I had Two POTS Lines .
The line that was tied to the Central Office via a Subscriber Line Carrier System failed after about 9 Hours .
The other line ran directly to the Central Office on Copper and remained operational for the duration of the power outage .
If one is connected to the Central Office via Subscriber Line Carrier do not expect to have telephone service during long term power outages .
The design criteria for SLC is eight to twelve hours of battery backup .

Indeed .
The Florida PSC does not view the SLC as a remote CO ( even tho that is actually what they are ) and has no statutory requirement for battery capacity .
Battery backup , while it is supposed to be good for 8 - 24 hours , does n't always happen .
I had to report the local ILEC to the PSC twice because the SLC had zero battery capacity .
When you live in the boonies , and the power fails , its hard to call the power utility if the POTS line fails as well .
I 'll leave it the imagination of the reader who the ILEC might be Indeed .

Granted that nature sometimes has a way of doing this with bad ice storms and the like , but in instances like that I would n't be staying at my home anyway .

If land lines are that important to our safety and security , why does n't the Obama Administration create another " Stimulus " Package and give land lines away free to everyone in the country ?
Surely it would end the suffering of the millions of underprivileged without unlimited long distance home telephone service and the ability to connect to 1-976 numbers .

You can save on landline costs while preserving 911 ability
You can still save money on landline costs by buying the low measured rate phone service ( $ 8 + taxes + fees ) for about $ 15 / mo .
This maintains 911 capability , use during power outages , etc .
There are other ways to get your long distance calling at rates cheaper than landlines bundled with unlimited calling while still maintaining landline security for emergencies .

You can save on landline costs while preserving 911 ability I cancelled my landline but my taxes were almost as much as what I was supposed to be paying a month .
I think mine was 18 a month and by the time all the taxes and surcharges were put on it was 32 .

I still have flat - rate local service , so it costs $ 21 per month .
I could knock a few bucks off of this by going to a measured service .
My POTS is still a lot cheaper than Cablevision 's phone service .
And there 's no way I 'd trust Cablevision with a 911 call .

Please do n't leave us !

Should n't that campaign be promoting the virtues of renting a phone from AT&T as well ?
After all what can do you if your personal corded telephone broke while you needed to dial 911 , only AT&T can ensure your uninterrupted access to emergency services via a fashionable avocado green , 30lb desk phone .
Do n't even thing about using a payphone , AT&T has been busy removing them for your convenience .

Member calling 911
In the past ten years I 've called 911 twice ; at neither time was I home and both involved traffic accidents .
We never bothered installing one of the useless things when we built our house .
Why pay $ 30 a month for telemarketers and politicians to call at all hours ?

If landlines were cheap and without horrible taxes , I would keep mine .
It 's realiable .
The problem is it is neither .
It costs about $ 12 then another $ 15 for taxes .
Want caller id ?
That 'll be $ 7.95 a month .

I have a cable VoIP service for $ 30 / month , and it includes a decent amount of features including CID and Canada calling ( which I use ) .
POTS service is ( or was ) $ 30 / month ... $ 40 / month if you want any features like CID , and an extra $ 5 / month for Canada calling .. and an extra $ 13 / month in fees .
My AT&T POTS service typically was $ 57 - $ 58 / month .
For almost $ 30 / month , I can fill up my minivan ( when gas was $ 2.40 / gallon ) .

The Baby Bells which were created in 1982 , and have been mostly reunited , had a aversion to " Stranded Capacity " .
Stranded Capacity results when facilities stop generating revenue when replaced by new technology .
For example the bean counters set the pricing for PABX Trunks to be delivered via T - 1 or PRI Circuits , so that they would not compete cost wise , with physical Ground Start Trunks .
Telephone wanted to show a financial return in the form of revenue from their earlier investment in analog trunks .
If Telephone had thousands of cable pairs and ground start terminals not generating revenue because a new technology had replaced them , that would pay havoc with what they disclose in their annual report .
That is one of the reasons that some companies are dragging their feet when it comes to installing fiber and want customers to keep their POTS Lines .
If Telephone is sincere in wanting to keep customers they would eliminate the now obsolete Central Office Connection Charge which can add over $ 6.00 per line to the local phone bill .
The Central Office Connection Charge mutated out of the ( CALC ) Customer Access Line Charge and is one of Telephone 's undisclosed unfee .
The FCC allowed the telephone companies to levy the charge when the Bell System was broken up .
It was to replace part of the revenue received by local telephone companies from Toll Separations from the Old AT&T Long Lines Division .
The bottom line is that to retain POTS customers
Telephone is going to have to lower prices and include more features at no additional charge .
Lower revenue is better than no revenue at all .

I have caller ID for $ 10 / month ( which I 'm probably going to cancel ) .
I save second - receiver fees from DiSH because both receivers are connected to the same phone line .
I have a dialup account from Earthlink that used to get used fairly often , to check on Time - Warner outages .
Besides , my DSL provider requires me to have telephone service .

I do n't understand the call quality claim .
When I had a POTS line , the signal to noise ratio was not as good as either Vonage or the cable company 's solution ( VOIP too -- I think ) .
Provided the codec uses enough bandwidth , one would expect this since an analog signal that travels only the wires in your house will be far superior to one that has to travel a much longer distance from your house to the CO or at the very least , one of those big green boxes that concentrates several lines on some sort of backhaul to the CO .
As proof , once I dumped my POTS , I had to reduce the volume on the phones in my house that had them .
Otherwise it was too loud !
When I had Vonage quality did suffer when there were HSI problems .
However , I have not experienced such issues using the cable company 's solution .
( It 's not affected by HSI traffic problems ... )

Yes .
And AT&T is coming out with a " Peanut Phone " that steadily introduces extremely small amounts of peanut vapor into your mouth as you talk .
The tech is only available via land lines however , which is why AT&T is pushing their landline service to folks who suffer from peanut allergies .

A lot of telephone companies have a dialtone already active weather you have phone service or not .
You use this dialtone to order telephone service or it can be used to dial 911 .
Just keep a phone connected for 911 and check it once a month to determine if you have a dialtone still or not and pay nothing for 911 service .

Try living with a life threatening condition with a cell I tried to call 911 on my cell phone both times I could get through .
Comcast was knocked out in Tacoma , One of my mother patients lost all phone contact ,
If she had an attack she would have died .
Mom considered moving her in to the home until Comcast was able to restore the cable and phones a week latter .
If anybody has a life threatening condition I can not recommend ether cell phones or VOIP .
Anaphylactic shock is not joke Karl ,
One could die if one can not get medical attention quickly and you trust in cell phone and dislike for corporations show you absolute ignorance or wiliness to put your ideology over safety and life and death decisions

That 's for a literally no features touch tone unlimited usage line .
I do n't know what bill you 're looking at to come up with $ 40 a month for a plain line with no features .
Cox , perhaps ?
You could get metered service and get 200 minutes of outbound calling and unlimited minutes of inbound calling for under $ 10 a month , although you can't have metered and unlimited to the same address .
Edit : I lied .
It was $ 14 before taxes .
$ 18.10 after taxes .
It costs $ 14 a month all in , at least if you 're served from the Jenks CO .
5 years ago it was $ 13 .
I had that service until I moved .

I think the BYOB VoIP is called 3G Femtocells / AT&T Branded Microcell service .
It is in trails right now , and public press releases state a public release sometime later in 2009
I believe you will get unlimited usage when placing calls from your home MicroCell , but do n't quote me on that .
And since the Internet is the backhaul for your 3G Cell Phone Call , in that sense it is VoIP ...

Never had a landline , might not ever .

My cell service is great , and the only time it does n't work reliably is when college students are coming and going .
Even then , it 's been vastly improved in the past year or so .
Still convincing my parents to keep one as they live out of town and they understand that cell phones are not as reliable .
They also like to be able to talk " un-metered " - my dad is on my plan and even though it 's 1400 minutes / month ( with free nights / weekends / incoming calls ... ) , it 's easily possible to get overages ( even though we have n't yet ) .
Basically , it is worth keeping for emergencies and for " un-metered " usage .
I realize there are " unlimited " cell plans , but it 's not worth it for us at this point .
The other thing that really REALLY pisses me off is that AT&T has slacked so much with " naked " DSL service .
It might be available by now , but I truly do n't care .
Cox has been very responsive and has solved internet issues quickly enough - not to mention it 's much faster .
Aside from never really marketing me a cheap landline deal , they 've utterly failed to EVER market " naked " DSL service .
If they offered a good deal on DSL , without forcing a phone plan , I might 've considered it at one point .
Since , however , they 've been completely arrogant and up tight about it , I doubt they 'll ever see me as a customer .
I 'd rather wait for FIOS and get a freaking generator .
That said , I 'm still not a fan of Verizon ripping out copper when they install fiber - I think they should be legally obliged to leave your phone service alone on copper due to reliability , and because there 's no real need to destroy something that works so well - what about " being green " here

WASHINGTON  The Obama administration has gone on the record again that it will not use federal stimulus money to prop up California as it wrestles with its fiscal problems .
“ It ’s obviously not an easy time for the State of California , ” the White House spokesman , Robert Gibbs , said Tuesday at a briefing after The Washington Post reported that top state officials had requested aid .
“ We ’ll continue to monitor the challenges that they have , but this budgetary problem unfortunately is one that they ’re going to have to solve . ”
But a spokesman for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger took issue with The Post ’s article , which said officials had gone to the administration “ hat in hand . ”
Mr. Schwarzenegger ’s communications director , Matt David , said : “ We are in complete agreement with the White House that California should be solving its budgetary problems on its own without a bailout from the federal government .
Governor Schwarzenegger has stressed time and again that we need to get our own fiscal house in order , and that ’s exactly what he has proposed to do .
The governor has not asked for federal assistance to address California ’s fiscal crisis . ”
Trivia
In subsequent interviews , Dreyfuss reiterated what he said of his experience working with Murray .
He further alleged in 2019 that at one point during the production , Murray screamed at him while intoxicated , telling him " Everyone hates you !
You are tolerated ! " and then threw an ashtray at him .
Murray , on the other hand , later stated when he guest appeared on The Howard Stern Show in 2014 , " I really try to make the other actor look good whenever I can ... I try to make the other person look good .
In this particular film , annoying Dreyfuss , which I kind of got to enjoy I gotta confess -- but I did n't try to annoy him off the screen . "
Producer Laura Ziskin recalled having a disagreement with Murray which led him to toss her into a lake .
Ziskin confirmed in 2003 , " Bill also threatened to throw me across the parking lot and then broke my sunglasses and threw them across the parking lot .
I was furious and outraged at the time , but having produced a dozen movies , I can safely say it is not common behavior . "

Imagine , for a moment , how it might sound to turn on the news one day and hear that the head of the A.C.L.U. had vanished from his home in the predawn hours .
Or , think how America might be different today if a pesky young Thurgood Marshall had been silenced using an obscure tax rule and kept out of the courts .
At around 5 A.M. on Wednesday , Chinese authorities visited the home of Xu Zhiyong , a prominent legal scholar and elected legislator in Beijing , and led him away .
He has not been heard from again .
Unless something changes , he is likely to stay away for a long time , with or without formal charges .
Anyone with an interest in China , its economy , its place in the world , or the kind of future it will fashion , please take note : this is a big deal .
Xu might not have reached Marshall status yet , but he is as close as China gets to a public - interest icon .
He teaches law at the Beijing University of Post and Telecommunications .
He has also run the Open Constitution Initiative , a legal - aid and research organization that worked on many of China ’s pathbreaking cases .
He and his colleagues had investigated the Sanlu milk scandal , in which dangerous baby formula harmed children ’s health , and assisted people who had been locked up by local officials in secret undeclared jails .
All of those activities are emphatically consistent with the goals of the Chinese government , even if they angered the local bureaucrats who were caught in the act .
Xu has never set out to undermine one - party rule ; he is enforcing rights guaranteed in the Chinese Constitution .
He has enough faith in the system that he joined it : in 2003 , he ran for and won a seat as a legislator in his local district assembly , one of the few independent candidates to be elected in an open , contested election .
He even received the recognition , rare among activists , of being profiled last year in a Chinese newspaper .
“ I have taken part in politics in pursuit of a better and more civilized nation , ” he said at the time .
“ I am determined to prove to the citizens across the country that politics should be desirable . ”
His work naturally angered parts of China ’s bureaucracy , and pressure on him mounted .
On July 14th , the Open Constitution Initiative , also known as Gongmeng , was fined 1.42 million RMB for “ tax evasion . ”
Then it was banned .
Xu was to have had his day in court , except he was picked up before he could .
Separately , a young colleague named Zhuang Lu has also been detained , and her whereabouts are unknown .
It is easy to look at China ’s list of high - profile detentions and rationalize them : that guy was a cowboy , or , things in China are improving , and we have to keep it in context .
Sorry .
Not this time .
Xu is no cowboy .
As a Time magazine reporter wrote , in 2007 , “ Xu is probably the person most committed to public service that I ’ve met in China , and possibly in my whole life . ”
Moreover , his work is as intimately connected to the broader context of China ’s economic and political future as you can get .
When the U.S. and China wrapped up a round of strategic and economic talks this week , they issued a joint press release that affirmed “ the importance of the rule of law to our two countries . ”
Hu Jintao is quoted every chance he gets — “ the rule of law should let the people be the masters of the country ” — talking about exactly the kind of legal professionalism that Xu stands for .
Jeffrey Prescott , the deputy director of Yale ’s China Law Center , which has worked with Xu and his organization since 2004 , tells me :
He is doing careful , thoughtful , and important work of international caliber — not much different than what mainstream public interest lawyers and scholars do every day in the U.S. or anywhere else .
Xu and his colleagues are doing research into China ’s problems , making efforts to promote constructive ideas for legal reform , and helping provide legal assistance to weak and marginalized groups in society … .
Any of this would make Dr. Xu an important figure .
But , above all , it is his human qualities that make him truly compelling .
He is someone of rare idealism , judgment , commitment to law , selfless dedication , and fundamental decency .
So that makes his detention very hard to understand .
For China , and those who have given their careers to studying and negotiating with it , this is a big test .
It ’s not too late for Xu to be released before the full bureaucracy gets too invested in holding him , but time is limited .
China deserves better than this kind of behavior .
Xu— or Hu Jintao — would be the first to tell you that .

mysterious , and so different from the other boys . "
In the distance , Theo snarled and swung his tail a few times , inadvertently sweeping the legs of a passing student .
" Who , you mean Theo ? "
Bonita 's friend - person smiled off in the direction of Theo , chewing gum or twirling her hair or something .
" Theo 'smysterious .
No one knows much about him , but he 's been around forever .
He only disappeared once , three years ago , when he drove across country on his motorcycle .
He 's so dreamy .
He lives just outside of town in Dragon Hills . "
If Bonita had responsible parents , they'd have taught her to ask questions like " Why is he at our school if he does n't live in this town ? " and " How old must he be if he already had a motorcycle license three years ago , when we were all 12 ? "
Unfortunately , Bonita 's parents really only existed so they could disapprove of her young love , and I can't even totally remember if she had both parents or if one of them died at some point .
And I am not flipping back to check , so you can just forget it .
" Keep dreaming , Bonnie , " Bonita 's friend said .
Bonita had never had a nickname before .
She reacted with indifference .
" Theo does n't date anybody .
He 's out of everyone 's league .
See you in class . "
She 's not in the book anymore .
While Bonita 's friend walked off in a direction , Bonita continued to watch the mysterious and mysterious Theo .
She still could n't quite put her finger on what exactly it was that separated
Theo from the other boys , even as she sat watching him blast fire from his gaping mouth .
She sat there emotionlessly , drool trickling down her chin , watching Theo for a little while longer .
Finally , after what seemed like an eternity , but probably was n't , Theo approached her , his horns pointing out like dongs atop his head , and his dong , confident and powerful , protruding from his dong - region like a massive horn .
" You must be Bonita , " Theo said , his voice low and warm , and with just a hint of mischief .
He sounded the way that drives girls crazy , like an American Idol or an iPod or whatever .
His eyes , the color of coals ( black ) , seemed to be staring directly into Bonita 's soul .
A warming chill sent sweaty shivers up Bonita 's spine .
" I am , " Bonita said , registering neither shock nor joy at the realization that Theo knew her name .
" I was about to go to lunch , " Theo whispered , his pointed dragon teeth looking like a bunch of finely sharpened dongs .
" Are you hungry ? " " No . "
Vatican U - turn as it gives new Harry Potter film its seal of approval
The Vatican has broken with its traditional stance on Harry Potter and given the new film out tomorrow its seal of approval .
In a review of the blockbuster the official Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano said Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince made clear the difference between '' good and evil ' .
Under the headline ' Magic is no longer a game of surprise , ' reviewer Gaetano Vallini praised the film 's special effects and the development of the lead characters saying they were ' far more credible ' than previous episodes .
This contrasts with comments made in 2003 when , before becoming Pope Benedict XVI , Cardinal Ratzinger criticised the ' subtle seductions ' contained in the Potter series which could ' corrupt the Christian faith ' in impressionable young children .
The film , the sixth in the series , again stars Daniel Radcliffe , as the teen wizard and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger , pictured together
The film , the sixth in the series written by author JK Rowling , again stars Daniel Radcliffe , as the teen wizard and the usual cast of Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley .
In his review , Vallini said that the ' mixture of supernatural suspense and romance which has reached the right balance , making the the roles more credible .
'' The characters have grown from adolescents into adults and at the same time the tone of the story has grown and as a result entertainment has benefited ' .
U-turn :
The Vatican has given its seal of approval to the latest Harry Potter film , six years after future Pope Cardinal Ratzinger criticised the ' subtle seductions ' in the movies
Vallini added that the line ' between good and evil was clearly marked , and it makes clear that doing good is right and that in some cases this involves hard work and sacrifices ' .
He closed his review by saying that : ' At the end of the film what remains is not he scenes of magic but these of the values such as friendship , altruism , loyalty and the giving of one 's self . '
The glowing praise is a complete turnaround of what L'Osservatore Romano wrote last year in which it said Harry Potter was the ' wrong kind of hero ' .
In that article it also said Harry Potter transmitted 'a vision of the world and the human being full of deep mistakes and dangerous suggestions , even more seductive since it is mixed with half - truths and compelling story - telling ' .
The Vatican 's praise follows the sharp criticism of the Harry Potter series by a conservative Austrian priest at the center of a church crisis earlier this year .
The Rev. Gerhard Maria Wagner had characterized Harry Potter novels as Satanism , while also suggesting Hurricane Katrina , which ravaged New Orleans and surrounding areas , was provoked by sin .
Pope Benedict XVI promoted Wager to the post of auxiliary bishop in Linz , Austria 's third largest city , in January .
But amid an outcry among Austrian Catholics over his comments , Wagner eventually gave up the promotion .

The Free Market and its Enemies
A book of Quotes assembled by James R. Cook Page 4
“ Highly graduated taxation realizes most completely the supreme anger of democracy .
Creating a state of things in which one class imposes on another burdens which it is not asked to share , and impels the state into vast schemes of extravagance , under the belief that the whole costs will be thrown upon others . ”
W.E.H. Lecky
“ Here in the united States , we ’ve seen failure of mass programs of redistribution and the financial crisis to which they give rise .
And yet many continue to defend and promote them . ”
Robert A. Sirico
“ Neither the entrepreneurs nor the farmers nor the capitalists determine what has to be produced .
The consumers do that . ” Ludwig Von Mises
“ To enslave a people , give them money they did not earn . ”
James Cook
“ What … can a government do to help the poor ?
The only answer is the libertarian answer :
Get ot of the way . ”
Murray N. Rothbard
“ To assign to everybody his proper place in society is the task of the consumers .
Their buying and abstention from buying is instrumental in determining each individual ’s social position .
Ludwig Von Mises
“ Government –to - government aid rests on socialistic assumptions and promotes socialism and stagnation , whereas private foreign investment rests on capitalistic assumptions and promotes private enterprise and maximum economic growth . ”
Henry Hazlitt
“ The Market is color blind . ” W.H. Hutt
“ Once a bureau is created its staff becomes a tenacious political grou , well placed to defend its budget and to make a case of expanding its activities . ”
Robert Higgs
“ The truth is that the characteristic feature of capitalism was and is mass production for the needs of the masses . ”
Ludwig Von Mises
“ To write about business one should be in business , just as in writing about Tasmania one should visit Tasmania . ”
James Cook
“ Under capitalism men provide for themselves , while under socialism they are provided for . ” Ludwig Von Mises
Defence , security and intelligence grandees will next week launch a critique of the government 's strategy for dealing with terror , including a demand that ministers should show that Britain has " unambiguously " renounced the use of torture .
They will argue that the government must demonstrate that it is " on the right side " when it comes to the abuse of detainees and the practice of extraordinary rendition .
The 180 - page final report of the Institute of Public Policy Research 's security commission , to be published on Tuesday , will recommend that the government ensures that its own agents employ only legal methods and robustly challenge alleged or suspected torture .
The commission also warns that control orders and other measures that " subvert the rule of normal law " can provide a propaganda coup for radical jihadi groups .
The criticism of official policy across a range of counter - terrorism and human rights issues is expected to prove highly influential as many of its figures come from the security and defence establishment .
The commission was jointly chaired by the former Nato secretary - general , Lord Robertson , and the former Liberal Democrat leader , Lord Ashdown .
Its final report has been signed off by commissioners who include the former chief of the defence staff , Lord Guthrie ; the former British ambassador to the UN , Sir Jeremy Greenstock ; and the former Cabinet Office security and intelligence coordinator , Sir David Omand .
The two - year study concludes that a commitment to the rule of law at home and abroad and a willingness to uphold and protect human rights are fundamental to the legitimacy of a national security strategy .
Their recommendations include :
• Suspected terrorists should be dealt with using the standard criminal justice system ;
• Ways need to be found to use intercept evidence in criminal trials without prejudicing national security ;
• Deporting terror suspects to countries that practice torture on the basis of diplomatic assurances is unacceptable unless accompanied by robust independent monitoring to ensure their safety ;
• Britain should sign the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance .
The report also examines the government 's Prevent strategy to counter radicalisation and terrorism within Britain and warns that there have been occasions where enforcement activity has backfired .
" Prevent must not become Provoke .
Some of the pursuit and disruption tactics employed have had just such unintended consequences .
" This damages a counter - terrorism strategy that must be enacted ' amongst the people ' and that is largely predicated on community trust and confidence in the state and its agents , " says the final report seen by the Guardian .
It says the police and security services must recruit more Muslim staff and also further review the use of language to build on the decision not to use phrases such as the " war on terror " .
On torture , the authors say they pass no judgment on the allegations in the case of Binyam Mohamed , the British resident released after more than four years ' detention at Guantánamo Bay .
" However , in our view , in ordering the closure of Guantánamo Bay , the ending of CIA practices of enforced disappearances and secret detentions forbidding torture , President Obama is re-establishing Amercian legitimacy in the eyes of the rest of the world .
In the UK , we too must consider what more we can do to be unambiguously on the right side of these issues . "
On the rule of law in Britain , the security commission stops short of calling for control orders and lengthy period of pre-charge detention to be scrapped , but says that both involve suspending the legal right of habeas corpus - the right of the accused to hear the evidence against them .
" We recognise the difficulties in this area but we must also recognise that developments that subvert the rule of normal law , however well - intentioned , can be a propaganda coup for the radical and neo - jihadi groups we are trying to combat , " they warn .
The security and defence experts add that legitimate grievances of isolated minority groups , including over British foreign policy , have to be addressed .
They say that a divided and grievance - ridden society is unlikely to prove a resilient one when subjected to the extreme disruptions that future security scenarios might bring .

I just recently learned that soft hyphens are now usable and effective in HTML markup , as they are finally supported in a sensible way by most modern browsers .
( Pity Jukka Korpela , author of the preceding link : he has been writing that document for twelve years . )
The soft hyphen — which has the entity code ­ or ­ or ­ — can be interpreted as a hyphenation hint , letting the browser or rendering engine know where are the ideal places to break up a long word , leaving a hyphen behind , should it encroach on the margin .
The soft hyphen is not displayed if the word is not broken upon rendering .
I have tested the below and verified that it works as intended in Safari 3 and 4 on a Mac ; IE 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 on Windows ; and Firefox 3.0 and 3.5 anywhere .
( Firefox 2.0 ignores soft hyphens . )
Opera on Vista and OS X render perfectly , according to readers .
This is a test of how various browsers handle soft hyphens .
Here are a few long , or long­ish , words that should help us see how things go when one of them gets near a margin : asyn­chron­ous uni­later­al un­pre­medi­tated guber­na­torial ante­delu­vian http://­recov­er­ing­phys­i­cist­.com ex­acer­bat­ed on­o­ma­to­poe­ic ex­has­perat­ed re­barb­a­tive per­hel­ion ante­delu­vian asyn­chron­ous ex­acer­bat­ed ex­has­perat­ed guber­na­torial on­o­ma­to­poe­ic per­hel­ion re­barb­a­tive un­pre­medi­tated uni­later­al .
This discussion on Reddit contains lots of detail about the behavior in other browsers and operating systems .
As a Reddit commenter pointed out , a disadvantage of using soft hyphens is that what gets copied onto a clipboard from the rendered text is unpredictable .
You might expect that if you mark and copy the text above , then paste it into a text editor , you would see hyphens in those words that happen to break at the margin .
On the Mac using Safari 4 , all the soft hyphens in the source come through the clipboard as regular hyphens .
It ’s reported that using Safari 4 on Windows results in spaces where the soft hyphens were .
Another problem : a word containing a soft hyphen may not be found by searching on the page from within the browser .
For example , in order to find the word “ exacerbated ” on this page ( in the example block above ) , I found “ ex acer bat ed ” to be the string that worked .
President Obama placed his political capital on the line Monday and reiterated his threat to veto a military spending bill unless the Senate removed $ 1.75 billion set aside to buy seven additional F - 22 fighter jets .
Mr. Obama stepped up his campaign after liberal Democrats like Senators Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry of Massachusetts said they supported the purchases , arguing that the program would retain high - paying jobs in many districts nationwide .
The F - 22 , the world ’s costliest fighter jet , is the most prominent weapons system that Mr. Obama wants to cancel or cut in his plan to rein in military spending .
A vote by the Senate to keep producing the plane would be an embarrassing setback for him .
Military analysts say it has always been hard to persuade Congress to halt big weapons programs like the F - 22 , made by Lockheed Martin , which has suppliers in 44 states and provides 25,000 jobs .
JUAN GONZALEZ :
We begin today with the latest news of the ship that was seized by the Israeli military Tuesday as it tried to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza .
Israeli forces boarded the ship and towed it to the Israeli port of Ashdod .
The twenty - one activists on board include former Congress member and presidential candidate Cynthia McKinney and the Irish peace activist and Nobel laureate Mairead Maguire .
Huwaida Arraf and Lubna Masarwa were released , while the other nineteen remain in detention .
AMY GOODMAN : Huwaida Arraf is the founder of the Free Gaza movement .
She joins us now on the phone from Israel .
Huwaida , welcome to Democracy Now !
Explain why you took this boat trying to get to Gaza and then what happened to you on board .
HUWAIDA ARRAF : [ inaudible ]
Hello to you all .
The purpose of our mission was to highlight to the international community that what Israel is doing to Gaza is blatantly illegal , and our government is n’t doing anything about it .
Israel constantly claims that their policies are based on security , but what they ’re doing — imposing collective punishment on an entire civilian population .
We were carrying on our very , very small boat some medical aid , some rebuilding supplies , because after the January — December - January assault on Gaza , thousands of homes have been destroyed , tens of hospitals and schools all demolished .
And , you know , the donor community supposedly pledged [ inaudible ] Gaza , but no one is saying anything .
Not one country is saying anything about the fact [ inaudible ] the entire Gaza Strip , and not one bag of cement [ inaudible ]
— AMY GOODMAN : Huwaida , we ’re going to interrupt for a minute , because , Juan , it sounds like we have someone else from a jail cell in Israel .
JUAN GONZALEZ : Yes , it sounds like we have Mairead Maguire , the Nobel Prize winner , on the phone from her jail cell .
Welcome to Democracy Now !
MAIREAD MAGUIRE :
Thank you very much , indeed .
Thank you .
JUAN GONZALEZ : Could you tell us what is going on right now with you and the others who are being detained ?
MAIREAD MAGUIRE : Yes .
We have just been locked into our cells now for a couple of hours .
We are currently going through their process .
We are being charged with entering illegally into Israeli — near Israeli shores .
We are going , it looks like , to be deported from Israel .
We did not choose to come to Israel .
Our little boat was boarded by the navy combat soldiers , and they came in in full riot gear onto our boat when we were just twenty - five miles off the shore of Gaza .
We were under gunpoint , forcibly taken to Ashdod , held in the detention center overnight .
And then I was removed from Ashdod detention center , handcuffed in a military vehicle , and brought here to the prison , where we ’re currently being held .
All of us , all nineteen — there were twenty - one , but Huwaida and Lubna are out — but the rest of us are being held here in detention in this prison .
AMY GOODMAN : What is your response , Mairead Maguire , to Mark Regev , the Israeli spokesperson , who said aid is free to pass into Gaza ?
MAIREAD MAGUIRE : No , that is wrong .
I mean , we know it is not free .
I mean , Gaza is like a huge prison , but — because its borders are closed .
The sea pass into Gaza , which has been closed for over forty years by the Israeli government — we are only the seventh ship to get in to the port of Gaza that tried to break the siege .
And as we do that , it ’s very interesting , we pass the gas fields of Gaza .
You know , Gaza has huge gas deposits , which Israel is now beginning to use .
So it ’s very important that there is the issue of who owns the gas in the Gazan Strip .
And also farmers — fishermen , who try to go out without — in about twelve miles to fish for their families , are shot up and have been killed by the Israeli navy in that area .
So , Gaza is a huge occupied territory of one - and - a - half million people who have been subjected to collective punishment by the Israeli government .
That breaks the Geneva Convention , every international law in the book .
And the tragedy is that the American government , the UN and Europe , they remain silent in the face of the abuse of Palestinian human rights , like the freedom , and it ’s really tragic .
And it is also tragic that out of ten million Palestinians of a population , almost seven million are currently refugees out in other countries or displaced within their own country , particularly after the horrific massacre by Israeli jet fighters after just earlier this year .
Twenty - two days Israel bombarded Gaza , Gazan people , civilians .
And we ’re not sure what kind of weapons were dropped .
We need the scientists .
We need people to go in to see : is it depleted uranium in the very soil of the Gazan fields now ?
Unfortunately , Israel does not want human rights activists in there to see what they ’ve done and what they ’re doing .
Even the representative of [ inaudible ] — JUAN GONZALEZ : Mairead Maguire — MAIREAD
MAGUIRE : — is not allowed in .
JUAN GONZALEZ : And , Mairead Maguire , I ’d like to ask you , to your knowledge , has your government or the government of the United States , in the case of Cynthia McKinney or some of the others , attempted to visit with the detainees or to lodge protest with the Israeli government ?
MAIREAD MAGUIRE : Yes , we have had [ inaudible ] our consulates in the different governments come here to see us .
And we are concerned about the five people who came from Bahrain , and — because they do n’t have — their government does n’t have the same links with Israel , and we are concerned for their safety .
We have asked that all those who were — who were hijacked — we were hijacked on the seas of Gaza — that they be all given freedom and their goods returned , because we have got to look out for each other .
AMY GOODMAN : Mairead Maguire , what will happen now ?
And we understand that some people were injured .
MAIREAD MAGUIRE : Yes , indeed .
I mean , when as were the combat troops in masks and fully armed came on board our small boat , some people were injured .
And even during — that happened during the day .
But our life was put at risk even more , because the previous night , during the night , when we were in international waters , we were — a couple of Israeli naval ships came up around us .
Over the radio , they told us if we did not turn back into Cyprus , they would shoot at our boat .
They cut off our communications , including our satellite communications .
So we were in grave danger of actually being killed at that point .
The second thing was , when actually the navy combat forces came on board our boat , they would n’t allow the captain to take the boat to Ashdod ; instead , they took over .
And , you know , I really thought that we were all going to drown , because when we got near , when we were sailing to Ashdod , there was heavy winds , there was water coming in , and it was — really we were in a very , very dangerous position .
So we were literally hijacked , taken at gunpoint by the Israeli military .
And now we are here in prison , and they are threatening to deport us .
We were brought here against our will .
We did n’t come here by choice , and we are not here by choice .
AMY GOODMAN : Mairead Maguire , what jail cell are — what jail are you in now ?
MAIREAD MAGUIRE : We ’re in Giv’on Prison , and we ’re — the women here are on one side , and the men are on the other side .
AMY GOODMAN : Mairead Maguire , I want to thank you for being with us , Irish peace activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner , speaking to us from her jail cell , redefining the cell phone .
Huwaida Arraf before her , founder of the Free Gaza movement .
Mairead is one of nineteen people who remain in jail .
Huwaida just got out .
Scratchbot relies on whisker - like to sensors to help navigate , and could have uses in fire rescues and vacuuming
A robotic rat that can scurry through the dark using its plastic whiskers to navigate could be used to help rescue people from burning buildings , scientists said today .
The device , known as Scratchbot , can track objects using whisker - like sensors andhas been labelled by its creators as a " significant milestone " in the development of animal - inspired artificial intelligence .
The inventors at the Bristol Robotics Lab and University of Sheffield said robots that use feelers rather than vision were much more effective in the dark and in smoke - filled environments .
The Scratchbot – the name derives from spatial cognition and representation through active touch – mimics the " sweeping motion " of a real rodent 's whiskers to determine the size and shape of objects in front of it .
The technology has the potential for use underground , in the sea , or in vacuum cleaners " to sense textures for optimal cleaning " , the researchers said .
A team of international scientists will see the robot in action tonight at the University of Sheffield .
Tony Pipe , of the Bristol Robotics Lab , said : " Active touch sensing is a key focus for those of us looking at biological systems which have implications for robotics research .
Sensory systems such as rats ' whiskers have some particular advantages … in humans , for example , sensors are at the fingertips , [ so ] they are more vulnerable to damage and injury than whiskers .
" Rats have the ability to operate with damaged whiskers and in theory broken whiskers on robots could be easily replaced , without affecting the whole robot and its expensive engineering . "
He said applications for the technology could include extremely dusty conditions where visual capability was impaired .
" In a smoke - filled room , for example , a robot like this could help with a rescue operation by locating survivors of a fire . "
Tony Prescott , a professor at Sheffield University 's psychology department , said : " Our project has reached a significant milestone in the development of actively controlled , whisker - like sensors for intelligent machines .
Although touch sensors are already employed in robots , the use of touch as a principal modality has been overlooked until now .
By developing these biomimetic robots we are not just designing novel touch - sensing devices , but also making a real contribution to understanding the biology of tactile sensing . "

( That 's a movie reference , by the way . )
Pope Benedict XVI has called for a world political authority to manage the global economy and for more government regulation of national economies .
The pope 's call for a re-think of the way the world economy is run came in new a encyclical which touches on a number of social issues but whose main connecting thread is how the current crisis has affected both rich and poor nations .
Entitled Caritas in Veritate ( Charity in Truth ) , parts of the encyclical appear likely to upset conservatives because of its underlying rejection of unbridled capitalism and unregulated market forces , which he says has led to ' thoroughly destructive ' abuse of the system .
Read the full text of the Encyclical
The pope says every economic decision has a moral consequence and called for ' forms of redistribution ' of wealth overseen by governments to help those most affected by crises .
He says ' there is an urgent need of a true world political authority ' whose task would be " to manage the global economy ; to revive economies hit by the crisis ; to avoid any deterioration of the present crisis and the greater imbalances that would result ' .
The UN , economic institutions and international finance all have to be reformed ' even in the midst of a global recession ' , he says in the 141 - page encyclical .
The document , which it is understood was delayed in order to address the economic crisis , was released on the eve of the G8 Summit in Italy and three days before the pope is due to discuss the global downturn with US President Barack Obama .
In several sections of the encyclical , the Pope makes it clear he has grave reservations about a totally free market .
' The conviction that the economy must be autonomous , that it must be shielded from ' influences ' of a moral character , has led man to abuse the economic process in a thoroughly destructive way , ' he says .
' In the long term , these convictions have led to economic , social and political systems that trample upon personal and social freedom , and are therefore unable to deliver the justice that they promise , ' he adds .
Profit was useful only if it served as a means to a brighter future for all humanity .
' Once profit becomes the exclusive goal , if it is produced by improper means and without the risks destroying wealth and creating poverty , ' he says .
' The economy needs ethics in order to function correctly - not any ethics whatsoever , but an ethics which is people - centred , ' he adds .
In other sections of the encyclical , his first on social issues since his 2005 election , the Pope addresses topics such as development , migration , union rights , terrorism , sexual tourism , population issues , the environment , bioethics and energy .

Hot potato !
Cold potato !
Served in a wax bowl .
How cool is that ?
This truffled potato shooter is the ultimate “ cream of mushroom soup ” on the planet .
It ’s very rich , creamy , buttery , and best served in small portions .
I recently hosted a post - Christmas get - together — more of a working dinner party — for this recipe , with some fellow foodies .
Good times .
We all prepared this dish together , and each of us assembled our own servings .
People can get very creative in their plate prep — no two were exactly alike !
It was quite fun , and they all loved the soup ’s sinfully decadent taste .
A happy guest stomping her feet in delight .
Cold Potato Soup
Mise en place :
I looked for black truffle juice locally , but could n’t find it in any of my retail haunts , so I ordered a can of Savini Tartufi black truffle juice from Master Caviar .
I planned on using it for this recipe and BLACK TRUFFLE , Explosion .
It was a little short for both recipes , so I added some chicken stock to make up the difference .
If you ’re vegetarian , you could easily use a vegetable stock to extend .
I was a bit apprehensive , but the end results were still very potent .
I diced up the potatoes and added them to the truffle juice in a medium saucepan .
Brought to a boil and simmered for about 20 minutes or so , until the potatoes were done .
Remember , the smaller the dice the less time it takes to cook .
Then added the cream and brought back up to a simmer .
Removed from heat and blended , covered , until smooth .
Slowly added the white truffle oil as it puréed .
And I added a little less salt than the recipe asked for .
( I always try to cut down on the salt in recipes if I can get away with it . )
Then strained into a plastic container and refrigerated until needed .
Ingredients :
Yukon Gold potatoes , from Whole Foods
Savini Tartufi black truffle juice
Alta -Dena heavy cream
Savini Tartufi whitle truffle oil
Diamond Crystal kosher slat
Hot Potato
We scooped out balls of potato with a 0.5 ″ Parisienne scoop ( melon baller ) .
Use Yukon Golds , and do n’t peel them .
I was trying to scoop out perfect spheres until I realized that a flat top would actually be better for the truffle slices to rest on .
Duh …
Added the potato balls to simmering clarified butter and cooked for about 20 minutes .
The butter did indeed bubble as described .
But the potatoes browned a bit as they cooked ( a fine , golden buttery brown ) .
Removed from heat and set aside in prep area .

Challenge butter , clarified
What ’s “ clarified ” butter ?
Clarified butter is made with melted butter .
As Michael Ruhlman describes it in his indispensable take on Strunk and White , The Elements of Cooking , “ butter from which all salt and water have been removed — pure , translucent butterfat . ”
Melt your butter slowly , being careful not to brown or burn it .
Its milk solids , salt and water will separate out .
Skim them off the top and use just the pure yellow butterfat .
Butter
I cut some very cold butter into 0.875 ″ cubes and froze until we were ready to assemble .
A trick suggested in the book is to used a sharp , hot knife to cut the cubes , wiping the blade off with a towel in between cuts .
I usually have a pot of very hot water to dip my knife into , then wipe with a towel .
This works very well when you ’re looking for a nice , clean edge to , say , cheesecake slices , or the like .
Ingredients :
Challenge unsalted butter
Here ’s where I put my guests to work .
Parmesan
My friend Reverend Chili cut up some Parmesan cheese into 0.875 ″ cubes , and reserved to a prepared sheet tray .
We used Parmigiano Reggiano , a firm cow ’s milk cheese of “ protected designation of origin , ” made only in a small area of Northern Italy .
Yum .

Truffle Slices
I ordered a fresh winter Périgord black truffle from Master Caviar .
The package arrived next day air in a styrofoam cooler , surrounded by icepacks in a vacuum - pack bag with arborio rice ( I ’m gonna make risotto with that ) .
My daughter picked out the rice embedded in the nooks and crannies of the truffle , perfect work for little hands .
The truffle was 59g ( 2.08 oz ) in weight , for US $ 101.87 ( yikes , $ 1.73 per gram ) .
I thought it would be enough for both this recipe , and BLACK TRUFFLE , Explosion .
I carefully cut it up in thin slices on a mandoline .
And reserved what we needed to the prep area .
The remainder of the slices I froze for later .
Everyone was curious , so the tasting began .
The overall consensus was that it was very tasty , but a bit dry .
The lone holdout , my daughter , remarked that it “ tasted like dirt . ”
So I coated the slices we ’d use with some white truffle oil .
Made the slices look a little darker too .
That ’ll bring out the flavor .
The bits and scraps leftover I added to the potato soup .
Ingredients :
Fresh winter Périgord black truffle , from Master Caviar
To Assemble and Serve
Mise en place :
Cooking this recipe is simple .
The exotic ( read “ expensive ” ) ingredients may make it seem complicated , or out of reach .
But it ’s not .
We ’ve got potato soup , butter , chives , cheese and mushrooms .
That ’s it .
And it ’s fun and easy to assemble in a group .
At Alinea , they serve this soup in specially made paraffin wax bowls .
A chef makes about a hundred a night for each full 92 - seating service .
They ’re made with custom molds designed by Martin Kastner of Crucial Detail .
And you just ca n’t buy them .
But you can make your own , like I did .
Or get some of the 2.5 ″ silicone condiment cups ( each , US $ 1.50 ) from Crate and Barrel .
They come in white and red .
I bought several sets of metal cocktail picks ( set of 6 , US $ 6.95 ) at Crate and Barrel which will work .
But then I saw that you can buy the 2.25 ″ stainless steel Alinea picks from J.B. Prince ( pack of 10 for US $ 14.40 ) .
So I did !
My friend Chili took the cold soup out from the fridge .
Candice drained the hot potato balls on paper towels .
I poured soup in the wax bowls .
Then we were ready to assemble !
Take a stainless steel pin and pierce the side of a bowl , angling upward .
Skewer a cube of Parmesan , then cold butter , then a chive or two onto the pin .
Space ’em out if you want .
Finish with a hot potato ball , flat skin - side up .
And top with a slice of truffle and a few flakes of Maldon sea salt .
Now it ’s ready to eat !
To Eat
Take a wax bowl of soup in your hand and pull out the stainless steel pin .
The skewered bits will fall into the soup .
Then shoot it !
Chewing , of course …
Mmmmmmmmmmm …

Sen .
Tom Coburn issued a blistering attack on the husband of Sen. John Ensign ’s mistress .
Coburn : Ensign flap manipulated
Sen . Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) on Thursday issued a blistering attack on Doug Hampton , the husband of Sen. John Ensign ’s ( R - Nev. ) mistress , saying that he had provided false information about paying off Hampton after Ensign revealed he was having an affair with his wife .
“ John Ensign has n’t put me in a tough position at all , ” said Coburn , a housemate of Ensign ’s at a Capitol Hill home owned by a Christian fellowship .
“ The person that ’s deceiving now is Doug .
And you all need to go do the investigation now on that side of it and quit asking us and ask what 's the motivation here . ”

Coburn was responding to a televised interview Doug Hampton gave to a Nevada television station in which he went into detail about the Ensign ’s affair with his wife , which reportedly started in December 2007 and ended in August 2008 .
Hampton , a former close friend of Ensign ’s and chief of staff to the senator , said that Coburn and other peers were involved in talks to urge Ensign to pay Hampton for the damage he caused his family — including potentially giving him “ millions ” of dollars .
“ This was at the request of Tom Coburn and some people to try and help them manage John , ” Hampton said of the talk about payments , which he said were necessary because Ensign continued to “ pursue ” his wife and left his family in financial shambles .
“ I did n't talk to John Ensign personally at all .
Our attorneys did talk .
Our attorneys absolutely talked , because Sen .
Tom Coburn asked and was involved in these negotiations out of good will and good faith , ” Hampton said earlier in the broadcast .
Jon Ralston , who interviewed Hampton , asked : “ Tom Coburn , a U.S. senator , told John Ensign , ' Listen , you 've got to deal with this .
Make these folks whole .
Let them get out of your life .
And let 's move on .
Is n't that exactly what happened ? ”
Hampton responded : “ Absolutely . ”
Hampton suggested that Coburn urged Ensign to write a February 2008 letter apologizing to Hampton ’s wife , Cindy , a campaign aide to Ensign .
But on Thursday , Coburn said : “ He is in error , and he ’s manipulating the situation and you are all buying it . ”
“ I was never present when a letter was written , never made any assessment of paying anybody anything .
Those are untruths .
Those are absolute untruths . ”
Ensign admitted the affair last month , and stepped down from a Senate GOP leadership position .
He apologized , but he has refused to answer questions about whether he acted improperly with his former aides and whether he wanted to pay off Hampton to keep the situation quiet .
A spokesman said Wednesday that Hampton was “ consistently inaccurate ” in his statements , and Ensign told POLITICO Thursday he planned to issue a statement on the matter later Thursday .
In the meantime , the scandal has touched Coburn , a fellow Christian conservative .
“ Dr. Coburn did everything he could to encourage Sen. Ensign to end his affair and to persuade Sen .
Ensign to repair the damage he had caused to his own marriage and the Hampton ’s marriage , ” Coburn ’s office said in a remarkable public rebuke of his friend and fellow Christian conservative .
“ Had Sen . Ensign followed Dr. Coburn ’s advice , this episode would have ended , and been made public , long ago . ”
On Thursday , Coburn declined to go into detail about his conversations with Ensign .
“ I ’m not going to go into that — that ’s privileged communications .
I ’m never going to talk about that with anybody .
…
I never will , not to a court of law , not to an Ethics Committee , not to anybody — because that is privileged communication that I will never reveal to anybody . ”
He suggested that his position as a physician and an ordained deacon could keep the information privileged .
And the senator lashed out at the media for continuing to focus on the matter and for helping “ tear apart ” the Hamptons and the Ensigns , who each have three kids and have known each other for years .
“ You ’ve got two families that are back together and you guys are going to help tear them apart .
What do you think their kids are thinking about what you ’re writing right now ?
You ’re helping tear apart two families that are back together — you need to quit . ”

Ask yourself :
How much would more scientific literacy help the public , really , in understanding the toughest , most contentious issues ?
Undoubtedly , the more scientifically literate Americans are , the more they ’ll understand newspaper articles about science , and be able to follow public debates .
But there ’s a limit : Scientific literacy is no shield against anti-evolutionists or global warming deniers , for example , who are often scientists themselves , who couch their arguments in sophisticated scientific language , and who regularly cite articles in the peer - reviewed scientific literature .
Having the knowledge equivalent of a PhD is more along the lines of what ’s necessary to refute them , and even then , the task requires considerable research and intellectual labor , far more than most people have the time for .
Yet while scientific illiteracy is nothing to shrug at , the truth is that it ’s only part of a broader problem for which scientists themselves must shoulder a significant portion of the responsibility .
Decrying ignorance and scientific illiteracy , many scientists treat their fellow citizens as empty vessels waiting for an infusion of knowledge .
That is exactly wrong , and exactly why so many people , in turn , see science and scientists as distant , inscrutable , aloof , arrogant .
Rather than blaming , scientists ought to be engaging with the public , trying to personally make their knowledge hit home and to instill by example ( rather than from a distance ) the nature and virtues of the scientific mindset - while also encouraging average Americans to ask their own questions and have their say .
Scientists must make it clear that while they do n’t have all the answers , science is about searching for the truth , an imperfect process of doing the best one can with the information available , while knowing there is always more to learn - the epitome of humility .
Scientists are fond of citing statistics such as these in explaining conflicts between the public and the scientific community .
On politicized issues like climate change , embryonic stem cell research , the teaching of evolution , and the safety of vaccines , many Americans not only question scientific expertise but even feel entitled to discard it completely .
The reason , many scientists infer , is that the public is just clueless ; perhaps we would n’t have these problems if the average citizen were better educated , more knowledgeable , better informed .
Earlier this month , the Pew Research Center and the American Association for the Advancement of Science unveiled the latest embarrassing evidence of our nation ’s scientific illiteracy .
Only 52 percent of Americans in their survey knew why stem cells differ from other kinds of cells ; just 46 percent knew that atoms are larger than electrons .
On a highly contentious issue like global warming , meanwhile , the gap between scientists and the public was vast : 84 percent of scientists , but just 49 percent of Americans , think human emissions are causing global warming .
If members of the public are n’t all going to earn PhD ’s , they need something else , an attribute the standard “ scientific illiteracy ” survey questions do n’t really measure .
We would describe it as a deep and abiding awareness of the importance of the scientific endeavor to their lives and the national future .
This means that Americans would be more likely to see - much in the way that scientists currently see - how science - centered developments and controversies will shape the coming decades and guide countless critical political decisions , in areas ranging from energy policy to the ethics of various types of biomedical research .
To that end , Americans should be far more engaged with scientists and what they ’re doing .
They should know the names of leading researchers ( most Americans do not ) and the nation ’s top scientific agencies ( again , most Americans do not ) .
To the extent possible they should know scientists personally , both so they can get a sense of the nature of scientific reasoning and so they feel they are being heard , not just lectured to .
Perhaps this way , when it comes to the toughest and most politicized questions , they will better recognize that scientists will not rally around a firm conclusion unless it really is precisely that .
As matters currently stand , though , such reaching out to the public is n’t much rewarded in the scientific community .
There ’s little incentive for it .
Advancement in science does n’t happen , for the most part , due to one ’s public engagement or media skills .
Rather , it ’s all about your published research :
How many papers have you placed into leading journals , and how much are they being cited by other scientists ?
There are , admittedly , efforts afoot to change this problem .
The National Science Foundation ’s decade - old IGERT program - Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship - strives to impart a far broader set of skills to young scientists , and is supporting some of the best courses in the nation to this end .
For example , an IGERT - supported course entitled “ Climate Change and Marine Ecosystems , ” taught at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography by marine biologist Jeremy Jackson , introduces young scientists not only to the research on climate change , biodiversity , and conservation , but also to economic thinking , policy realities , the nature of the modern media , and even the work of filmmakers , improv comedians , and Internet organizers .
However , the IGERT program is a shadow of what it could be :
At present , the program disburses about 20 grants per year , yet each funding cycle , the NSF reports receiving more than 400 preliminary IGERT proposals .
We need an entirely new project of public outreach on the part of the scientific community .
It should n’t require every academic scientist to go door to door - not all will be interested in this work , and not all will be good at it .
Rather , it should centrally focus on training those young researchers who are not destined for academic jobs - their numbers are growing today , as academic opportunities decline - so that they ’re ideal emissaries for bringing science to the rest of society .
The enthusiasm is already there in the youngest generation of American scientists , who want to give something back .
Some will become our next crop of great researchers - yet some do n’t want to follow in the footsteps of their professors , and are ideal candidates for becoming liaisons between science and society .
But finding careers for them in public outreach is another matter entirely .
As the free market surely wo n’t do it , universities , philanthropists , and scientific societies must create these careers - and of course , we need the help of government as well .
Ultimately , all of this could lead to nothing less than a substantial redefinition of the role of the scientist in public life .
No longer merely a distant voice of authority , the scientist could also become an everyday guide and ally , a listener as much as a lecturer .
There ’s no doubt members of the public must become much more knowledgeable about science and its importance .
But scientists must also become far more involved with - and knowledgeable about - the public .

Chandra observatory marks a decade of X - ray astronomy
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : July 23 , 2009
Astronomers celebrated the 10th birthday of the Chandra X-ray Observatory on Thursday , a decade after the shuttle Columbia sent the hefty telescope to a looping orbit high above Earth .
New data from the Chandra X- ray Observatory was used to create this refined image of E0102 , an exploding star in the nearby Small Magellanic Cloud about 190,000 light years away .
Chandra first observed this object shortly after its launch .
Scientists released this image to commemorate Chandra 's 10th anniversary .

The third of four NASA Great Observatories , Chandra gave researchers their most detailed look into the high - energy universe .
Scientists have used the observatory to study targets ranging from comets to black holes .
" Chandra 's discoveries are truly astonishing and have made dramatic changes to our understanding of the universe and its constituents , " said Martin Weisskopf , project scientist at NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center .
Chandra has also produced convincing evidence supporting the existence of dark matter , invisible material that astrophysicists believe makes up less than one - fourth of the universe .
Researchers have also used the bus-sized observatory to investigate dark energy , an even more exotic force causing the universe 's expansion rate is accelerating .
Chandra independently confirmed dark energy is real , according to NASA .
Built by Northrop Grumman Corp. , the 10,000 - pound spacecraft rode space shuttle Columbia into orbit on July 23 , 1999 .
Columbia deployed Chandra and a solid - fueled Inertial Upper Stage about nine hours after liftoff .
The upper stage fired twice to propel Chandra toward its operational orbit stretching one - third of the way to the moon .
Chandra and its booster rocket , weighing a combined 50,000 pounds , combine to form the heaviest payload ever launched by a space shuttle .
Chandra has doubled its original five - year mission , producing nearly 10,000 individual observations and logging more than 60,000 hours of sciecne observing time , according to Northrop Grumman .
" Chandra has significantly expanded the world 's scientific knowledge base about the nature of our universe , " said Dave DiCarlo , sector vice president and general manager of Northrop Grumman 's space systems division .
" It has opened up new vistas of study for the world 's astronomers and provided technology and integration and test techniques that we 're using to develop the next generation of space observatories . "

Officials say Chandra shows no signs of slowing down .
" Right now , a 15 - year mission appears totally feasible and 20 years is being looked into , " said Megan Watzke , spokesperson for the Chandra X-ray Center at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge , Mass .
Originally proposed in 1976 , Chandra unveiled a strikingly different universe from the objects observed by telescopes specializing in other forms of light .
" The Great Observatories program , of which Chandra is a major part , shows how astronomers need as many tools as possible to tackle the big questions out there , " said Ed Weiler , associate administrator for NASA 's science mission directorate .
Other Great Observatories include the Hubble Space Telescope , the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory , and the Spitzer Space Telescope .
Unlike Hubble , Chandra was not designed to be repaired by the space shuttle because of its high - altitude orbit .
" I am extremely proud of the tremendous team of people who worked so hard to make Chandra a success , " said Harvey Tananbaum , director of the Chandra X - ray Center .
" It has taken partners at NASA , industry and academia to make Chandra the crown jewel of high - energy astrophysics . "
Sanford case shines a spotlight on the central paradox of marriage .
South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford not only played fast and loose with the institution of marriage , but with email .
However , help keeping affairs secret has arrived for not only politicians , but all of us .
AshleyMadison.com just released apps for mobile phones and the Blackberry .
Jeremy Caplan reports for
Time that because they ’re “ loaded up from phones ’ browsers , they leave no electronic trail . ”
For those unfamiliar with it , AshleyMadison is a matchmaking service for married individuals .
That ’s right :
It facilitates affairs .
To summarize the statement of a woman Caplan quotes who consults in the online dating field , AshleyMadison is infidelity “ rebranded ” and made “ monetizable . ”
Though Ashley Madison has signed up over one million users since going online in 2001 , she seems concerned that it harms the online dating business for singles .
As has been noted , the Sanford case is unlike other Republican sex scandals .
It ’s devoid of sex with prostitutes ( to which prominent Democrats , like Eliot Spitzer , are also prone ) , drooling over congressional pages , soliciting sex in a public rest room , or pursuing an aide ’s wife .
Sanford was simply a man who fell in love with another woman who was n’t much younger than he .
As the spiritual counselor to the Sanfords and their circle , Warren Culbertson , said in a Huffington Post article :
. . . the only thing holding his friends ’ marriage together right now is “ their vow to God . ”
“ Because it ’s not feelings — it ’s not emotions . …
For most Christians , at some point in your marriage , if you ’re married long enough , you do it because that ’s what we ’re called to do — out of obedience instead of out of passion . ”
You can almost hear the strains of a psaltery in the background .
Apparently Sanford , despite his faith ( not fundamentalist , actually , but Episcopal ) , was unable to adhere to a view of marriage as starkly medieval as Culbertson’s .
It ’s not just religious principles , but romantic ideals about marriage — however strange bedfellows — that are stern taskmasters .
Entering marriage , neither the man nor the woman typically understands each other ’s sexuality .
( Thus strengthening the case for gay marriage . )
Male needs are cyclic , like hunger or urination .
Women , on the other hand , tend to be episodic .
Not only do n’t religion and romance acknowledge the problem this might pose , they make no provisions for when a partner ( the aged aside ) spurns sex entirely .
Causes most commonly cited include stress and fatigue .
Compounding those , the partner suffering from one or both of those symptoms — at the risk of gender - typing , usually the wife — may resent the other for helping to cause them by not holding up his or her end of the chores or child - rearing .
Other reasons include — today especially — loss of self - respect if one loses job and , of course , weight gain .
The husband blows up and turns off the wife or she packs on the pounds and no longer feels attractive .
Divorce may not be an alternative because resuming the solo life , especially with kids , is n’t feasible for most in today ’s economy .
Also , the person denied sex may still care deeply for his or her spouse .
Nevertheless , a life without physical intimacy is unthinkable for many .
Is an affair the answer ?
Even if not sniffed out by the spouse , it may end the marriage .
The unfaithful spouse may , a la Sanford , link up with the fabled “ soul mate , ” which seems to make abandoning one ’s family understandable in the eyes of God .
( Funny how those soul - mate sensations have a way of fading once the cheating spouse divorces and then marries his or her paramour . )
On the other hand , as hollow as married life becomes without intimacy , in lying and deception lay the path to true misery .
Of course , like Sanford , the cheater can admit to the affair on the theory that confession is good for the soul .
It ’s just that any benefit that might accrue to the sinner comes at the expense of the one sinned against .

Debian decides to adopt time - based release freezes
July 29th , 2009
The Debian project has decided to adopt a new policy of time - based development freezes for future releases , on a two - year cycle .
Freezes will from now on happen in the December of every odd year , which means that releases will from now on happen sometime in the first half of every even year .
To that effect the next freeze will happen in December 2009 , with a release expected in spring 2010 .
The project chose December as a suitable freeze date since spring releases proved successful for the releases of Debian GNU / Linux 4.0 ( codenamed Etch ) and Debian GNU / Linux 5.0 ( Lenny ) .
Time - based freezes will allow the Debian Project to blend the predictability of time based releases with its well established policy of feature based releases .
The new freeze policy will provide better predictability of releases for users of the Debian distribution , and also allow Debian developers to do better long - term planning .
A two - year release cycle will give more time for disruptive changes , reducing inconveniences caused for users .
Having predictable freezes should also reduce overall freeze time .
Since Debian 's last release happened on Feb.
14th 2009 , there will only be approximately a one year period until its next release , Debian GNU / Linux 6.0 ( codenamed Squeeze ) .
This will be a one - time exception to the two - year policy in order to get into the new time schedule .
To accommodate the needs of larger organisations and other users with a long upgrade process , the Debian project commits to provide the possibility to skip the upcoming release and do a skip - upgrade straight from Debian GNU / Linux 5.0 ( Lenny ) to Debian GNU / Linux 7.0 ( not yet codenamed ) .
Although the next freeze is only a short time away , the Debian project hopes to achieve several prominent goals with it .
The most important are multi-arch support , which will improve the installation of 32 bit packages on 64 bit machines , and an optimised boot process for better boot performance and reliability .
The new freeze policy was proposed and agreed during the Debian Project 's yearly conference , DebConf , which is currently taking place in Caceres , Spain .
The idea was well received among the attending project members .

North Korea may be able to overcome technical difficulties and assemble a missile capable of hitting West Coast cities within three years , a top Defense Department official said Tuesday , but it is unlikely to be able to deliver a nuclear warhead in that time frame .
The U.S. assessment came as North Korea ’s rulers show signs of preparing for additional weapons tests in the face of international condemnation and new United Nations sanctions .
The estimate of three to five years was provided in congressional testimony by Marine Gen.
James Cartwright , vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , who previously oversaw America ’s nuclear forces as head of Strategic Command .
It follows North Korea ’s most recent tests , including a nuclear detonation last month and a multistage missile launch in April that indicated progress but also highlighted flaws in the country ’s technology .
At the White House , President Obama met Tuesday with South Korea ’s president , saying he would end the cycle in which the North Korean government provokes international crises to obtain aid .

North Korea in the past has promised to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for energy and economic aid .
“ This is a pattern they ’ve come to expect , ” Obama said .
“ We are going to break that pattern . ”
At a news conference with President Lee Myung - bak of South Korea , Obama called North Korea a “ grave threat . ”
He emphasized that a chief U.S. concern is that North Korea may spread nuclear technology to other countries or extremist groups .
But he also stressed the importance of negotiations .
Cartwright outlined the potential threat posed by North Korean missiles in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee .
North Korea ’s Taepodong 2 missile is designed to reach the West Coast of the U.S. , but test launches to date have been partial failures .
Advertisement
Analysts believe the Taepodong 2 is inaccurate and so far has failed to reach a third stage , a critical leap to be able to hit the United States .
Cartwright said that in three to five years , the government in Pyongyang might be able to overcome its technical problems .
But he said that time frame did not include development of a warhead .
He did not estimate how long it might take the communist regime to develop a warhead small enough to put on a long - range missile .

Cartwright also stressed that his assessment represented an estimate .
“ My crystal ball ’s not going to be any better than anyone else ’s , ” he said .
Under questioning from Sen. Evan Bayh ( D - Ind. ) , Cartwright said he was “ 90 % - plus ” confident that the U.S. could shoot down a missile launched at the United States from North Korea .
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has proposed trimming the overall U.S. missile defense budget , but has requested $ 900 million to maintain and improve interceptor missiles now based in California and Alaska .

North Korea detonated a nuclear device last month , its second test in three years .
Some U.S. officials have said North Korea may be making preparations for a third nuclear test .
William J. Lynn , the No. 2 Pentagon official , said that although North Korea ’s future behavior was unpredictable , Pyongyang had accelerated its missile and nuclear tests , justifying additional U.S. investment in defensive systems .
“ It could present a threat to the U.S. homeland , and we think that ’s a strong reason to maintain a ground - based interceptor system and to upgrade it , ” Lynn said .
Lynn is a former lobbyist for Raytheon Corp. , a major missile defense contractor .

Benjamin LeBaron , 31 , and Luis Widmar , 29 , a brother - in - law who tried to help him , were grabbed by at least 15 commandos shortly after midnight in Colonia LeBaron , which is about 200 miles southeast of El Paso , witnesses said .
The bodies of the men , both naturalized U.S. citizens with five children each , were found nearby shortly afterward , each shot several times in the head , Brent LeBaron , a cousin of Benjamin who lives in the village , said by telephone .
Benjamin LeBaron had led successful protests earlier this year to free his kidnapped brother and demand police protection for their isolated rural community .
“ We are fighting a cause that should be heard throughout the world , ” said Brent LeBaron , who was helping build the slain men ’s coffins Tuesday and prepare for their burials .
“ We have two martyrs on our hands , two men who are completely innocent taken out of their houses and killed .
“ We do n’t know what to do , ” he said .
“ We ca n’t bear arms .
We have no way of legally protecting ourselves . ”
Attacked cousin ’s house
The attackers struck his cousin ’s house as the family slept trying to knock down the front door and smashing its windows , Brent LeBaron said .
A panicked Benjamin LeBaron phoned two brothers - in - law for help .
But after the attackers threatened to throw a grenade into the house , LeBaron opened the door .
The gangsters beat Le - Baron and one threatened to rape his wife in front of their children before carrying their victims away , Brent LeBaron said .
As the commandos left they fired assault rifles at the second brother - in - law , who was wounded with shrapnel in the back .
Benjamin LeBaron and other village leaders had led hundreds of people in May to Chihuahua City to demand government action in the abduction of Eric LeBaron , Benjamin ’s 16 - year - old brother .
The kidnappers were demanding $ 1 million in ransom , but the LeBaron community had decided to instead pressure for the boys ’s release , which occurred in mid-May .
“ We ’re fighting as a community , ” Brent LeBaron said .
“ Standing up against extortionists and kidnappers .
But we have never done anything against the drug lords .
We stay away from the drug war because we know it ’s a battle that we ca n’t win . ”
A placard left with the bodies said the killings were in retribution for the June arrests by federal forces of 25 men in a distant village accused of running narcotics .
“ These guys blame our protest for pressuring the government to act and do something , ” said Clary Jones , who helped organize the protest to free Benjamin ’s brother , Eric , in May and who is directly mentioned in the warning left with the men ’s bodies .
“ It ’s a message from them . ”
Hundreds of soldiers as well as state and federal police swarmed into Colonia LeBaron on Tuesday in search of the attackers .
Chihuahuan state officials promised to bring the killers to justice .
The village of Colonia Le-Baron , was founded by Benjamin ’s great - grandfather , Alma Dayer LeBaron , and other ancestors who broke with the Church of the Latter Day Saints in the 1920s over its ban on polygamy and other doctrinal differences .
Practicing faith
More than 900 people live in LeBaron today , practicing their faith and working at farming and construction .
Some village men unofficially practice polygamy , which is illegal in Mexico , as it is in the United States .
Many villagers are dual U.S. and Mexican citizens .
Narcotics production and trafficking flourishes throughout Chihuahuan state and the rugged Sierra Madre range than runs along its western flanks .
And as elsewhere across Mexico , kidnappers and extortionists are targeting LeBaron and nearby communities , dubbed the “ Corridor of Terror . ”

Some of the nation ’s leading journalists gathered in Key West , Fla. , in May 2009 for the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life ’s Faith Angle Conference on religion , politics and public life .
Francis S. Collins , the former director of the Human Genome Project , discussed why he believes religion and science are compatible and why the current conflict over evolution vs. faith , particularly in the evangelical community , is unnecessary .
Collins , an evangelical Christian , talked about his path from atheism to Christianity and his belief that science provides evidence of God .
He cited the Big Bang theory and the fact that the universe had a beginning out of nothing .
He added that the laws of physics have precisely the values needed for life to occur on earth and argued that would seem to point to a creator .
Barbara Bradley Hagerty , the religion correspondent for National Public Radio , discussed how the brain reacts to spiritual experiences .
She talked about the current debate over whether transcendent experiences are merely physiological events or whether they reflect encounters with another dimension .
Bradley Hagerty said she believes that “ God is a choice , ” that people can look at scientific evidence and conclude that everything is explained by material means or that they can look at the universe and see the hand of God .

MICHAEL CROMARTIE :
Twice a year we meet at the Pew Forum with eight of your colleagues to talk about what subjects you want to discuss in Key West .
We do that because we want your input obviously , but also because we really want the topics to be related to what you ’re working on .
So we try to make these topics relevant to the discussions that are going on in our culture and society and public life .
One of the topics that ’s been coming up for several years is religion and science , and we ’re honored and delighted that Dr. Francis Collins could be with us .
After his presentation and after Barbara responds , we ’re going to hand out some information about a new think tank that Dr. Collins has started called BioLogos .
Most of you , of course , know him by reputation and by all of the good work he ’s done at the National Human Genome Research Institute and the National Institutes of Health .
You ’ll also notice in his bio that he has an M.D. and a Ph.D. , and so he ’s eminently qualified to talk to us about our topic this morning , “ Religion and Science : Conflict or Harmony ? ”
Francis , thanks so much for coming .
FRANCIS COLLINS : Thanks , Michael .
It ’s great to be here with all of you in this remarkable gathering .
I ’ve met some of you individually over the years in various contexts , and it ’s wonderful to be here with the whole group .
I look forward to the discussion we ’re going to have , which I anticipate will be interesting , energetic and vigorous .
I thought I would start off with some background in terms of the particular area of science that I have spent a lot of my time on over the last 20 years , namely the study of DNA , and particularly the study of all of the DNA of the human , namely the human genome .
With that little bit of brief background , then I ’ll tell you about my path in the religious realm , going from being an atheist to becoming a believer and , more specifically , a Christian .
But then I ’ll spend most of the time talking about the current conflict that appears , at least in this country , to be a rather unpleasant one , where the voices that are arguing that science and faith are incompatible are actually quite loud – even shrill at times .
I ’ll offer up from my own perspective why that conflict is an unnecessary one and provide some possibilities of how it might be resolved in a way that I think would be good for our future .
I ’m sure there will be opinions about this , and those would be great to hear .
So let ’s start with the science , and , of course , I have to start with something from the media .
Time magazine , like many other publications , seems to like to talk about DNA , as in this cover story from the time when the human genome was being completed in 2003 .
I ’ve noticed , however , that virtually all cover stories about DNA include two kinds of display items .
There ’s the double helix , of course , and invariably there are naked people .
( Laughter . )
I could ask you what that ’s all about , but I think I know that it says editors realize that double helixes do n’t sell magazines .
( Laughter . )
And they know what does .
I know there ’s broad diversity and background in this room , but I ’m not going to get deeply into the nitty - gritty of genomics .
I will simply use this metaphor because I think it ’s a pretty good one , that the DNA of an organism is its instruction book sitting there in the nucleus of the cell .
All of the DNA of any organism is its genome .
Ours happens to be about 3.1 billion of those letters of the code .
The Human Genome Project set itself up in 1990 as an international effort to read out all of those letters at a time when this was pretty controversial , and many people thought this was foolhardy because the technology to do this had n’t been invented .
But due to the ingenuity and commitment of a very dedicated group of over 2,000 scientists that I had the privilege of leading , we did in fact , two - and - a - half years early and about $ 400 million under - budget , achieve the goal of reading out all of those 3.1 billion letters in April of 2003 – rather nicely and poetically in the 50th anniversary month of Watson and Crick ’s publication on the double helix in April of 1953 in Nature .
That was six years ago .
So what have you done for us lately ?
Well , a lot of the effort on the genome since that time has been to understand how the instruction book actually does what it does .
How do you read these instructions written in this funny language that has just four letters in its alphabet – A , C , G and T – the four bases of the DNA code ?
But particularly , we ’ve been interested in trying to identify the ticking time bombs in the human genome that put each of us at risk for something .
Progress here has been actually quite exhilarating .
It was really only in 2005 that we began to have sufficient power to be able to discover the variations that are associated with common disease , things like diabetes and heart disease .
Each year since 2007 we ’ve discovered dozens of genetic variations associated with risks of a common disease .
So more than a hundred of these discoveries , each one of which shines a bright light on the possible mechanisms by which diseases come about .
Not only have we had the ability to identify those variations in the genome that are associated with disease , but sequencing the entire human genome in each one of us is well on the path toward reaching a thousand - dollar price tag , which is pretty amazing when you consider that first human genome six years ago cost about $ 300 million .
This graph here showing you the drop in costs – the red line – of doing a million bases of DNA sequence at high quality is dropping faster than Moore ’s Law for computers .
So this is a pretty dramatic time we ’re in the midst of , and there ’s no sign that this is about to let up .
I think probably within another five years , the thousand - dollar genome will be a reality , and then that will make a very convincing case for including it as part of medical care so the information is in the medical record when you need it .
This has created somewhat of a challenge in the research arena because there ’s so much data coming out of these new sequencing efforts , but we ’re having fun with it .
So where this is going as far as medicine – and for me as a physician , this was always the point – is the ability to identify individual risks of disease based on a study of DNA so that we would be able to move from a one - size - fits - all approach to diagnosis , prevention and treatment to something that is more specific for the individual .
The way that ’s going to work is already getting underway .
We ’re identifying all of these risk factors for almost any disease using the tools of the Human Genome Project .
That in turn provides the opportunity to identify who ’s at risk for what .
You can already , for $ 400 , send your money to one of these direct - to - consumer marketing companies , and they will tell you what your risk is for about 20 different diseases .
That leads to the opportunity for preventive medicine , which is obviously something you would like to focus more on instead of waiting for people to get sick and then spending a great deal of money trying to take care of them .
It also opens the door to being able to pick the right drug at the right dose for each person .
That ’s what pharmacogenomics is all about , and that ’s already happening for about a dozen drugs , although it ’s slow getting into standard practice .
The ability to develop new treatments based upon a precise molecular understanding of disease instead of just trying to guess what might work , although that ’s the longest in terms of the time course , is probably going to be the most significant development .
So all of that ’s happening .
There ’s a true revolution going on .
I just recently finished a book on personalized medicine , which will be coming out early in 2010 , designed to try to explain this for a non-scientific audience , namely the general public , to try to begin the process of people imagining how to incorporate this information into their own health care .
I ’ve been talking about DNA ; this is actually DNA .
It ’s a different sort of picture than you ’re used to , where instead of looking from the side , you ’re looking down the barrel of the double helix .
It ’s quite a beautiful picture that way , and I think this is a provocative pair of images to introduce the main topic this morning , which is , are those two worldviews that you see there incompatible ?
On the left is the rose window of Westminster Cathedral , a beautiful stained glass window , and on the right , a picture of DNA .
There are certainly voices out there arguing that you ca n’t have both of those ; you ’ve got to take your pick .
You either are going to approach questions from a purely scientific perspective or a purely spiritual perspective , and the two are locked in eternal combat .
I do n’t happen to agree with that , so perhaps I should say a bit of a word about how I got there .
I grew up in a home where faith was not practiced .
My parents were free spirits in the arts and theater and music .
I was home schooled till the sixth grade .
I was not taught that faith was ridiculous , but I was certainly not taught that it mattered very much .
When I got to college and later graduate school in chemistry , I became an agnostic and then eventually an atheist .
In my view at that point , the only thing that really mattered was the scientific approach to understand how the universe worked ; everything else was superstition .
But then I went to medical school and discovered that those hypothetical questions about life and death and whether God exists were n’t so hypothetical anymore .
As I sat at the bedside of individuals who were facing death and saw in many instances how their faith was such a strong rock in the storm for them , I could n’t help but wonder about that .
I could n’t help but wonder how I would handle that situation if it were me lying in that bed , and I was pretty sure I would not be at peace the way these folks were .
So it seemed like a time to perhaps look at the question a little more deeply because I realized my atheism had been arrived at as the convenient answer , the answer I wanted , not on the basis of considering the evidence .
I assumed there probably was n’t any evidence for the idea that God exists , but I figured it was probably time to look .
A thoughtful person turned me onto the writings of C.S. Lewis , which was quite a revelation in terms of the depth of intellectual argument that undergirds a belief in a creator God and the existence of moral law .
I began to realize that even in science , where I had spent most of my time , there were pointers to God that I had paid no attention to that were actually pretty interesting .
One obvious one , although maybe it ’s not so obvious , is that there is something instead of nothing .
There ’s no reason there should be anything at all .
Wigner ’s wonderful phrase “ the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics ” also comes to mind – Eugene Wigner , the Nobel laureate in physics , talking about the amazing thing about the whole study of physics is that mathematics makes sense ; it can describe the properties of matter and energy in simple , even beautiful , laws .
Why should that be ?
Why should gravity follow an inverse square law ?
Why should Maxwell ’s five equations describe electromagnetism in very simple terms , and they actually turn out to be true ?
A thoughtful and interesting question .
This is certainly one that Einstein also wrote about quite significantly .
The Big Bang , the fact that the universe had a beginning out of nothingness , as far as we can tell .
From this unimaginable singularity , the universe came into being and has been flying apart ever since .
That cries out for some explanation .
Since we have not observed nature to create itself , where did this come from ?
That seems to ask you to postulate a creator who must not be part of nature or you have n’t solved the problem .
In fact , one can also make a pretty good philosophical argument that a creator of this sort must also be outside of time or you have n’t solved the problem .
So now we have the idea of a creator who is outside of time and space , and who is a pretty darn good mathematician , and apparently also must be an incredibly good physicist .
An additional set of observations I found quite breathtaking and do to this day is the fact that the physical constants that determine the nature of interactions between matter and the way in which energy behaves have precisely the values they would need to have for any kind of complexity or life to occur .
Various people have written about this .
Martin Rees has a book on this called Just Six Numbers .
Depending on how you count them up , somewhere between six and a dozen of these constants are independent of each other , and I ’m talking about things like the gravitational constant .
Theory can tell you that gravity is an inverse square law , but there ’s that constant in there to say how strong gravity is and you ca n’t derive that by theory .
That is something you have to measure experimentally .
It makes you wonder , suppose it did n’t have the value that it does ?
What kind of interesting universe would that be ?
There are probably days where you think gravity does n’t have the value that it does , when something seems to be pulling you down .
But gravity is actually in this precise little zone , and it turns out that if you go through the mathematical modeling of what would happen after the Big Bang if gravity was just a little weaker , things would just keep flying apart indefinitely .
And I mean just a little weaker , one part in a billion .
If gravity was just a little stronger , things would coalesce into stars and galaxies and planets , but a little too soon , and before we ever arrived on the scene , a Big Crunch would have followed the Big Bang .
Each one of these constants has that same amazing , precise , knife - edge tuning to it .
Now some would argue , well , so what ?
We ’re here , so it must have been OK , otherwise we would n’t be having this conversation .
But you ca n’t look at those numbers and not marvel at what ’s going on here .
You ’re basically stuck with two options :
Either those constants were set by an intelligence that was interested in having a universe that was not sterile , or the alternative is that actually there are an almost infinite number of other parallel universes out there that have different values of those constants .
Of course , we have to be here in the one where everything worked or we would n’t be having this conversation .
That second hypothesis , the multiverse hypothesis , does require a certain amount of faith because those are not other parallel universes that we ever expect we would be able to observe .
So which of those is a more faith - requiring hypothesis ?
I would ask you to think about that from my perspective , using the Ockham ’s Razor approach that the simplest explanation may in fact be the right one .
This sounds a lot like all of these things are pointing us toward a creator who had an intention about the universe that would include setting these constants so that interesting things might happen .
Then there ’s C.S. Lewis ’ point that I discovered while reading the first chapter of Mere Christianity , “ Right and Wrong as a Clue to the Meaning of the Universe . ”
Where does this notion of morality come from ?
Is this a purely evolutionary artifact , where we have been convinced by evolution that right and wrong have meanings and that we ’re supposed to do the right thing , or is there something more profound going on ?
That would be a very interesting discussion I ’m sure we could get into , and there is lots of interesting research going on about this right now by people like Martin Nowak .
But I would submit that evolution would have a very hard time explaining the most radical acts of altruism , where an individual puts himself and his future progeny at great risk by carrying out a radical sacrifice on behalf of somebody he ’s never met .
Those circumstances do n’t happen often , but when they do , we admire them .
We think of that as the example of what human nobility ought to be .
Evolution looks at that and says that ’s a scandal .
So all of that information , I guess , really began to sink in as arguments that made the plausibility of God actually pretty compelling .
Then I had to figure out , what is God like ?
That meant going and looking at the world ’s religions and trying to understand what they stood for , and finding that they ’re actually a lot alike in many ways as far as their principles , but they ’re also quite different in terms of their specifics .
Never having really known much about Jesus and discovering that he was not a myth because the historical evidence for Jesus was actually much better than I had realized – some would say better than the evidence for Julius Caesar – I began to realize he was a person to take seriously .
I encountered this particular verse , which I thought was interesting .
Jesus is asked ,
What is the greatest commandment in the law ?
He replies , “ Love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your soul and with all your mind . ”
With all your mind !
Boy , that does n’t sound like faith and reason are disconnected .
If you go back to Deuteronomy , which is where this verse is coming from , the quote is , “ With all your heart and all your strength and all your soul . ”
But Jesus adds the word “ mind , ” which I think we were supposed to notice .
So I became a Christian on that basis .
That was at the age of 27 .
Now , 32 years later , I find this to be an enormously satisfying way to be able to answer questions that science can’t answer – things like , is there a God , and what happens after we die , and why am I here anyway , which are questions that science basically says , not on the table for us .
But they ’re on the table , I think , for most of us as human beings .
So it should n’t be a problem , right ?
Faith and science are two ways of knowing .
They have to answer different questions .
Science answers questions about “ how ” ; faith answers questions about “ why . ”
I like this description , which is not original to me , that basically if you are using both science and faith , you are reading both of the books that God gave us , the book of God ’s words and the book of God ’s works , mainly nature .
No problem , right ?
Well , there seems to be a problem .
Have you ever seen the very amusing cartoon about the never - ending debate between cheddar and evangelical Goldfish crackers ?
In it a somewhat angry Richard Dawkins fish is saying , “ We came from cheese , ” while a Ken Ham fish is saying , “ We just appeared in the bag . ”
It ’s a funny cartoon , but the battle sometimes is n’t funny at all .
It seems as if we ’re locked in this kind of deliberation , this debate , which sometimes gets pretty hostile .
But how can you be both a believer and a biologist ?
I ’ve certainly been asked that question on numerous occasions by people who find out that I ’m a geneticist who studies DNA every day and I ’m a Christian .
How does that work ?
Does n’t your head explode ?
After all , do n’t you realize that evolution is incompatible with faith , so what ’s the deal here ?
Do you , Francis Collins , not believe in evolution ?
If you believe in evolution , how can you be a believer ?
That ’s the usual kind of concern .
First of all , let me say the evidence for Darwin ’s theory of descent from a common ancestor by gradual change over long periods of time operated on by natural selection is absolutely overwhelming .
It is not possible , I think , to look at that evidence accumulated , especially in the last few years on the basis of the study of DNA , and not come to the conclusion that Darwin was right .
Darwin was right in ways that Darwin himself probably never could have imagined , not knowing about DNA , not knowing that we ’d have a digital record of these events to study – but we do .
Among the evidences are the ability to compare the genomes of ourselves with other species .
Not only did we sequence the human genome , as published in Nature , but we did the mouse , and we did the chimpanzee , and we did the dog , and the honeybee , and the sea urchin , and the macaque – oh , good heavens – the platypus , and those are just the ones that ended up on the cover of Science and Nature .
By now we ’ve sequenced about 40 different vertebrate genomes .
The ability to do the comparisons is really interesting .
You can feed all of that data into a computer and say , make sense of this , without telling the computer anything about what these animals look like or what the fossil record said , and the computer comes up with this analysis with all of these species lined up in order .
Humans are there as part of this story , and the computer says , this really only makes sense if you derive this back to a common ancestor in this case of vertebrates .
We could even extend this to invertebrates , where we have lots of sequence as well .
When you look at the details of that tree in terms of which animals are clustered close together and how long the branches are , which says something about how long it ’s been since they diverged , the matchup here with the fossil record and with anatomical descriptions is breathtaking .
It ’s all very internally consistent .
You ca n’t help but realize if you read anything about Darwin that that ’s exactly what he was thinking about .
There ’s a famous page from his notebook with a drawing of a tree with the words “ I think ” at the top , something that was beginning to emerge in Darwin ’s own thought process long before he published On the Origin of Species .
This is the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of Species , and the 200th anniversary of Darwin ’s birth , so we ’re hearing a lot about Darwin .
Darwin , of course , has been demonized in many places .
I think one of the mistakes maybe we ’ve made is to use the term “ Darwinism ” to describe a fundamental discovery about biology without which you can’t really understand anything in biology at this point .
You would n’t call relativity “ Einsteinism . ”
Darwinism sort of makes it sound like it might be a cult , a personality cult , and probably that has n’t helped in this long history of misunderstanding .
So let ’s just call it evolution .
Now you might say , looking at this tree , that that does n’t prove anything about descent from a common ancestor .
If you believe that Genesis says that all of these organisms were created as individual acts of special creation , would n’t it have made sense for God to use some of the same DNA motifs , modifying them along the way ?
And would n’t it therefore seem to show you that DNA is more similar between creatures that look more like each other , so this does n’t prove anything .
And that is actually a defensible point if all you have is this kind of information .
But when you start looking at the details , that argument really ca n’t be sustained anymore .
I could give you many examples , but I ’ll just give you one because of the time .
Here is one that I think really cannot be easily understood without the common ancestor hypothesis being correct and with it involving humans .
If you look across the genome of ourselves and other species , you find genes in a particular order with space in between them .
Here ’s a place , for example , in the human and the cow and the mouse genome where you have the same three genes .
They ’re lined up in the same order , which also is consistent with a common ancestor , although it does n’t prove it .
But I picked these three for a particular reason .
These genes have funny names – so what do they actually do ?
I ’m not going to bother you about two of them , but GULO is an interesting gene .
It codes for an enzyme called gulonolactone oxidase .
So what the heck does that do ?
That is the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of vitamin C , ascorbic acid .
You probably know that vitamin C is something that ’s a vitamin because we need it .
We ca n’t make it ourselves , and the reason for that is that our GULO gene has sustained a knockout blow About half the gene has been deleted , and there ’s a little remnant left behind that you can see .
The tail end of it is still evidence that GULO used to be there , but it ’s not in any of us .
In fact , it ’s not there in any primate .
So somewhere higher up in that lineage this happened in a single individual , and that happened to be spread throughout all of the following organisms , primates and humans .
That ’s why we humans get scurvy if we do n’t have access to vitamin C. Apparently in most of human history and primate history , there was plenty of vitamin C in the environment , so there was no great loss sustained here until we went to sea for long periods of time .
Cows and mice do n’t need vitamin C ; they make their own .
They have a GULO gene that works .
Now looking at that , of course , that immediately suggests common ancestry for all three of these species – not only suggests it , but , it seems to me , demands it because if you ’re going to try to argue that the human genome was somehow special , that God created us in a different way than these other organisms , you would also have to postulate that God intentionally put a defective gene in exactly the place where a common ancestry would say it should be .
And that was done why ?
To test our faith ?
Does that sound like the action of a God of all truth ?
It does n’t seem like it .
I could give other examples .
But it is – once you look at the details – I think inescapable for somebody with an open mind to conclude that descent from a common ancestor is true and we ’re part of it .
Despite that , we have issues , especially here in the U.S. , about what people believe about this question .
You all probably have seen the Gallup Poll that gets asked every year – and we could debate whether the questions are asked in a way that elucidates what people really think .
But given the choice among three options , what do people say ?
That first option , that God guided a process that happened over millions of years – 38 percent ; the second option , that God had no part , that being a deist or an atheist perspective – 13 percent .
But the largest number – 45 percent , almost half – choose the third option , that God created human beings in their present form in the last 10,000 years .
You ca n’t arrive at that conclusion without throwing out pretty much all of the evidence from cosmology , geology , paleontology , biology , physics , chemistry , genomics and the fossil record .
Yet that is the conclusion that many Americans prefer .
The history for that is really interesting .
If you have time , read Ron Numbers ’ book called The Creationists , which goes through how it is that over the last 150 years this has become the accepted position for many evangelical Christians , who are taught if that ’s not your view , then you ’re probably in danger of a slippery slope that will cause you ultimately to lose your faith .
When I spoke in Nashville at a gathering of youth group leaders and youth pastors from mostly evangelical churches last fall , I conducted the same poll of about 7,000 people gathered in the arena .
In that instance 90 percent chose the last option .
Maybe they raised their hands because they were worried about who was watching them and they felt like that was supposed to be the answer .
Maybe in their minds they were thinking , yeah , I do n’t really know .
But we are in a funny spot here in that this has become so widely embraced .
There are a lot of forces that are trying to encourage that view .
If you ’ve been to the Creation Museum – I have n’t , but I gather some of you have – it will show you this perspective of humans and dinosaurs frolicking together in a way that ’s consistent in Ken Ham ’s view with the 6,000 - year - old Earth .
Again , many children going to see this are probably walking away thinking , yeah , that makes sense .
I get e-mails practically every week from people who were raised in this tradition and perhaps have been to the Creation Museum – many of them home schooled or schooled in a Christian high school where young Earth creationism is the only view that they ’re exposed to .
Then they get to university and they see the actual data that supports the age of the Earth as 4.5 , 5 billion years old , and they see the data that supports evolution as being correct , and they go into an intense personal crisis because they figure that if what they were told about origins from the pulpit and in Sunday school and from their parents and from their Christian high school is wrong , then why should they believe the rest of it ?
Yet these are often people whose faith is a deep and important part of who they are .
We ’ve set those folks up for a terrible struggle by what we ’re doing right now in this country .
Of course , the argument that comes back is , wait a minute , let ’s not give up so easily here .
If you ’re saying evolution is true , did n’t you just abolish the need for God ?
There ’s certainly that perspective coming through from many articulate writers , not just Richard Dawkins , but particularly Richard Dawkins – the book The God Delusion .
Of course , Christopher Hitchens , Sam Harris , Dan Dennett – the four horsemen of the atheist apocalypse , as they like to call themselves – are all writing prolifically about this and many times using evolution as a club over the head of believers , saying : Look , evolution is incontrovertibly true ; that means your idea of God is wrong and , actually , by the way , religion is evil .
I had the chance to debate Richard Dawkins in a debate that David Van Biema moderated and that is still up there on the Web if you ’re interested in going to look at this , although it ’s now been a couple of years since this was published in Time magazine .
I think that was actually a pretty useful debate in that it was not done in front of a lot of undergraduates , where you ’re just trying to score points .
It was actually done in front of the editors of Time magazine , who were quite sober about the whole thing .
I think we had a really interesting conversation , although we probably could have gone even further .
Of course , from my perspective , having been an atheist and traveled this path , it seems to me that atheism is , of all of the choices , the least rational because it assumes that you know enough to exclude the possibility of God .
And which of us could claim we know enough to make such a grand statement ?
Suppose the knowledge of God just happens to be outside of your little circle of understanding ?
Then would it not be the height of arrogance to say , I know there is no God ?
G.K. Chesterton says this quite nicely : “ Atheism is the most daring of all dogmas , the assertion of a universal negative . ”
Atheism is a pretty dogmatic position to take .
It ’s a fundamentalist position to take , in fact .
So atheism wo n’t do .
So how , then , do we put this synthesis together ?
I ’ll give you the view that I ’ve arrived at , which in my experience is also the view that about 40 percent of working scientists who believe in a personal God have arrived at .
And , by the way , it is 40 percent .
That surprises a lot of people who think atheists and scientists are synonymous .
In fact , 40 percent of us feel quite differently .
So here it is – God , who is not limited in space or time , created this universe 13.7 billion years ago with its parameters precisely tuned – that fine - tuning argument – to allow the development of complexity over long periods of time .
That plan included the mechanism of evolution to create this marvelous diversity of living things on our planet and to include ourselves , human beings .
Evolution , in the fullness of time , prepared these big - brained creatures , but that ’s probably not all we are from the perspective of a believer .
God , in that case , having a house that ’s now well - designed for it , gifted humanity with free will and with a soul .
We could argue about what a soul actually means .
And at that point , humans received this special status : made in God ’s image , not in physical terms , but in spiritual and mental terms .
We humans used our free will to disobey God – that ’s what the story of the Garden of Eden is all about – leading to our realization of being in violation of that moral law .
Thus we were estranged from God .
For Christians like myself , Jesus is the solution to that estrangement .
Now there ’s nothing in that synthesis , I would argue , that is in conflict with what I know as a scientist or with a reasonable reading of the Bible .
We ’ll come to “ reasonable ” in a moment because I think that ’s where a lot of the arguments tend to get focused .
This is often called theistic evolution .
It ’s not a great term ; evolution seems to be put forward as the noun and theistic – not too many people are quite sure what that means anyway .
So we need an alternative here .
The modest proposal is to go to the Greek and what we ’re really talking about is life , including our life , bios , through God speaking it into being , logos , the word .
In the beginning was the Word : John 1 .
Or , more simply , putting it together : BioLogos , God speaking life into being .
So there are objections to this .
No surprise there .
Some would say , evolution just does n’t seem like a very efficient method .
Why would God spend so much time getting to the point ?
Remember , a few steps back there , we said the only way you ’ve really solved the creator problem without ending up in an infinite regress is to have God be outside of time .
So , basically , it might be a long time to us , but it might be a blink of an eye to God .
That also is a useful thing to contemplate when it comes to this second question of divine action and is God involved in the evolutionary process or did he just set it up and hope it would turn out all right ?
That latter point does n’t fit very well with the idea of God being interested in us and sending Jesus to die for us .
The intelligent design perspective , which is so prominent now in the evangelical church and , of course , is a flashpoint for debates about the teaching of science in schools , is basically this one , that evolution might be OK in some ways , but it ca n’t account for the complexity of things like the bacterial flagellum , which are considered to be irreducibly complex because they have so many working parts and they do n’t work with any of the parts dropping out , so you ca n’t imagine how evolution could have produced them .
This is showing severe cracks scientifically in that the supposedly irreducibly complex structures are , increasingly , yielding up their secrets , and we can see how they have been arrived at by a stepwise mechanism that ’s quite comfortable from an evolutionary perspective .
So intelligent design is turning out to be – and probably could have been predicted to be – a God - of - the - gaps theory , which inserts
God into places that science has n’t quite yet explained , and then science comes along and explains them .
I think I would also say intelligent design is not only bad science ; it ’s questionable theology .
It implies that God was an underachiever and started this evolutionary process and then realized it was n’t going to quite work and had to keep stepping in all along the way to fix it .
That seems like a limitation of God ’s omniscience .
Of course , the biggest question for most evangelicals is :
As soon as you say that Darwin was right , have n’t you thrown out the Bible ?
Have n’t you started down a path that , ultimately , will cause you to deny the resurrection ?
Well , not so .
I think we need only go back before Darwin and see what theologians thought about Genesis to have a better conversation about this .
Now it ’s gotten so defensive .
But what did people say ?
Go back all the way to Augustine in 400 A.D.
Here is a marvelous quote from a person who I think thought as deeply about Genesis as anybody has since that book was written .
Augustine is writing here specifically about Genesis : “ In matters that are so obscure and far beyond our vision , we find in Holy Scripture passages which can be interpreted in very different ways without prejudice to the faith we have received .
In such cases , we should not rush in headlong and so firmly take our stand on one side that , if further progress in the search for truth justly undermines this position , we too fall with it . ”
And is that not what is happening in the current climate with , in fact , insistence that the only acceptable interpretation for a serious Christian now is a literal acceptance of the six days of creation , which , again , Augustine would have argued is not required by the language ?
There is a wonderful book coming out this summer by John Walton , who is a professor of Old Testament theology at Wheaton College .
He takes a completely new view of Genesis , which , by the way , makes me wonder how he could have signed the Wheaton College statement that you ’re required to about the literalness of Adam and Eve because he comes up with a very different interpretation – and a very interesting one .
It takes into account the original language , also the culture of the time – the audience that Genesis was written for – and comes up with a much more allegorical interpretation than I think most would have expected from a professor at Wheaton College .
All of this has led to lots of conversation .
I want to finish up here just by telling you a little bit about what this wonderful group that I ’ve been working with on the BioLogos Foundation has tried to do to provide some additional information here .
I published a book called The Language of God three years ago , trying to lay out the harmony of science and faith that I had found in my own life .
As a consequence , I received thousands of letters and e-mails from people who read the book or heard a presentation and wanted to go a little deeper and ask more questions about how to put together various concepts from science and faith .
I could not possibly keep up with all of those , so I have been fortunate to bring into this effort a number of fellows from the Trinity Forum Academy , which is on the Eastern Shore of Maryland , and more recently some other distinguished scientist - believers : Karl Giberson and Darrel Falk .
Ralph Veerman , who is here in the meeting , has joined this effort as well .
All of this is being managed by a very talented program director named Syman Stevens .
Together with support from the Templeton Foundation , we just launched a website on science and faith – the BioLogos Foundation website .
Let me just walk you through it .
Here are some photos from gatherings at the international BioLogos headquarters , which happens to be my dining room table .
( Laughter . )
It ’s a rather low - budget affair at the moment but not lacking in spirit and energy .
This is the homepage , which shows you some of the kinds of questions and images that we hope will draw people in .
For example : “ What ’s the proper relationship between science and religion ? ”
There are 25 of these frequently asked questions distilled from those thousands of e-mails , from which we have tried to put together thoughtful responses – not necessarily answers because some of these do n’t have single answers .
Some of them have options , various answers that might be consistent with the truth and we are not sure which one is right .
But in each instance we think there are some possible ways of resolving conflicts that people are worried about .
Each question has about a three - or four - page response , which is well - referenced with footnotes and links to other sites .
If you go through the website , it will also tell you something about the BioLogos mission – the questions , again , being the main part of this .
We have other projects that are getting underway – among them the opportunity to run a workshop next November in New York , where we ’re going to bring together scientists , theologians and pastors in a closed meeting , about 15 of each , and try to see if over a three - day period with people who are willing to be open - minded , we can get beyond this defensiveness between science and faith and into a theology that is celebrating what we are learning about God ’s creation instead of worrying about it being a threat to God .
We also have started a blog , and , in fact , we have been fortunate to be invited by Beliefnet to post this new blog on their website , which gets 22 million hits a month , in a series called “ Science and the Sacred . ” Karl Giberson , Darrel Falk and I will alternate as weekly bloggers .
On the BioLogos website , we have a news and events page as well , including a reference to the conversation that I had with Christianity Today , and shortly the Time magazine and the Religion Newswire pieces will be there too .
There ’s a resource page that points to lots of other books and leading figures for people who are interested in knowing what else is published that ’s out there , with little descriptions of each of these books .
On the contact page we provide the opportunity for people to send us queries , which we will try to keep up with , suggestions about new questions that are n’t on the list , suggestions about places where they thought the question missed the point .
We want this to be an interactive site .
The team is pretty small , but we hope over the course of time to be able to enlarge that .
It does seem , at least from the initial reaction in the first few days , that this is finding a niche that was otherwise not much occupied .
There ’s a lot out there in terms of the voices coming from the extreme ends of the spectrum – the atheist fundamentalists or the religious fundamentalists .
We hope to make a contribution to filling that void .
So I think with that , I will draw this to a close .
I just want to say what a privilege it is to be here to speak in front of all of you and how much I look forward to Barbara Bradley Hagerty ’s presentation and to the discussion that will follow .
Thank you very much .
CROMARTIE : Thank you , Dr. Collins .
( Applause . )
We asked Barbara to respond because , ladies and gentlemen , in two weeks Barbara ’s new book , The Fingerprints of God : The Search for the Science of Spirituality , will be out .
Well , it ’s out now !
I mean , I ’ve got a copy right here .
But we love having your colleagues respond to subjects , and it was wonderful to find out that Barbara ’s book that she ’s been working on for some time was just coming out at the same time as this event .
So , Barbara , we ’re delighted that you can add comments , and then we ’ll get into the Q&A and the conversation .
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY : I was sitting here listening to Francis and the line from Admiral [ James ]
Stockdale occurred , which is – remember , he was standing there in the [ 1992 vice presidential ] debates and he said , “ Who am I and why am I here ? ” ( Laughter . )
That ’s a little bit how I feel right now : a religion correspondent following the former head of the Genome Project .
But I will plow ahead because that ’s my mandate .
I will not do it without notes the way Francis can do things without notes .
I ’ve thought a lot about the evidence for or against God , or kind of an intelligence that stitches together the universe , over the last few years in terms of writing my book .
I remember having an epiphany about four years ago .
I was on the Cambridge - Templeton grant .
I was doing their fellowship at Cambridge University for two months , and in that fellowship , as you may know , they have a lot of scientists come and speak to 10 journalists that have been selected .
So I was sitting there – it was a day that John Barrow was going to speak .
John Barrow is a brilliant mathematician at Cambridge who was giving a presentation about the anthropic principle , the notion of a fine - tuned universe .
Sitting at the table with us , actually , right next to me was Richard Dawkins .
He wanted to hear Barrow speak .
As you know , Dawkins is a very vocal and famous atheist .
So as Barrow was speed - walking us through the argument that we live in an exquisitely calibrated universe , kind of what I think Freeman Dyson said :
It ’s as if the universe knew we were coming .
As he was walking us through this , Barrow said almost as an aside , I ’m quite happy with a traditional , theistic view of the universe .
I ’m sitting next to Dawkins and I ’m feeling him kind of roil like a teapot about to blow .
So finally he could n’t stand it any longer , and he said :
Why on earth do you believe in God ?
And everyone looked at Barrow .
And Barrow said :
If you want to look for divine action , physicists look at the rationality of the universe and the mathematical structure of the world .
Yes , but why do you want to look for divine action , Dawkins said .
Well , Barrow said , for the same reason that someone might not want to .
I remember thinking right there : God is a choice .
We can look for or exclude the action of the divine .
You can look at the evidence and conclude that everything is explained by material means or you can look at the world and the universe and see the hand of God .
I do n’t think that science can referee this question .
I do n’t think they can actually get at the answer on this because I think , fundamentally , whether you believe in God is a matter of belief .
For the past century , materialism had reigned triumphant .
Now Francis said that about 40 percent of scientists believe in God .
Very prominent scientists , though , at the National Academy of Sciences , only about 7 percent of them believe in God , and they often are the ones who are driving the debate .
This is radically different from the public .
I ’m not just talking about people who pray .
You know , 90 percent of people pray ; even atheists pray , which I ’ve always puzzled over .
But the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago has done extensive polling on people who have spiritual experiences – not just believe in God , but a spiritual experience .
It turns out that 51 percent of people have had a spiritual experience that absolutely transformed their lives , that they can go back and say , June 14th , 1995 , 2:00 , that day I felt something different and it transformed my life .
That ’s a lot of people .
So now I think there is a move afoot among scientists to , if not embrace , then at least study this thing called spiritual experience .
They can do that because they have the technology to do that or at least to start to make inroads .
They have brain scanners and EEGs , which allow them to peer into the brain .
Back in 2006 , I took a year off from NPR to just study , to look at what I think of as the emerging science of spirituality .
My litmus test in doing my research was this :
Basically , if a prominent scientist or if prominent scientists were investigating some aspect of spiritual experience , then it was fair game for me to report on it .
So I encountered questions like , is there a “ God spot ” in the brain ?
Is there a God chemical ?
Is God all in your head ?
These questions are a little bit tongue - in - cheek , but , actually , they let me tackle the science and explore some big philosophical questions .
What I thought I ’d do today is just talk about a couple of these questions and tell a couple of stories .
First I attacked the question of the “ God spot ” in the brain :
Is there an area of the brain that handles or mediates spiritual experience – by spiritual experience I mean that notion , that transcendent moment that you have , that sense that there ’s another being in the room or around you .
Is there a place in the brain that actually mediates that ?
The question is , if you can locate the place that mediates spiritual experience , does that mean that God is nothing more than brain tissue ?
People have long suspected that the temporal lobe has something to do with religious experience .
The temporal lobe runs along the side of your head , and it handles things like hearing and smell and memory and emotion .
The first concrete evidence that there was a connection between the temporal lobe and spiritual experience was made by a Canadian neurosurgeon named Wilder Penfield .
Back in the 1940s and ’ 50s , he began mucking around in the brains of patients as he operated on them .
There are n’t any pain receptors in the brain , so he ’d go in and he could take an electrode and prod a part of the brain – keep them awake – prod a part of the brain and see what part of the body corresponded with that part of the brain .
He would prod one little section , and he ’d get the right big toe ; he ’d prod another section , and he ’d get the lips .
He actually made a map of the brain and how it corresponds to different body parts .
Well , when he prodded the temporal lobe , something very strange happened .
People reported having out - of - body experiences and hearing voices and seeing apparitions .
He hypothesized that he might have found the seat of religious experience , the physical seat of religious experience .
So science figured out that one way to try to explore spiritual experience and look at the brain mechanics of religious experience is to look at people with temporal lobe epilepsy on the theory that the extreme elucidates the normal .
Temporal lobe epilepsy is basically an electrical storm in the brain where all the cells fire together .
Usually seizures are really horrible things .
I went to a Henry Ford hospital to the epilepsy clinic and I cannot tell you – it was just – it ’s a horrifying experience to watch a seizure .
But in a few rare cases , people have ecstatic seizures , and they believe that they are having a religious experience .
They may hear snatches of music or words , presumably from their memory bank , and they interpret it as a message from God or the music from the heavenly spheres .
They may see a snatch of light and think that that ’s an angel .
You can probably see where this is going .
Today a lot of neuroscientists have kind of retrofitted a lot of major religious leaders with temporal lobe epilepsy .
Like Saul on the road to Damascus – was he blinded by God and heard Jesus ’ voice or did he suffer , as one neurologist said , “ visual and auditory hallucinations with photism and transient blindness . ”
Joseph Smith , the founder of Mormonism , did he see a pillar of light and two angels or did he suffer a complex partial seizure ?
What about Moses and the burning bush , hearing God ’s voice ?
The list , which is compiled by Jeffrey Saver at UCLA , who is a neurologist there , includes Mohammed , Joan of Arc , Teresa of Avila , the founders of the Shaker movement , the New Jerusalem Church , the Christian Science Church , 7th Day Adventists , virtually all the mystics .
All of these people , they say , suffered from the sacred disease , which actually raises a question .
You being an expert , I ’d love to know , Francis , is there a gene – you talked about genes that can be identified with different diseases .
I wonder if there is a gene for the sacred disease , which would be religious experience .
CROMARTIE : Andrew Newberg addresses that .
BRADLEY HAGERTY : He does .
Now I ’ve got to say , I have a little trouble with this analysis , this kind of retrofitting , because it ’s hard to imagine something as debilitating as epilepsy being high on the résumé , you know , helpful in writing , say , the bulk of Christian doctrine , as did Paul ; guiding a nation through the wilderness for 40 years , as did Moses ; or founding one of the three monotheistic religions , as did Mohammed .
It ’s hard to imagine that epilepsy is actually helpful in that .
But I do think that scientists are onto something .
I think the temporal lobe may in fact be the place that mediates spiritual experience .
One of the reasons I think that – I mean , I did a lot of research here – but one of my favorite stories , one of the people who convinced me of this is a guy named Jeff Schimmel .
Jeff is a writer in Hollywood .
He was raised Jewish , never believed in God , had no interest in spirituality .
Then a few years ago , nine years ago , when he was 40 years old , he had a benign tumor in his left temporal lobe removed .
The surgery was a snap , but a couple of years later , unknown to him , he began to suffer from mini-seizures .
He began hearing things and having visions .
He remembers twice lying in bed when he looked up at the ceiling and saw a kind of swirl of blue and gold and green all settle into a shape , a pattern .
And he ’s looking at it and he ’s thinking , what is that ?
He said , then it dawned on me , it was the Virgin Mary .
Then he thinks , why would the Virgin Mary appear to a Jewish guy ?
( Laughter . )
She could do so much better .
But a few other things began to happen to Jeff .
He became fascinated with spirituality .
He found himself weeping at the drop of a hat when he saw pain in other people .
He became very interested in Buddhism .
When I talked to him for the first time , I said , how do you measure your spirituality ?
He said , well , OK – we were on the phone – I ’m looking at my mantle and I see one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , 10 , 11 Buddhas sitting on the mantle .
I mean , he became fairly obsessed with Buddhism .
But he began to wonder , could his newfound spirituality have anything to do with his brain ?
So the next time he visited his neurologist , he asked to see a picture of his brain scan , the most recent one .
And , in fact , the temporal lobe was very different – he saw the before and after the surgery .
It was very different .
It had kind of pulled away from the skull .
His temporal lobe was smaller , a different shape , it was covered with scar tissue , and those changes had begun to spark electrical firings in his brain .
He essentially developed temporal lobe epilepsy .
But there was no question in his mind that his faith , his newfound love for his fellow man , all of that , came from his brain .
So this begged a question in my mind :
Are transcendent experiences – not just Jeff Schimmel ’s , but Teresa of Avila ’s – are they merely a physiological event or could it possibly reflect an encounter with another dimension ?
I want to propose that how you come down on that issue depends on whether you think of the brain as a CD player or a radio .
Most scientists who think that everything is explainable through material processes think that the brain is like a CD player :
The content , the CD with the song on it , for example , is playing in a closed system , and if you take a hammer to the machine , you know , destroy it , the song is not going to play .
In other words , no God exists outside of the brain , no God that is trying to communicate exists outside of the brain .
All spiritual experience is inside the brain , and when you alter the brain , God and spirituality disappear .
Now there is some scientific support for this line of thinking .
These days scientists can make transcendent realities , or God , disappear or appear at will .
It ’s kind of a party trick .
Recently a group of Swiss researchers found out that when they electrically stimulated a certain part of the brain in a woman , she suddenly felt a sensed presence , that there was another being in the room enveloping her .
A lot of people describe God that way : a sensed presence , a being nearby enveloping them .
So they could conjure up God just by poking part of the brain .
Making spiritual experiences disappear is , of course , far more common .
It ’s what epilepsy specialists are actually trained to do :
It ’s called treatment .
You remove part of the temporal lobe or you medicate the brain and tamp down the electrical spikes and , voila , God disappears , all spiritual experience goes away .
But suppose the brain is n’t a CD player .
Suppose it ’s a radio .
Now in this analogy , everyone possesses the neural equipment to receive the radio program in varying degrees .
So some have the volume turned low .
I would suspect that Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens have hit the mute button .
Other people hear their favorite programs every now and again , maybe some of you all , like me , who have had brief transcendent moments .
Some people have the volume way too high or they ’re caught between stations and they hear a cacophony , and those people actually need medical help .
But in this analogy , the sender is separate from the receiver , and the content of the transmission does n’t originate in the brain anymore than , say , the hosts of “ All Things Considered ” are sitting in your radio when they ’re broadcasting , right ?
So if you destroyed the radio , you ’re not going to hear “ All Things Considered , ” but the transmission – the words of Robert Siegel or Michele Norris – that transmission is still operating .
If the brain is a receiver , then it ’s picking up God ’s communications , which never stop , even when the brain does , even when the brain has been altered by surgery or medication or death .
So that ’s not to say that all of our thoughts come from another spiritual realm any more than all of our thoughts come from “ All Things Considered , ” although I would suspect that all of my thoughts come from “ All Things Considered . ”
But it merely suggests that perhaps people who have vivid or frequent transcendent moments are able to tune into another dimension of reality that many of us ignore .
Maybe St. Paul and Joan of Arc were n’t crazy ; maybe they just had better antennae .
So that ’s one debate about the brain and whether spiritual experience is just something within the brain or something that may transcend the brain .
Another argument that God is all in your head comes from neuropharmacologists .
They propose that God is nothing more than chemical reactions in your brain .
I remember thinking about this a couple of years ago as I sat for 11 hours , from 9 p.m. to 8 a.m. on the dirt floor of a teepee .
I was at a Navajo peyote ceremony in Lukachukai , Ariz .
There were about 30 of us .
Everyone but me had ingested a whole lot of peyote – the active ingredient is mescaline .
It ’s basically a psychedelic .
I kind of wish I had as I watched everyone looking pretty happy , their heads bobbing to the beat of the drummers like little bobbleheads .
But , alas , I was there to observe .
So there I sat cross -legged for 11 hours .
Around midnight the woman who was the center of the ceremony broke her silence .
Her name was Mary Ann , and she suffered from shingles .
She had had it for a couple of months .
It had gone untreated , and this was a healing ceremony .
Around that time she confessed that 20 years earlier she had accidentally run over a man on the highway .
She stated he was already dead when she ran over his head .
But at any rate , for the past 20 years , a headless man kept haunting her dreams , and she wanted forgiveness .
She wanted the peyote , which Navajos consider to be the mediator between the spirit world and the human world – she wanted the peyote to kind of broker the deal between this guy whose head she had run over and her .
So I looked around to see if anyone else had noticed that we may have just had a confession to vehicular homicide .
Everyone was just smiling happily and nodding .
A few hours later , after a lot more peyote , Mary Ann announced that the shingles were gone .
She said , the spirit came before me and forgave me and now I ’m healed .
I ’m sitting there thinking , yeah , right , we ’ll revisit this in a couple of days and see if the shingles are really gone .
I called her a couple of months later , and , in fact , she had never suffered from shingles after that moment .
I called her just a few days ago and it never recurred .
So what you ’ve got here are three options : Door No. 1 , there was a medicinal property to the peyote that cured her shingles ; door No. 2 , the relief that she felt from her vision reduced her stress and thus her shingles ; or door No. 3 , that she really did access the spiritual world .
Peyote is like other psychedelic drugs , including LSD and magic mushrooms – magic mushrooms and psilocybin are kind of the same thing .
They seem to prompt mystical experience .
Scientists have discovered recently that these psychedelic drugs have a couple of interesting things in common .
Chemically , they all look a lot like serotonin , which is a neurotransmitter that affects parts of the brain that relate to emotions and perception .
Now scientists at Johns Hopkins University have discovered that they all target the same serotonin receptor , serotonin HT2A .
So what that receptor does is , it allows the serotonin or the psilocybin or the active ingredient of these psychedelics to create a cascade of chemical reactions , which then create the sounds and sights and smells and perceptions of a mystical experience .
Essentially , they ’ve discovered a “ God neurotransmitter , ” in a way .
So now they can get a sense of what happens in the brains of mystics or you and me when we have a spiritual experience .
What ’s really cool about this is that the war on drugs ended this sort of research for about 35 years , but now at Johns Hopkins and other places , the government ’s allowing this to go on .
They ’ll be able to give you a capsule of psilocybin , slide you into a brain scan , and actually watch spiritual experience unfold in an FMRI .
This has really opened the door for understanding the brain mechanisms of spiritual experience .
So the question is , does that mean that God is just a chemical reaction ?
I think probably a lot of scientists would say , yes .
But Roland Griffiths , who ’s the researcher at Johns Hopkins , does n’t think so , and he does n’t think so for a couple of reasons .
One is that people who have spiritual experiences can do this without help from their chemical friends , right ?
They can do it through meditation and prayer and chanting and fasting – all of these can spark spiritual experience .
Second , he says it ’s just as plausible that the chemical reactions and the electrical firings in the brain are reflecting an interaction with God or the spiritual realm .
And he uses this analogy :
He says , when you eat a piece of apple pie , all sorts of things happen in your brain .
The part of the brain that mediates smell will light up or taste will light up .
Probably the part of the brain that handles memory will light up as you think about the last time that you had a piece of apple pie .
But does the fact that there is this predictable and measurable brain activity – does that mean that the apple pie does n’t exist ?
Of course it does n’t .
So maybe , Griffiths says , this brain activity is chronicling an interaction with the divine .
He raises a third issue , which Francis alluded to , which is , why ?
Why are we wired to have mystical experiences in the first place ?
Is it possible that there is a God or an intelligence who ’s created this way ?
I mean , if there is a God who wants to communicate with us , he probably would n’t use the big toe ; he ’d probably use the brain .
Does n’t it make sense that this is how God would communicate ?
Now in the end , I do n’t think science will be able to prove or disprove God , but I do think there ’s a really fascinating debate – and I ’m going to close with this – that ’s circling around spiritual issues .
We may actually make some headway about it .
There may be a way to tackle this issue in a definitive way .
It ’s the mind - brain debate , or can consciousness operate when the brain is stilled ?
I just have one more story to tell you to illustrate a point .
In 1991 , there was a woman named Pam Reynolds .
Have you all heard of her ?
She was found to have had an aneurysm on her brain stem .
Her doctor told her that it might rupture at any moment and that she could die at any moment , and so she decided to undergo what was then a very experimental surgery called a standstill operation .
She flew out to Arizona to a place called the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix .
Essentially what they did was they put her under anesthesia , they taped her eyes shut , they put in molded speakers in her ears that emitted really loud clicks – about 90 to 100 decibels .
That ’s what a jet plane sounds like when it takes off .
So loud clicks were firing in her ears .
Then when her brain no longer responded to the clicks , the surgeons knew that they could proceed .
The way they proceeded was , they lowered her body temperature and drained the blood out of her head – kind of like draining oil out of a car engine .
The aneurysm sac collapsed for lack of blood .
The surgeons then went into her skull , snipped the aneurysm , sewed it up , warmed the blood back up , reintroduced it back into her body , raised her body temperature and brought her back to consciousness .
So she was basically without blood in her head or in a deep coma - like state for over an hour .
When she awakened , she had quite a story to tell .
Basically , she said that she floated upwards – she had an out - of - body experience and watched part of the operation – not all of it because she had a near - death experience in the middle of it .
But what was interesting was , she could describe the operating theater – how many people were there , who was placed – she could tell where men and women were .
She did n’t know their names , obviously .
She could describe a very unusual - looking bone saw called the Midas Rex bone saw and the blade container .
It ’s unusual ; it looks like an electric toothbrush , so it ’s not something you see all the time .
She heard conversations , including the one where a female surgeon said that her arteries were too small in the left groin for a tube and so the chief surgeon told the other surgeon to try the right side – she heard this kind of conversation .
So she saw things , heard things even though her senses were apparently blocked .
And then she had a typical near - death experience – the white light , seeing the dead relatives , yada , yada , yada , yada .
Now I ’m not all that interested in the near - death experience , but her ability to describe the operation while under deep anesthesia when her eyes were taped shut and her hearing blocked – it raised a question for me :
Was Pam ’s mind or consciousness operating separately from her brain ?
I ’ve heard dozens of stories about people who died on the operating table or in a car crash and felt themselves float above their bodies and claimed that they could see everything that was going on .
I thought they were interesting , but not conclusive stories .
It ’s entirely possible that their brains were operating and that this is what a brain does when it is shutting down – it creates illusions , it creates sensations .
It ’s entirely possible that this is normal activity that ’s explained by material means .
But Pam Reynolds ’ story feels a little bit more compelling to me , probably not to a lot of you , but to me it does .
For one thing , it ’s corroborated .
A doctor named Michael Sabom got all the hospital records and the transcripts from this operation and found that when Pam said something happened , that in fact did happen in the order that she suggested .
It seemed to corroborate her account .
I interviewed the chief neurosurgeon , Robert Spetzler , who confirmed that she was in a deep coma for an hour and could not have seen or heard any of the operation .
I asked him how he explained it , and he said that he “ had absolutely no explanation from a scientific perspective . ”
He also said that this has changed the way he thought about reality .
I just want to conclude by observing that in my year of interviewing scientists , I learned something about scientists .
When they hear of a case that they do n’t like – one that does n’t jive with their worldview – they call it just an anecdote .
When they like a story , they call it case history .
Now most scientists would probably say this challenge to a materialist worldview is an anecdote .
After all , Pam ’s story could lead to the astonishing notion that somehow we have consciousness or maybe a soul that could survive death .
Other scientists – in fact a growing number – will call Pam ’s story a case history , something to be explored and not just so easily dismissed .
But I ’m sure of a couple of things .
First , this question of consciousness is the next big battle in the emerging science of spirituality .
And second , how a scientist comes down on the debate about consciousness will be as much a matter of his own belief system as it will be of the science .

CROMARTIE :
Thank you very much , Barbara .
KATHLEEN PARKER , THE WASHINGTON POST : Barbara , thank you so much .
I now realize that I have completely misunderstood the G - spot all these years .
Alas , my first question is for Dr. Collins .
You may have answered this somewhat in your discussion of evolution , but if there is a God outside of nature and time , it would seem he ’s almost as smart as you are and he would have made some provision for global warming .
I wonder if you would just speak briefly on how you see the current debate in light of your scientific outlook ?
COLLINS : It does seem that our universe and our planet are remarkably stable in general .
For things that you would think might throw equilibrium off , there seems to be a tendency to regain it .
But obviously we ’re threatening that statement now with really dramatic changes in the nature of our planet by human activity .
God , for whatever reason , apparently was interested in giving humans free will .
That ’s the story of the Garden of Eden .
That ’s something familiar to all of us .
I think it ’s pretty hard to make the case that free will is an illusion .
I do n’t think of it as that at all .
And that carried with it some expectation that we might screw up , which we did from the very first moment that we had the chance to do so , and continue today .
I do n’t think God necessarily expected to come and be like a kindly grandfather and clean up after the children every time we did something wrong .
So this is our responsibility , I think , to perceive the ways in which free will can , either on an individual basis or on a basis that extends to the whole planet , be misused to cause trouble and then be used to try to find solutions , as we are increasingly now beginning to realize we have to do .
I do n’t think we can turn this around and say , God just is n’t powerful enough because God has n’t solved global warming .
If you want to postulate a circumstance where humans do not have free will , you could come up with that kind of model .
It would n’t be very interesting .
PARKER : A lot of people on the far right , now being represented by Rush Limbaugh almost exclusively , claim that global warming is – that God is too great and we are too minor to actually have affected Earth to that extent , and so we ought to just back off and let things resolve themselves .
But you would refute that , clearly ?
COLLINS : I think God gave us intelligence and curiosity and the ability to develop tools to study our environment , whether it ’s the universe or whether it ’s our own planet .
I think we ’re supposed to use those tools , and when those tools give us evidence , which is rigorously determined and leads to a conclusion that we ’re on a course that ca n’t be sustained , then to simply dismiss that as saying , God would n’t have allowed that , does n’t seem like the act of a rational person .
LAUREN GREEN , FOX NEWS :
One of the things I ’ve noticed that several scientists have said about evolution is that there ’s no evidence from the fossil record of macroevolution , which means one species actually developing , evolving , into another .
But there ’s much evidence of microevolution – you know , blue birds turning into red birds , or something like that .
Your presentation , obviously , with the DNA is quite believable , so are we going to have to let go of the idea that the fossil record ’s going to be out there to prove evolution and really start focusing on something else ?
But also , one of the things that I thought was very interesting , Dr. Gerald Schroeder , who believes in evolution but also believes that the first six days of the Bible can be summed up through time dilation – that the reference point is somewhere else in the universe , but that by the time Adam arrives , God ’s time and our time then go on a parallel motion , a parallel track .
CROMARTIE :
Who are you quoting there again , Lauren ?
GREEN : Dr. Gerald Schroeder .
CROMARTIE :
And who is he , again ?
GREEN : He is a physicist and a theologian .
COLLINS : The fossil record is expected to be incomplete and it is .
Most organisms leave no trace of their having been on this planet .
Only in exceptional circumstances is that something that we would find a record of .
It is remarkable , though , how much we ’ve learned about the fossil record in the course of the last 15 years , and a lot of comments about the incompleteness of the fossil record really need to be updated with new findings .
It used to be said , for instance , that there ’s no evidence of an intermediate between fish and land animals .
Go and look at the Canadian outcroppings where this amazing organism now called Tiktaalik was discovered , which clearly would represent a very good example of that , with the kinds of forelimbs that could both support weight on land and could be used also for locomotion in water , and with a breathing apparatus that might also be successful in both environments .
Similarly , people will cite , well , there ’s no evidence for a fossil intermediate that led to whales .
Not true .
There ’s some incredibly interesting stuff coming out of that .
Just the same , I think it is not going to be the case that we find every possible connection between every possible species .
Recognize , of course , most species became extinct before they gave rise to anything .
So when you look at what ’s alive today , you see the outcome of all the branches that actually survived , and most of the fossils you find are probably from branches that did n’t survive , just on the basis of the odds .
I think for anyone to try to use the fossil record as an argument against evolution is not well - supported , just in terms of what the expectations would be anyway .
I do think the study of DNA has taken this whole field over because of the digital evidence it provides in a way that you just ca n’t do by looking at anatomy of bones that have been in the ground for a long time .
Certainly , that requires the greatest attention .
If one is going to oppose macroevolution , then how can one come up with the explanation of these DNA relationships ?
In terms of macroevolution , it is hard to find examples that the skeptics will accept because macroevolution occurs over millions of years .
We are not given the chance to observe it happening .
Microevolution , on the other hand , is all around us .
Influenza viruses changing , as they just have , is a great microevolution example , as is bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics .
Nobody could really look at that data and not be convinced .
But to see a whole new species arise – we do not expect to have that opportunity in our lifetime .
We are just this tiny , little blink on the scale of time that ’s necessary for that .
You can see some interesting molecular examples of the consequences of macroevolution however .
Look at fish that are swimming around under the ice cap at the Arctic Circle and ask , why do n’t they freeze ?
All of these fish have various antifreezes that they ’ve developed .
They ’re a good example of what ’s called convergent evolution .
Different species have actually taken different proteins that were used for other things – a particular example is the enzyme trypsin , which we use to digest proteins .
Trypsin , it turns out also , if you mutate it just a little bit here and there , can be an antifreeze , and these fish have copied that gene over and over again .
So they make a lot of it in their blood , and it keeps their blood from freezing .
Fascinating , and it ’s hard to look at that and not say , well that ’s pretty macro !
CROMARTIE : Can you buy it over the counter , though ?
That ’s what I want to know .
( Laughter . )
COLLINS : Yeah , maybe with your peyote ; it might be just right .
CROMARTIE : Bring it on !
COLLINS : I think with the evidence , if one is willing to look at it , you really can’t walk away from macroevolution being a reality .
The comments from Gerald Schroeder about time , I ’m not familiar with the details of that .
I ’ve certainly seen examples of that put forward .
Frankly , they strain one ’s imagination and one ’s understanding of physics to the breaking point .
And the idea that there would be this kind of discontinuity in time is not something that there is any other evidence to support .
So you can only arrive at that if you insist from the get - go that there must be some way to have an Earth that ’s only 6,000 years old .
GREEN : His point was that the Bible was not a science book and that even in the Bible , the account of creation is saying that the Earth brought forth life , not God created it .
So he ’s saying that it actually supports the idea of billions of years .
But they were counting the first six days as some kind of understanding of time dilation that could have occurred , and then by the time Adam arrives on the scene , somehow that starts the motion in parallel with –
COLLINS : – more traditional time , right .
That would be consistent with some of the older versions , called the day - age theory or the gap theory of creation .
I think John Walton ’s book , The Lost World of Genesis One , takes a totally different tack on this and says even with that perspective we ’re probably straining the Scripture verses in a direction they did n’t belong to try to make sense of those six days .
Those first three days when there was no sun , how could there be a 24 - hour clock ?
A little hard to figure that out .
GREEN : Actually , he explains that too , but we will talk about that later .
COLLINS : OK .
ROSS DOUTHAT , THE NEW YORK TIMES : Dr. Collins , I wonder what you think about the idea that a lot of the resistance to the Darwinian narrative in the Christian community , and especially in the evangelical community , has less to do ultimately , maybe , with what Darwinism says about the existence of God and more to do with what Darwinism is taken to mean about the nature of God ?
It seems like if you go back to the debates over Darwinism running back into the 19th century , a lot of the Christian resistance has been driven by the idea that – you can accept the idea that God would use a gradual process to bring life into being , but the idea that God would use a gradual process that is in a sense drowned in blood and animal suffering and “ nature red in tooth and claw ” and so on , that seems to be more a manifestation of an already fallen world , I guess , even before Adam and Eve come on the scene .
It seems to me that that ’s a deep driver of Christian discomfort with Darwinism and a deep , I think , theological challenge for Christians in the wake of the Darwinian revolution .
I think there ’s also the reason that attempts to build moral philosophies around Darwinism historically have tended to take a more Nietzschean view , in some sense , and emphasize ideas of struggle and violence and so on as being at the heart of creation .
So I ’m just curious what you think about that set – that nest – of issues .
COLLINS : That ’s a very important set .
By the way , one of the questions on the website is evolutionary harshness and how do you put that together with a loving God.
Certainly for many Christians , the idea of there not being death before the fall is a major stumbling block to accepting evolution in the first place .
Readings of the Bible and the way this is referred to subsequently in the New Testament , particularly in Romans 5 and in 1st Corinthians 15 , seem to suggest the idea that death came about through Adam ’s sin and was not previously present .
That interpretation actually , if you look closely , does not fit well with what the original Genesis account in Scripture says .
It ’s clear animal death is not being talked about ; it ’s human death , and it ’s probably human spiritual death .
So the notion that Scripture somehow would not allow an evolutionary process that includes death of animals – you really can’t make that story out of the Scriptures if you look carefully at the words .
And it seems that Adam must have been familiar with death ; otherwise , why would he have been afraid of the concept of that being a consequence of sin ?
Presumably Adam knew that animals died .
Obviously from a scientific perspective it gets really difficult to go very far down the path without saying , come on , people , the evidence for death down through the hundreds of millennia , through the fossil record and lots of other perspectives , is overwhelming .
Had there not been , you can imagine in a Malthusian way how the world would be truly unsustainable because of the difficulty in population explosions .
Part of the issue is that we humans are very schizophrenic in our thinking about death .
We think that , in a certain way , death is evil and harsh and mean - spirited and no one should have to suffer that .
Yet at the same time , we know that we will .
We know also , if we ’re believers , that the point of our existence goes beyond our earthly life , and so death is a necessary doorway .
So why then , from that perspective , would the notion that evolution also involves life and death be such a wrenching discontinuity with our view of God ?
It ’s not a question that has easy answers , and I ’m not providing them .
Again , if you go to that particular question on the website , you ’ll see we do n’t have an answer – we have a set of responses .
Scientifically , death has clearly been part of what ’s going on .
Biblically , it ’s clear also that death is consistent in the animal kingdom with God ’s plan .
So then you ’re left with some questions :
Why is that the best plan and why was n’t there some other plan where everything could have been nicer and smoother and nobody had to suffer the nature red in tooth and claw part ?
Could n’t we just have a God who is a kindly grandfather and wanted everybody to have a good time everyday ?
Well , apparently , that ’s not the God we have .
DAVID VAN BIEMA , TIME : I actually have two questions for Dr. Collins .
One of them involves time .
Lauren brought up this notion of Gerald Schroeder ’s of time dilation , which you seem skeptical of , but it does seem to me as though , if you ’re talking about the six numbers , that the idea of a God who is outside of our notion of time is one of the more fundamental ideas .
And yet , the notion of a being who stands outside of time is sort of inconsistent with our personal experience and seems in some ways one of the more arbitrary notions involved in the argument .
So my easy out for you is to ask you what else stands outside of time because I imagine physicists have some idea about that .
But then to ask whether , whatever the answer to that may be , whether that can truly be applied to a being of the sort that we have in mind with God , or whether that ’s just something that we choose to believe in order to believe in God – that ’s the first question .
The second question – and I ’m not certain whether I ’m messing up Barbara ’s argument – but it seems to me that to a certain extent she ’s suggesting that a lot of what she has researched comes down to a little bit of a six - of - one , half - a - dozen - of - the - other , that you can interpret these things one way or you can choose to interpret them the other way .
It seems to me that that is kind of a situation that many atheists or atheism - leaning agnostics would accept , that they ’ll accept what they see as a microscopic chance of God as being the explanation for these things in a whole universe of other chances if the believers are willing to say the same .
Two very different questions .
COLLINS : So the question of time .
Again , I do n’t think it ’s just an arbitrary , ad - hoc effort to try to solve the problem about how evolution can still involve God to say that God is outside of time .
I think you come to the God - outside - of - time answer from a different perspective , which I touched on but probably did n’t articulate very well .
It essentially involves the whole idea of the creation because , of course , go to Dawkins ’ book and what is the argument that he sees as the strongest against a creator God ?
It is , then who created God ?
Another one of the FAQs on our website , by the way .
If you have a God who lives within time , then you are obligated , I think , to address the question of what came before .
If God , on the other hand , is outside of time , that question no longer makes sense .
It ’s a category error .
So I think one is forced to that timelessness conclusion .
The point you made I ’ve certainly heard as well , which is , if God is outside of time , how does that mesh with the fact that we believers claim a personal relationship with him but also attest to the historical nature and person of Jesus Christ as being God ’s son – part of the Trinity ?
How can that work ?
Can God actually be both outside of time and in time ?
I would say , yeah .
What ’s against that ?
And admittedly , this is a problem for us because our experience and our brains are not set up to imagine what being outside of time would be like , and I do n’t think there are other aspects of physics that fit nicely into this .
So at this point , we ’re waving our hands .
I think we ’re forced to the conclusion of a God who ’s not limited by time , but if God is God , that does n’t mean that God cannot invade the natural world , including the axis of time , in ways that suit God ’s purposes .
And who would we be to say , oh , no , no , no , no , that ’s not our idea of how you should be able to behave ?
Putting that into the equation , you still have this interesting debate about whether evolution was pre-loaded by God with the seeds of its potentiality , which is actually Augustine ’s view .
Remarkably , he ’s way pre-Darwinian but actually sounding quite like that – prescient , even .
If you read in Alister McGrath ’s Gifford Lectures , which were just published , his chapter on Augustine , where he goes through this concept of the seeds of potentiality that Augustine puts forward , my goodness , it sounds like evolution some 1,400 years ahead of schedule .
Or , on the other hand , is God inhabiting evolution in some way that we cannot and will never perceive , not in an intelligent design way of fixing up the bacterial flagellum , but by participating in some way in this remarkable process with an intention toward certain outcomes ?
I ca n’t distinguish the differences between those options .
I do n’t think we have the tools to distinguish them .
And either way , you can say that this is not a godless process , that God does have God ’s hand upon it – whether in a timeless or a time - specific way , I ca n’t answer .
Your question about the six - of - one , half - a - dozen - of - the - other – I think the one option , though , that is taken off the table by the data that Barbara nicely described is the idea that spiritual experiences are just made up , that people are faking it .
There are people who have argued that , and they ’ve now had to be quiet .
Clearly there are brain - image defined patterns that tell you something really remarkable is going on when a Carmelite nun is deep in meditation .
So it ’s not just one of those things where you were told as a child , well , you should have these experiences , so you try to pretend that you are .
There ’s something much more going on .
But I like the CD player versus the radio analogy .
I think the people who like the CD player model will continue to like it , but as you said , maybe opening the door a crack to the idea that there ’s actually a signal coming from somewhere , and maybe we all would be better off , as you said , if we would admit that we ’re not absolutely sure of our own position on any of these matters .
I ’m not .
That ’s why it ’s called faith .
BRADLEY HAGERTY : Can I just jump in here ?
CROMARTIE : Please , jump in .
I ’m just trying to sort it all out .
BRADLEY HAGERTY : One of the interesting developments , of course , in the last few years is the rise of the new atheists , and what Dawkins and others would have you believe is that they can prove there is no God .
The reason I decided to look at the “ science of spirituality ” is because science is really in some ways our religion in the 21st century .
It ’s what we trust , the unbiased referee about what is true and what is n’t .
And so if Dawkins is right and God is a delusion and he can prove that scientifically , that ’s bad news for the Christian home team or Jews or whatever – believers of all stripes .
What I was interested in seeing is , does spiritual experience in some way stand up to science , not proving that there is a God , but at least holding its own ?
My view on this is that – what , 96 percent of the universe is dark matter – there ’s a lot that we do n’t understand about the world , and for people to say that absolutely they can prove there is no God or an intelligence that stitches together the universe , I think that ’s a bit arrogant .
I think it ’s also arrogant to say there absolutely is a God and if you do n’t come to Jesus as your personal savior , you ’re going to go to hell .
Both of them are arrogant positions , it seems to me .
I was n’t indifferent .
I do n’t think anyone ’s indifferent to the question ; I think everyone has his personal beliefs .
But I think maybe the good news for believers is that the non-believers have n’t proved their point and that there ’s a lot more research to be done .
I think scientific tools will allow us to further improve and explore the issue .
E.J. DIONNE , THE WASHINGTON POST : Thank you for great presentations .
I think all of us are going to be carrying CD players and radios in our – and I never thought before , but now I believe that Robert Siegel and Michele Norris – there is that analogy to the Almighty .
( Laughter . )
And if you remember , it gives new meaning to Dan Rather ’s famous line , “ Kenneth , what ’s the frequency ? ” ( Laughter . )
It ’s a spiritual thought .
I wanted to ask Dr. Collins two questions .
The first is , I ca n’t tell whether you are making a case for faith or a case for a humble and open - minded agnosticism , which is to say , I think you make a powerful case against a dogmatic atheism .
You have three propositions : Belief in God is incompatible with reason .
I think you knocked that one down .
But then there are two other possibilities .
Belief in God is compatible with reason .
Or , the existence of God can be proven through reason .
Those are two different propositions .
One might look at these scientific facts and have them lead you to God or one might look at these and decide there is no evidence that God is there .
You said , I think rightly – you rejected the idea we know enough to exclude the existence of God .
But do we know enough to include the existence of God ?
I thought one of the most powerful things Barbara said is , God is a choice , which suggests that there ’s a certain subjectivism underlying this argument .
And the second question I can’t resist asking is a theological one really , which is , even assuming that your account is true and that God created the universe , why do you believe we are obligated to love him or her ?
COLLINS : I do not believe that we will be given proof of God ’s existence .
I do n’t think that ’s forthcoming , no matter how clever we get in discerning all of these attributes of God ’s creation .
For whatever reason , I do n’t think it was part of God ’s purpose to make it that easy .
I think we were going to be faced with a choice , and that was part of the intention of our relationship with God .
I do think , though , that God gave us some pretty interesting pointers , and I tried to describe some of those .
Some of them are about matter and energy , which makes them sound more sort of deistic , but some of them are about ourselves , and particularly this existence of the moral law – this universal knowledge down through history in all cultures and all times of what the difference is between right and wrong and that we ’re called to do the right thing .
I continually come back to that as a pretty interesting place to find this pointer to God .
When we search our own hearts , this is what we learn about ourselves .
Now across cultures we will differ a lot in terms of what we call right and what we call wrong .
Influenced by our culture around us , we may put things in different boxes depending on what our culture tells us .
But we do n’t differ in the idea that there is a thing called right and we ’re supposed to do that .
It ’s an interesting law because we break it every day , and then we make excuses , which basically say we know we ’re actually supposed to adhere to this law , otherwise we would n’t bother making the excuses .
If you ’re looking for evidences – not proofs , but evidences – of God , this seems like a pretty powerful one that applies to each one of us .
But then what does it say about God ?
If God is the author of this moral law , then it seems God must stand for what is good and holy .
So it ’s telling us also about the character of God .
If we are in some way becoming aware of that , and at the same time aware of our own imperfections , you ca n’t stand in front of that evidence without feeling both in awe and also humbled , I think , as a creature that is falling short of what God expected of you .
That part of the awareness of God , maybe , is not so much initially love as it is , frankly , fear .
It was for me .
In fact , this is one of the things that brought me , after my search through all the world ’s religions , to realize that Christianity was going to be the one that made the most sense , because that fear of the widening gap between the holy God and my unholy self desperately needed a solution .
As I began to learn about this figure of Christ and read the historical record , well - documented by witnesses , of what it is that Christ said God was like – that ’s where a lot of the sense of God ’s character , for me , came from – then this became both a bridge to reach out to that holy God , despite my imperfections , and a description of what God must be like on the basis of what Jesus was like .
So all of that , over the course of two years , not five minutes before the coffee break – ( laughter ) – kind of came together in a fashion that made the most incredible sense , even though a few years earlier , that same story would have sounded to me like utter gibberish .
And again , maybe that ’s the mark of a religious conversion , when things that sound like gibberish suddenly become the greatest truths .
I do n’t think I ’ll get further than that , as far as proof of God ’s existence .
And I have doubts .
I mean , do n’t we all , whatever our position is ?
Paul Tillich said that doubt is not the opposite of faith ; it ’s an element of faith , if you ’re being honest .
So , OK , my faith is honest then because I have doubt in there as well .
But still , coming back to this synthesis of the pointers to God from nature , the pointers to God from within myself , and then the person of Jesus teaching me something about what God must be like and providing a solution to my imperfection – it all hangs together and it leads me to a perspective of being in awe and worship and love for God the creator .
MICHAEL GERSON , THE WASHINGTON POST :
As I have talked to Andy Newberg about this and visited his lab and other things ,
Andy has a much tougher time than Francis does and I do with specific religious commitments , not for a metaphysical reason but for an epistemological reason .
The brain research indicates that human beings have a tremendous desire for certainty , a kind of artificial certainty that comes from the brain .
And it makes him very skeptical of specific religious affirmations , not because they ’re impossible but because they ’re culturally conditioned .
We ’re wired for certainty .
So the question does n’t become questioning the existence of God but questioning our own certainties , given the predisposition of the brain and whether truth in these matters is accessible because of the way we ’re wired .
I ’m interested in what your reaction to that argument is and maybe Francis ’ too in this case .
The reality is people in various cultures believe that their tradition is absolutely true , and it seems to be related to the brain .
How does that affect the nature of belief and our confidence in our beliefs ?
BRADLEY HAGERTY : I actually found Andy ’s research theologically the most disturbing for me , personally , because everyone has a belief system .
They have a way to make sense of the world .
If you ’re spiritual , you often do it through some type of religion or not , Judaism or whatever .
If I can just tell you what Andy found when he looked at different types of religious people doing their religious practices , whether it was Franciscan nuns or Tibetan Buddhist monks –
CROMARTIE : Barbara , tell them who Andrew Newberg is .
BRADLEY HAGERTY : Oh , I ’m sorry .
Andrew Newberg is a neuroscientist and radiologist at the University of Pennsylvania , who has basically been running people through brain scans to see what happens when they engage in religious practices .
CROMARTIE : We had him here .
If you go to pewforum.org , you can see the dialogue we had with Dr. Newberg .
BRADLEY HAGERTY : What he has found is that generally much of religious practice looks the same in the brain .
So whether you ’re a Sikh chanting or whether you ’re a Carmelite nun or a Franciscan nun –
CROMARTIE : Pentecostal .
BRADLEY HAGERTY : Well , actually that is a big exception .
I ’ll tell you about that .
Whether you ’re a nun or a Buddhist monk or even a Sufi , basically the same types of brain activity occur .
It ’s like one is taking Google Maps and the other is taking MapQuest , and neurologically they get to the same place , this undifferentiated state , using the same neural network .
The big exception is Pentecostals , which I just love .
In nuns and monks and all of that , the frontal lobes activate , increase in activity , which shows that they ’re concentrating .
It ’s the executive area of the brain .
And the parietal lobe , which orients you in time and space , it goes dark , so that they do n’t have a sense of where their body ends and the universe begins .
So there is a sense of merging with Christ or merging with the universe .
These things happen with Buddhist monks and nuns and all that – Sikhs – except when you get to the Pentecostals , and actually the reverse is true .
Their frontal lobes shut down – which is not good news for the home team – but their frontal lobes shut down an

A chat with Ken Marino , Ken Marino interview , the State , Party Down , Reaper
TV Home / Entertainment Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
These days , Ken Marino can be seen serving up comedy as Ron Donald on Starz ’s “ Party Down , ” and he also achieved a certain degree of cult fame for playing a gay demon on The CW ’s late , great “ Reaper , ” but in the mid-1990s , he was – along with ten other really funny people – a cast member of MTV’s “ The State . ”
It ’s been a long , hard road getting the series to DVD , due to the horror of music licensing , but at long last , “ The State : The Complete Series ” is making its debut on July 14 , and if truth be told , Marino ’s as happy about it as anyone .
Bullz - Eye chatted with him about his work on the show ( though we did not ask him to dip his balls in anything , as that would have been highly unprofessional ) , slid in a few questions about “ Reaper ” and “ Party Down , ” and got the latest update on the long - rumored “ State ” movie .
Bullz - Eye : Well , geez , now that “ The State ” is finally coming out on DVD , I feel like I should start quizzing you guys about when “ You Wrote It , You Watch It ” is going to be released .
Ken Marino : ( Laughs )
How many people have you been talking to about “ The State ” ?
BE : I ’ve got a pretty decent track record .
I ’ve talked to Ben and Thomas , Michael , David , Joe , and now you .
KM : Wow .
You know , to be honest with you , I thought it was going to be on the DVD .
It is n’t ?
BE : Not that I ’ve seen .

There is , however , an appearance by the guys on “ The Jon Stewart Show . ” )
KM : Well , in that case , you got me .
( Laughs ) I ’ll be honest with you : I ’m very curious to see that stuff .
I have n’t seen that stuff in …well , even longer than it ’s been since I ’ve seen “ The State ” !
BE : So how much of a relief is it to finally get “ The State ” into stores after having been asked about it for so long ?
On getting " The State " released on DVD : " David ( Wain ) kind of headed the campaign to get it done , and he dealt with the outside forces that were trying to put it together or to block it or whatever , so I would just get E - mail updates .
At a certain point , I just got numb to that .
I was just , like , ' Oh , it ’s never gonna happen . "
KM : Well , selfishly , I ’m just happy so that I can watch it !
David ( Wain ) kind of headed the campaign to get it done , and he dealt with the outside forces that were trying to put it together or to block it or whatever , so I would just get E - mail updates .
At a certain point , I just got numb to that .
I was just , like , “ Oh , it ’s never gonna happen . ”
BE : So were you just like the rest of us , watching DVRs and 3rd- generation VHS tapes ?
KM : I have VHS tapes .
I was just cleaning out my garage , and I found a shitload of them .
David , I think , informed me , “ You know , VHS tapes do n’t hold up .
They ’re probably already worthless . ”
So I ’m glad that the DVD ’s coming out !
BE : So what were the writing teams like for “ The State ” back then ?
Was there a tendency for the same folks to write together , or did you mix it up for variety just to see what came out ?
KM :
You know , we would always … there were smaller groups of people .
Sometimes people would write alone .
I liked to go off and write with different groups of people .
Like , Mike Black and I would write together , or David and I , or David , Kevin , and I .
And Joe , Ben , and I would go to one of our apartments , drink a bunch of beer and maybe smoke some pot and then write skits .
A lot of those skits never got made .
( Laughs )
BE : Was there a particular favorite collaborative team ?
I know you worked with David a lot .
KM : No , I mean , it was always fun working with everybody in the group .
That was the thing .
It ’s amazing to think about that now : we all got along .
Certainly , there was a competitive nature , and there were fights within the group at times , but we ’re still all pretty tight , and we ’re still all good friends .
There ’s something about those guys and gal for me that I loved creating with them , and I always did .
There was never anybody who I was , like , “ I like this more . ”
It was just always fun to think up really stupid jokes with people and write them on bar napkins over beers .
BE : You guys did pretty good at picking pop culture targets who ’ve stood the test of time .
Like , there ’s the sketch where a house is first invested by Slash , then by Flea(s ) .
KM : ( Laughs )
Um…yeah , maybe heroin has something to do with it ?
BE : Could be .
Of course , there are also some definitive time - capsule moments for people who lived through the ‘ 90s .
I mean , at one point , I just went , “ Aw , they ’re making fun of Dan Cortese !
That ’s so cute ! ”
KM : ( Bursts out laughing )
Yeah , it ’s gonna be really interesting to see this .
I ’m assuming that there ’ll be a new group of people who ’ve never seen “ The State , ” and they ’ll go , “ Yeah , I ’ve heard a lot about this , I ’m looking forward to seeing it . ”
And then they ’ll watch it and be , like , “ Who the fuck … ?
What is this ?
What are they making fun of ?
Who is that ? ”
BE : So be honest : what ’s the most inappropriate time or place that the phrase “ I want to dip my balls in it ” has been thrown back at you ?
KM : ( Laughs ) I want to say my wedding , but it was n’t .
I do n’t know , man .
I mean , is there an appropriate place to say it ?
BE : Maybe not .
It seems like one of those phrases where you ’d have to be really drunk to scream it out in a crowd .
KM : Yeah , well , that has happened .
Not me screaming it out in a crowd , but other people .
BE : I ’ve heard that , at first , you guys did n’t have any real interest in doing recurring characters .
KM : No , we were very much against it , and that was the reason we did … that was , I guess , why we did Louie .
The point was that the catchphrase you can say over and over again was completely created .
It was our saying , “ Fuck you , we do n’t want to do this ! ”
And , of course , it wound up being huge .
I have n’t seen it in a long time , but in the first season , I think there ’s a whole episode dedicated to , “ And , now , our big recurring character ’s going to come up at the end of the show !
Here he comes !
It ’s Louie , the greatest recurring character ! ”
And then we were never going to do it again , because he was pointless .
But , of course , we ended up doing him a bunch more times .
But recurring characters were , in that first season , mandated by MTV .
They said , “ We want recurring characters , we wanted sick and twisted pieces , we want pop culture references , and MTV parodies . ”
And I think you ’ll see that in the first season , but once they kind of loosened up the reigns a little bit , I think we mostly avoided that kind of stuff … except for recurring characters , because we were , like , “ Hey , actually , recurring characters are fun to do ! ”
BE : Was there , like , a flipping of the switch when you realized , “ Hey , we can get more screen time if we keep doing the same characters over and over again ? ”
KM : ( Laughs )
Yeah , I think so .
There was always competition within the group to get the screen time , so , yeah , that might ’ve been an easy way to do it .
BE : Is there any character that you guys created that you think actually could ’ve maintained a feature - length film , a la “ Saturday Night Live ” ?
KM : ( Goes quiet for several seconds ) Maybe Doug .
BE : Doug is pretty awesome .
KM : Yeah , I think Doug would be the guy .
On writing for " The State " : " Sometimes people would write alone .
I liked to go off and write with different groups of people .
Like , Mike Black and I would write together , or David and I , or David , Kevin , and I .
And Joe , Ben , and I would go to one of our apartments , drink a bunch of beer and maybe smoke some pot and then write skits .
A lot of those skits never got made . "
BE : Of the bizarre one - off sketches that you guys did , I think the most inspired might ’ve been “ Mime Crash . ”
KM : “ Mime Crash ” ?
Oh , is that the one with the taped - off area ?
BE : Yeah , the mime ’s pretending to be a pilot , but he does n’t have the experience to land the plane , so he has to be talked down .
KM : Oh , my God .
You know , see , I have n’t thought of that one in 15 years , and now I ’m really curious to see it .
Is that on YouTube ?
BE : It may be .
But I ’ve already got a copy of the set .
KM : Oh , yeah ?
How is it ?
BE : Oh , it ’s great !
It ’s awesome , in fact .
And I have n’t seen these episodes in years , either , so it ’s fantastic to see them .
KM : Does it look like really cheap video ?
I bet it does .
BE : Well , not all of it .
There are certainly some bits where , in their appearance , they really show their age .
But it ’s aged pretty well .
And you guys …
KM : … look like babies ?
( Laughs )
BE : I was going to say “ kids , ” but same difference .
( Laughs )
KM : I ca n’t wait to see it .
I do n’t have it yet .
BE : I ca n’t believe I have a copy and you do n’t .
KM : Neither can I! ( Laughs )
( Writer ’s interjection :
If there was a silent “ you son of a bitch ” after Marino ’s commented , it would ’ve been totally warranted .
God love you , MTV and Paramount , for finally getting “ The State ” onto DVD , but there ’s just something damned inappropriate about the fact that a lowly journalist like myself was able to get an advance copy of the “ State ” set before one of the show ’s cast got one . )
BE : Do you have a favorite sketch that never made it to air ?
KM : Well , we did one that …I do n’t think it ever made it to air , but it was on “ Skits and Stickers , ” which was this VHS best - of kind of thing that we put out at one point .
It was a parody of horror movies that Joe and I wrote , and , basically , the killer is the actual video camera , just this floating video camera .
I do n’t know if it holds up .
I ’m sure it does n’t , and I ’m sure that ’s why we did n’t put it in the actual show , but I have fond memories of the scenes that Joe and I did in that particular piece .
He ’s a young drifter , I ’m a cop , and we ’re just screaming at each other .
BE : Actually , that gives the perfect opportunity to ask if there ’s anything to report on “ People Will Die , ” the script you and Joe have written ?
I ’ve read about it online .
KM : Oh , yes , we ’re …getting there .
It ’s hard , ‘ cause Joe and I are both working on other things , so we try to squeeze it in at different times , but we ’re getting there .
I think it ’s pretty funny .
And creepy .
So we ’ll see if there ’s a market for horror - comedy .
Sometimes there is , sometimes there ’s not .
It depends on which way the wind is blowing in Hollywood .
BE : Actually , speaking of scary stuff , do you think we ’ll ever see “ The State ’s 43rd Annual All - Star Halloween Special ” on DVD ?
KM : ( Laughs )
You know , I hope so .
Maybe if this DVD does well , maybe we can put it out .
I remember there being some good stuff on that .
But , again , I have n’t seen that in a long time .
Have you seen it ?
BE : No , I know of its existence , and I know that Sonic Youth was the musical guest , but I ’ve never actually seen it .
On The State 's unreleased album : " From what I remember , it ’s a drunken mess .
We were , like , ' Okay , if we take all our money and get tickets and go to the Bahamas to record it at a recording studio down there , we wo n’t really make any money , but we ’ll be in the Bahamas for two weeks .
You wanna do that ?'
If you listen closely on a number of the pieces , you ’ll hear ice in our glasses making noise , because we were constantly drinking whatever local flavored drinks were around . "
KM : Yeah , Sonic
Youth was the music guest , and a bunch of people did guest spots .
Shit , I ca n’t remember who .
Um… Janeane Garofalo , Jon Stewart , and Denis Leary , I think RuPaul was on it , and …Sting ?
And Larry…no , not Larry King , Alan King .
Anyway , a shitload of people .
They just kind of showed up , said a couple of funny lines , and left .
I think about four people watched it .
I ’m so glad we left MTV to do it .
BE : It ’s funny that you guys had so many guest stars on the special .
You look back at the entire run of the series , and it ’s , like , Jon Stewart , Gilbert Gottfried , Frank Whaley , and that ’s it .
KM : ( Explodes with laughter )
Yeah , we really had a lot of pull .
BE : I know the Jon Stewart connection , but how did Gilbert and Frank make it into the mix ?
KM : I think they said , “ Yes . ” ( Laughs )
We said , “ Hey , we need somebody .
Who can we get ? ”
And we were with our big agency , William Morris , and they said , “ Well , let ’s see : we represent Gilbert Gottfriend , and he said he ’d do it . ”
So he showed up for about a half - hour , he did n’t know what the hell was going on , and he left .
And Frank
Whaley , I think , is a friend of a bunch of people in the group .
BE : When is someone going to start bootlegging the album you guys recorded for Warner Brothers ?
KM :
You know , I feel like it ’s already out there .
BE : Maybe it is .
KM : I think it ’s out there , online .
Somebody already did it .
Yeah , it ’s …it has its moments .
But from what I remember , it ’s a drunken mess .
We all basically got paid to do this album , and we were , like , “ Okay , if we take all our money and get tickets and go to the Bahamas to record it at a recording studio down there , we wo n’t really make any money , but we ’ll be in the Bahamas for two weeks .
You wanna do that ? ”
“ Yeah , let ’s do that . ”
So we went to the Bahamas for two weeks .
And if you listen closely on a number of the pieces , you ’ll hear ice in our glasses making noise , because we were constantly drinking whatever local flavored drinks were around .
I wish we would ’ve taken it a little more seriously .
( Laughs )
But we were in the Bahamas , for God ’s sake !
But I do actually think there ’s some funny stuff on there .
BE : A couple of quick one - liners to wrap things up .
Any further development on the oft - rumored “ State ” movie ?
KM :
You know , we all want to do it , but it ’s just very , very difficult to get eleven people freed up for a couple of months .
It ’s very , very hard .
But , you know , whenever it comes up … and we have a bunch of material that we wrote for it , but then whenever it comes up , everybody ’s working .
Everybody ’s doing some other stuff , so it ’s just very difficult to get everybody ’s schedules on the same page .
BE : If they found the money to make a 2 - hour “ Reaper ” movie , would you be up for returning as Tony ?
KM : Oh , absolutely !
Are you kidding ?
It was great .
I have to say that , the first couple of times that I got into the four and a half hours of make - up for the demon costume , it was awesome .
And then after that , I was , like , “ Yeah , okay , I did it .
I do n’t you to need to do it anymore . ”
Under my horse - hoof legs , I was in six - inch women ’s high heels , and I had these really thick contacts in , so it got a little tedious after awhile .
But the actual character and the part … ?
Awesome .
Absolutely .
And to work with those people again ?
Definitely .
BE : Have you heard anything definitive about Jennifer Coolidge being full - time on “ Party Down ” next time ?
KM : I have not .
I do n’t know what ’s going on , actually .
BE : They officially confirmed that Jane Lynch is off to “ Glee . ”
KM : Yeah , and that ’s a big bummer , I know , for us and for Jane .
She wanted to do “ Party Down . ”
She ’s just incredible , and it ’s a big loss for us , but what are going to do ?
BE : What the heck happened with “ Outnumbered ” ?
It was on the slate for mid-season , and then it was suddenly gone .
KM : Did you see the pilot ?
BE : I ’ve read a review of it over on TheFutonCritic.com , but I did n’t actually see it myself .
KM : Yeah , it was good , but it was just …
I do n’t know , they showed it at the upfronts , and it was going ot be a mid-season replacement , and then it just went away .
But what was nice about that was that it ended up being a good thing for me .
If it had been picked up , then I would n’t have been able to do “ Party Down , ” and I could n’t be more proud of that show .
I love the people I ’m working with there , and I ca n’t wait to get back .
We shoot the second season in September , and I ca n’t wait .
BE : I know I need to wrap up , but a friend of mine wanted me to tell you how much she loves “ Diggers . ”
KM : Oh , tell her thank you so much !
It means a lot .
It ’s a very special movie to me .
BE : Do you think it was just the curse of the period piece that kept it from being any bigger than it was ?
Because it was a heck of a cast .
KM : I think that it ’s just … you know , movies like that , unless they get some push and somebody puts them out there …I mean , it was a small movie .
And , also , it was a victim of …oh , not a victim of , but it was part of Mark Cuban ’s thing with releasing films on his HD Network and on video and in theaters at the same time .
It was a very small movie , and it was n’t in many theaters , but it was well - received , and it holds a special place in my heart .
I ’m just happy that it got made .
BE : And , lastly , there ’s a line in your Wikipedia entry which states that you can be seen in the introductory film that accompanies Disney ’s Rock ‘ n ’ Rollercoaster .
Is that true ?
KM : Oh , yeah !
If you really want to see a fantastic performance by me , a non-verbal performance , you can see me as the sound guy if you ’re waiting in line for the Aerosmith Rock ‘ N’ Rollercoaster .
BE : Definitive proof that Ken Marino can emote .
KM : ( Laughs ) Absolutely .
All right , man , good talking to you .
Thanks a lot !

Radical proposals to give every 18 - year - old a £ 5,000 voucher to spend as they wish on their training or higher education are proposed in a highly critical report published today into Britain 's professional " closed shop " .
The report by an all - party panel chaired by the former cabinet minister Alan Milburn paints a damning portrayal of a country in which family wealth , private education and privileged access to university remain the key to well - paid professions .
It says : " There is a chasm between where we are and where we need to be if Britain is to realise the social benefits of the expected growth in 7 m professional jobs in the coming decades . "
The report , which also proposes a payment - by - results scheme for schools , accuses the professional classes of a " closed shop mentality " and " opportunity hoarding " , so making Britain one of the least socially mobile countries in Europe .
It finds that although only 7 % of the population attend independent schools , well over half the members of the professions have done so .
For example , 75 % of judges , 70 % of finance directors , 45 % of top civil servants and 32 % of MPs were privately educated .
The report says one in six parents cannot get their children into a decent school , leading it to conclude : " The problem is not a shortage of parental aspiration .
It is a shortage of good schools . "
The trend is for professionals to come from wealthier than average backgrounds , with today 's younger professionals born in 1970 typically growing up in a family with an income 27 % above that of the average family .
The typical doctor or lawyer of the future will today be growing up in a family that is better off than five in six of all families in the UK .
The typical journalist or accountant of the future , meanwhile , will today be growing up in a family that is better off than three in four of all families in the UK .
Similarly , the typical engineer or teacher of tomorrow will now be growing up in a family that is better off than two in three of all families in the UK .
In recommendations that are likely to lead to accusations of " dumbing down " , the report proposes university admissions policies take account of the social background of applicants when looking at examination results .
It says there is no evidence that such admissions criteria leads to worse results .
It also suggests that part - time students should be given more financial support because they will form a growing part of future universities intake .
At present they are not eligible for student loan support .
Students studying from home should not need to pay tuition fees , the report says – a proposal to which the government is sympathetic .
It also proposes that universities sit on the governing boards of secondary schools , and recommends that better information should be collated on the background of university applicants .
It is estimated that only 29 % of students – and just 16 % at the Russsell group of universities – come from lower socio- economic backgrounds , even though they make up 50 % of young people .
The report proposes a revolution in training by giving learners a £ 5,000 lifelong individual budget , topped up by employers , which could be redeemed for apprenticeships , professional qualifications or part - time further and higher education .
The aim would be to set up a truly demand - led training system in Britain .
In his foreword Milburn says : " Britain 's got talent – lots of it .
It is not ability that is unevenly distributed in our society .
It is opportunity . "
He argues that the professional classes have erected a host of new barriers to keep their jobs the preserve of the middle classes – including restricting work experience to the children of friends , internships that are only available to children in the south who have the parental wealth to work for nothing , and " qualification inflation " that prevents those without university degrees getting a job .
Overall , the report argues that the most important factor in widening participation in universities would be to improve the pass rate for five GCSEs , including maths and English , for lower socio-economic groups .
But it points out that over half of secondary schools located in the 10 % most deprived parts of England do not achieve the government 's official benchmark for a non-failing school , which is 30 % of children getting five good GCSEs .
The report suggests : " Individual parents in areas where schools are consistently underperforming could be given a new right of redress to choose a better school for their child through an education credit worth 150 % of the cost of the child 's schooling . "
Schools should also be given financial incentives to improve pupils ' overall outcomes , the report says .
It also proposes dismantling the government 's careers service Connexions , saying the panel has not heard a good word about the service , which focuses on vulnerable young people .
Schools and colleges should be reallocated the £ 200 m to provide careeers advice .
A national network of mentors to help children aged nine to 13 , initially focusing on 3,000 less privileged children , is also recommended
The report was welcomed by Labour and Conservatives , but the children 's department said it would have to study proposals to give financial incentives for schools based on their pupils ' outcomes .
The shadow higher education spokesman , David Willetts , said : " It was refreshing to read a report from a Labour politician that is not spending his time trying to draw up artificial dividing lines with the Conservatives , but instead address the issues . "
A battle over the legalities of poker is headed to the Colorado Supreme Court .
The Poker Players Alliance , an advocacy group , said today that one of its members will petition the state ’s high court for a review of a district court ruling this month that poker is considered gambling under Colorado law .
“ We clearly think this is the wrong interpretation of the law , especially in regard to poker , and the PPA is committed to helping demonstrate to the Colorado Supreme Court the broad academic research that exists showing that poker is indeed a game of skill , ” PPA executive director John Pappas said in a statement .
The case stems from an undercover probe by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation last year into a $ 20 buy - in Texas Hold ’em tournament at a Greeley watering hole .
Five people were arrested and charged with illegal gambling .
In January , a county court jury acquitted Kevin Raley , one of the organizers of the game and the first defendant to go to trial .
Charges against the others were then dropped .
During trial , Raley argued , among other things , that poker is a game of skill and not a game of chance .
Illegal gambling occurs when a game has chance , risk ( such as a buy - in ) and reward .
If poker is deemed a game of skill , then it would not fall under Colorado ’s gambling statutes .
The trial judge allowed Raley to call an expert — University of Denver professor Bob Hannum — to testify that poker is a game of skill .
Raley also presented evidence that everyone at the tournament had a social relationship , which would make the game legal .
The jury did n’t state a reason for the not - guilty verdict , so it ’s unclear which argument swayed jurors .
Raley ca n’t be retried , and charges against his partners wo n’t be refiled .
Nonetheless , to clarify Colorado ’s gambling laws in regard to poker for future prosecutions , the state appealed to the district court .
This month , a district court judge ruled that the lower court erred in allowing Hannum to testify because poker is already considered gambling under Colorado law .
“ The activity at issue in this case involved gambling , and the only exception that properly should have been presented to the jury for consideration was whether the activity fell within the social - gambling exception , ” Judge James Hartmann wrote in his opinion Aug .
4 .
If Hartmann ’s ruling is upheld , cash poker games and Hold ’em tournaments that charge a buy - in would be legal only at casinos in one of Colorado ’s three gambling towns or at a place where everyone has a “ bona fide ” social relationship .

Manchester City kicked off an ambitious summer of rebuilding by completing a £ 12 m deal for Gareth Barry last night and the club will follow that with an attempt to lure Carlos Tevez from Old Trafford later this week .
Aston Villa accepted a straight cash bid for Barry yesterday morning as City officials , mindful of frustrations in the last transfer window and the ambitions of the billionaire owner , Sheikh Mansour , wasted little time in finalising a fee for the long - time Liverpool target .
The 28 - year - old , who last summer cited Champions League football as the motivation for exchanging Villa Park for Anfield , held talks with City yesterday afternoon and will fly to Kazakhstan with the England squad this morning having doubled his previous salary to £ 100,000 a week .
Next in line for City is Tevez , ­provided Kia Joorabchian , the head of the consortium that owns the Argentinian 's economic rights , decides to invite rival offers for the striker following his latest round of talks with Manchester United .
David Gill , the United chief executive , is scheduled to meet Joorabchian in the next 48 hours in the hope of finally resolving the impasse over Tevez 's future at Old ­Trafford .
Gill indicated before last week 's Champions League final that United are now prepared to pay the £ 25.5 m required to turn the striker 's two - year loan spell into a permanent deal , despite ­describing the sum as " a bit toppy " and initially ­hoping to reduce the fee by up to a third .
Joleon Lescott may also be a target for Mark Hughes although Everton are likely to rebuff any move for the England defender .
Joorabchian has resisted several offers for Tevez from rival clubs , with Chelsea and Real Madrid believed to be among them , as he allows United the chance to take the option they agreed in 2007 .
A representative of Tevez , however , has claimed his client has been " humiliated " by United 's reluctance to meet the ­original asking price and , if no agreement is reached this week , the way will be clear for City to make an official bid .
Rafael Benítez is also interested in Tevez but cannot compete financially with Chelsea , Real or City , and not even for Barry , who was more of a priority than the Argentinian for the Liverpool manager but has now escaped his pursuit for a second and probably final time .
The England international has signed a five - year contract with City , who met no late competition from Liverpool , following swift negotiations with the executive chairman , Garry Cook , at the national team 's base , The Grove near Watford .
He was also granted permission by the Football Association to leave training with England and undergo a medical .
" I 'm delighted to be joining City , " Barry said .
" It did n't take much persuasion from Mark Hughes –they are heading in the direction I want to go .
There is great potential here , and I 'm sure there will be a few more additions to the squad this summer . "
Hughes said : " When players of his quality become available then you have to be in the market for them so we are absolutely delighted that we have been able to conclude this deal .
" The experience required to compete with the best in the Premier League is vital .
With Gareth we get the experience of someone who has played week - in , week - out in the hardest league in the world .
He plays at a level that has an impact on the game and we are thrilled that he is joining us . "
Barry 's decision to move to City will sit uncomfortably with Villa supporters and Martin O'Neill .
The former Brighton trainee indicated 12 months ago that the chance to play Champions League football was the motivation for his desire to join Liverpool .
City , however , finished 10th in the Premier League , 12 points behind Villa , and failed to qualify for the Europa League , leaving Barry open to ­accusations that finance rather than football has ­influenced his decision .
Indeed , it is highly possible that O'Neill knew what was around the corner when , in the closing weeks of the season , he repeatedly said that no one at Villa Park would " begrudge " Barry the opportunity to join a Champions League club .
Villa offered the club 's longest servant – he joined 12 years ago – a new contract worth around £ 80,000 a week but once City tabled a £ 12 m bid for a player who could leave for nothing this time next year , and it was obvious that Barry 's head had been turned , O'Neill advised Randy Lerner , the chairman , to sanction the deal .
City 's successful pursuit of Barry is unlikely to come as a major shock to Benítez , although the Liverpool captain , Steven Gerrard , expressed a desire to see his England colleague at Anfield only this week , but it may yet complicate his summer transfer policy .
Benítez , thwarted in five attempts to sign Barry last year , remained keen to bring the midfielder to Anfield despite the possible ramifications for Real Madrid 's target Xabi Alonso .
Benítez has said his compatriot is not for sale , though Alonso could yet force the issue by declaring he wants to end his five - year stay at Liverpool .
Athletic Bilbao's central midfielder , Javi Martínez , is a possible alternative to Barry for the Liverpool manager .
Tugay , the former Blackburn midfielder , has said he is joining City 's coaching staff .
He knows Hughes from Ewood Park and said he would " work as a coach " before becoming " technical director " .
" I made an agreement with Manchester City and will work as a coach , " Tugay told Turkish TV station NTV .
" To work there will be a huge step for me .
When I feel strong enough , then I will begin to work as a technical director . "
Tugay retired from playing at the end of this season .
As endlessly predicted , Apple 's unveiled a new iPhone today at WWDC , the iPhone 3G S -- the " s " stands for speed .
Although it looks almost exactly like the 3G , it 's much , much faster -- some tasks are almost four times faster .
Data speeds are upped to 7.2 Mbps HSDPA , and the camera is now a 3 megapixel unit with tap - to - autofocus and auto white balance -- and just as expected , it now supports 30 fps VGA video recording with editing features .
You 're also getting a built - in compass , Nike + support , and a new battery that offers 5 hours of 3G talk time and 9 hours of WiFi internet use .
There are some surprises , too -- holding down the home button now enables a new voice control interface that lets you do everything from make calls to control iTunes , and Apple 's touting a new " fingerprint - resistant oleophobic coating . "
New and end - of - contract pricing is set at $ 199 for 16GB and $ 299 for 32 GB when it goes on sale June 19th Stateside and in 80 more countries in August -- and the current 8 GB 3G will remain on sale for $ 99 , effective immediately .
You 'll have to pay a bit more if you 're mid-contract , though -- $ 299 for the 3G and $ 399 /$ 499 for the 3G S .
Teens beat mom's boyfriend over misunderstanding
Posted Friday , July 3 , 2009 7:01 am
HARTFORD , Conn . ( AP ) -- A 16 - year - old girl thought she heard her mother being assaulted by her boyfriend and rounded up some friends who beat him up , only to learn later that the couple actually were having sex , the woman and police said .
The girl misinterpreted the woman 's amorous screams , and she and four other teens went to the woman 's bedroom in the Torrington home on June 6 , police Lt. Bruce Whiteley said Thursday .
One of the teens beat the 25 - year - old man with a bat and others punched him , police said .
He suffered a black eye and several bruises .
The girl , two 17 - year - old boys and Dilyen Langdeau , 19 , of Torrington , were arrested Tuesday night and arraigned in Bantam Superior Court on Wednesday .
Langdeau was charged with assault and conspiracy ; the teens face similar counts .
The fifth teenager was not charged .
A judge sealed the police report .
The names of the girl and the two boys were not released because of their ages .
The 34 - year - old woman , Melanie Arnold , told The Associated Press on Thursday that the girl is her daughter .
Arnold denied she was screaming , and said her daughter thought she heard a slap and believed an assault was happening .

" Instead of asking what was going on , they assumed and took matters into their own hands , " Arnold said .
" Now they have to learn a lesson . "
The teens knocked on the bedroom door and Arnold opened it , according to the couple , who recently broke up .
The teens rushed into the room and the man , Roger Swanson , said he did n't have a chance to explain himself .
He said he tried to get away , but the teens chased him down and started beating him in the house .
He said he knelt down over a chair and tried to protect his face , but got hit in the eye and in the back .
He said Arnold covered his back to try to protect him , but the teen with the bat started hitting him in the legs .
Then the youths left .
" What if they fight someone else and those guys do n't walk away ?
What if they kill somebody ? " he said .
" Then they 're going to spend the rest of their lives in jail .
These kids need to learn , go through the court system and see if you do something to somebody , you see what happens . "
While doing some research on the latest news about space strategy games under development I came across with the FreeOrion project .
FreeOrion is an open - source project which goal is to build a turn based 4 x space strategy game .
The entire project is community - centered were people who share the common motivation are invited to contribute to build the game in many ways , some as programmers , others as conceptual designers , others as opinion makers .
As stated in the project vision the game is inspired in the Master of Orion series and it will be a turn - based strategy game built - in the classic 4X model style .
Edit : For an interview I did with the FreeOrion Programming Lead please refer to : Interview with FreeOrion ’s Programming Lead : Zach Laine . / Edit
Current status
As far as I could tell from the official page forums and wiki the project seems to have started somewhere around 5 to 6 years ago and the word is that the game is currently in the alpha stage and that it will be still a while till it is finished .
You can see the project roadmap here .
The most recent version available to download is currently ( version 0.3.13 ) which means that according to the roadmap there is still a long way to go .
First impressions
After checking out the forums of the project and reading some people announcements , ideas and warnings of premature and unstable material my expectations became rather low .
I downloaded the most recent build available for Windows ( version 0.3.13 ) from the project sourceforge that you can find in this link ( there are also builds for Linux and Mac ) .
I installed the game ( clean ) , launched it ( sounds good ) , there is already a more than presentable main menu , good ambient sound music and voila the galaxy is presented to you in all of its splendor .
Immediately you identify familiar things about the game that makes you remember of Master of Orion like for example the ship movement mechanics ( select a ship with a left mouse click and choose destination planet with right - click with spaceship immediately moving towards the planet ) .
After some time clicking on the menus , mostly in the planets and in the spaceships I have to say that it seemed that I was really playing a Orion game .
And I do n’t think more of a compliment to the design & development team I can give than this .
In spite the version still being alpha with all the expected unpolished graphics , many unfinished functionalities , others still not present at all and clunky User Interface I really have to say that I got hooked immediately to the game atmosphere and I really wanted to play more .
Oh and by the way , no software crashes :) still …
Some screenshots
As you can see the galaxy map already shows a good presentation .
The production screen still looks unfinished , a lot of polish to be done , more solid graphics and definitely better UI still required .
The research screen shows potential but , as normal , is still rough around the edges ( rather messy and confusing dependencies with all that curvy lines around ) .
All things considered I think that all of this is already great work !
The project seems to be in the good path .

You can see more screen shots here .
Conclusion
FreeOrion is definitely a project to take seriously and to watch closely in the near future .
The game seems really to embrace the spirit of the Master of Orion series .
I personally became quite interested in knowing more about the project and to contribute myself to the cause with all the means I can .
For now I ’m spreading the word , in the near future I plan to make updates at least when the major project milestones are announced .
Godspeed FreeOrion , and watch out for the Guardian ! :)

Stevie Nicks celebrated her 61st birthday today .
It makes you wonder how a 61 year old lady can look so good .
The music business is VERY tough and competitive .
But let ’s not forget about the critics , studio time and tours .
All this leads to stress , which can make you grow old fast .
Stevie Nicks still looks great and her voice is still going pretty strong .
I hope I look half as good when I am 60 .
Rock on Stevie and Happy Birthday !
August is a big vacation month in North America and Europe .
So it ’s not surprising to find columnists writing about lessons learned from their summer travels .
Nor is it surprising they ’d learn lessons from what most of us do on vacation — getting outdoors and connecting to something less cerebral and urban than our daily routines .
Take Nicholas Kristoff , in “ Food for the Soul . ”
His visit back home to the Willamette Valley in Oregon leads him to wax eloquent about the price we ’ve paid for large - scale industrial efficiency in agriculture .
His co-columnist Thomas Friedman , on safari in Botswana , writes in “ Connecting Nature ’s Dots ” about what we can learn by reading the " newspaper " of markings in a dirt road ; the remarkable connectedness in nature .
And Natalie Angier , in “ Brain is a co-conspirator in a Vicious Stress Loop , ” suggests the antidote to a vicious circle of stress that hardwires even more stress into the brain .
The antidote is August .
Having just returned from vacation myself , it struck me that my own reflections followed a similar pattern .
I took a vista - on - steroids trip from Vancouver to Calgary , with stunning views of rivers , deserts and mountains from train , helicopter and roadside .
Fabulous memories and photos — but from all of it , one image stands out .
It ’s the view of several animal crossings being built across the trans - Canadian highway near Banff .
The crossings look pretty much like any other bridge built to carry a local road over a highway — except that they ’re for animal roads .
They carry not asphalt , but earth and vegetation .
The road down their middle is buried below the edges , so animals ca n’t see the gas - powered people traffic beneath them as they cross on their own roads .
Built for deer , moose , porcupines , marmots , bears , bighorn sheep , ground squirrels and other inhabitants of the neighborhood , the bridges prevent cars from crashing into moose on the highway — something good for neither moose nor car .
But roadkill prevention alone could be handled just by fences .
More broadly , the bridges keep the highways from dissecting ecologically integrated communities into fragmented pieces .
Animals require certain geographic ranges of movement to sustain themselves as a population .
In communities like Banff , the delicate balance between town garbage regulations , coyotes , wolves , bears , bobcats and dogs makes clear the lessons of interdependence between all creatures and their ecosystems .
Why should a Canadian living in Nova Scotia give a damn whether a deer crosses the highway in Alberta ?
Why should an Albertan care , for that matter ?
The only answer is , because they have evolved a society that grants social permission for the collective care and feeding of the interdependencies that underlie society .
Granted , those of us in urban US environments can also cite extraordinary examples of social interdependence .
Cities do n’t work without massive social recognition of the need to get along together .
But the animal bridges provide a counterpoint to , for example , the current health care debate in the US .
If the Canadians can recognize and act upon — at a Federal level — the value of protecting inter-species interdependence , why ca n’t their neighbors to the south figure out the value of providing universal basic health care coverage to their own species ?
Evolved social structures — including trust — have to begin with the recognition that we ’re all in this together .
August is a good time to remember the interdependencies that make trust so valuable .
Arms Sales Tables
Country Profile
Saudi Arabia is America�s top customer .
Since 1990 , the U.S. government , through the Pentagon�s arms export program , has arranged for the delivery of more than $ 39.6 billion in foreign military sales to Saudi Arabia , and an additional $ 394 million worth of arms were delivered to the Saudi regime through the State Department�s direct commercial sales program during that same period .
( Foreign Military and Construction Sales and Direct Commercial Sales are recorded and published by the Dept. of Defense in Foreign Military Sales , Foreign Military Construction Sales and Military Assistance Facts ; the most current online edition includes information through FY 1999 . )
Oil rich Saudi Arabia is a cash - paying customer .
It receives no U.S. military assistance to finance these purchases , although it does demand that about 35 percent of all major contracts be " offset " - that is , economic benefits equaling 35 percent of the arms contract value must be steered back to the Saudi economy .
( Check out the Offsets Monitoring Project for more information on this phenomenon . )
The United States has very close and long - running military ties to the Saudi regime dating back to 1945 .
Following the 1990 - 91 war against Iraq , more than 5,000 U.S. troops and thousands of U.S. military contractors have been continuously based in Saudi Arabia .
However , several concerns have been raised about this close military cooperation and the related sales of sophisticated arms .
These concerns are :
Sophisticated arms sales to Saudi Arabia spurring regional arms races
With billions of petro-dollars , Saudi Arabia has been buying very modern , deadly weapons from America .
Many of the systems on order , such as the M - 1A2 Abrams main battle tank , M - 2A2 Bradley armored vehicles , F - 15E Strike Eagle attack aircraft and Patriot surface - to - air missile , are the top - of - the - line systems deployed with U.S. forces .
A flurry of expensive arms sales followed the 1990 - 91 Gulf War .
However , long before Iraq invaded Kuwait , Saudi Arabia sought to obtain America�s most sophisticated weaponry in order to counterbalance its much more populous regional rivals - Iran and Iraq .
From 1986 - 93 , these three countries accounted for nearly 40 percent of all arms exports to developing world countries .
Saudi Arabia imported $ 55.6 billion in arms , Iraq imported $ 22.7 billion , and Iran imported $ 13.9 billion .
( Richard F. Grimmett , Congressional Research Service , Conventional Arms Transfers to the Third World , 1986 - 93 , " 29 July 1994 )
Recent U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia have dramatically raised the level of military technology in the region , spurring arms races with other Persian Gulf states and with Israel .
Having denied Egypt�s request for the sale of Apache helicopters equipped with Longbow radar , the U.S. government has approved the possible sale of this technology to Saudi Arabia .
This move opens the way for a further shift in the balance of power and technology in this region .
The sale of F - 15E bombers provides a good case study of how others respond to sales of high - tech U.S. arms .
Saudi Arabia had sought to buy the jet in the mid-1980s , but Congress opposed the sale on the grounds that it would threaten Israel .
( While relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia improved following the Gulf War , the two are technically still in a state of war . )
In September 1992 , the Bush Administration and Congress approved the export of 48 of the aircraft to Saudi Arabia , largely on the basis of an aggressive " jobs now " campaign waged by McDonnell Douglas ( MD ) , the manufacturer of the aircraft .
The Air Force was finished procuring the jet , and so MD devised a national campaign to promote the controversial sale explicitly on the number of jobs that it would sustain ( see Arms Sales Monitor No. 16 and No. 17 ) .
The sale got caught up in presidential politics , with then - candidate Bill Clinton endorsing the deal while on a campaign stop in St. Louis , where the jet is manufactured .
Shortly thereafter President Bush announced his support for the sale while at a campaign - style rally at the McDonnell Douglas factory .
This was the first time the jet -- which can deliver twelve tons of bombs 1,000 miles -- had been exported to any nation .
Only two years previously , the plane was rushed into service with the U.S. Air Force for the Gulf War , where it was used on hundreds of deep - strike bombing raids .
The Saudi planes will be less capable than U.S. F - 15E jets : they will carry less ordnance and are not currently slated to carry AMRAAM or HARM missiles , and the radar will have a lower resolution .
Nevertheless , this was the most sophisticated combat aircraft the United States had ever exported ... until a year and a half later , when the Clinton Administration and Congress agreed to give Israel 21 F - 15E bombers with greater capabilities , in order to maintain Israel 's qualitative military edge over Saudi Arabia .
Having gained U.S. government approval for two sales of its most advanced fighter - bomber , MD is eagerly anticipating more :
It recently competed ( unsuccessfully ) for a sale of 20 to 80 long - range attack planes to the United Arab Emirates .
The winner of that $ 8 billion - plus competition is Lockheed Martin , which will develop an " enhanced strategic " version of its popular F - 16 fighter for the U.A.E .
The F - 16 " ES " would have several improved features over the F - 16s flown by the U.S. Air Force : a reduced radar signature , conformal fuel tanks , internal navigation and targeting gear and a un-refueled combat range of 1,000 miles .
In addition , as a condition of the sale , the U.A.E. has demanded that the jets be equipped with the Air Force 's most advanced medium - range air - to - air missile ( AMRAAM ) -- and the Clinton Administration agreed .
Previously the U.S. had declined to export this missile to countries in the region .
Now Israel , Egypt , Bahrain , and Saudi Arabia have all lined up to get AMRAAMs .
Since the U.A.E. jet sale , Saudi Arabia has been making noises about buying more F - 15s , which Israel opposes .
Saudi Arabia has threatened the United States not to base decisions future export decisions on regional security and avoiding arms races : � Officials in the Saudi capital have hinted that the kingdom may look elsewhere for a replacement for the F - 5 if the USA continues to link future military sales to Israeli security concerns . �
( �Country Briefing : Saudi Arabia , � Jane 's Defense Weekly , 18 August 1999 , p. 30 ) .
Through these sales , the U.S. government has dramatically raised the standard of combat aircraft and munitions of U.S. allies in the region , many of whom are engaged in a " cold peace " with each other .
Large - scale sales of advanced conventional weapons to our Middle Eastern allies play into the threat perceptions of " unfriendly " governments as well , in this case Iran and Iraq , spurring them to seek countervailing weapons .
Such sales by the United States also give the green light to other arms exporters to introduce new levels of military technology into this and other tense regions .
A 1995 report by the CIA 's non-proliferation center noted that " as countries ' reliance on exports to maintain their defense industrial base grows , pressures will increase to export advanced conventional weapons and technologies to remain competitive with the United States in the world arms market " ( emphasis added ) .
By making multi-billion dollar sales of extremely advanced weaponry to the Middle East , the United States government has diminished credibility in pressing other governments to refrain from making sales that it views as dangerous .
[ See U.S. Nonproliferation Policy , hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee ( Washington : U.S. GPO , 1994 ) , pp. 27-29 on the difficulty the United States faces in persuading Russia to forgo arms exports to Iran , given high level U.S. arms transfers to Persian Gulf countries . ]
At the same time , defense and intelligence officials now routinely cite the spread of advanced and , on occasion , low end conventional weapons as a threat to U.S. security .
And , completing the circle , the military services and industry justify development and production of next - generation weapons on the basis of arms being acquired by Third World nations , including previously - exported U.S. systems .
In lobbying Congress for production funds for its F - 22 fighter , Lockheed cites the widespread proliferation of very capable combat aircraft , like the Russian MiG - 29 and the American - made F - 15 and F - 16 .
High level military expenditures undermining stability
From 1987 - 97 Saudi Arabia is estimated to have spent $ 262 billion ( constant 1997 dollars ) on its military , with its annual military expenditure consuming on average 18 percent of GNP .
( By comparison , the United States spent about 4.6 percent of its GNP on the military during this same time . )
During just 1995 - 97 , over $ 31 billion was spent on arms imports from the United States and Europe .
( U.S. State Department , World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers 1998 )
Low oil prices , a $ 60 billion tab for the 1991 Gulf War , and tens of billions of dollars worth of new weapons have led to large budget deficits for the past several years .
These budgetary problems have led the Saudi Kingdom to revise payments on $ 25 - $ 30 billion of U.S. arms contracts .
A January 1994 deal between the United States and Saudi Arabia extends payment and delivery schedules for outstanding weapons orders ; less important orders may be postponed .
Saudi financial problems will grow when the embargo on Iraqi oil sales -- in place since 1991 - - is lifted .
According to William Quandt , a middle east scholar at the Brookings Institution , " This is not a popular regime .
It 's a huge patronage system that has spread the wealth around .
If you take that away , you could contribute to a political crisis " ( New York Times , 23 August 1993 ) .
In May 1995 the State Department acknowledged that the economic downturn in Saudi Arabia is undermining political stability in the sheikdom , as the Saudi government is cutting popular public subsidies for gas , electricity and water in an effort to redress the deficit .
In a letter to Rep. Lee Hamilton ( D - IN ) , the State Department reported that " Tighter government budgets have reduced employment opportunities for young Saudis , frozen wages and slowed the private sector ....
The short term economic downturn has colored popular perceptions of the government�s financial management and sharpened the distinctions among the social groups .
These economic strains have added to the resentment over the advantages enjoyed by the very large Saudi royal family . "
Hamilton asked the State Department whether U.S. efforts to boost sales of advanced weaponry and aircraft have contributed to the Saudis� financial woes and whether the burden of these payments contributes to anti-American sentiment .
" We are aware that the high profile of some U.S. commercial successes has generated criticism of the U.S. in sectors of Saudi society which believe incorrectly that the U.S. has pressed the Saudi government to make unwanted or unneeded purchases , " said the State Department .
" It is the Saudis alone who have defined their import priorities .
Thus , it is misleading to suggest that U.S. companies are responsible for Saudi economic problems . "
( For a copy of Rep. Hamilton�s inquiry and the State Department�s response , see Congressional Record , 2 May 1995 , pp. E908 - 10 )
Actually , the United States has been helping Saudi Arabia define its military needs for over fifty years .
In 1991 , Lt. Gen. Dennis Malcor completed the most recent DOD assessment of Saudi Arabia�s security needs , which presumably laid the ground work for recent U.S. sales of Patriot anti-aircraft missiles , F - 15E bombers and M - 1A2 tanks .
And , according to a report in the Washington Times in May 1995 , the Pentagon recommended that the Saudis buy several Aegis - class destroyers and cruisers at $ 1 billion each .
Opposition to American military presence on Saudi soil
Despite high military spending , Saudi Arabia remains unable to defend itself , principally because of its small population and large territory .
There are only about 7 million Saudis , while there are 21 million people in Iraq and 66 million in Iran .
The chief of U.S. naval intelligence has said that , regardless of " long - term plans to expand their military with the purchase of equipment ... , it is doubtful that the Saudis would be able to counter threats from Iran and Iraq completely .
The United States , or a coalition , would have to be called upon again to provide protection or to repel aggression . "
A prominent Saudi official has said the Gulf War demonstrated that " no matter how built up we become , we can't replace the U.S.... The U.S. is our protector . "
The " invasion " of Saudi Arabia by hundreds of thousands of Western soldiers during Operation Desert Storm caused a backlash among Saudi conservatives , and some liberals , who want to preserve Arabian culture and fear domination by the West .
Some secular Saudis dislike the Saudi family 's domination of the state and the corruption it breeds .
More radical Muslims assail the royal family for allying itself with the infidel United States .
For decades , the Saudis avoided publicly associating themselves too closely with the United States unless absolutely necessary .
A powerful bomb exploded at Saudi National Guard headquarters in Riyadh on 13 November 1995 , killing eight and wounding 60 more .
Over 1,300 U.S. Army and civilian contractors work there training the Guard , whose main function is to protect the ruling family .
Five of the dead and half of the casualties were Americans .
Since the blast , the U.S. embassy has repeatedly advised the 30,000 Americans in Saudi Arabia ( many of them arms contractors or military personnel ) to " keep a low profile . "
Lt. Gen. Thomas Rhame , director of the Pentagon�s arms sales agency , notified Congress two days after the blast that , " The overall effectiveness of the U.S. security assistance mission in Saudi Arabia is not expected to be hampered as a result of this incident . "
Two Islamic groups claimed responsibility for the bombings , and four Saudis were publicly beheaded on 31 May 1996 for their connection to the bombing .
Their confession which implicated Saudi financier Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network of terrorists was later dismissed .
A second bomb exploded at the Khobar Towers , just outside an airbase in Dhahran , Saudi Arabia on 25 June 1996 .
Nineteen American servicemen were killed and 100 were seriously injured in the blast .
Speculation that bin Laden was behind the bombings has more recently been dismissed , but the U.S. Justice Department has charged that the Saudi Government is withholding evidence and hindering the investigation into the bombing .
The U.S. government continues to support the government of King Fahd , but it has decided to move U.S. troops away from major cities to more secure ( isolated ) parts of the country .
In June 1997 , Secretary of Defense William Cohen traveled to Saudi Arabia , where he met with King Fahd .
The two confirmed the " firm and unshakable " relationship between the two countries ( Washington Times , 15 June 1997 ) .
Political repression and violations of human rights
Despite the show of U.S. support demonstrated by this astounding quantity of arms sales , Saudi Arabia�s human rights record is very poor .
According to the U.S. State Department�s 2000 Human Rights Report , the Saudi government�s " human rights record remained generally poor in a number of areas , � with reports of arbitrary arrest , prolonged detention and physical abuse of prisoners .
Such practices technically violate Saudi law , yet security forces commit abuses �with the acquiescence� of the government .
In addition , the government prohibits or restricts freedom of speech , the press , assembly , association , and religion .
Since Saudi Arabia is a monarchy , there is no method or right by which citizens can bring about government change .
Amnesty International has recently launched a campaign to highlight the worst abuses of the Saudi justice system and the relative silence of the international community .
Concurring with and expanding upon the State Department�s annual report , Amnesty documents experiences young , female , foreign workers who have been charges and sentenced without any semblance of due process , such as access to a lawyer , consulate , or even information about the crimes allegedly committed .
Also detailed are tales of torture of prisoners using electro - shock batons �weapons that the U.S. Commerce Department has authorized to be shipped to Saudi Arabia at least a dozen times .
Saudi Arabia�s position as a strategic Gulf ally has blinded U.S. officials into approving a level and quality of arms exports that should never have been allowed to a non-democratic country with a poor human rights record .
The United States has also sold small weapons and security equipment most likely to be used in the commission of human rights abuses .
The Pentagon delivered $ 23 million worth of guns and ammunition to Saudi Arabia during 1996 - 98 , and the State Department authorized export of another $ 4.8 million of guns , grenade launchers , police riot control equipment , ammunition , and ammunition raw materials and manufacturing equipment during the same time period .
The U.S. Department of Commerce has authorized the transfer of electro - shock batons , and police equipment possibly including thumb cuffs , leg irons , shackles , and handcuffs .
The following reports by Amnesty International on Saudi Arabia are available online :
� A Justice System Without Justice , � May 2000 .
Saudi Arabia : a Secret State of Suffering , March 2000
" Military , Security and Police Relations : Stop Arming the Torturers ,
For an overview of political instability in Saudi Arabia , see Milton Viorst , " The Storm and the Citadel , " Foreign Affairs , Jan. / Feb. 1996 .
Regional tensions
Saudi Arabia�s relations with its smaller neighbors have been difficult on occasion , even with the fellow monarchies of the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) .
Qataris and Saudis clashed over a disputed border post in September 1992 , leaving two dead .
Qatar boycotted several GCC meetings after the skirmish .
Qatar and Saudi Arabia were also at odds over the civil war in Yemen in 1994 ( Jane 's Intelligence Review , August 1994 ) .
In Yemen , victorious northern forces accused the Saudis of sending arms , money and mercenaries to breakaway southern forces .
Saudi Arabia tried , and failed , to conquer Yemen , which lies on its southern border , during its consolidation of the Kingdom in the 1930s .
James Wyllie of the University of Aberdeen suggested in 1992 that " Yemeni democracy presents a sharp and embarrassing contrast to Saudi Arabia 's deep - seated political conservatism ( Jane 's Intelligence Review , June 1992 ) .
Yemen 's 1993 elections , in which women were allowed to vote , were the first ever held on the Arabian peninsula .
Saudi Arabia expelled between 500,000 and 800,000 Yemenis in 1990 and 1991 to punish Yemen for its opposition to the war against Iraq .
Concerns about proliferation : nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles
The Saudi inclination to buy security may have included attempts to acquire nuclear weapons , according to a Saudi defector .
Mohammed Khilewi , first secretary at the Saudi mission to the United Nations until July 1994 , said that the Saudis have sought a bomb since 1975 .
According to Khilewi , the Saudis sought to buy nuclear reactors from China , supported Pakistan 's nuclear program , and contributed $ 5 billion to Iraq 's nuclear weapons program between 1985 and 1990 .
If true , these actions would violate Saudi commitments under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty , which Saudi Arabia signed in 1988 to ease concern over their purchase of long - range Chinese ballistic missiles .
While the U.S. government vocally opposes the development or procurement of ballistic missiles by non-allies , it has been very quiet about the fact that Saudi Arabia possesses the longest - range ballistic missiles of any developing country .
In February / March 1988 , it was revealed that the Saudi regime had bought an estimated fifty CSS - 2 missiles from China .
The missiles can travel a distance of more than 1,500 miles and deliver a payload of over 4,000 lbs .
The Saudis have also been accused of retransferring U.S. military equipment or technology without U.S. approval in violation of obligations under the Arms Export Control Act .
The Saudis allegedly gave Iraq 1,500 U.S. 2,000 - pound bombs during the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq War ( Los Angeles Times , 14 September 1992 ) .
" Inadvertent " transfers of bombs and vehicles to Syria and Bangladesh during the Gulf War have also been reported ( Arms Control Today , May 1992 ) .
Another " inadvertent " transfer almost took place when an asylum - seeking Saudi F - 15 pilot flew his aircraft to Sudan in November 1990 .
The plane was returned ( Washington Post , 15 November 1990 ) .
Support for international terrorism
Mohammed Khilewi , who accused the Saudis of trying to buy access to a nuclear weapon , also says Saudi Arabia has supported terrorism , and has spied on Jewish - American groups and on U.S. military installations .
However , the State deparment has found no evidence of official Saudi support for terrorism .
In a June 1994 Congressional hearing , the State Department said :
Some Saudi citizens probably provide funds to HAMAS and other radical Palestinian groups throughout the region , as well as to extremist elements in Somalia , Sudan , and Yemen .
Private Saudi benefactors also sponsor paramilitary training for radial Islamists from many countries in Afghanistan , Yemen and Sudan .
The State Department has no evidence that the Government of Saudi Arabia sponsors these activities .
In its yearly report , Patterns of Global Terrorism 1996 , the State Department maintains this view and says that money from private Saudi citizens flows chiefly to two groups , HAMAS and HUA ( the Harakut ul - Ansar , a Pakistani group that operates in the Kashmir region ) .
Saudi financier Osama Bin Ladin is reportedly a major bank - roller of terrorists and is said to want to rid Saudi Arabia of American forces .
He is believed to be in Afghanistan under the protection of the fundamentalist Muslim Taleban militia .
Saudi Arabia revoked his citizenship in 1994 .

( CNN ) --
Two Pennsylvania teens will serve time in a county jail for participating in a brawl that left a Mexican immigrant dead last July .
Brandon Piekarsky and Derrick Donchak 's joint trial began in late April in Schuykill County , Pennsylvania .
Brandon Piekarsky , 17 , was sentenced to 6 to 23 months , and Derrick Donchak , 19 , received 7 to 23 months for their roles in the beating death of 25 - year - old Luis Ramirez .
Judge William Baldwin ordered the two to report to Schuylkill County jail on July 19 to begin serving their sentences .
An all - white jury convicted the two former high school football players of misdemeanor simple assault at trial last month and acquitted them of felony counts , including aggravated assault , ethnic intimidation and hindering apprehension -- charges that carried lengthier sentences .
In fashioning his sentence , Baldwin acknowledged the severity of the attack , which left Ramirez on life support for two days before he died , but said he could pass a sentence only in accordance with the jury 's verdict .
" This was n't any fight , this was a group of young athletes ganging up on one person .
That 's not a street fight , " Baldwin said , referring to the defense team 's characterization of the confrontation as a " street fight . "
" You picked out a guy who was n't one of you and beat the pulp out of him , " Baldwin said .
The incident divided the small , rural mining town of Shenandoah into camps for and against the boys as it became a flashpoint for racial tensions across the country .
After the verdict , Gov. Ed Rendell sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder recommending that the Department of Justice pursue civil rights charges .
" The evidence suggests that Mr. Ramirez was targeted , beaten and killed because he was Mexican , " Rendell said .
" Such lawlessness and violence hurts not only the victim of the attack but also our towns and communities that are torn apart by such bigotry and intolerance . "
During Wednesday 's sentencing , Baldwin said he was surprised that Rendell had chosen to speak out on the case and told the court that his sentence was not affected by the governor 's letter .
Fred Fanelli , Piekarsky 's lawyer , said he felt the sentence was harsh , given the circumstances .
The judge could have sentenced the teens to probation under Pennsylvania 's sentencing guidelines .
" I 'm disappointed that the court exceeded the aggravated range and sentenced him to six months .
Having said that , I 'm glad we finally have some finality with this case , " Fanelli told CNN affiliate WBRE after the sentencing .
Baldwin heard from several teachers , coaches and family friends who testified that the teens were good kids who fell into a bad situation .
They urged leniency so the teens could realize their potential as adults .
Ramirez 's longtime girlfriend and mother of two of his children read a statement in open court before an audience consisting mostly of the defendants ' supporters .
" He was my one and only love , and they took him away from me , and they took my children 's father , " Crystal Dillman said .
" Now I have to live without my best friend and love of my life . "
The court also heard a prepared statement from Ramirez 's mother , Elisa Zavala , who lives in Guanajuato , Mexico .
" I'm not the same person as before , now I feel a great emptiness within my heart , " she wrote .
" There are moments in which I 'm alone and I ask myself :
What do I do now that I do n't have my son ?
I feel that without him , I am no one . "
The judge also tacked on extra days to each boy 's sentence for consuming alcohol earlier in the evening .
For providing the alcohol to his friends before the fight , Donchak was also convicted of corrupting minors .
Jurors found Piekarsky not guilty of third - degree murder .
Prosecutors had said he delivered a fatal kick to Ramirez 's head after Ramirez was knocked to the ground in the alcohol - fueled brawl , which occurred on a residential street in Shenandoah the evening of July 12 .
Prosecutors alleged that a group of teens , which included Piekarsky and Donchak , baited Ramirez into the initial confrontation after a night of drinking , hurling racial epithets at the undocumented Mexican immigrant .
After the fight broke up , witnesses said Ramirez came back at the teens , who beat him so severely that , according to a medical testimony , brain tissue oozed out of his skull during surgery at a hospital .
Jurors heard from several teens who witnessed the incident but did not participate , as well as one teen who pleaded guilty in juvenile court and another whose case is being handled in federal court .
The testimony painted a picture of confusion , with several inconsistencies as to who did what .
Defense lawyers argued that Ramirez 's death was a street brawl gone wrong that was not motivated by racial bias .
They also suggested that Ramirez was responsible for triggering the second confrontation .
Advocacy groups condemned the verdict and sentences , and called on the Department of Justice to bring federal hate crime charges against the defendants .
" The meager sentences handed to the defendants today leaves justice gasping for further redress , " said Gladys Limon , staff attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund .
Citing FBI statistics , Limon said that hate crimes against Latinos have risen 40 percent in the last five years and called on Congress to strengthen hate crime laws .
" The failure to hold these defendants responsible for their atrocious crimes denies justice not just to the Ramirez family , but also to the entire community by failing to deter similar crimes in the future , " she said .
Richard Cohen , president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center , said the case had troubling implications in the wider context of race relations nationwide .
" Since the year 2000 , we 've seen a 50 percent surge in the number of hate groups across the country , to a record 926 by our latest count , " he said .
" The increase has been fueled by the same factor responsible for the rise in the anti-Latino hate crimes -- a backlash against the changing demographics of our country , a backlash fueled by politicians trolling for votes and pundits looking for ratings . "

America is not # 1 .
Well , not unless you count military spending and handgun related deaths .
We ’re shit at public education .
Our health care system is both the most expensive and the least effective in the developed world .
Literacy , infant mortality , per capita living below the poverty line and / or without any health insurance … etc. , etc .
We ’re kind of horrible at a whole lot of things , if you want to be honest about it .
We ’re also , on average , fat as fuck .
Throughout small town America today , one will see flags , fireworks , and junk food on display .
A common sentiment you 'll encounter is pride , and many find it necessary to express their pride in being Americans today .
I 'd like to make two small additions to this conversation , neither of which are original and one of which is presented in video form .
First , you are going to hear many people claiming that the United States is # 1 .
Those making this claim do not usually specify what they mean , so one is left assuming that they must mean we are the best in every way imaginable .
When you hear this claim , please consider the following from " 10 Things Every Adult Should Know " written by f*cking c*nts :
There is nothing wrong with being proud of what we are doing right , but it should n't mask our screw - ups so much that we become blind to them .
Second , consider the absurdity of being proud over something that one did not do and had no control over ( i.e. , being born in America ) .
But do n't take my word for it .
Instead , see what George Carlin had to say on the subject :
Have a good day , stay safe , and enjoy spending time with family and friends .
Take pride in what you have accomplished ( e.g. , managing to break free from religious delusion ) , but do n't get sucked into the mire of blind patriotism .
I 'll try to do the same .

Sharing an obscene sexual fantasy over e-mail is a federal crime that enjoys no protection under the First Amendment , a federal appeals court said Monday , in a decision that drew sharp dissent from one judge and potentially set the stage for a Supreme Court appeal .
In a 10 - 1 decision , the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to rehear the case of Dwight Whorley , a Virginia man whose criminal trial marked two firsts for the American justice system : the first conviction for possession of obscene Japanese manga , and the first for authoring pornographic fiction and sending it over e-mail .
" Whorley violated criminal statues regulating obscenity , " Judge Paul Niemeyer wrote for the majority , " and his convictions may not be forgiven because his conduct was prompted by his sexual fantasies . "
But in a lengthy dissent , Judge Roger Gregory urged the Supreme Court to take up the case and reverse it .
" I am hard - pressed to think of a better modern day example of government regulation of private thoughts than what we have before us in this case : convicting a man for the victimless crime of privately communicating his personal fantasies to other consenting adults , " Gregory wrote .
Whorley was convicted in 2006 and sentenced to 20 years in prison , in part for possessing genuine child pornography .
But the Justice Department — perhaps sensing a chance to smuggle bad law onto the back of an unsympathetic defendant — also charged Whorley for having unsavory manga under the recently - enacted Protect Act , which outlaws obscene cartoons depicting minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct .
More surprisingly , prosecutors charged him under an older statute outlawing the possession of " any obscene , lewd , lascivious or filthy book , pamphlet , picture , motion - picture film , paper , letter , writing , print or other matter of indecent character " as defined by a jury .
That violation was for writing out his sexual fantasies involving children , and e-mailing them to like - minded internet friends .
Though Whorely is apparently a pedophile , the law applies to any obscene content .
A three - judge panel voted ( .pdf ) 2 - 1 to uphold the manga and e-mail convictions last December , with Gregory dissenting ( .pdf ) .
The judge repeated and expanded on his dissent this week , when the full court rejected Whorley 's rehearing request .
Gregory , a President George W. Bush appointee , also argued that it was wrong to convict a man for manga art depicting children having sex .
Obscenity laws , he wrote , should not apply to " images of purely imagined children . "
But he was particularly alarmed over the e-mail convictions .
In 1969 , the Supreme Court ruled that Americans have the right to possess obscene material in the privacy of their own homes .
But trafficking in such goods through interstate commerce — which today includes the internet — is illegal under that ruling .
Gregory argued that the law has not kept up with technology and should be changed .
" This is a difficult case .
The e-mails were admittedly transmitted and received through channels of interstate commerce and were found by a jury to be obscene , " Gregory said .
He added that , " In today 's world , our e-mail inbox , just as much as our home , has become the place where we store the memorabilia of our thoughts and dreams . "
Following Whorley 's conviction , federal authorities convicted an Iowa man last month of possessing manga art depicting children having sex .
But unlike Whorley , the defendant did not also have any real , obscene pictures of nude children having sex .

HDTV : It s not just crisper images and richer sound
I read a story once about how to catch wild hogs .
You bait them with food and , once they get comfortable and show up to eat consistently , you build one side of a pen .
The hogs will stay away for a few days but the easy groceries will bring them back again .
Then you build the second side of the pen .
If you keep that up until the pen is built and the hogs enter through the open gate to eat , all you have to do then is close the gate .

The television broadcast industry was scheduled to change over from analog to digital Feb. 17 , 2009 .
The switch has been delayed indefinitely for reasons that vary depending upon the source and interpretation of source information .
Regardless , we have seen the marketplace expansion of interest in " High Definition ( HD ) TV " and consumers  appreciation for the new generation of television technology increase dramatically in recent years .
To the majority of the TV watching public , the switch to HDTV is just another step in the process of replacing outdated analog systems with digital technology that offers greater image and sound reproduction compatible with modern electronic digital media players .
But better sound and a clearer picture is just the beginning .
The evidence shows that HD technology can also be used to remotely gain complete control over the thoughts , emotions and actions of people who will have no power to resist .
The power that could potentially be wielded by those capable of remotely controlling peoples thoughts and actions is virtually limitless .
An " experiment " of what can happen when large numbers of humans are subjected to remote control was successful in 1990 and witnessed by the whole world when Iraqi troops began surrendering to coalition forces .
Newsweek magazine reported July 30 , 1990 , that the U.S. military successfully deployed " Silent Sounds " through the FM frequency radio band used by the Iraqi army after Saddams military communications system had been destroyed by coalition forces .
" According to statements made by captured and deserting Iraqi soldiers . the most devastating and demoralizing programming was the first known military use of the new , high - tech type of subliminal messages referred to as ultra - high - frequency silent sounds  or silent subliminals ,  " Newsweek reported .
Once system - wide conversion to HDTV is made , the silent sounds that neutralized the Iraqi army can be planted into the minds of Americans enjoying the crisper images and richer sounds of digitized TV .
Through HDTV , " Big Brother " will be able to order troops to invade the homes of America and begin seizing weapons , food , valuables and maybe even children while our people are absolutely paralyzed for no apparent reason and can do nothing to defend themselves , their families and their homes .
Dr. Delgado
The desire to remotely control animals and people goes back as far as the desire to remotely control machines and for the same reasons .
The New York Times reported May 17 , 1965 , that Dr. Jose Delgado of the Yale University School of Medicine had remotely taken control of a fighting bull with silent sounds during an experiment conducted the previous year in Cordoba , Spain .
" Afternoon sunlight poured over the high wooden barriers into the [ bullfighting ] ring , as the brave bull bore down on the unarmed matador , a scientist who had never faced a fighting bull .
But the charging animals horn never reached the man behind the heavy red cape .
Moments before that could happen , Dr. Delgado pressed a button on a small radio transmitter in his hand and the bull braked to a halt .
Then he pressed another button on the transmitter , and the bull obediently turned to the right and trotted away .
The bull was obeying commands in his brain that were being called forth by electrical stimulation by the radio signals to certain regions in which fine wires had been painlessly planted the day before , " wrote John A. Osmundsen of The New York Times .
According to Dr. Delgado , experiments of this type had also been performed on humans .
While giving a lecture on the Brain in 1965 , Dr. Delgado said , " Science has developed a new methodology for the study and control of cerebral function in animals and humans . "
In a telling comment to Congress published in the Congressional Record ( No. 26 , Vol. 118 , February 24 , 1974 ) , Dr. Delgado , representing the Yale University Medical School , expressed why he felt the development of techniques for remotely controlling animals and humans was so important :
" The individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence , but this is only his personal point of view .
This lacks historical perspective .
Man does not have the right to develop his own mind .
This kind of liberal orientation has great appeal .
We must electronically control the brain .
Someday armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain . " [ emphasis added ]
In another experiment , Dr. Delgado was able to compel a cat to lick its fur , and then continue compulsively licking the floor and bars of its cage .
In yet another experiment , Dr. Delgado delivered a signal designed to stimulate a portion of a monkeys thalamus , a major midbrain center for integrating muscle movements and was able to trigger a complex reaction :
The monkey walked to one side of the cage , then the other , then climbed to the rear ceiling , then back down .
The animal performed this same activity as many times as it was stimulated with the signal , up to 60 times an hour .
But the monkeys actions were not performed blindly the creature was still able to avoid obstacles and threats from the dominant male while carrying out the electrical imperative .
Another type of signal has made monkeys turn their heads , or smile , no matter what else they were doing , up to 20,000 times in two weeks .
As Delgado concluded , " The animals looked like electronic toys . "
Beyond Dr. Delgado
Since Dr. Delgados comparatively crude experiments over 30 and 40 years ago , a complete record of the advances being made in the field of remotely controlling other living beings has been published in the scientific literature and in the U.S. Patent Office .
US PATENT # 4,858,612 , issued to Philip Stocklin Dec. 19 , 1983 , is " For direct transmission of sound into the human auditory cortex [ a section of the brain ] . "
The abstract basically explains that ears are no longer necessary because words can be implanted directly into your brain .
This is called " synthetic telepathy . "
US Patent # 5,159,703 which describes the " Silent Sound Spread Spectrum ( SSSS ) , " was developed for military use by Dr. Oliver Lowery of Norcross , Georgia and granted on Oct. 27 , 1992 .
SSSS , or " S - Quad , " is described in the abstract as , " A silent communications system in which nonaural carriers , in the very low ( ELF ) or very high audio - frequency ( VHF ) range or in the adjacent ultrasonic frequency spectrum , are amplitudeor frequency modulated with the desired intelligence and propagated acoustically or vibrationally , for inducement into the brain , typically through the use of loudspeakers , earphones , or piezoelectric transducers .
The modulated carriers may be transmitted directly in real time or may be conveniently recorded and stored on mechanical , magnetic , or optical media for delayed or repeated transmission to the listener . "
In laymans terms , this device , this " Sound of Silence " simply allows for the unwarranted implantation of specific thoughts , emotions and even prescribed physical actions into unsuspecting human beings .
Why the switch ?
It has recently been decided on a global scale to eliminate the standard analog television broadcasts and convert to digital only .
Why ?
If SSSS was being broadcast through traditional televisions via the analog system , it would show up as static on our stations and , therefore , be detectable .
Once SSSS is delivered digitally through HDTV , no one will notice .
Wireless digital technology is the cheapest , most effective way to transmit electromagnetic frequencies to your brain because there is significantly less infrastructure to maintain and much of it has already been built to meet ever - growing consumer demand for wireless communications and entertainment .
People who convert to HDTV and get their fair share of digitally - enhanced " programming , " will be most vulnerable to SSSS suggestion .
However , throwing away your TV or declining to convert will not fully protect you from the silent sounds because their signals will be ambient in the air and our brain receptors will serve as antenna .
Further indications that HDTV will be used for ill
Even instincts and emotions can be changed .
In another study by Dr. Delgado , a mother giving continuous care to her baby suddenly pushed the infant away whenever the signal was given .
Dr. Ross
Adey determined that merely placing a subject in an electromagnetic field could remotely influence emotional states and behavior .
Adey and others have compiled an entire library of frequencies and pulsation rates which can affect the mind and nervous system Dr. Eldon Byrd .
From 1980 to 1983 , Dr. Eldon Byrd ran the Marine Corps Nonlethal Electromagnetic Weapons project .
He conducted most of his research at the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute in Bethesda , Md. During this time , Dr. Byrd stated , " We were looking at electrical activity in the brain and how to influence it " By using very low frequency electromagnetic radiation the waves way below radio frequencies on the electromagnetic spectrum Dr. Byrd found he could induce the brain to release behavior - regulating chemicals .
" We could put animals into a stupor " by hitting them with these very low frequencies .
" We got chick brains in vitroto dump 80 percent of the natural opioids in their brains , " Dr. Byrd said .
Dr. Byrd reported that he even ran a small project using magnetic fields to cause certain brain cells in rats to release histamine .
In humans , this would cause instant flulike symptoms and produce nausea .
" These fields were extremely weak .
They were undetectable .
The effects were nonlethal and reversible .
You could disable a person temporarily .
It [ would have been ] like a stun gun , " Dr. Byrd noted .
Dr. Stephen Aftergood .
Director of the Project on Government Secrecy , Dr. Stephen Aftergood with the Federation of American Scientists said during a CNN interview with David Mattingly on the American Edge Show on June 18 , 1997 , " The idea that electro - magnetic energy can be used against people and not just against other weapons or electronic systems , is current ; it is understood that this is an option and it makes the surprising claim that a psychophysical effect on people is possible for the purpose of altering their behavior , and even controlling the social aims of regional or even global societies .
The fact is that today the United States is spending as much money on developing psychophysical weapons as on the most complex space programs . "
Artificial recreation of natural phenomena
Studies conducted around the world have , for decades , been documenting otherwise unexplainably elevated rates of suicides and cancers in geographical areas .
These areas have been found to be naturally enveloped in electromagnetic fields emitting frequencies detrimental to human health and well - being .
The phenomena , commonly referred to as " geopathic stress , " has been understood in scientific circles since ancient times .
The effects of biologically - detrimental electromagnetic fields naturally emanating from the ground are associated with people experiencing chronic fatigue , headaches and migraines , depression , insomnia , anxiety or anger .
We now live in a time where the artificial creation and amplification of the naturally - occurring phenomena of biologically - compromising energy fields has been weaponized .
Weaponized
Dr. Robert J. Bunker of California State University at San Bernardino is an " unconventional war " expert and the editor of the " INSS Occasional Paper , " 15 USAF Institute for National Security Studies , USAF Academy , Colorado .
In his article , " Electromagnetic , High Power Microwave [ HPM ] Weapons , " Dr. Bunker wrote that HPMs can also cause human unconsciousness without permanent maiming by upsetting the neural pathways in the brain or they can be made lethal .
Evidence that testing of silent sounds is ongoing was noted in an Associated Press article published shortly after Gulf War II began .
SOUTHERN IRAQ Saturday , March 22 , 2003
Associated PressU.S. and British forces streamed in a long line of tanks and armored vehicles toward Basra , Iraqs second largest city , on Saturday , a day after they collected underfed and overwhelmed Iraqi soldiers who surrendered in droves .
An entire Iraqi division , the 51st Infantry , gave up to U.S. troops Friday , military officials said .
A key unit for Basras defense with 8,000 men and up to 200 tanks , it was the largest defection in a day when Saddam Husseins forces showed signs of crumbling .
Saturday morning , American Marines and British troops rumbled along the main road from the Kuwaiti border to Basra , Highway 80  nicknamed the " Highway of Death " during the 1991 Gulf War when U.S. airstrikes wiped out an Iraqi military convoy along it .
At the Kuwait border , hundreds of tanks , armored personnel carriers , Humvees and trucks were lined up Saturday in a desert muddied by overnight rain , waiting in columns to pass into Iraq .
It resembled a great train yard in the desert -- some lines 70 vehicles long , others 50 long .
In the wake of the allied force , Iraqi captives were left packed into improvised pens of concertina wire , watched over by Marines .
Partly disassembled rifles taken from the surrendering soldiers were piled beside the road .
[ emphasis added ]
The implication here is that the Iraqi soldiers had , themselves , partially disassembled their weapons before surrendering them .
Since there is no known incident in the history of war where soldiers had attempted to render their weapons inoperable before surrendering them , one can assume that these soldiers responded to a silent order to do so .

Honduran Women 's Manifesto of Rebellion
In the rebel Garífuna territory of Vallecito , Iriona , Colón , Honduras , surrounded by elements of nature that nourish life and hope , 1,200 women and approximately 350 children gathered and embraced each other with life and words , arriving from Choluteca , El Paraíso , Copan , Olancho , Valle , Francisco Morazán , Gracias a Dios , Colón , Yoro , Cortes , Atlántida , Intibucá , Lempira , La Paz , Comayagua , and Santa Bárbara .
We felt ancestors Margarita Murillo , María Enriqueta Matute , Berta Cáceres , Magdalena Morales and aunt Macucu with us in all of our actions as spirit , as thought and as strength .
We felt the energies of our peoples , of the Tolupán , Lenca , Misquito , Garífuna , Pech , Maya Chortí and all other peoples in struggle , coming together after ten years of the coup d’état and the resistance of the Honduran people , of the women of Honduras .
The gathering salutes the strength and rebelliousness of women , those present , those who could not come , and those who are no longer physically with us .
Despite the wounds and pains from violence and oppression visited upon our bodies , territories and organizing processes , we have enormous conviction and dedication to continue thinking , creating and acting together .
The strength of the worldview of indigenous peoples was present and manifested through spirituality , wisdom , experiences of resistance and forms of relating to nature and life .
Through debate and conversations during meals , breaks , and work , we assembled these words , which we now share .
The coup d'état transformed into a dictatorship and continues to deepen the extractive model that threatens the livelihood of women and indigenous peoples .
This is a regime that plunders the common good , identities , bodies , wisdom , spirituality ; that is sustained by corruption , impunity , drug trafficking , militarization , persecution , criminalization of our sisters who struggle throughout the territories of Honduras .
We are living through an humanitarian crisis produced by that plunder , which cruelly and clearly creates the migrant exodus by our sisters and brothers , an exodus which empties our territories , with disastrous results for our people and the community social fabric , benefiting the extractive projects that have less and less opposition to confront .
We call upon all of us to respond to the urgent necessity of reclaiming and multiplying autonomous practices and envisioning sovereign alternatives that are anti-patriarchal , anti-racist , inclusive and diverse , due to the evident failure of masculine exercise of power based on the colonial electoral democratic model , which threatens women and indigenous peoples .
The increasing normalization violence against the bodies of women worries us .
Our bodies become a territory for the expression of machista and hetero - patriarchal culture and frustration , often perpetrated by men from the social movements and exacerbated by the increase in militarization and religious fundamentalism .
The role of women in the struggle has been at once set back and strengthened , with better political clarity , wisdom , ability to mobilize and inspire in diverse struggles where we have been putting forth our thought , voice , bodies and action .
No violence will hold us back .
From this gathering , we commit ourselves to continue coming together in collective rebellion , to embody each other ’s struggles and to envision a Honduras without dictatorship , with autonomy and sovereignty for the people , for women .
After 10 years of the coup , we continue to struggle together .
For a Honduras without dictatorship .
WHO PAYS ?
Current estimates suggest that it would cost in the neighborhood of $ 1 trillion over 10 years to extend coverage to tens of millions of uninsured Americans .
Under current plans , half or more of that would be covered by reducing payments to providers within the giant Medicare program , but the rest would require new taxes or revenue sources .
If President Obama and House Democratic leaders have their way , the entire tax burden would be dropped on families earning more than $ 250,000 or $ 350,000 or $ 1 million a year , depending on who ’s talking .
There is strong opposition in the Senate , and it seems likely that at least some burden would fall on the less wealthy .
Many Americans reflexively reject the idea of any new taxes  especially to pay for others ’ health insurance .
They should remember that if this reform effort fails , there is little hope of reining in the relentless rise of health care costs .
That means their own premiums and out - of - pocket medical expenses will continue to soar faster than their wages .
And they will end up paying higher taxes anyway , to cover a swelling federal deficit driven by escalating Medicare and Medicaid costs .
WHO WON ’T BE HAPPY ?
Healthy young people who might prefer not to buy insurance at all will probably be forced to by a federal mandate .
That is all to the good .
When such people get into a bad accident or contract a serious illness , they often ca n’t pay the cost of their care , and the rest of us bear their burden .
Moreover , conscripting healthy people into the insured pool would help reduce the premiums for sicker people .
Less clear is what financial burden middle - income Americans would bear when forced to buy coverage .
There are concerns that the subsidies ultimately approved by Congress might not be generous enough .
WHAT IF I HAVE GOOD GROUP COVERAGE ?
The main gain for these people is greater security .
If they got laid off or chose to leave their jobs , they would no longer be faced with the exorbitant costs of individually bought insurance but could buy new policies through the insurance exchanges at affordable rates .
President Obama has also pledged that if you like your current insurance you can keep it .
Right now employers are free to change or even drop your coverage at any time .
Under likely reforms , they would remain free to do so , provided they paid a penalty to help offset the cost for their workers who would then buy coverage through an exchange .
Under the House reform bill , all employers would eventually be allowed to enroll their workers in insurance exchanges that would offer an array of policies to choose from , including a public plan whose premiums would almost certainly be lower than those of competing private plans .

Archbishop Hector Aguer of La Plata has denounced the government for imposing new materials on Argentinean schools that are based on controversial ideologies instead of the comprehensive formation of students .
In his television program , “ Keys to a Better World , ” the archbishop explained that the State is imposing a particular ideology that is evident in the materials being distributed to teachers and in some “ policies of the State ” that are being established the Ministries of Health and Education .
“ The new material , ‘ Building the Citizenry , ’ imposes a critical theory that is intended to make the child or the student into a miniature critical theorist in order to change society , thus altering the order that is supposed to exist in the transmission of knowledge .
Basic subjects are neglected and instead this critical perspective that is markedly ideological is emphasized , ” the archbishop said .
“ The source of inspiration is the neo -Marxism of the Frankfurt School .
Do we want illiterate revolutionaries to come out of Argentinean schools ? ” he asked .
After denouncing the implementation of gender ideology for sexual education in schools , the archbishop explained that “ according to this perspective , sexuality does not belong to the nature of the person , it is not a biological , psychological , affective and spiritual reality , but rather an historical and socio-cultural construct .
One is a man or a woman not because one was born such , but because one was made such by the culture , which molds the gender of persons .
“ A spilt between sex and gender is being proposed , such that one can speak of diverse sexual options , all equally valid , ” Archbishop Aguer criticized .
He also went on to address the lack of appreciation for motherhood .
“ It ’s curious how , in the name of promoting women , the feminine figure is denigrated ; above all , her maternal vocation is not accepted , because maternity is seen as a burden , since sexuality is totally separated from marriage ... What kind of education can be founded upon these principles ? ” the archbishop asked .

" Seinfeld " creator Larry David says he wrote a reunion into the upcoming season of " Curb Your Enthusiasm " for the cast of the memorable sitcom .
David told the reporters at the TCA Press Tour in Pasadena , " I called Jerry , and Jerry was game . "
He says he worked closely with Seinfeld on the " show - within - a - show " script and that the cast will appear in five " Curb " episodes in a storyline about the cast reuniting .
" You 're not going to see the whole show but then you 'll going to see the cast as themselves in a ' Curb ' episode with ' Curb ' stories , so it 's this strange kind of blending of the two shows , " David tells " Extra . "
He adds , " You get two for one . "
Jerry Seinfeld , Julia Louis - Dreyfus , Jason Alexander and Michael Richards have n't appeared together on screen since the " Seinfeld " series finale in 1998 .
" Curb Your Enthusiasm " returns to HBO on Sept. 20 .

Article Index The Computer - What 's The Big Idea ?
Babbage
The big idea Page 1 of 3
In this article we take a look at what a computer is .
What it means to be a universal computer and the principle of computational equivalence which basically claims that computers and universal computers at that , are everywhere .
What exactly is a computer ?
What makes it different from all of the other machines that we use today and have used in the past ?
A computer clearly is unique and nearly always easy to spot because it is a machine that does no useful work !
This may seem like a cruel joke thought up by someone who knows computers all too well , but it is 100 % true .
In physics work is only done when a force moves its point of application through a distance and so steam engines and motor cars do useful work but a computer just gets warm .
Yes , all those power stations work day and night polluting the atmosphere just to keep your machine warm .
More seriously the fact that computers get warm is just a sign that we have n’t quite got it right even now .
In theory there is absolutely no reason why a computer should get hot at all - but that ’s another story to do with reversable processes and quantum computing .
So a computer is a machine that does no useful work .
True but this really only narrows it down .
After all a TV and a simple telephone satisfy the same condition and so do most electronic devices .
Clearly a computer is a bit more than either of these two devices so what is the essence that makes it so different ?
To answer that question we have to go back in time but not as far as you might think …
Boole - the man who invented logic
Is a computer a calculator ?
Long before a recognisable computer was produced there were calculators - mechanical devices , usually based on cogs and gears , that performed the four basic operations of arithmetic .
The calculator is still an essential machine that in a strange irony is to be found today as a desktop accessory on most computers .
That is the once ubiquitous calculating machine is now nothing more than a simulation inside our computers .
The fact that our computers create a virtual calculator should give you the clue that the two are not really the same type of machine .
But do n't write the calculator off too quickly .
There were even calculators that worked with non-numeric problems .
After Boole invented symbolic logic in 1854 William Stanley Jevons was inspired to build “ The Logical Piano ” - no , seriously a logical piano .
This was a collection of cogs and gears that did n’t crunch numbers but rather worked with Boolean logic .
You entered an expression with And , Or and Not and it told you if the whole thing was true or false .
Later machines were built that could solve much more complex problems of the sort found in puzzle books but even these impressive machines are not computers .
The Jevons ’ Logical Piano The Loom ?
If logical pianos are not kin to the computer what about some sort of industrial machinery .
It is often said that a forerunner of the computer was the Jacquard Loom because it used punched cards to control the patterns it wove into the cloth .
This is mostly nonsense - although it clearly influenced the early thinkers about computers and was used by them as a more concrete example of what they were trying to explain to an otherwise uncomprehending public .
It is difficult to explain what a computer is when you do n’t have one to point at .
The Jacquard loom was said to be “ programmable ” in the same way as a computer because you could alter the punching of the cards to get different patterns .
It could even claim to be the first device to invent the program loop because by sticking the front of the first card to the end of the last card the machine could run without break .
However , far from being a computer the Jacquard loom is just an example of an advanced automaton and is only one of several machines that followed set patterns of behaviour controlled by slotted metal sheets , metal rods or oddly shaped wheels .
Its only claim to fame is that the control mechanism was easily altered because , instead of metal , it used thick cardboard .

Here ’s an idea that comes from outside the green business world , but has much to offer us and I think should be repeated all over .
In London , KiosKiosk is a simple , powerful , powerfully fun idea : Create an attractive temporary space for upcoming ( but ready to sell ) businesses to be at , in a high traffic area .
At no cost .
Backed by the London Sustainable Development Commission , businesses just need to submit a brief form describing what they ’d like to use the kiosk for , when , and why they are a good idea for the KiosKiosk and vice versa .
While the KiosKiosk is focused on creative / design / arts / music businesses , such an idea could , and should be replicated for green startups , many of which , like any small company , may not have the funds or credit history to get a full fledged , full time space .
Since there is no rent to pay , this could also be used by companies to create , say , memorable experiences and activities out of the space , of lasting promotional value and social media worthy mentions , growing their online business , for example .
[ social_buttons ]
More than just a booth space , the site ’s website gives both the public and other participants a glimpse in to who and what ’s going to be there each day , with an extensive profile .
This would provide value beyond the actual day (s ) the business is there , giving consumers and potential investors a chance to learn about them at their leisure .
Giving further depth and value to the space , special events and workshops will peppered throughout the 3 month run of KiosKiosk .
It ’s “ inside the box ” thinking like this that will help boost business vitality and encourage more to give entrepreneurship in these challenging times .
Readers :
What other inventive , supportive ways are you seeing business , green or otherwise being being supported ?
Do you live in a community with space ripe for this ?
Will you try doing it ?

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Violent crime in the United States fell 2.5 percent last year as cities and towns across the country reported fewer murders , rapes and other incidents for a second straight year , the FBI said on Monday .
The FBI ’s preliminary statistics could ease concerns that gangs , youth violence , more gun crimes and fewer police could lead to a long - term rise in crime .
In 2008 , the number of murders fell by 4.4 percent , aggravated assaults by 3.2 percent , rapes by 2.2 percent and robberies by 1.1 percent .
Property crimes like auto theft were down 1.6 percent from 2007 levels as they continued to fall from their 2003 high , according to the FBI data .
Auto thefts fell 13.1 percent and thefts fell 0.6 percent but burglaries rose 1.3 percent .
Arsons fell 3.9 percent .
Crime was down in all areas of the United States except the Northeast , where property crimes rose 1.6 percent .
Small towns with fewer than 10,000 residents were the exception as they posted a rise in all violent crime categories .
Murders were up 5.5 percent in these areas .
Violent crimes fell from 1991 to 2005 due to what experts described as better enforcement , economic prosperity and declines in high - risk populations of young adults .
The number of reported crimes rose in 2005 and 2006 .

On Monday ( July 20th ) , Kim Jong
Un visited the construction site for the Pyongyang General Hospital and unleashed some rather scathing criticism against the management of the project .
An excerpt from KCNA :
Noting that it is making a serious digression from the Party ’s policy in supplying equipment and materials to go against the intention of the Party which initiated the construction for the people and mapped out its operation , he severely rebuked it for burdening the people by encouraging all kinds of “ assistance ” .
Saying that the construction coordination commission failed to solve all the problems in conformity with the Party ’s policy line , he said in the strong terms that if such situation is left to go on , the noble plan and intention of the Party which initiated the glorious and worthwhile construction for the good of the people could be distorted and the image of the Party be tarnished .
He instructed the relevant departments of the Party Central Committee to investigate the performance of the construction coordination commission as a whole and replace all the officials responsible and make strict referral of them .
Pointing out that though the construction work of the hospital was being pushed ahead thanks to the patriotic zeal and devoted efforts of the builders [… ] .
( Source : “ Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un Gives Field Guidance to Pyongyang General Hospital under Construction , ” Korean Central News Agency , July 20th , 2020 . )
The Pyongyang General Hospital project was destined for hurdles from the very beginning , as this article explores .
Kim has personally emphasized how central it is to finish hospital construction by the deadline of October 10th this year , when the Korean Worker ’s Party will celebrate its 75th anniversary .
With such time pressure for construction , worksite conditions were always going to be problematic .
The politically motivated deadline , moreover , increases the risk of shoddy construction work .
Rather than serve the general public at large , the hospital , whenever finished , is likelier to cater to the sociopolitical elite who can pay their way and , perhaps , to medical tourism .
Kim ’s criticism against construction officials , however , is about much more than the hospital construction project itself .
It relates to the very structure of the North Korean system , and of communist economies in general .
This sort of criticism really is a standard performance in a decades - old genre , where the supreme leader shows himself to be on the side of the people by pinning the blame for any problems and suffering among the population on lower - ranking officials .
Kim ’s public criticism of the construction management officials is , in other words , not exceptional , but a standard mechanism and a feature of North Korea ’s economic system .
Much in North Korean governance may be subject to dynamic change , but the one constant is that the leader can hardly ever be at fault . *
To hold this constant , someone else must be blamed when economic plans do n’t go the way they should .
Never mind that the leader often rules by directives that are often vague and given in off - the - cuff - statements , left to subordinates to interpret and implement as best as they can .
Problems like this are almost inevitable in an economy like North Korea ’s , still in structure very much a command economy despite significant relaxations over the past few decades .
Thus , when the Soviet Union ’s industrialization plan did n’t proceed as intended , it had to be the fault of wreckers working for foreign powers .
Stalin himself could never be at fault .
In the same way , it cannot , by definition , be Kim ’s fault that people are overburdened with requests for “ assistance ” to help build the hospital .
Lower - level bureaucrats have to be the ones to blame , for overburdening the people , because the leader can never be associated with direct pain and suffering in people ’s daily lives .
In fact , such “ assistance ” – often termed “ voluntary ” – is a mainstay of the North Korean economic system and pretty much has been ever since the beginning .
Kim surely cannot have missed the pictures and news reports in his own state media about “ active support ” from “ the people ” , and different localities sending construction materials .
This sort of “ voluntary labor ” to gather materials for state projects or work on construction sites is of course not voluntary at all , as staying away would be punishable .
It is a facet of everyday life in North Korea that does n’t get nearly the attention it deserves , as it often takes up a substantial number of hours .
It is also not a new phenomena .
The North Korean state has always demanded such “ voluntary ” contributions from the people to make up for materials and labor that the state cannot produce .
Naturally , officials will use whatever means required to make their deliveries , even if these means are forcible .
This applies to financial assets as well .
The wealthier the trading middle class grows , the more the state will subject them to loyalty payments and the like .
In North Korea ’s current situation , what choice does Kim really have but to blame lower officials for failures , and admonish them to do better ?
The Pyongyang General Hospital is not the only grandiose , heavily publicized project that is doing poorly .
The Wonsan - Kalma resort has also been plagued by shortages and delays .
The government needs these projects not least for propaganda value , to show to the country that although difficulties abound , all is not hopeless , the economy is still making progress , and people ’s living standards will improve .
So when none of the projects carrying this message are working out , the government has a problem .
In normal times , the state could have dismantled more economic regulations to make it easier for people to conduct trade and private economic activity .
Indeed , though it is difficult to quantify , the state giving room for market mechanisms has been the most important factor for the significant improvements in the North Korean economy over the past few years .
Right now , this is difficult to do , because the state needs to extract more resources , not fewer .
Over the past few years , the state has grown increasingly short of foreign currency and other assets , first because of sanctions , and later because of the Covid - 19 border shutdown ( which has partially ended ) .
As a result , we ’ve seen the state cracking down more and more on private business and market actors , to bring in resources as other avenues dry up .
The more difficult things get for the North Korean economy , the more demands increase for “ loyalty payments ” from private citizens , to fund the mega - projects that Kim has staked so much credibility on .
We can expect to see more officials lose their jobs in the future in the same manner as those who got axed after Kim ’s hospital construction field guidance .
* Such self - criticism does of course happen , but its rarity is attested to by the fact that it ( rightfully ) makes news headlines .
One recent example is Kim Jong Un ’s 2017 New Year ’s Address .
Honda ’s EVO6 concept was the star of the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show .
Then we all forgot about it .
Now the Spanish website SoloMoto is claiming that Honda will soon unveil a production version .
It wo n’t be at EICMA in November , because Honda ( and Yamaha ) will be absent this year .
But a new big Honda might just be in the pipeline :
The EVO6 engine was the Gold Wing ’s 1832 cc flat six , and production of the Gold Wing is moving from Ohio to Japan .
So it could be the time for Honda to take a big leap forward .
If the new ‘ supernaked ’ stays close to the original EVO6 concept , we ’ll be overjoyed .
We just hope it ’s not an auto - only model : the exhibition model was missing a clutch lever and shifter .

Egyptian Security Refuses to Return Abducted Christian Coptic Girl
( AINA ) --
Two incidents of abduction of Coptic girls to force them to convert to Islam took place within one week in Upper Egypt .
In both cases the Egyptian security predictably played a key role in the outcome of the cases .
Rania Asaad was returned to her family , while Irene Labib is still missing , in spite of pleas from human rights organizations to the security authorities to end this Coptic family 's misfortune .
In view of the security authorities ' complete neglect in the handling of Irene 's case , and false government media reports that Irene was returned to her family , a spokesman for the Coptic Church 's Sohag Diocese issued a statement on 7/16/09 calling for the immediate return of the abducted girl .
Irene Hanna Labib , 20 - years old , disappeared on 7/1/2009 from Sahel Tahta , Sohag Governorate , 500 km south of Cairo .
After carrying out their own investigations , the well to do Labib family discovered that Irene was abducted by Muslim Hisham Saad Mohamed , who works as a waiter in the IT institute where she studies .
" Her brother Girgis Labib went and met with the abductor Hisham , who confessed to Irene being in his possession , " said Reverend Sawires Rady pastor of St. Shenouda Church , Sahel Tahta in Sohag .
" The Labib family filed a report with the police and accused Hisham Mohamaed of abducting their daughter .
The police detained Hisham and Irene 's brother Girgis , who was subsequently released after taking a pledge not to harass Hisham . "
Hisham was released three days later after promising security to bring back Irene at 8 pm of the same day , but he has subsequently disappeared .
Reverend Sawires said " the abductor never kept his promise and I now ask security to bring back the abducted girl as they know her whereabouts . "
Mamdouh Nakhla , head of Al Kalema Human Right Organisation told Copts United " Security must disclose the whereabouts of the girl kidnapped by the Muslim man , as they know her whereabouts from the confessions of the abductor who pledged to bring her back on the same day . "
Nakhla holds security responsible for bringing the girl back to her family safe and unharmed .
Also the Bareek Center for Anti-Violence Against Women Advocacycriticized the role of security .
Until her return , the Labib family is keeping quiet about the circumstances of their daughter 's disappearance .
The family of 21 - year old pharmacy student Rania Tawfik Asaad from Samalut , Minya Governorate , were successful in getting back their daughter , one week she disappeared on 6/27/2009 ; she was held by her abductor in the small village Of Taha Bosh , Nasser district , in the Beni Suef Governorate .
Rania was approached by Muslim army officer Mohamed Sayed Farag , 29 years old , who posed as a Copt called Mina who was living in Cairo .
After a brief courtship , the army officer proposed to her and asked her to meet his elderly mother .
According to Ayman Eid of Free Copts advocacy Rania knew the true identity of her abductor only when she arrived at a secluded house in Beni Suef .
Mohamed was also discovered to be a member of the Islamic Welfare Association , which is affiliated to the Muslim Brotherhood .
He asked Rania to convert to Islam and marry him , but she refused .
After a great ordeal her family discovered her whereabouts and learnt that she was forced to convert to Islam by the Association and married Captain Mohamed two days after her abduction .
Her father reported the incident to security and accused the army officer of abducting his daughter .
According to an eyewitness who asked to remain anonymous , the State Security had made a deal with Rania 's father to bring her back on condition of dropping all changes against the army officer , as he would be subjected to trial by the armed forces and due to the negative publicity to the reputation of the Defence Ministry , in return for his daughter 's safe return .
The issue of abduction of Coptic girls forms one of the most explosive problems in the relations between Christians and Muslims of Egypt -- especially as abductions are carried out in cooperation between Arab - funded legitimate associations and the State Security .
In the opinion of Magdy Khalil , political analyst and researcher that abduction of Coptic girls is an organized crime .
" Abducting and converting Coptic girls to Islam is not only a result of the paranoid and racist incitation against the Copts , it is an organized and pre-planned process by associations and organizations inside Egypt with domestic and Arab funding , as the main role in seducing and luring Coptic girls is carried through cunning , deceit , and enticement , or through force if required , " he said .
Khalil tells of incidents of abduction he witnessed when the Grand Imam of Al - Azhar and Pope Shenouda intervened , and where the abducted girls were returned to their families within 24 hours .
" What can we call this ?
And what about the poor ones whose voice could not be heard , or have no connections ? " he said .
Activist Medhat Kelada , PR for Copts United advocacy believes that the Islamization business represents a permanent source of livelihood for security officials , " Especially with the flow of funds from the rich and extremist Wahhabis who try to Islamize the Egyptian Copts with the help of some of the security service officers " , he said .
The Egyptian Al Fagr ( the Dawn ) independent newspaper was the first to report on the lucrative business of the ' brokers ' of Islamization of Christians , in its May 19th 2008 issue , taking the city of Alexandria as an example .
Al Fagr reporter Tamer Salah - el - Din highlighted how the operation which is funded by Muslim businessmen is carried out with the collusion of State Security and Mosque sheikhs .
The ' trading rates ' cashed by brokers for each Christian male and female conversion to Islam , at the time of writing his report , was 7000 Egyptian pounds for the male and 6000 for the female .
The rates for Coptic girls fluctuate depending on how good - looking she is and her family 's social status .
Coptic Pope Shenouda III openly protested on December 17th , 1976 about this problem and in spite of the multiplicity of incidents , not one single person accused of abduction of Coptic girls was brought to justice .
" Amid the government 's inaction and its collusion , awakening the international conscience may be the more effective means in exposing the perpetrators and those who support them . " says Khalil .

Here is an interesting short discussion on reusing mall space from Rob Walker in the NY Times Magazine : Repurpose - Driven Life
Talk of American infrastructure tends to focus on inadequacies : roads that need to be repaired or widened , bridges fortified , electrical grids updated .
All the more striking , then , that America ’s retail infrastructure — its malls , supercenters , big boxes and other styles of store - clumping — has come to be characterized by rampant abundance .
This has been a decades - long trend .
But it has taken the economic downturn , with chain stores liquidating , mall tenancy slipping and car dealerships scheduled for closure , to focus popular attention on the problem with our retail infrastructure : there is too much of it .
A recent book , “ Retrofitting Suburbia , ” by Ellen Dunham - Jones and June Williamson , notes that in 1986 , the United States had about 15 square feet of retail space per person in shopping centers .
That was already a world - leading figure , but by 2003 it had increased by a third , to 20 square feet .
The next countries on the list are Canada ( 13 square feet per person ) and Australia ( 6.5 square feet ) ; the highest figure in Europe is in Sweden , with 3 square feet per person .
From Italian cartoonist Giovanni Fontana ( used with permission ) .
Here is his website , the vignettist 's corner
Click on cartoon for larger image in new window .
And that was in 2003 - before the most recent mall building boom began ( see graph at bottom ) .
Of course the housing bubble in the U.S. was much large than the mall bubble .
In 2005 , investment in single - family structures hit a peak of $ 481 billion ( all residential investment including multi-family and home improvement was $ 761 billion in 2005 . )
Investment in malls peaked at $ 32.5 billion in 2007 .
So the mall bubble is n't anywhere near as big as the housing bubble in absolute numbers or potential negative impact on the overall economy .
Here is a graph of mall investment through Q1 2009 as a percent of GDP based on data from the BEA ...
Investment in multimerchandise shopping structures ( malls ) peaked in Q4 2007 and is continuing to decline .
Note that the article above stated there were 20 square feet of retail space per person in shopping centers in 2003 - and that was before the more recent building boom .
There is just too much retail space in the U.S .
Can you imagine anything " so important that it must not be subjected to the risks of disconfirmation or serious criticism " ?
Intellectually , most of us would say not .
But , in fact , we often act as though the answer is yes .
Take , for instance , certain ideas about equality .
Many confuse the moral claim that all human beings should be equally valued and have the same rights regardless of ethnicity , with the factual claim that all ethnic groups have the same basic abilities .
If this factual claim ( which is probably true ) is even tested , let alone put in doubt , they start shouting " racism " .
The belief is too important to even scrutinise .
Even science , which is all about testing and criticism , can be thought to be so important that certain beliefs about its scope and power should not be questioned .
This is the kind of cognitive prophylactic that Daniel Dennett had in mind when he talked , in Breaking the Spell , about " belief in belief " .
This occurs when a tenet comes to be seen , in his words , as " so important that it must not be subjected to the risks of disconfirmation or serious criticism " .
He thought that such a protective cloak should not be thrown over any belief , whether true or false , or whether that belief is in the empirical equality of human beings , the power of science , or of belief in God .
Such belief in belief , however , can come in at least three varieties .
First , there is the social version , which holds that , whatever doubts the powerful cognoscenti may have , it is important that they foster belief in religious belief , or all hell will break loose .
This view is often accused of being elitist ( which it is ) and patronising ( which it may not be ) .
To treat someone as though they were less intelligent than they are is patronising ; to treat someone as though they were less intelligent than you , when they are indeed less intelligent than you , is not .
That is why we do not patronise small children when we talk at their level .
I 'm not convinced this kind of paternalism is good or necessary .
Ethics aside , even on a pragmatic level , it both overestimates the power of elites to determine what the masses think , and the intellectual superiority of the ruling classes .
Second , and a more interesting possibility , is that we might justify belief in belief for ourselves .
For instance , I remember talking to a trade unionist who sincerely believed that the world would be better without money , and that human beings are fundamentally good enough to thrive in such utopian conditions .
When pushed on this , she said : " I have to believe that . "
Such examples of acknowledged belief in belief are not uncommon , although most people feel uncomfortable admitting to it .
But such dogged loyalty is surely only justified in extremis .
If you are stuck on a mountaintop , the belief that you will get down if you try hard enough is too important to seriously doubt .
In contrast , the belief that you will survive no matter what you do , is too dangerous to go unchallenged .
In normal circumstances , however , no belief should be immune to scrutiny .
Even if it seems you would be happier if you did n't test some comfortable convictions , in the long run , such evasion is often destructive .
You may be happier today if you do not question whether your marriage really is in good shape , but if it is n't , your refusal to countenance the possibility is probably going to make things worse in the long run .
Belief in God is no exception , in the public and private cases .
Despite the moral panics of traditionalists , there is no evidence that when religious belief deteriorates , society does too .
Even if the questionable evidence that religious believers are happier and healthier than non-believers holds up , belief in truth should n't rest on instrumental benefits .
It would take a very shallow Christian , for example , to switch faiths if she found that , on average , Jains lived longer , happier lives .
In some respects , the way I 've framed the debate so far misses the point .
Belief in belief is powerful precisely because it is not usually explicit .
Rather , it is like a kind of in - built compass that directs away from the challenging and towards the confirming .
Dealing with this is much more difficult than answering the somewhat tired question of whether it is right to promote religion as a " noble lie " .
( It is n't .
Next . )
Anyone who values truth , including atheists , has to strive very hard try to compensate for belief in belief 's distorting effects .
And that 's no less the case when it appears in the guise of belief in unbelief .

Sebastien Loeb is still interested in trying his hand at Formula 1 in the future , with the Frenchman saying on Tuesday that he is willing to answer his curiosity about just what he could do in a grand prix .
French newspaper L'Equipe revealed on Tuesday that representatives of Loeb have contacted the new Team US F1 about the possibility of selected appearances in 2010 .
And although Loeb could yet make his F1 debut for Scuderia Toro Rosso in the season - closing race in Abu Dhabi , he has also expressed a desire to try out more races in the future if there was a chance .
" After the Abu Dhabi episode , Toro Rosso asked me whether I really wanted to make it in F1 , " he told L'Equipe .
" From my side , I wanted to know if I was of interest to anyone , just out of curiosity .
A person I know therefore made contact with this new team [ US F1 ] .
I do not know what he said . "
He added : " I am enjoying myself driving a WRC car , and I 'm about to extend my deal with Citroen .
" However , if the opportunity to race in one of more grands prix in 2010 occurred when the F1 and rally schedules do not clash , then why not ?
" Rather than constantly asking the question , what could I do in F1 ?
I might as well give it a go .
At least , then I would be sure . "
PARIS , July 12 ( Reuters ) - Workers at collapsed French car parts maker New Fabris threatened on Sunday to blow up their factory if they did not receive payouts by July 31 from auto groups Renault and Peugeot to compensate for their lost jobs .
New Fabris was declared in liquidation in April , so the workers stand to get no redundancy money , although they are entitled to draw state unemployment benefit .
They want Renault SA RENA .
PA and PSA Peugeot Citroen PEUP .
PA to pay 30,000 euros ( $ 41,800 ) for each of the 336 staff at the factory , or some 10 million euros in total , in return for its remaining stocks of equipment and machinery .
“ The bottles of gas have already been placed at various parts of the factory and are connected with each other , ” CGT trades union official Guy Eyermann told France Info radio .
“ If Renault and PSA refuse to give us that money it could blow up before the end of the month , ” he added
A delegation of the workers has a meeting on Thursday with Renault , which had no immediate comment .
Police also declined to comment on the threat by the workers , who are occupying the New Fabris factory at Chatellerault , near Poitiers in central France .
The company is the successor to Fabris , founded in 1947 and put into liquidiation in 2007 .

ZEN SpA , based in Albignasego near Padua , makes cast iron parts for vehicles .
Garro controls other metal firms in France such as Rencast and SBFM that also have financial difficulties .
Some French workers have adopted militant tactics in the economic crisis , including “ bossnappings ” where managers have been held hostage in their offices .

VANCOUVER–They 're mocking Hogtown again .
A new billboard campaign in British Columbia for Coors Light declares the beer is " Colder Than Most People From Toronto . "
The slogan caught Newmarket resident Kathryn Morton by surprise .
" That 's pretty insulting to such a large group of people , " she said .
" We hear stuff about Toronto people all the time but we could n't believe anyone would put it on a billboard . "
Morton , who grew up in Kamloops , where she said it was common for people to make fun of Toronto , saw the ad on a camping trip a couple of weeks ago .
Her 16 - year - old son Stuart spotted it first .
" He realized the political incorrectness of it .
What bothered us was we saw the Olympic logo on the billboard .
This is n't a great way to bring in people to the province . "
But marketing expert Paul Cubbon said it 's likely the people behind the billboards wanted to generate talk .
Making fun of Toronto is a unity issue that ties together everyone who does n't live there , a strategy that has been used for years .
What has changed , said Cubbon , who teaches marketing at UBC's Sauder School of Business , is the speed at which localized ads can move outside their target area via cellphone cameras , YouTube videos and Twitter postings .
" I thought the ad was humorous , " said Cubbon , who saw it last weekend while driving through the Okanagan .
" Everyone out here likes poking fun at Toronto . "
Beer marketing campaigns usually play up regional differences , Cubbon said .
But ads can offend just as easily as they amuse .
Last year , Ford Canada dropped its campaign " Drive It Like You Stole It " after critics objected to its glib message , especially in western cities like Winnipeg , which has a high rate of auto theft .

Coors Light brand marketing manager Adam Moffat said he has heard complaints about the beer ad from one or two people .
" It was from Torontonians visiting the Okanagan who saw it and they thought it was curious , " he said .
" What we 've told consumers is we 're sorry and apologetic if we 've offended anyone . "
Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei urges Iranians and Muslims in general to resist enemy efforts to fuel sectarianism .
" Those who are targeting our national unity using faith as an excuse … they are the elements of the enemy , " the Leader said in the western Iranian city of Sanandaj on Tuesday .
" Those who try to sow discord among Shia and Sunni are mercenaries of the enemy , whether they realize it or not , " Ayatollah Khamenei told the large crowd gathered for the speech .
"
The miserable Salafi and Wahhabi groups who are fed petro-dollars to carry out terrorist acts in Iraq , Afghanistan , Pakistan and elsewhere , many of them are not aware that they are mercenaries of the enemy .
" Speaking in the Kurd and Sunni majority province of Kurdestan , Ayatollah Khamenei went on to say that Shias who insult Sunni beliefs , and vice versa , are also working for the interests of world powers and adversaries of Islam .
Moderate Sunni and Shia Muslims are of the belief that the Wahhabi ideology , which leaders of groups such as the Taliban and al - Qaeda seek to promote , bears no resemblance with Islam .
Comments made by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at a congressional hearing confirm that Washington supports such groups as part of its pursuit of its regional interests .
" And great , let them come from Saudi Arabia and other countries , importing their Wahhabi brand of Islam so that we can go beat the Soviet Union , " she said on the Taliban 's creation in the 1980s .
During the Tuesday speech , Iran 's most senior official said that the Iranian nation would defend its territorial integrity against powers that do not want a united Iran .
Kurdestan is the Iranian province where PJAK separatists , offshoots of the internationally - recognized terrorist group the Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) , seek to gain ground by carrying out violent attacks .
According to a November 2006 article published by The New Yorker , the US military and Israel provide PJAK with equipment , training and vital intelligence to destabilize the Iranian government .
Diplomacy 101 from Joe Biden
Joe Biden gave an interview to the Wall Street Journal after his sojourn to Georgia and Ukraine .
I would n’t characterize his remarks as " diplomatic " :
The reality is the Russians are where they are .
They have a shrinking population base , they have a withering economy , they have a banking sector and structure that is not likely to be able to withstand the next 15 years , they ’re in a situation where the world is changing before them and they ’re clinging to something in the past that is not sustainable .
If Biden was just shooting the breeze off the record , I ’d be hard - pressed to disagree with anything in the quotes .
I ’m pretty sure , however , that part of " smart power " is not being gratuitously insulting to fellow members of the nuclear club .
Maybe , just maybe , they ’ll take this kind of dumbass statement personally .
Do n’t take my word for it , though — take Joe Biden’s :
It is never smart to embarrass an individual or a country when they ’re dealing with significant loss of face .
My dad used to put it another way :
Never put another man in a corner where the only way out is over you .
It just is not smart .
The word " stupid " has been thrown around a lot this week , but I think it applies pretty well to Biden ’s language .
[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : yst 0.2.1
I 'm pleased to announce the release of yst , now available on HackageDB .
yst generates static websites from YAML or CSV data files and StringTemplates .
This approach combines the speed , security , and ease of deployment of a static website with the flexibility and maintainability of a dynamic site that separates presentation and data .
The easiest way to get a feel for yst is to try it : cabal update cabal install yst yst create testsite cd testsite yst yst attempts to fill a niche between two kinds of site creation tools .
On the one hand you have simple static site generators like webgen , webby , nanoc , and my old custom system using make and pandoc .
On the other hand , you have dynamic web frameworks like rails and django .
For my own smallish websites , I found that the dynamic frameworks were overkill .
Nobody but me was going to edit the pages , and I did n't want the trouble of writing and deploying a dynamic site , setting up a web server , and administering a database .
A static site would be faster , easier to deploy , and more secure .
But the dynamic frameworks offered one thing that the static site generators did not : an easy way to separate data from presentation .
This was becoming increasingly important to me as I found myself constantly updating the same information ( say , publication data for a paper ) in multiple places ( say , a LaTeX CV and a differently formatted web listing of papers ) .
What I wanted was a site generation tool that used YAML text files as a database and allowed different kinds of documents to be produced from the same data .
I could n't find anything that did just what I wanted , so I wrote yst .
By way of illustration , here are the build instructions for HTML and LaTeX versions of a CV , plus a web page with a list of papers : - url : cv.html title : CV template : cv.st data_common : &cvdata contact : from contact .
yaml jobsbyemployer : from jobs .
yaml order by start group by employer degrees : from degrees .
yaml order by year desc awards : from awards .
yaml order by year desc group by title papers : from papers .
yaml order by year desc where ( not ( type = ' review ' ) ) reviews : from papers .
yaml order by year desc where type = ' review ' talks : from talks .
yaml where date < ' 2009 - 09 - 01 ' order by date desc group by title dissertations : from dissertations .
yaml order by role then year group by role theses : from theses .
yaml order by year then student courses : from courses .
yaml order by number group by title data : <<: * cvdata html : yes - url : cv.tex title : CV inmenu : no template : cv.st layout : layout.tex.st data : <<: * cvdata html : yes - url : papers.html title : Papers template : papers.st data : papersbyyear : from papers .
yaml order by year desc then title group by year yst 's query language is limited , and there are lots of things you can do with a full - fledged database that you can't do with yst .
But yst is ideal , I think , for small to medium data - driven sites that are maintained by a single person who likes working with plain text .
It scratched my itch , anyway , and I release it in case anyone else has the same itch .

Here is a story that you wo n’t be seeing on MSNBC .
According to Media Matters , CNBC sent an email to a national Tea Party coordinator looking for a mob to cover at a healthcare protest .
They were looking for a location with , “ lots of energy and lots of anger . ”
Low and behold , CNBC may be trying gin up anti-healthcare reform coverage .
You can view a post from the Tea Party Patriots website on the Media Matters blog , from Jenny Beth Martin that says , “ We have a media request for an event this week that will have lots of energy and lots of anger .
This is from CNBC .
So where are the big events this week and where can TPP be best represented in the news ? ”
This is more evidence not only of the overt political agenda of CNBC , but it also dispels the idea that these protests are somehow organic movements of regular people who are showing up because they are opposed to healthcare reform .
This is proof of the level of coordination and organization that is involved in this movement .
Advertisements
It is n’t much of a surprise that the tea baggers are also showing up to protest at the town hall meetings .
The tactics being used are the same for both the tea parties and these healthcare protests .
The Nazi signs , the yelling , the disruption , it is all the same thing .
Quite frankly , the issues do n’t matter to these people .
They want “ their country back ” that the black man stole from them .
It also is n’t a shock that CNBC is involved in spinning the coverage .
As the Media Matters blog asked , is CNBC also contacting Democrats and progressives for their town hall coverage ?
It is a pretty safe bet that they are n’t .
Of course , this story wo n’t be covered on MSNBC or NBC , because as we saw with Jim Cramer / Jon Stewart incident , the NBC family covers for each other .
Electronic wizards and bicycle fanatics Kraftwerk are expected to play songs from their album Tour de France in an appropriate setting this summer when they perform at the Manchester Velodrome just as the iconic race gets going across the Channel .
The German group , whose 1983 hit Tour de France has been used as the theme track for Tour de France coverage , will play at the cycling venue as part of the Manchester International Festival , which runs from July 2 -19 .
The bill says the group will play a two - hour set drawing on the entire Kraftwerk catalogue so unless they are feeling particularly cruel , it looks like fans can expect to hear at least some of the tracks from the 2003 album named after the grueling French bicycle race .
Kraftwerk members Florian Schneider and Ralf Hutter are famously obsessed with bicycles and the 1983 song Tour de France was followed up in 2003 by an album of the same name featuring tracks such as Titanium , Aero Dynamik , Vitamin and what one Guardian columnist describes as “ the hilariously deadpan Elektro Kardiogramm , ” about a heart monitor .
Hutter and Schneider took up cycling in the 80s with Hutter taking his new passtime particularly seriously .
It 's said that at the height of his obsession he would jump off the tour bus and cycle the last 150 km into the next town where the band was scheduled to perform .
Talking about the 1983 Tour de France EP , Hutter said : " The bicycle is already a musical instrument on its own .
The noise of the bicycle chain , the pedal and gear mechanism , the breathing of the cyclist , we have incorporated all this into the Kraftwerk sound . "
Hutter suffered serious head injuries in a cycling accident near the Rhine Dam which left him in a coma for two days .
His first words on waking were , reportedly , " Where 's my bike ? "
Unsurprisingly perhaps , when percussionists Flür and Bartos left the band in the 80s , cycling was cited as a major reason .
More recently the band teamed up with Hot Chip to remix two of the tracks , Aerodynamik and La Forme .
Catch Kraftwerk at the Manchester Velodrome on Thursday , July 2 , at 7.30 pm .

Hundreds of co-vocabularists offered their definitions of “ Money ” in April , and “ America ” in May .
This weekend , Schott ’s Vocab is soliciting definitions of faith .
Faith is described in the Bible as “ the substance of things hoped for , the evidence of things not seen . ”
H. L. Mencken called faith “ an illogical belief in the occurrence of the improbable . ”
And , Samuel Butler said of faith , “ You can do very little with it , but you can do nothing without it . ”
Co-vocabularists are invited to submit their own definitions of faith , the pithier the better , by appending a comment to this post .
How it all started :
I 'd been living in London when my world turned upside down and I 'd had to come home .
By the time my plane landed back in Sydney , all I had left was a carry on bag full of clothes and a world of troubles .
No one to welcome me back , no place to call home .
I was a tourist in my hometown .
Standing there in the arrivals terminal , watching other passengers meeting their waiting friends and family , with open arms and smiling faces , hugging and laughing together , I wanted someone out there to be waiting for me .
To be happy to see me .
To smile at me .
To hug me .
So I got some cardboard and a marker and made a sign .
I found the busiest pedestrian intersection in the city and held that sign aloft , with the words " Free Hugs " on both sides .
And for 15 minutes , people just stared right through me .
The first person who stopped , tapped me on the shoulder and told me how her dog had just died that morning .
How that morning had been the one year anniversary of her only daughter dying in a car accident .
How what she needed now , when she felt most alone in the world , was a hug .
I got down on one knee , we put our arms around each other and when we parted , she was smiling .
Everyone has problems and for sure mine have n't compared .
But to see someone who was once frowning , smile even for a moment , is worth it every time .
Why did it get banned ?
Public liability fear and red tape .
But it 's all okay now !
Make sure to check your local laws before embarking on your Hugathon !
Special Thanks
I would just like to thank Sick Puppies for their incredible song " All the Same " which the Free Hugs campaign video would have never been the same without .

Thinking of turning to crime ?
Become a fat - cat fraudster and the law will leave you alone
Stick to fraud :
You 're more likely to get away with it
Most people have a commonsense approach to fraud .
We know cheating , lying and stealing when we see it .
The law does not work in such a simple way .
The case of the London woman who claimed a false address in order to get her child into a desirable school
illustrates the point .
She may or may not have cheated but charges against her were dropped because of legal doubts about whether she was technically guilty of fraud .
Cheating over a school place is not , it was argued , like a bank clerk fiddling the accounts to make a bit on the side .
To many of my constituents for whom access to a good education
is a prime concern , that will be a bewildering conclusion : an acceptance that anything goes and dishonesty wo n’t be punished by the law .
I do n’t particularly want to single out this family for criticism since there are countless cases of parents resorting to dishonest little tricks to get their children into schools of their choice .
My point is a more general one : fraud , in the broad sense , is all around us but is tolerated .
Every week I have people coming to my advice surgery telling me that they are victims of fraud .
They have lost a lot of money to a dodgy builder or bank or lawyer or travel company but cannot persuade the police to investigate or are told that there is insufficient proof of intent to defraud .
They are not rich enough to hire lawyers for a civil action and often may not be eligible for legal aid .
They may suffer grievous loss and ruin .
Yet nothing can be done to remedy the injustice , under the law .
At a time when many people are losing their jobs and homes and others are making fortunes , the frail protection we have is the law .
And the law is what determines whether the fortunes have been made honestly and not by theft .
Yet we see what looks like fraud and cheating on a large scale and crooked people getting away with it while thousands of perfectly honest people go before courts every week to face the dire consequences of home repossession or bankruptcy .
I seriously worry that there is now a massive disconnect between what most people would regard as justice and fairness and what actually happens under our law .
Bernie Madoff has been sentenced to 150 years in jail for huge fraud
Last week , we had one case where justice was done .
The world ’s biggest fraudster went to jail in America .
Bernie Madoff stole money in clever ways from - mostly - rich people and from charities he patronised .
For this crime he has been sentenced to several lifetimes in jail .
He has been treated more severely than a murderer or rapist .
The US authorities were , I think , trying to give the public a reassuring message : that white - collar crime , notably fraud , has victims just as much as bank robbery or burglary ; and that the law will eventually catch up with crooks .
Good messages .
But messages that ring a little hollow , especially in Britain .
Madoff ’s technique was what was called a Ponzi scheme .
He stole money from investors who entrusted their cash to him and kept enough back to pay out reasonable returns on investments and those who asked for their money back .
The rest of the money disappeared .
As in the US , Ponzi schemes and other forms of pyramid selling are criminal here in Britain .
What the public finds strange is that the Madoff Ponzi scheme is not very
different from the way many of our financial and other banking institutions function .
People have made fortunes in the City on the basis of promises to investors that were as improbable as Madoff’s .
Their banks duly collapsed ; the taxpayer has compensated the victims ( or not , in the case of Equitable Life ) ; and the operators have walked away with their loot .
A couple of months ago , I visited the head of the Serious Fraud Office ( SFO ) to ask why more fraud was not being prosecuted .
I believe that there are several Madoff - type schemes in the City now being investigated which will be brought to court .
Misconduct of a more general kind is difficult to prove .
It is striking that despite the substantial criminal powers available to the police and the financial regulators ( the FSA ) , these are rarely used .
The SFO also has a sad history of failed prosecutions ( and its authority was badly undermined when Tony Blair stopped it investigating alleged large - scale bribery involving arms contracts and Saudi princes ) .
The public has , I think , drawn the correct conclusion : Madoff was the exception .
My career advice for British crooks is to stick to finance : you ’ll never get to court , let alone prison .
One man who did not follow such advice is Ronnie Biggs , the Great Train Robber .
Despite advancing years and poor health , he can not be released from jail .
Paedophiles and murderers go free but he remains behind bars .
I am not trying to defend Mr Biggs , who violently assaulted a train driver and stole a lot of money .
What the authorities can’t forgive is not the assault ( worse happens every day and does n’t even attract a custodial sentence ) but his two - fingered salute to the powers that be .
He sends out the dangerous message that he is n’t sorry for helping himself to other people ’s money .
He was just unlucky enough to be caught .
Great Train Robbery : Ronnie Biggs pictured in 2001
The public ’s cynicism grows by the day as they judge that there is a yawning gap between justice on financial abuses and crime in general .
The parliamentary expenses scandal , for example , is sliding into the long grass apart from the revelations just surfacing about Mr George Osborne .
There is a large grey area between the ethical and the illegal but the two are interwoven .
Unless justice is seen to be done , there is no legal underpinning for ethical behaviour .
The public sense that this recent financial – and parliamentary – crisis is part of a wider collapse of standards and decline in honesty and that the authorities are too weak or lazy or incompetent to ensure justice is done .
Before we settle back down to ‘ business as usual ’ it is vitally necessary that the mini-Madoffs who populate the financial community and their equivalents in public life who have been dishonest are brought before the courts and sentenced .
The SFO , the anti tax - dodging operations of HM Revenue & Customs , the police and other enforcement bodies , must be built up , not cut back .
The law can not be blind to fat - cat criminals and eagle - eyed to everyone else .

Tock
Tock ( translator from occam to C from Kent ) is a Haskell - based compiler for occam and related languages .
Current frontends :
occam2.1
Rain
Current backends :
C99 using the CCSP runtime
C++ using the C++CSP runtime
It 's written in Haskell , making use of the Parsec parser combinator library and generic tree transformation passes .
It aims to provide C - like performance for straightline code .
For more details on Tock , see the " Publications " section below .
Tock is currently experimental and under development ; if you 're after a stable occam - pi implementation then please see ​KRoC or ​ the Transterpreter .
Getting Tock
The source code is currently managed using ​ the Darcs distributed revision control system .
You can browse it with a web browser here :
To download a copy of the source to play with , install Darcs , then do darcs get -- partial http://offog.org/darcs/tock/
; this will give you a tock directory containing the source code .
Compiling Tock
Tock itself needs GHC version 6.12 or later and Alex .
If you 're on Debian , then you can do the following to install all the packages required for Tock :
apt - get install ghc6 ghc6 - prof \ libgh c6 - mtl - dev libgh c6 - hunit - dev libghc6 - fgl - dev libghc6 - quickcheck2 - dev \ libghc6 - haxml - dev libghc6 - parsec - dev libghc6 - regex - base - dev \ libghc6 - regex - compat - dev \ alex haddock drift \ darcs gcc g++ autoconf automake pkg-config
haddock is only necessary if you want to build the documentation .
libghc6 - haxml - dev and drift are only necessary if you want to experiment with the XML AST .
Once you have the sources in a directory , you will need to execute these commands :
autoreconf - i ./ configure make
You can also run the command make check to run the supplied unit tests .
Tock 's C backend needs GCC 3 or later , and the latest Subversion version of the CCSP library from KRoC ( which currently only supports IA32 ) .
Tock 's C++ backend needs GCC 3 , and C++CSP v2.0.2 or later .
Running Tock
To compile a program to a binary using Tock , use a command of the form :
/ path/to/tock --output=testprog testprog.occ
For more exciting output , add the -v flag .
The command ./ tock --output=testcases/commstime-mini testcases/commstime -mini.occ will compile one of the testcases .
By default , Tock uses the occam frontend and the C/ CCSP backend .
To change this , use -- frontend=rain and / or -- backend=cppcsp respectively .
However , both the Rain frontend and C++CSP backend are currently unfinished .
Publications
The best overview of what we 're doing is probably this paper , describing the overall structure of Tock , and our work on making Scrap Your Boilerplate and Uniplate fast enough for use in nanopasses :
Here are the slides Adam presented at Fun in the Afternoon that are a dramatically cut - down version of the paper above , just talking about our Uniplate work in context :
This paper describes some of the performance problems we had with SYB that lead to the work above :
This paper describes the pattern - matching system that we developed for use in Tock :
There 's also the very first presentation Adam gave when he first started working on what later became Tock , which describes some of the sillier approaches he tried before finding something that worked :
Working on Tock
Tock is designed to make it straightforward to experiment with modifications to the compiler -- for example , adding new backends , or testing out new language features or optimisations .
If you 're interested in working on ( or using )
Tock yourself , then please join the tock - discuss mailing list :
You can use Darcs to work on and commit ( " record " ) changes in your own copy , and then submit them to Adam when you 're happy for them to be merged using darcs send .
Provided your changes do n't break
Tock for other users , we 're interested in getting them into the trunk as soon as possible so that they 're available to everybody .
The code is documented inline using Haddock syntax ; install Haddock and type make haddock to create HTML documentation in the doc directory .

Abstract
Chronic health effects are increasing in the world such as cancers , hormonal , reproductive , nervous , or immune diseases , even in young people .
During regulatory toxicological subchronic tests to prevent these on mammalian health , prior commercialization of chemicals , including pesticides and drugs , or GMOs , some statistically significant findings may be revealed .
This discussion is about the need to investigate the relevant criteria to consider those as biologically significant .
The sex differences and the non linear dose or time related effects should be considered in contrast to the claims of a Monsanto - supported expert panel about a GMO , the MON 863
Bt maize , but also for pesticides or drugs , in particular to reveal hormone - dependent diseases and first signs of toxicities .
Keywords : Pesticides , GMO , MON 863 , side effects , toxicological tests .
Introduction
Some contaminations or pollutions by pesticides [ 1 ] and other chemical residues [ 2 - 4 ] affect human and animal health , together with biodiversity .
Thus it is important to study potential mid and long - term toxicological effects during regulatory tests prior to commercialization of chemicals , and not to test only short - term or subchronic effects .
This question has also been raised for GMOs [ 5 ] , especially those containing pesticides , either because they tolerate ( such as Roundup Ready soya ) or produce ( such as Bt maize ) these molecules ( 99 % of commercially cultivated GMOs ) .
This subject has been reviewed recently by Dronamraju [ 6 ] .
Objectives
Here we shall discuss more particularly the existing data on possible toxic effects of a GMO on mammals , with putative relevance to humans , and with the aim of commenting on current procedures and experimental protocols in mammalian feeding experiments ( Fig. 1 ) .
Doull et al . [ 7 ] indicated their general criteria needed to classify as biologically relevant the observed significant effects during 90d toxicological tests on mammals .
The example taken was for a GMO , a Bt maize called MON 863 , producing in its cells a new kind of modified insecticide Cry3Bb1 , known as a toxin for coleopterans .
But these authors claim to apply the same criteria to other products such as pesticides and drugs .
The history of the debate on the biosafety of this GMO is paradigmatic , and it raises a series of general questions on risk assessment of commercial transgenic crops and of pesticides or chemicals .
These considerations are crucial , since public health is concerned and their discussion may critically influence the decision to release in particular some agricultural GMOs or not , and also to another extent the economic feasibility of this kind of project .
Figure 1 Comparison of regulatory toxicity tests generally performed in vivo on mammals , for instance with rats , the most used model , before commercialization of various products .
These are GMOs used for food or feed , pesticides , drugs , or the best tested chemicals .
The choice of how to apply standards is made by scientific commissions of regulatory instances .
This figure does not include reproductive , developmental or trans - generational tests that are not requested for commercialized GMOs for food or feed .
Nutritional tests are not represented either because they do not require blood analyses , which are very informative on health secondary effects .
Some mammalian nutritional tests are performed with pigs or cows , for instance for GMOs , and may last longer with fewer animals .
Subchronic toxicity tests are in the last case performed , if any , only with rats for most GMOs .
Then it is only with 10 animals fully assessed on 20 for each of two doses , and per sex .
There are 3 mammalian species used for other products .
This is to measure short - term effects .
The so - called chronic tests ( lasting more than 3 months ) give more chances to reveal metabolic , nervous , immune , hormonal or cancer diseases .
They are widely performed for pesticides and drugs and for some chemicals over a certain production , but not for actual commercialized GMOs released in the environment ( 1995 - 2009 ) .
This is a matter of debate , since 99.9 % of those are genetically modified to contain new pesticide residues that they tolerate ( ex. Roundup Ready soya ) or that they produce ( ex. insecticides
Bt in maize , that are newly modified proteic toxins ) .

The protocol used to test GMOs in regulatory in vivo tests with mammals
Recently , Doull et al . [ 7 ] offered a new contradictory analysis of Séralini et al . [ 5 ] .
It was about the interpretation of the only crude data available from the longest toxicity test ( 90 days ) on a mammal that had been fed with MON 863 .
The original feeding experiment was performed by Covance and Monsanto [ 8 ] , with a great experience of this kind of tests always designed in a similar manner .
They measured the effect of feed containing only two doses ( 11 and 33 % GM in the equilibrated diet ) and for only two periods of exposure ( 5 and 14 weeks ) .
The goal is a debate on standards to be set to interpret admitted significant effects [ 7 ] between treated groups versus controls as biologically relevant or not in toxicological tests in general .
There are several preliminary unsolved questions at stake to be answered such as whether to prolong tests before commercial release , for instance up to two years for GMOs , as is done for some pesticides or drugs , in order to assess chronic effects not visible in short periods .
There are also questions regarding the appropriate number of concentrations of the putative toxic agent to be tested etc. , and critical experimental criteria such as number of animals to be used per dose or concentration to increase their resolution power to obtain homogeneous and reliable significance levels in outcome measurement data .
However , the crude data on MON 863 were obtained by Monsanto for only one mammalian species ( instead of the three used for evaluations of pesticides or drugs ) and first classified as confidential by the Company which obtained it ( 2002 ) .
The data was then used to obtain commercial release agreements all over the world .
After heated discussions in Europe concerning the possible physiological effects provoked by this GMO , a decision in the German Appeal Court allowed public access to the crude data ( 2005 ) .
Monsanto then published its own interpretation of the data [ 8 ] in which it was concluded that the MON 863 was safe to eat .
After careful analysis of the crude data , Séralini et al . [ 5 ] applied appropriate statistical methodology to test the effects of the Bt maize on mammalian health .
First , GM fed rats were compared to their closest isogenic controls , and then to the six reference groups who were fed various other maize - based diets that Monsanto added in the study .
Data were compiled by organ , dose and timing of dietary exposure .
In addition , the effects on the rat metabolism of the diet composition without GM maize was studied , comparing only control and reference groups between them to avoid systematically linking these effects to the GM diet .
In the first instance Monsanto did not do such a statistical study ( [ 8 ] and in commercial request file ) but only took into account effects between the GM fed rats at the highest dose and all other groups .
It is important to note that in order to isolate the effect of the GM transformation process from other variables it is only valid to compare the GMO ( in this case MON 863 ) with its isogenic non-GM equivalent .
Therefore , the inclusion in the analysis of unrelated feeding groups serves to confuse rather than clarify the effect of the MON 863 event .
The goal of the statistical analysis is to decide whether the consumption of GMOs can be considered to have no effect ( null hypothesis H 0 true ) or to have an effect ( H 0 false ) on the health of the rats .
This analysis cannot be reduced in the computation of a collection of p-values .
Statistical rejection of the null hypothesis H 0 does not imply that the effect is biologically significant .
In the same way , failure to reject H 0 does not mean that it is true .
Therefore , the power of the hypothesis test must be assessed .
The power of a statistical test depends on the sample size ( and therefore the experimental design ) , the significance level of the test and the effect size ( which can be considered as biologically significant ) .
This most important issue is totally overlooked in the experimental design and the statistical report made by Monsanto on MON 863 .
Moreover , any hypothesis which is not statistically significant with their reductive method is always excluded .
This disturbing oversight runs false negative results and a risk of health consequences for millions of people and animals .
Sex -related and non-linear signs of toxicity
In the MON 863 study , Séralini et al . [ 5 ] were also concerned by false positive results , but concluded that there were enough signs of toxicity to prolong the feeding experiments .
This is mostly because significant effects were concentrated in livers and kidneys as main detoxification organs reacting in cases of food / chemical contamination ; there were at these levels some worrying physiological profiles .
Moreover , the effects of the MON 863 insecticide toxin itself are not experimentally documented on mammalian cells .
Furthermore , it remains a possibility that there would be side effects due to insertional mutagenesis during the GM transformation .
For instance , the Séralini et al . [ 5 ] analysis showed evidence of a significant increase in blood glucose of 10 % in GM - fed females , in triglycerides of 24 - 40 % , overweight livers and enhanced liver / brain ratios ( 7 % ) , small but significant body weight gain ( 3.7 % ) , and disturbed kidney parameters .
When comparing females eating GMOs to their closest controls eating the isogenic line , there were signs of a possible pre-diabetic profile .
In both sexes and periods the profiles were different but it concerned liver and kidney parameters .
From that , Doull et al . [ 6 ] concluded that any effects with no clear dose - response relationship ( which should increase with dose ) or with time are unrelated to the GM diet .
We consider that first of all , to a scientific point of view , choosing a priori 2 doses and 2 periods does not allow the assessment of a linear dose - or period - related effect [ 9 - 11 ] .
Our hypothesis was to question the possibility of subchronic or chronic health effects that were not or only partially revealed by short - term tests .
Several hormonal disrupting effects do not linearly increase with time or dose , but present non-linear peaks in the shape of U or J curves [ 12 - 14 ] at some periods or some ranges of doses , depending on the age and exposure period of the test animals [ 15 - 17 ] .
Secondly , a clear histopathological study should be published and studied in parallel to the biochemical effects found by Monsanto or the Monsanto - supported expert panel [ 7 ] .
It is possible that metabolic changes precede , within 90 days , histopathological lesions that could appear afterwards .
This is another reason to prolong the experiments and may also solve the problem of reproducibility .
Simultaneously , the occurrence of similar effects in both sexes is an important criterion of toxicity for Doull et al . [ 7 ] , which is not for us .
Sex - dependent differences in chronic diseases resulting from chemical intoxication are well established [ 18 , 19 ] .
The liver is itself a sex - differentiated organ ; for example chemical sensitivity is different in males and females [ 20 ] .
In Monsanto 's data for these 3 month rat tests with
Bt maize MON 863 , for all rats including the six times bigger group of normal control and reference animals eating non GM diets , there were confirmed sex - differentiated effects in liver and kidneys parameters ( Fig.2A and B ) .
Doull et al . [ 7 ] also considered a normal range of variations in undefined historical data , or compiled the closest isogenic control with other reference groups that have diets different in salt or sugars .
This is not scientifically precise .
Figure 2 A. Principal Component Analysis for liver parameters in all rats of the MON 863 experiment .
It was performed according to Hotelling [ 29 ] in order to study the scattering of the different factors .
The scheme obtained for parameters at week 14 explains 42.42 % of the total data variability ( inertia ) expressed on 2 axes ( 32.01 % for factor 1 ; 10.41 % for factor 2 ) , scale d=2 .
This demonstrates the clear separation of parameters values according to sex .
B. Principal Component Analysis for kidney parameters in all rats of the MON 863 experiment .
The scheme obtained for parameters at week 14 explains 47.73 % of the total data variability ( inertia ) expressed on 2 axes ( 26.95 % for factor 1 ; 20.78 % for factor 2 ) , scale d=5 .
This demonstrates the clear separation of parameters values according to sex .

Conclusion
We assume that Séralini et al . [ 5 ] methodology can discriminate potential false positive and GM - linked effects , avoiding to some extent false negative ones , in the best way we can do for this discussed and too limited protocol already in use for commercialized GMOs .
These GM - linked effects are then considered as signs of toxicity in the 90 days , not proofs of toxicity .
The biological plausibility of a subchronic or chronic side effect of the GM diet , linked to the new toxin in the mammalian regimen , or due to the mutagenesis effect of the genetic modification itself , is thus non negligible .
Finally it should be stressed that statistically significant effects of GM diets , or of residues of pesticides that are contained by GMOs , have also been observed in other instances [ 21 - 25 ] , but not in all studies [ 26 , 27 ] enlightening the necessity of a case - by - case approach , and that the real toxicological studies are quite limited up to date for that [ 28 ] .
All these observations taken together in our opinions do not allow a clear statement of toxic effects , but to suggest them as such , because they are clearly undeniable .
Now , to any good researcher similar results would mean that there is much to be improved in the planning of experimental design ; and thus to increase their resolution power to obtain unequivocal statements , for instance increasing the duration and / or the number of rats tested .
Generally speaking it seems to us unbelievable that a risk assessment carried out only on forty rats of each sex receiving GM rich diets for 90 days ( yielding results often at the limits of significance ) have not been repeated and prolonged independently .
We should overall take into account the fact that the analysed GM product could be fed long - term to people and animals of various ages and sexes , and with various pathologies .
We call for more serious standardized tests such as those used for pesticides or drugs , on at least three mammalian species tested for at least three months employing larger sample sizes , and up to one and two years before commercialization , for GM food or feed specifically modified to contain pesticide residues .
We also call for a serious scientific debate about the criteria for testing significant adverse health effects for pesticides or chemicals , but overall for GM food or feed products , such as MON 863 .

Sintex Industries ' aptly - dubbed biogas digester is most certainly not the first of its kind , but it is somewhat commendable that its maker is making no bones about this thing 's purpose .
Destined to " solve India 's energy and sanitation problems in one stroke , " this concoction can convert " human [ waste ] , cow dung , or kitchen garbage into fuel that can be used for cooking or generating electricity . "
Reportedly , a one - cubic - meter digester would sell for around $ 425 , but could pay for itself in energy savings in under 24 months .
Excrement to energy -- now there 's a concept .

For the longest time American writers got little respect from condescending arbiters of taste abroad or even from literary scholars at home .
Professors of English were in thrall to the mother country , with its awesome cultural traditions .
Snobs at heart , they saw American literature as little more than a provincial offshoot , decorously genteel but with a handful of talents ( Melville , Poe , Whitman ) who were almost freakishly original .
In Memoirs of Hecate County , Edmund Wilson recalled how his teachers at Princeton , just before the First World War , either ignored or patronized American writers .
“ In those days the English department stopped short with the Victorian age and did not admit the importance of any American writers at all . ”
This began changing soon afterward , but the celebration of our native literary genius has accelerated tremendously in recent decades .
Since 1975 , when I first started teaching graduate students , I ’ve seen their interests shift dramatically from earlier writers to modern and contemporary ones , from poetry to prose , and from English to American literature .
These changes have been reflected in reading patterns outside the university , and they helped set off a genuine upheaval in the literary canon .
I confess to misgivings about all these trends , especially the shameful neglect of poetry and the inexorable tilt toward the contemporary .
Readers have grown impatient with the difficult and the unfamiliar .
Through the first half of the 20th century , universities balked at teaching writers whose work had not yet found their historical niche .
Dominated by scholars rather than by critics , literature programs took a curatorial approach to literary history , building monuments to authors long dead and safely canonized .
They were agnostic about teaching the greatest modern writers , such as Franz Kafka or Marcel Proust , let alone postwar figures like Saul Bellow and J. D. Salinger .
They felt that literary instruction should concentrate on works distanced by history or estranged by shifts in language and social customs .
As they came to be influenced by the close reading methods of the New Critics , they saw poetry as the concentrated essence of literature .
Prose works , especially fiction , were far easier to grasp , so why bother to teach them ?
Literature was part of a long tradition that had to be mastered as a whole , even when its links had been shattered .
Students needed to be immersed in works hallowed by time .
In the aftermath of the 1960s , colleges tossed out many requirements , including core courses , survey courses , even distribution requirements .
Students were encouraged to do their own thing , though they often had no idea of what that thing was .
The undergraduate program at Brown became famous — and a big draw with high school seniors — for its taster ’s - choice curriculum .
Competing for funds and students , departments everywhere grew more market driven .
With precious little help from their elders , students cobbled together programs as if from a Chinese menu .
Contemporary courses provided just the recipe for consumer satisfaction , not for historical breadth .
As graduate and undergraduate programs featured more courses in recent literature , doctoral candidates began writing up - to - date theses on current authors .
Most important of all , there was a rising tide of attention given to American writers who had once seemed of merely local interest — imposing figures in their time and place but scarcely of world class .
As an undergraduate at Columbia , I earned my spurs in the required humanities course — the Western classics from Homer to Dostoyevsky — but also signed on for a three - year survey of English literature from its medieval beginnings to 1900 .
It was an ambitious but Eurocentric literary education .
Though I was an English major , I did n’t take a single course in American literature , and I was never urged to do so .
This blatant omission was largely my own choice .
The American writers I ’d bumped up against in high school bored me to distraction .
Besides anthology chestnuts like “ A Man Without a Country ” by Edward Everett Hale , high school textbooks of the 1950s featured works by such cozy Victorian “ fireside poets ” as William Cullen Bryant and John Greenleaf Whittier in company with “ O Captain !
My Captain ! ” — Walt Whitman ’s least typical poem .
The modern poets were Carl Sandburg and Robert Frost , decked out as harmless old gaffers dispensing cracker - barrel wisdom .
( We also read Julius Caesar and Macbeth — too slowly to appreciate them . )
The only American book that excited me in those years was Hawthorne ’s Scarlet Letter , which I chose as the subject for a paper .
When as a freshman in college I stumbled on Joyce and Conrad , a new world seemed to open before my eyes .
Under the impact of the new modernist sensibility , the traditional American canon had already been drastically revised , but the news had yet to reach most high schools .
Starting in the 1920s with critics like Lewis Mumford , D. H. Lawrence , and F. O. Matthiessen , Melville was rediscovered , Emily Dickinson was discovered for the first time , Stephen Crane ’s work from the 1890s was revived , and new writers like Hemingway , Faulkner , Fitzgerald , and a host of difficult modern poets created a cultural revolution .
But while advanced critics drew attention to some neglected American writers , including Hawthorne and Henry James , they cast others into purgatory , above all the social realists who had emerged from the ferment of the Gilded Age .
Only a generation or two earlier , William Dean Howells , Mark Twain , Theodore Dreiser , Edith Wharton , Willa Cather , and Sinclair Lewis had weathered the antagonism of genteel taste to become the most celebrated writers of their age .
In his later years , Howells , the friend of both Twain and James , had waged a campaign for realism in his magazine , where he sponsored the work of younger writers like Crane , Frank Norris , Hamlin Garland , Paul Laurence Dunbar , and Abraham Cahan .
They wrote dark , gritty books , quite unlike the historical romances that were bestsellers in their day .
Inspired by Tolstoy and other European realists , Howells espoused fiction and poetry that did not glamorize their subjects and remained true to ordinary experience .
Before the advent of the new modernists after the First World War , these writers epitomized everything that was frank and daring about modern literature .
Between the 1920s and the 1950s the reputations of these realist writers faded .
Their subjects , which included poverty , greed , heredity , crime , and religious doubt , were bold for their time but now seemed dated ; their style could be clumsy , their books badly structured .
The pioneering realists could not match the self - conscious art of the writers who emerged in the ’ 20s or the psychological subtlety of their forebear , Henry James .
Caught up in the social suffering of the Gilded Age , their comfortless books were tuned to the lower frequencies of American life .
But during the early years of the Cold War , writers and readers turned inward , dismissing the politics of progressivism and protest as an intrusion .
The Depression was over , America seemed on a roll , and the social criticism of the realists — indeed , the social novel itself — looked like something left over from another era .
In “ Reality in America , ” the influential lead essay in The Liberal Imagination ( 1950 ) , Lionel Trilling compared the hard social reality reflected by Dreiser with the more complex psychological reality in Hawthorne and James .
Trilling was an ardent admirer of European realists like Balzac and Stendhal but suggested that their tradition , infused with personal passion and ambition , had never taken hold here .
Ignoring their best work , especially Dreiser ’s Sister Carrie , Trilling saw the American realists as crudely reductive and materialist , lacking the rich psychology and individuality pursued by their counterparts abroad , including the expatriate James .
Trilling ’s view became the critical consensus of the 1950s , the gospel that would be discarded by readers and scholars in the following decades .
When I was an undergraduate at the end of the 1950s , the works that seemed essential included Stendhal ’s The Red and the Black ; Austen ’s Pride and Prejudice and Emma ; Flaubert ’s Madame Bovary and Sentimental Education ; Dickens ’s Great Expectations and Our Mutual Friend ; Tolstoy ’s Anna Karenina ; Conrad ’s Heart of Darkness ; almost anything by Dostoyevsky , but especially his Notes from Underground ; Nietzsche ’s Birth of Tragedy and Genealogy of Morals ; Freud ’s Civilization and Its Discontents ; Eliot ’s Waste Land and Four Quartets ; Yeats ’s later poems ; Joyce ’s Portrait and Ulysses ; the novels and stories of D. H. Lawrence ; and so on .
These reflected the modern sensibility of our teachers as well as the mood of the moment .
They made up an international canon , strongly influenced by psychoanalysis and existentialism .
Trilling had given up his course on American literature to teach these writers .
He projected them as disturbers of the peace , unsettling originals , and he complained that his students had begun taking them for granted .
He was quite wrong , for in those days the modern still had the power to unhinge us and challenge everything we had already been taught .
They even became the lens through which we viewed their precursors in earlier centuries , some of whom we saw as modern before their time .
Everything in that canon , even the much challenged work of D. H. Lawrence , is still vibrant today , but now I find that my students , like me , are drawn to books like Whitman ’s Leaves of Grass ; Dreiser ’s Sister Carrie ; James ’s Portrait of a Lady ; Twain ’s Huckleberry Finn and Pudd’nhead Wilson ; Howells ’s A Hazard of New Fortunes ; Crane ’s Maggie : A Girl of the Streets and his crisply ironic short fiction ; Sarah Orne Jewett ’s Country of the Pointed Firs ; Kate Chopin ’s Awakening ; William James ’s Pragmatism ; Wharton ’s House of Mirth and Age of Innocence ; Cather ’s My Ántonia ; and Zora Neale Hurston ’s Their Eyes Were Watching God .
Between them , Whitman and Dickinson have eclipsed the whole of 19th - century American poetry , particularly those three - named New Englanders who trafficked in regular rhymes and conventional poetic diction .
In short , this is not your father ’s literary canon , nor was it mine when I was coming of age .
It reflects the vast new interest in books by women and minority writers .
And it flourishes outside the classroom as well , in adult reading groups and book clubs , including Oprah ’s , which went from living writers like Toni Morrison to earlier works by Carson McCullers and Faulkner ; in repeated film and television adaptations ; in the PBS series American Masters , which recently profiled Cather and Hemingway ; and in the reassuringly uniform black volumes of The Library of America , which since 1982 has done more to establish the American canon than any other institution .
It advanced the novel idea that American writers have a real corpus of work , to be read whole , not simply a patchwork of isolated successes amid agonizing failures .
It challenged the truism that there are no second acts in American lives .
How did it happen that literary works that not long ago seemed provincial , even secondrate , came to be regarded as newly vital and compelling ?
In part it reflects the advance of the nation itself from a distant English province and a longtime bastion of isolationism to a world power .
Parts of the world have always appreciated American writers more than we have .
British readers lionized Whitman while he was still a disreputable figure here .
The French enthusiasm for Poe was succeeded by a passion for Faulkner , a warm welcome for Richard Wright , and a fascination with hardboiled film and fiction .
The Russians published Dreiser and Jack London in huge editions , in part because their work was politically acceptable but also because it was couched in a straightforward realism that invited translation .
Italian writers after World War II were deeply affected by Hemingway ; in the hands of Cesare Pavese or Natalia Ginzburg , the impact of his work transformed Italian as a literary language .
By the mid-20th century , the worldwide success of the new American writers and painters rebounded on their predecessors .
The triumph of abstract expressionism awakened wonder about styles as different as the landscape art of the Hudson River school and the dour realism of Homer , Eakins , and Hopper .
Faulkner and Hemingway lent a retrospective glow to Melville and Hawthorne .
There were always skeptics who saw only a crude , primitive vitality in American culture , but the rise of American power commanded new respect for the originality of American art .
By the end of the 20th century , the growth of what we now must see as an American empire led to spasms of imperial self - absorption .
The more our reach spread across the world , the less active interest we took in it .
Cheap travel and instant worldwide communication gave us access to every corner of the globe , yet we seemed less curious about how other people lived .
If we once felt like country cousins of European cultural traditions , more and more we began to show our arrogance , as if we had given birth to ourselves .
As the rest of the world worked hard at learning English , we largely stopped studying foreign languages .
We expected foreigners simply to become more like us , to speak our language , buy our technology , watch our movies and TV programs .
We adopted their culinary traditions but could grow annoyed when they stubbornly persisted in speaking their own language .
Literary translation , like film distribution , became a one - way street , from English to other languages .
The provinces were now somewhere else as foreign visitors flocked to our shores .
The inexorable course of modernization became synonymous with American influence across the globe .
Meanwhile , in the small world of literary scholars , art critics , and music critics , a new historical approach concentrating on the social context of art replaced a formal method that focused minutely on the works themselves .
American literary classics , mistrustful of old world influence , insecure about technique , rarely provided satisfactory material for a purely formal analysis .
Ours is a tradition rich in failed masterpieces — great or near - great books in which the writer lost courage or concentration before reaching the last page .
This faltering touch can be felt in works as divergent as The Scarlet Letter , The Portrait of a Lady , Huckleberry Finn , and A Modern Instance .
In this last book , perhaps Howells ’s most daring novel , the story ’s painful outcome — a failed marriage , abandonment , divorce — proved so disturbing that the author had a breakdown trying to finish it .
But many American writers made up for their aesthetic shortcomings with their sharp social insight , which has proved as engrossing to today ’s readers as it was off - putting to Trilling ’s de-radicalized generation .
Some of their current appeal is linked to politics — these writers were often matchless social critics — but their social views would not keep their books alive without genuine literary power .
While nothing they wrote offers an ultimate key to the American experience , since no such key could ever be found , their books shed light on many significant features of our history and national character .
If historians better understood how to use this material , they would find buried treasure in the American literary canon , where urgent and still - troubling social problems take on a lived reality .
No archival evidence could measure up to the vigorous treatment of immigrant life in Upton Sinclair ’s Junge , Cather ’s My Ántonia , or Henry Roth ’s Call It Sleep ; hardscrabble farm life in Hamlin Garland ’s Main - Travelled Roads ; John Steinbeck ’s Grapes of Wrath ; and James Agee ’s Let Us Now Praise Famous Men ; social mobility and the American dream in Howells ’s Rise of Silas Lapham and Fitzgerald ’s Great Gatsby ; slavery , of course , in Harriet Beecher Stowe ’s Uncle Tom ’s Cabin and Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass ; race in the work of Charles Chesnutt , Richard Wright , and many other writers ; marriage and divorce in A Modern Instance and Chopin ’s Awakening ; faith and doubt in Harold Frederic ’s once - famous Damnation of Theron Ware , which was one of Fitzgerald ’s favorite novels ; the cut - throat money society in Wharton ’s House of Mirth and Custom of the Country ; city life in innumerable novels from Howells , Crane , and Dreiser to Bellow .
One could go on and on .
During the years following World War II , critics , reacting against the committed literature of the 1930s , saw many of these novels as defective simply because they were social novels , as if they were deformed by an extra-literary agenda .
Today we no longer expect organic purity or structural perfection in works of art .
We have come to question the very separation implied by the idea of a canon .
We ’ve become more aware of the mixed intentions of the writer , the complexities of all representation , and the limits inherent in language itself .
Writers themselves could be eloquent about where they had fallen short .
Faulkner , at the peak of his form , insisted that he had failed four times over in the four sections of The Sound and the Fury , each written from a different point of view .
As readers we ’ve learned to appreciate works with all their flaws and contradictions , above all if they have something powerful to say to us , as many longneglected American classics still do .
We see them not as belonging to a select circle of masterpieces but as part of the long continuum of our cultural history .
A genuine sense of history is rare in America , where ( as Philip Rahv once complained ) nothing seems to last more than 10 years .
Moreover , in recent decades realist novels have become a battleground in what the philosopher Simon Blackburn calls the “ truth wars , ” test cases for the skepticism or relativism at the heart of postmodern literary theory .
Some gifted scholars see the novels of American realists as vessels of ideology , blinkered by the cultural assumptions of their moment .
They deny that literary works can convey the truth about anything , including their own subjects .
In The Social Construction of American Realism , one of the best of these critical studies , Amy Kaplan defends her interest in these writers , and their historical value , without defending the accuracy of anything they wrote :
If realism is a fiction , we can root this fiction in its historical context to examine its ideological force .
How does the fiction of the referent become a powerful rallying cry for some , a point of contention for others , and an assumption taken for granted by still other writers at the particular historical juncture of the 1880s and 1890s ?
How do literary texts produce a social reality that can be recognized as “ the way things are ” ?
Most readers , of course , are unconcerned about “ the fiction of the referent ” — that is , the illusion of actuality that these works convey .
Ordinary readers harbor the unfashionable notion that these works are really about something .
If a novel commands belief , or at least works well enough to suspend disbelief , readers are more than willing to follow where it leads , taking its people , its story , its milieu , and its social subjects as fully convincing .
They understand that novelists frame their subjects subjectively , not impartially , and that this selection , or distortion , is precisely what enables them to go beyond mere documentation and to generate meaning .
Accepting the identifications a good novel proposes to them , readers assimilate it as fiction at the same time they experience it as real , a process clever critics have belabored in vain .
Strong readers identify with the predicament of Lily Bart in The House of Mirth , Carrie Meeber in Sister Carrie , and Edna Pontellier in The Awakening without asking themselves whether things had to happen in just this way .
Indeed , one source of power in the American novel has been its reflection of a woman ’s point of view , not simply in women writers like Stowe , Jewett , Wharton , and Hurston but in key novels by men , including The Portrait of a Lady and Sister Carrie .
Leslie Fiedler once argued that all the great American novels were boys ’ books exploring male relationships , but this oft - repeated truism is confounded by most of the works mentioned here .
It would be no exaggeration to say that second - wave feminism contributed more to the opening of the American canon than any other influence .
In the end , the rediscovered works of American literature stand several cuts below the greatest books in the Western tradition .
Melville was a deep reader of Shakespeare , who lent fire and extravagance to Melville ’s language ; but in his range of sympathy he was no Shakespeare .
Howells ’s vast comédie humaine of American society cannot match Balzac or even Trollope on their own ground .
Uncle Tom ’s Cabin is Dickensian in its weaknesses as well as its strengths , achingly alive yet relying on sheer melodramatic intensity to tear at the heartstrings .
At the other extreme , Henry James had too much refinement and subtlety , too little saving vulgarity , ever to become a world classic .
Yet their books cannot fail to engage us as Americans , even as we are leery of any form of cultural nationalism .
When America was merely a remote province of world culture , its educated elites were Anglophile , Francophile , or broadly cosmopolitan .
Education was grounded in classical learning , a respect for the ancients over the moderns , and a deeply ingrained respect for old Europe ’s artistic heritage , though not its feudal and fratricidal politics .
Only a few American writers , like Emerson , Thoreau , Whitman , and Twain , were strong enough to emancipate themselves from this suffocating respect .
Now America itself has grown multicultural while the whole globe is being turned on its head by modernization , by the new politics of the post–Cold War era , and by the juggernaut of American popular culture .
When Alfred Stieglitz took up the cause of serious American art in the first decades of the 20th century , and when Aaron Copland did the same for American music in the ’30s and ’ 40s , they were engaged in an uphill struggle , for much of the world , including our audiences at home , were convinced that we had little to contribute .
In recent decades that battle has been won .
As the nation assumed its paramount role on the world stage , everything once belittled about the arts in America assumed far greater weight , at the same time that art itself was under siege .
But we need to take care that this newfound dominance does n’t make us provincial again , incurious about other cultures or trampling on what they have to offer , expecting them to fall in line and become more like our own .
PLUS : Did Palin attorney defame an ethics complainant in recent statement ?
Brad Friedman Byon 7/22/2009 , 2:12 pm PT
[ Update 7/24/09 : I chatted about the issues in this article with noted Mudlflats blogger & Huffington Post contributor AK Muckraker --- an expert on all things Palin --- while Guest Hosting Thursday 's Mike Malloy Show .
Listen to the interview right here .
Select Hour 3 audio archive .
Interview begins about 10 minutes into the archive . ]
A brief , two paragraph statement [ PDF ] by the private attorney of Alaska 's very - soon - to - be- former Gov. Sarah Palin was posted on the governor 's official public state website on Monday .
Attributed to " THOMAS VAN FLEIN --- Personal Attorney for Governor Palin , " the statement posted to the Governor 's officially run state website at www.gov.state.ak.us decries the latest ethics complaint filed against Palin --- alleging the improper disclosure of gifts and the receipt of free services --- as an abuse of the state Ethics Act .
That the official state website would be used to publicize the private response of Palin on Monday to another ethics charge is somewhat ironical , given Tuesday 's leak of a preliminary independent report [ PDF ] from a state ethics commission investigator finding " probable cause " that Palin's " official " legal defense fund violated the Ethics
Act in that it made use of her " official position for personal gain . "
Citing Alaska Statute 39.52.120 ( a ) which states that a " public officer may not use , or attempt to use , an official position for personal gain , " the state 's independent investigator , Thomas M. Daniel notes that " personal gain " is defined by law as " a benefit to a person 's or immediate family member 's personal interest or financial interest . "
Does the use of the state 's website to publicize Palin 's personal attorney 's response to an official ethics complaint constitute the use of " an official position for personal gain " ?
Was the complainant allowed to post her attorney 's response to the complaint , or to Palin 's personal response to it , on the official Alaska state website ?
Of course not .
Perhaps one more ethics complaint needs to be filed in Alaska before Palin quits her job as Governor this weekend .
We came across Monday 's publicly posted private response via a Monday night tweet on Palin 's personal Twitter page which linked to it :
But , as still more irony would have it , Palin and / or her attorney may have also committed a legally actionable act of defamation in their response to the leak of yesterday 's confidential " probable cause " finding ....
In attorney Van Flein 's statement responding to the leak of the report , as posted on Palin 's Facebook page yesterday , he may have defamed the complainant , Alaska resident Kim Chatman , by declaring , as fact , some action of hers to have been " illegal . "
" All options are open in terms of legal remedies , " Van Flein threatened , in response to his apparent belief , as ABC News characterized it , that Chatman is the one who leaked the confidential preliminary report .
" It is a clear violation of Alaska law that Mr. Daniel explicitly reviewed with Ms. Chatman prior to her illegal actions .
We will be contacting the appropriate authorities for review and action . "
It 's unclear whether Van Flein was asserting that the alleged " illegal action " of Chatman was the leak of the preliminary report , as ABC implies , and , if so , what his evidence is for that .
None is given .
But he has very clearly stated , as a fact , that Chatman committed " illegal actions . "
That is , of course , what Palin , via Van Flein , had inaccurately alleged about Alaska blogger and radio host Shannyn Moore , after she discussed rumors of a coming " iceberg scandal " that might sink the U.S.S. Palin --- as we reported here at the time --- shortly after Palin announced she would be aborting her term as Governor to , apparently , become a celebrity community organizer .
Trouble is , neither Moore , nor anybody else to our knowledge , ever stated that the rumored " iceberg " investigation --- believed to be into whether or not Palin misappropriated funds and / or materials and / or labor from the construction of the Wasilla Sports Complex for use in the construction of her Wasilla home on Lake Lucille , which was built during approximately the same period , as detailed last year by the Village Voice --- was a " fact " ( other than the general assertion that it was a fact that local Alaskans had been buzzing about those rumors for several weeks leading up to Palin 's surprise resignation announcement ) .
As Van Flein , who at the time described media reports of those allegations as " actionable , " wrote in his July 4th legal threat letter [ PDF ] in response :
To the extent several websites , most notably liberal Alaska blogger Shannyn Moore , are now claiming as " fact " that Governor Palin resigned because she is " under federal investigation " for embezzlement or other criminal wrongdoing , we will be exploring legal options this week to address such defamation .
This is to provide notice to Ms. Moore , and those who re-publish the defamation , such as Huffington Post , MSNBC , the New York Times and The Washington Post , that the Palins will not allow them to propagate defamatory material without answering to this in a court of law .
So while neither Moore , nor any other media that we 're aware of , " claim[ed ] as ' fact ' " that Palin was " under federal investigation , " Van Flein , on behalf of Palin , has now stated that a legal complainant , Kim Chatman , committed " illegal actions . "
Despite their widely reported threats and attempts at intimidation , as Moore and other local bloggers described it at the time , no lawsuits for " defamation " have yet been filed by the Palin team to date .
But it certainly seems that Chatman --- if , in fact , she did not leak the report , or break any other laws --- might well have a very good case of " defamation " to file against Palin at this point .

Pitching government control , President falsely accuses doctors of conspiring to make children sicker
WASHINGTON — Dr. Richard S. Kerr , M.D. , a West Virginia Libertarian Party member and a retired doctor with 36 years experience , asked President Barack Obama Thursday to apologize for comments made in his Wednesday night press conference accusing doctors of conspiring to make children sicker for profits .
‘ President Obama should be ashamed of himself for trying to scare Americans into supporting his government takeover of medicine by falsely accusing doctors of making children sicker .
I have never heard a more disgusting or blatantly phony conspiracy theory .
We treat our patients with the respect , care and concern you will never find in Obama ’s government - run rationed care bureaucracy , ’ said Dr. Kerr .
‘ On behalf of my colleagues , I respectfully ask President Obama to apologize for such a slanderous lie and ask him to stop engaging in sickening conspiracy theories to push his government - run scheme .
These cheap scare tactics are beneath the dignity of the office of The President and perfectly illustrate why more and more Americans are losing faith in Barack Obama . ’
In his Wednesday night press conference , Obama claimed , ‘… you come in and you ’ve got a bad sore throat , or your child has a bad sore throat or has repeated sore throats , the doctor may look at the reimbursement system and say to himself , you know what , I make a lot more money if I take this kid ’s tonsils out . ’
‘ For President Obama ’s information , pediatricians do not perform tonsillectomies .
If he does n’t know that , then he has no business centrally planning your family ’s health care , ’ said Dr. Kerr .

A comedian has grown a toothbrush moustache in an attempt to break its association with Adolf Hitler .
So how did people react and could it ever be fashionable ?
Herring says he could sense people judging him by his moustache Moustaches come in all sorts of styles but the sight of a toothbrush moustache , with its narrow width and straight , untapered sides , is very rare .
Since World War II it has not been popular , but long before Hitler rose to power , the toothbrush was the signature look of Charlie Chaplin .
Chaplin even played on his likeness to the German leader by sending him up in The Great Dictator , although when filming stopped his false moustache would be packed away with his trademark walking stick and hat .
Now comedian Richard Herring is sporting a toothbrush moustache for his Edinburgh show , Hitler Moustache , in which he rails against voter apathy and the BNP .
He first grew it more than three months ago and the first few days were very unsettling for him .
I felt quite afraid and a bit upset
Richard Herring
" As people passed they would start laughing about five yards behind me .
A group of lads called me ' Adolf ' .
I have n't had any sense of anger but I think some people were intimidated or scared . "
The moustache made him so paranoid about what judgements people were making that he shaved it off after the first week .
" I thought that at any moment someone might smack me in the face .
I was being judged by my appearance and being a white , middle - class man I 've never looked to draw attention to myself before .
" I felt quite afraid and a bit upset .
Then I wondered if I was upsetting anyone , and was it worth it if I had done . "
FAMOUS TOOTHBRUSHES
Robert Mugabe Abdalá Bucaram , former Ecuador president Grange Hill 's Mr Bronson ( pictured ) Oliver Hardy Blakey , in On The Buses His parents ' impending golden wedding celebrations gave him another excuse to shave it off but he grew it back with added purpose , because the BNP European election gains had given his forthcoming Edinburgh show - and his facial hair - a political focus .
" After I grew it back again , I knew that if anyone challenged me , I had a reason to give them .
" I was trying to reclaim it as a political protest against the BNP .
I 'm using the Hitler moustache to oppose fascism .
" It feels like a victory for Hitler that , 70 years on , he still has a vestige of a victory that this is still his moustache and not , for instance , Charlie Chaplin's . "
Gay skinhead
The toothbrush became popular in the 1920s , says Herring , as a response by working - class men to the more flamboyant , flowing Kaiser - style moustaches of the upper classes .
After his show , Herring supplies everyone in the audience with a fake toothbrush moustache , and he hopes to organise a day when , like a red nose for Comic Relief , everyone wears a narrow moustache to champion democracy and emphasise the important of voting .
" In order to change the meaning of a symbol , it requires a few people to go out and change opinions , in the way that gay men did with the skinhead .
Hitler trimmed his moustache in World War I so it could fit into a gas mask " I 'm not convinced it will work but people seem to be getting behind the idea .
I 'm not anticipating it becoming a fashionable thing again but it would be good if people could grow one without the fascist association . "
Since World War II there have been some notable toothbrush moustaches .
The late actor Michael Sheard was one of its most prolific exponents .
Not only did he bring it into the Grange Hill classroom as the authoritarian teacher Maurice Bronson from 1985 to 1989 , he also played Hitler five times .
There was also the former Ecuador president , Abdalá Bucaram .
' Very strange '
But style commentator Karen Kay says the chances of it ever becoming fashionable in the UK are very remote .
" It 's so comical .
The way it 's neat and rectangular .
Hair is n't meant to have square edges , it 's natural and flowing .
" At least if you are going to have one , make it curly and flowing , but to have a rectangular block on your lip is very strange . "
Perhaps a geeky comedian or singer could pull it off , she says , but no man should grow one to improve their attractiveness because the only man in history who has ever looked good with a moustache is Tom Selleck .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I was going through my grandfather 's belongings after he passed away and found various articles in local newspapers dated during WW2 - One of the front pages grabbed my attention as it was portraits of soldiers missing at Dunkirk - all but a few had a toothbrush moustache - seems ironic that this moustache is iconic with a man hated so much yet the brave men fighting against him had the same style .
Rob Breaks , London I went to Herring 's show and wore the fake moustache after - it was terrifying getting stared at .
I ended up giving directions in Edinburgh to an Eastern European .
My wife afterwards said it was hilarious because with all my pointing she said I actually looked like I was giving the ' Seig Heil ' when all I was doing was showing him where the castle was .
Nathan McIntosh , Rosyth , Fife I have been sporting a Hitler moustache most of my adult life , the fact that I cant grow proper facial hair causes me much ridicule is particularly unpleasant especially when you take into account my Jewish background .
Good on Richard .
Bring this look back into fashion .
Guy Nevett , Guiseley I understand the difficulty , which just makes my grandad 's decision to wear the exact same ' tache as Hitler and Chaplin throughout his entire life ( he died aged 89 in 1989 ) even more mystifying .
Not only that but he was a short , slight man and bore a remarkable resemblance to Hitler .
Did he not notice ?
Did no - one ever mention this to him ?
What was my grandmother thinking ?
He lived through both World Wars and even visited Germany in the 1930s as a schoolteacher and still thought a Hitler moustache was OK ... do n't get it .
Lesley , Hope Valley Pro-democracy day ?
Wear your toothbrush moustache with pride ?
Excellent stuff - bring it on .
I suggest 30 April - the day Hitler died .
Maybe every time the BNP hold a gathering then instead of turning up with those pointlessly vicious " anti-fascist " counter meetings , have everybody in town wear a Hitler moustache and stare at them silently with a manic glare .
The embarrassment would drive them mad and be the best possible weapon - social ridicule .
Anyone who has read the chapter on beating the Ku Klux Klan in the fine book " Freakanomics " will understand what I mean .
Des , Surrey I think it 's an admirable thing to do - if the toothbrush moustache is forever associated with Hitler , and is frowned upon as a result , then the man still has an influence over that very specific part of life .
By reclaiming the ' look ' , it becomes less a symbol of evil and more just a rubbish moustache .
Hitler should be remembered for his heinous acts , not his facial hair .
Liam , Manchester
In a free and tolerant society , I would hope people will not be judged by how they style their hair , or how they choose to dress .
To that end , I hope Mr Herring does not encounter any undue criticism or suspicion , and wish him success .
Of course , copying the appearance of those whom you admire is a common behaviour , so I suspect many will come to the wrong conclusion about why he 's sporting that moustache .
Graham Pound , Blackburn
You have missed probably the best toothbrush moustache of all from your list - Ron Mael of the band Sparks .
Chris Higginbottom , Belper , UK
The Hitler moustache should not be called the Hitler moustache anymore , but the Chaplin moustache - in recognition of Chaplin 's anti-fascist satire in the Great Dictator .
Phil Brand , London
It is totally futile to try and disassociate the toothbrush from Hitler , it will always be as is evident in this article .
Besides , why would you want to associate oneself with such a moustache anyway ?
It , in modern fashion , is quite frankly ridiculous and attempting to " claim back " such a piece of facial hair strikes me as petty , and more absurd than the moustache itself !
Stephen , Birmingham
Whilst I agree with your comment about perhaps only a singer or comedian can carry it off .
I think Freddie Mercury should also be up there with Tom Selleck .
Jim Goodacre , Pontyridd , Wales I applaud Richard Herring 's efforts to end Hitler 's association with the toothbrush moustache .
I ( along with many others ) have long been fighting a similar fight , that of reclaiming the ancient symbol of peace and good fortune that was appropriated by the Nazis , the Swastika .
We really should try to remember things for positive reasons rather than negative and I firmly believe that with enough exposure both the Swastika and the toothbrush moustache could be bought back into polite society .
Matt Martin , Glastonbury
My grandfather used to shave with a straight razor .
Just watching him shave under his nose with a cut throat razor , where the angle of the blade is into the flesh , was a terrifying experience .
He never wanted a ' tache but he would have grown a toothbrush just to spare his top lip .
This , he told me so it must be true , is how the toothbrush ' tache came about .
The only reason he did not leave that bit unshaven was because that is what Hitler did .
He never did get the hang of safety razors and used the cut throat till he died ( of heart failure rather than a cut throat which always looked likely ) .
Harry , Manchester , England
Why is it that a square tuft of hair above the upper lip is deemed unacceptable and unattractive , but a square tuft of hair under the lower lip is all the rage amongst " the young people " ?
Rebecca Haywood , Hastings Dennis
The Menace 's Dad in The Beano has one , at least he did when I read it from 1984 - 92 .
Richard Davies , Stockport Will Mr Herring now be calling his kids Adolf and Eva ?
Should n't we be similarly " reclaiming " these names ?
Mike , London
While I laud Herring 's attempt to reclaim the toothbrush moustache , I feel that the choice of title for his show - " Hitler Moustache " - is perhaps a little self - defeating .
Gerard O'Brien , Belfast Hello !?
Anybody seen those countless early Monty Python sketches , mostly Palin and Cleese , sporting the famous Hitler lip wear ?

Hartmut Esslinger 's Frog Design made WEGA / Sony 's electronics fetish items , and then designed the " Snow White " language the Mac used .
He 's a design legend and an author .
Here he tells us about the challenges of designing , then and now .
Advertisement
How did you shift from entertainment products to personal computers ?
Did you seek them out or were you pulled in ?
And were there others besides Apple ?
Was there a chance you might have ended up sharing your Snow White design language with some other company , turning a competitor of Apple into the iconic " cool computer " maker of the day ?
My second client in 1970 was the German company CTM , an offspring of Nixdorf , back then a leader in making data processing affordable and usable to mid-size companies .
They were quite successful and together we created the first ergonomic desktop terminal with a tilting display and detached keyboard in 1978 which won international acclaim .
Advertisement
Apple 's " Snow White " design language was the result of a very close relationship and collaboration with Apple , and ultimately expressed the very specific values and aspirations of Apple .
The key was that Steve Jobs wanted " the very best design , not only in the computer industry but the entire World " .
This allowed us to create a totally new design paradigm for " digital - convergent products " without historic precedence .
How have product considerations evolved in the same time ?
What was the 1979 equivalent of hardware vs. software ?
Or physical button vs. touch surface ?
Let 's take Sony as an example : as of 1976 , we were working on remote controls for multiple sources from TV to Audio - Systems and " Home - Control " with software screens , activated both by buttons and direct - touch .
Even as the key problem – aside of cost - was slow processing power and LCD screens with little contrast .
Our objective was to simplify usage and some products went into the market in Japan .
So to your answer : we already had it in 1979 .
Advertisement
What design trends were hot in the late 1970s that are coming back around now ?
Which trends from the 1970s will NEVER come back ?
The late 1970s were very much defined by the shock of the oil crisis and the subsequent recession especially here in the United States .
In Europe and Japan , there was a wider acceptance of energy - saving and ecologically responsible product strategies .
The hot design trends were " personalization and miniaturization " – SONY 's Walkman being the best manifestation – and with the Japanese domination of electronic consumer electronics making professional - grade technology – e.g. cameras - accessible and affordable to millions .
This also was a time , when the United States lost out big time in this field .
The late 1970s also were the " Golden Age " of product design – and this trend will return for product experiences and hyper - convergence – which means to design how people feel .
Advertisement
Is n't part of design envisioning products that use technology that does n't yet exist ?
What were the sorts of things you envisioned in the 1970s that are commonplace today but did n't yet exist ?
What are you envisioning now ( or what have you envisioned lately ) that will take some time for technology to catch up ?
This may sound a bit arrogant , but in 1968 I proposed an " Atomic - Time Radio - Wristwatch " for a watch competition .
People laughed at it , but in 1986 frog designed exactly such a product for the German Junghans company .
Advertisement
Sometimes , technology surpasses human speed : today we are using mobile phones with more computing power then could be imagined 20 years ago – and even science fiction authors like William Gibson or Arthur C. Clarke did n't even anticipate them – but the user interfaces are split into " old- phone - physical " and " agnostic - digital " ( Apple 's iPhone succeeds because it is the first product to bridge this idiotic chasm ) .
Looking a the future , I think that technology and our body will grow closer together – a couple of years ago , we designed " Dattoos " , the vision of a protein - based computer " living " on human skin .
Closer to reality are concepts of enhancing brain activities by electro - magnetic impulses .
Already , design is expanding from " bits and atoms " to " neurons and genes " – one could call it BANG - Design .
Advertisement
Were there times when companies were afraid to go as far as you wanted them to ?
Are there any examples of companies that refused to make design improvements — perhaps because of cost — and paid a larger price for that ?
Strategic design is not about " going as far as possible " but about " going the best way together " .
As said above with the Apple Snow White example , the interactive relationship between client and designer is a vital element for success or failure .
So , even as I may push for more advanced solutions , the client may have many reasons not to follow .
At the end of a day , each jointly achieved result shall be a healthy compromise , motivated by achieving the best for the user and / or consumer .
Naturally , there are some negative examples where I could n't convince clients , which I also describe in my book : Polaroid which stuck too long to chemical image creation , Maytag which refused to innovate in a strategic way and Motorola which missed the opportunity to create the iPhone long before Apple did .

John Hartigan laments how bloggers are not sent to jail like in China or Burma
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , July 1 , 2009
A stinging attack by John Hartigan , the CEO of Rupert Murdoch ’s News Limited , labels bloggers and alternative media outlets as “ political extremists ” .
Hartigan implies that bloggers should be jailed as they are in oppressive police states like China and Burma .
In a speech to the National Press Club , Hartigan savagely dismissed blogs as , “ Something of such little intellectual value as to be barely discernible from massive ignorance . ”
“ Bloggers do n’t go to jail for their work .
They simply are n’t held accountable like real reporters … .
It could be said the blogosphere is all eyeballs and no insights , ” barked Hartigan .
“ In the blogosphere , of course , the mainstream media is always found wanting .
It really is time this myth was blown apart . ”
“ Blogs , and a large number of comment sites , specialise in political extremism and personal vilification .
Radical sweeping statements without evidence are common . ”
Hartigan does n’t seem to grasp the fact that the mainstream media is always found wanting because they habitually lie about news events and spin stories to suit the demands of their corporate owners .
This is the very reason why blogs and alternative media outlets have become so popular and have eaten into the mainstream media ’s audience share , because people are sick of being treated like idiots , sick of being lied to , and are desperately in search of the truth .
Indeed , Hartigan ’s boss Rupert Murdoch confessed to the fact that his media empire tried to shape public opinion to support the war in Iraq
In other words , Murdoch ’s many prominent news outlets wantonly put out propaganda supporting the manufactured case for invasion .
Murdoch admitted to this while lamenting the corporate media ’s “ loss of power ” to alternative media and Internet blogs , seemingly unaware of the fact that the two are directly connected .
When the people know that the corporate media is deliberately lying to them about Niger yellowcake and weapons of mass destruction , they are going to seek alternative avenues of information .
The fact that the corporate media habitually lies is a manifestly provable reality , not a “ myth ” as Hartigan ludicrously claims .
In addition , while mainstream media routinely uses anonymous sources and little more than bluster and hot air to back up their stories , blogs provide links to almost every claim they make so readers can research the source evidence for themselves .
This is the opposite from Hartigan ’s claim that blogs make “ radical sweeping statements without evidence . ”
Indeed , this phrase perfectly characterizes tactics employed by the mass media on a daily basis .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The corporate media monopoly has terminal cancer and they are losing their power to blogs and alternative media , which is why people like Hartigan are so angry and also why the establishment is aggressively moving to phase out the old Internet altogether and replace it with “ Internet 2 , ” a highly regulated and controlled electronic Berlin wall , where alternative voices will be silenced and giant corporate propaganda organs will dominate once again .
As blogger Darryl Mason writes today , “ John Hartigan is full of shit .
Bloggers have gone to jail for their work , and to protect their sources , in North Korea , Iran , Egypt , the list of countries persecuting bloggers grows longer by the week .
And the CEO of Australia ’s biggest news corporation does n’t know this ? ”
The jailing of bloggers for speaking too much truth is obviously not the kind of news that John Hartigan , a Rupert Murdoch CEO , is interested in .
How could he not know about those jailing and prosecutions .
Remember those words .
“ Political extremism ” .
You will hear that call more and more as the major news corporations scale up their war against independent media , and bloggers .
The source of the establishment ’s move to claim that bloggers and alternative media outlets are “ extremists ” or at worst “ terrorists , ” as we first reported in September 2006 , was a White House strategy document that the government had been following since 9/11 .
In a September 5 , 2006 speech President George W. Bush referred to the document as “ an unclassified version of the strategy we ’ve been pursuing since September the 11th , 2001 , ” that takes into account , “ the changing nature of this enemy . ”
The strategy paper on how to ‘ win the war on terror ’ cites “ conspiracies ” as one of the wellsprings of terrorism and threatens to “ address ” and “ diminish ” the problems they are causing the government in fulfilling their agenda .
This notion then reappeared in a March 2009 Homeland Security document entitled “ Domestic Extremism Lexicon , ” in which the “ alternative media ” is listed alongside other radical extremist groups with the implication that people who disagree with the mass media ’s version of events are potential domestic terrorists .
According to World Net Daily , the DHS document was almost immediately rescinded , but the groups listed alongside Neo - Nazis , Aryan prison gangs and black power extremists again prove that the federal government is targeting American citizens who are merely knowledgeable about their rights and up on current issues as potential domestic terrorists to be treated as a “ threat ” to law enforcement .

A Spinvox customer claims to have been contacted by a call centre
The voicemail - to - text service Spinvox has applied for two patents which describe the service as being operated by humans , the BBC has learned .
Spinvox has previously claimed that state - of - the - art speech recognition technology is the basis of its service .
However , its patent applications claim the approach is accurate precisely because it employs human operators .
Spinvox 's head of social media said that the patents were just two among many for which the firm had applied .
The BBC has also learned that an employee of a call centre in Pakistan tagged his own appeal onto a Spinvox message sent to a US customer , claiming that workers there had not been paid .
Spinvox has always maintained that humans only play a minor role in converting voice messages into text .
Both patent applications were lodged in the United States in the name of Daniel Doulton , the company 's co-founder .
The first , which was filed originally in 2004 , describes a " method of providing voicemails to a wireless information device " .
It says an operator " intelligently transcribes the actual message from the original voice message " , and concludes that " because human operators are used instead of machine transcription , voicemails are converted accurately , intelligently , appropriately and succinctly into text messages . "
The second application , which appears to be dated July 2nd 2009 , describes a similar system , but goes into more detail .
It says " the task of constructing voice recognition software that can reliably and accurately recognise natural speech ... remains a daunting one . "
But it says Spinvox 's invention challenges the orthodoxy by using human operators .
The idea that agents only hear ' specific parts ' of the message always seemed far - fetched

When queried about one of these patents by a commentator on the firm 's blog , Spinvox 's head of social media James Whatley said it was just one among many .
" Spinvox has an entire family of over 70 patents currently residing at international patent offices and many of them have different purposes for their application / submission , " he said .
" The one you quote sits firmly under the umbrella of ' the strategic patent ' .
Generic patents help us build different combinations - i.e. : Humans interacting with machines - to prevent any other companies doing similar things in the long term . "
' Real trouble ' Meanwhile Jason Sewell , a Spinvox customer from Virginia in the US , said he received an email from the service this March that included an audio file of a voicemail message for him .
The text read : " We are employees of Spinvox .
Since voicemail to text message service has started by Spinvox we are converting your messages here in Pakistan . "
It invited him to ring a number in Pakistan and concluded " You can confirm please we are in real trouble .
Please for God sake . "
Mr Sewell told BBC
News that a friend rang the number on his behalf and was told the workers at the call centre were angry because they had not been paid for two months .
The BBC has asked Spinvox to comment on the patent issue and on Mr Sewell 's story .

In addressing the unemployment situation it is important to look at the velocity of job losses .
In January of 2009 we had a stunning 741,000 jobs lost in one month .
This by far was the biggest one month cut during the current recession but it was n’t the biggest one month change .
The worst month came in November of 2008 when we saw a net increase of 217,000 more job cuts in one month from the previous month .
With 26,000,000 Americans unemployed or underemployed it is important to understand how the job market data is calculated .
Last week the market sold off heavily not so much on the unemployment rate which ticked up to 9.5 percent but more on the net monthly change in the severity of job cuts .
In fact , prior to last month we had four consecutive months where each subsequent month seemed to get a little bit better .
In most cases this is called the second derivative but the June data put any notion of this trend to an end .
I have put together job data for the recession :
From this employment data you get a clear picture of what is occurring .
Since November of 2008 to April of 2009 each month saw 500,000 + job losses .
This was significant .
The drop in the May data was big not so much for the 322,000 jobs lost but because it was the biggest monthly change on the downside for the entire recession .
That is , from April to May we saw a 197,000 shift .
Yet that was washed away in the June data .
With recent market volatility it is understandable that the market is tracking the employment data carefully .
If we plot this data you have a better visual of the trend :
Since the recession started in December of 2007 some 6.4 million jobs have been officially lost .
The last time we saw this severity in jobs losses was back in the 1950s :
Keep in mind that we are using data from June 2008 to June 2009 .
What this means is we are including June , July , and August of 2008 which had sub 200,000 job loss months .
Once we hit September data , the 12 month percent change will surely put us into the record books .
Since September of 2008 the average job loss per month is 536,000 .
What the latest employment report tells us is that the economy is still on shaky ground given that this is now playing out like a minor depression .
The 9.5 percent unemployment rate understates the gigantic number of people now working part - time but looking for full - time work :
Since the start of the recession those working part - time for economic reasons went from 4.6 million to 8.9 million .
Keep in mind that these people are counted as employed with the headline 9.5 percent unemployment rate .
These could be people working 10 or 15 hours a week making up for a full - time job they just lost .
Given the large size of this population , it is an important caveat to keep in mind when we hear the headline figures rattled off .
Initial unemployment claims remain stubbornly high above the 600,000 mark .
This is another good indicator to look at to see whether employment is improving .
Unfortunately the severity might have slowed a bit simply because employers are n’t hiring any other people .
That is , job cuts might slow in the next few months but signs of hiring are nowhere to be found .
The latest data shows 5 people that are unemployed are competing for each 1 job opening .
The UI claims show how quickly things have changed :
Until we get to roughly 400,000 initial claims per week any recovery talk is premature .
The second derivate is absolutely vital for the average American family who has seen their net worth obliterated by the multi- decade housing bubble and simultaneous stock market bubble .
Many are now looking at employment for any signs of a turn around .

Die Piratenpartei hat mit ihrem Achtungserfolg bei der Europawahl auf sich aufmerksam gemacht .
Jetzt muss sich zeigen , ob sie die so gewonnene Aufmerksamkeit für sich auch bei der Bundestagswahl nutzen kann .
ARD - Wahlexperte Jörg Schönenborn wägt im tagesschau.
de - Interview ihre Chancen ab .
tagesschau.de : Eine Partei , die mit dem Thema Internet und vielen jungen Leuten erfolgreich startet - das ist die Piratenpartei .
Sind sie die neuen Grünen ?
Jörg Schönenborn sieht gute Voraussetzungen , aber auch zahlreiche Hindernisse für die Piratenpartei .
Jörg Schönenborn : Das ist gleich die schwierigste Frage vorneweg .
Die Piratenpartei ist unter den Kleinstparteien sicherlich eine , die bessere Voraussetzungen hat als viele andere .
Aber die Grünen stehen natürlich für eine politische Erfolgsgeschichte , die nicht mit einem Thema anfing .
Die Grünen waren die Friedenspartei , die Anti-Atompartei , die Ökopartei und ein wenig die Anti-Kapitalismuspartei .
Insofern hinkt der Vergleich .
tagesschau.de : Inwiefern hat die Piratenpartei bessere Voraussetzungen ?
Schönenborn : Zum einen wenden sie sich an eine bestimmte Zielgruppe , nämlich junge , besser gebildete Menschen .
Das ist eine Gruppe , unter denen es viele Politikinteressierte gibt , die auf dem gegenwärtigen Parteienmarkt nichts finden , was sie gerne wählen wollen .
Für diese Zielgruppe gibt es ein Angebotsvakuum .
Darüber hinaus ist das Internet als Mobilisierungsmedium bei deutschen Wahlen bisher ein Totalausfall .
Und eine Partei , die speziell eine Internetklientel anspricht , hat da natürlich alle Chancen .
tagesschau.de :
Hat die Piratenpartei denn eine Chance , über die von Ihnen genannte Zielgruppe hinaus Wähler zu gewinnen ?
Schönenborn : Politische Erfolgsgeschichten fangen in der Regel mit einem festen Fundament an .
Wenn man sich die Ergebnisse der Europawahl anschaut , dann ist zu sehen : Die Wähler der Piratenpartei sind zu zwei Dritteln männlich , bis 35 Jahre alt , gut gebildet und leben in Großstädten .
Zur Person Jörg Schönenborn ist Fernsehchefredakteur des WDR und ARD - Wahlexperte .
Seit 1999 moderiert er bei Landtagswahlen , Bundestagswahlen und Europawahlen .
Jeweils am ersten Donnerstag des Monats präsentiert Jörg Schönenborn in Zusammenarbeit mit den Meinungsforschern von Infratest dimap den ARD - Deutschland - Trend in den tagesthemen .
Wenn man eine Zielgruppe so klar erfasst , dann hat man in den anderen Zielgruppen auch Schwierigkeiten .
Die kann man nur überwinden , wenn die eigene Politik auch in der Öffentlichkeit sichtbar wird .
Und das ist bei der Piratenpartei bisher nicht der Fall , von der Präsenz im Internet einmal abgesehen .
tagesschau.de :
Sie meinen also , neue Zielgruppen erschließen sich erst dann , wenn die Partei in Parlamente und Bürgerschaften einzieht ?
Die Piratenpartei will in den Bundestag .
Schönenborn : Alle Beispiele , die wir dafür in Deutschland haben , beginnen in kleinen Parlamenten .
Die NPD , die Ende der sechziger Jahre fast in den Bundestag gekommen wäre , hat erst Landtage erobert .
Die Grünen haben ebenfalls erst Landtage erobert , bevor sie in den Bundestag kamen .
Viele kleine Parteien , wie die Statt - Partei , haben zuerst eine kleine Basis gehabt , die ihnen Aufmerksamkeit gesichert hat .
Die Bundestagswahl ist selbst bei schlechter Wahlbeteiligung eine Wahl mit 45 Millionen Wählern .
Das heißt , um fünf Prozent der Stimmen zu erreichen , braucht eine Partei rund 2,5 Millionen Wähler oder mehr .
Das sind zehn Mal so viele Stimmen , wie die Piratenpartei bei der Europawahl gehabt hat .
Das ist eine gigantische Zahl , die man aus dem Stand eigentlich nicht erreichen kann .
tagesschau.de : Ein Prozent - das ist das Ziel , das die Piratenpartei für die Bundestagswahl ausgegeben hat .
Wird sie dieses Ziel ebenso verfehlen wie die Fünf - Prozent - Hürde ?
Schönenborn : Ich habe die Fünf - Prozent - Hürde genannt , weil das Erreichen dieser Marke Aufmerksamkeit sichert .
Parteien , die den Sprung ins Parlament schaffen , haben immer auch eine Basis in der Öffentlichkeit .
Voraussetzung für ein gutes Ergebnis wäre aus meiner Sicht , dass sie das eher natürlich zugewachsene Internet für eine Kampagne nutzt .
Es müsste so etwas wie eine Welle im Netz zu Gunsten dieser Partei beginnen .
tagesschau.de : Sehen Sie diese Welle schon in Ansätzen ?
Schönenborn : Ich sehe sie im Moment , soweit ich das beobachte , lediglich in einer ohnehin schon interessierten Szene .
Der Kreis der Interessierten ist zwar klar auszumachen , was auf allen Märkten immer ein Riesenvorteil ist , aber es ist trotz allem eine Zielgruppe , die man mit der Lupe anschauen muss .
tagesschau.de : Die Europawahl gilt als Spielwiese der Wähler .
Das Wahlverhalten bei der Bundestagswahl ist ein anderes .
Schönenborn : Das ist richtig .
Es gibt eine Wahl , bei der sich die Deutschen schwer tun , die Stimme als Protestzettel zu benutzen - und das ist die Bundestagswahl .
Seit den siebziger Jahren sind es wirtschafts - und sozialpolitische Fragen , die bei dieser Wahl die entscheidende Rolle spielen .
Über die bisherigen Wähler der Piratenpartei wissen wir hingegen , dass die Stichwörter innere Sicherheit und Datensicherheit die Kernthemen sind .
Ich bin mir nicht sicher , ob es genug Menschen gibt , die am Wahltag sagen , diese Themen sind mir wichtiger als mein Arbeitsplatz , meine Rente , meine Einkommensverhältnisse .
tagesschau.de :
In der letzten Zeit gab es einige Schlagzeilen im Zusammenhang mit dem Bundestagsabgeordneten Jörg Tauss , Ex-SPD - und mittlerweile Mitglied der Piratenpartei , gegen den die Staatsanwaltschaft Anklage im Zusammenhang mit Kinderpornografie erheben will .
Ist er für die Piratenpartei ein Gewinn oder ein Problem ?
Schönenborn : Das ist schwer abzuschätzen .
Zuerst erscheint er als Problem , da der Verdacht , unter dem er steht , nie für gute Schlagzeilen sorgt .
Auf der anderen Seite ist natürlich denkbar , dass die Personalie Tauss wieder in den Hintergrund gerät , aber die Erinnerung an eine Partei bleibt , von der viele vorher nicht gehört hatten .
Es gibt im Nachrichtengeschäft den zynischen Satz : " Hauptsache der Name ist richtig geschrieben . "
Wenn es also etwas Gutes gibt an dieser Debatte , dann sicherlich , dass die Piratenpartei erwähnt wird .
Würde jedoch in absehbarer Zeit gewählt , wäre es ein ziemlicher Ballast .
tagesschau.de : Die Piratenpartei ist geprägt durch eine individualistische Parteiarbeit , die oft von zu Hause , vom Computer aus über das Internet stattfindet .
Glauben Sie , dass sich in dieser Partei Strukturen herausbilden können , die eine Parteiarbeit im konventionellen Sinne ermöglichen ?
Schönenborn :
In der Politik gilt , wie in vielen anderen Lebensbereichen auch : Erfolg nährt den Erfolg .
Ich glaube , die Bereitschaft von vielen Anhängern , sich über das Schreiben von E - Mails und Blogtexten hinaus zu engagieren , braucht eine Erfolgsbasis .
Das kann eine Aufwärtsspirale sein , wenn es eine Erfolgsgeschichte wird .
Wenn die engagierten Anhänger nachkommen , dann wird es auch irgendwann Strukturen geben .
Doch der erste Schritt zum Erfolg ist der allerschwierigste .
Und man darf nicht unterschätzen , wie hoch diese Hürde für diese Partei ist , selbst ihre selbstgesetzte Hürde bei der Bundestagswahl von einem Prozent der Stimmen .
tagesschau.de : Warum ist die Aufmerksamkeit auch der Medien für diese Partei eigentlich so groß - im Vergleich zu anderen Parteien ähnlicher Größe ?
Was macht die Piratenpartei so sexy ?
Schönenborn : Der Name ist natürlich sehr sexy .
Der bleibt im Gedächtnis und ist kein schlechter Marketinggag .
Aber ich glaube darüber hinaus , dass sie Aufmerksamkeit auf ein Thema lenkt , das viele Menschen noch nicht als Problem wahrgenommen haben .
Mir fällt als Vergleich dazu die Partei Die Grauen ein .
Es gab eine Zeit in den Neunziger Jahren , als diese Gruppe um Trude Unruh große Aufmerksamkeit erregte und man dieser Partei auch durchaus einiges zutraute .
Einige Achtungserfolge hat sie ja auch gehabt .
Damals waren
Themen wie die Vernachlässigung der älteren Generation oder der Gewalt in der Pflege in der Gesellschaft noch nicht im Bewusstsein verankert .
Für das Thema Freiheit im Internet gilt das heute genauso .
Viele Menschen , die das Netz täglich nutzen , sind sich nicht darüber im Klaren , dass dort alte Spielregeln nicht automatisch gelten .
tagesschau.de : Werden die etablierten Parteien die Themen der Piratenpartei irgendwann schlucken - so wie es teilweise den Grünen und ihrem Thema Ökologie passiert ist ?
Und wird die Piratenpartei so überflüssig werden ?
Schönenborn : Dafür sind einzelne Ziele im Moment noch zu umstritten .
Da bin ich eher skeptisch , weil es in der Sache momentan häufig um radikale Positionen geht .
tagesschau.de :
Und wenn einzelne Aspekte des Themas , beispielsweise die Debatte um Killerspiele , oder generell die Datensicherheit im Internet , von den Innenpolitikern der etablierten Parteien mehr thematisiert würden ?
Jörg Schönenborn : Junge Politiker der etablierten Parteien könnten vielleicht diese Themen aufgreifen .
Doch die Chance , dass Fragen des Datenschutzes in die allererste Reihe der politischen Themen kommen , ist gering , da die Fragen nach Rentenerhöhungen oder nach Mehrwertsteuersenkungen viel publikumswirksamer sind .
Politik wird in Berlin häufig auf der Sachebene in klugen Ausschüssen gemacht .
Vielleicht besteht die größte Chance der Piratenpartei darin , dass sie junge Politiker in den etablierten Parteien zur Sachkunde ermuntert .
Insofern könnte in der Sachpolitik am Ende doch die ein oder andere Spur übrig bleiben .
Das Interview führte Fabian Grabowsky , tagesschau.de .
I 'm so furious about this attempt to scare seniors , because it 's so close to home :
My mother just died Sunday .
We talked with my parents about all kinds of these issues in advance - but they also changed their mind about some things as they got closer to the end .
My mother died peacefully in her sleep , exactly as she wanted .
My father , on the other hand , died of cancer in the hospital , talked out of the home hospice care he would have preferred by his " pro-life " activist physician .
( " You do n't want that , they 're a little too free with the drugs . "
You know , because God forbid you die a few hours sooner . )
Two days before my father died , I literally had to push his doctor up against the wall and harangue him to get him to authorize the morphine he needed .
And you know what this tin god did ?
He left an order for morphine pills " on request . "
( Dad could no longer swallow , and was in so much pain , he was in and out of consciousness . )
I found out the next morning and told the nurse to get him on the phone .
The weenie had his associate call back instead , and he said he could n't override the other doctor 's instructions .
" As long as I have you on the phone , I have another question , " I said sweetly .
" Dr. X also left instructions that my dad was to be resuscitated , and he told us he did n't want that .
My mother says that 's not her signature on the request , so it seems to me we have something of a legal problem here . "
All of a sudden , he became quite helpful and offered to prescribe a morphine IV for my father .
Now , I 'm a fighter , and I 'm effective .
But not everyone is , especially when a parent is dying .
And some of those seniors have no family left to fight for them .
So regular counseling about this would be a very , very good thing .
And the people who are using it to frighten seniors for their own political benefit ( or a talk - radio paycheck ) should rot in hell .

A stunning report from Channel 4 on Israeli soldiers confessing to using civilians as human shields , and firing phosphorous into houses during the Gaza invasion earlier this year :
Team bosses are all now signed up to compete in next season 's campaign Ferrari and the rest of the teams in the Formula 1 Teams ' Association ( Fota ) have submitted conditional entries for the 2010 championship .
Williams announced on Monday that they intend to enter next season 's campaign .
McLaren , BMW Sauber , Toyota , Renault , Red Bull Racing , Toro Rosso , Brawn GP and Force India have now followed suit .
However , the teams have only signed up to the new season on the condition that they are able to operate on the basis of current technical regulations .
The teams and the sport 's governing body , the FIA , have been at odds in recent weeks over plans to introduce an optional budget cap in 2010 .
The teams have tried to meet ( FIA president ) Max Mosley halfway on this one - it remains to be seen now if he agrees to their terms
BBC Five Live's F1 commentator David Croft
Those teams who pledged to keep costs under £ 40 m a season would be allowed greater technical freedom than those outside of the budget cap , but many of the teams felt the cap was far too strict , fearing it would create a two - tier championship .
Ferrari , Renault , Red Bull and Toyota all threatened to pull out of the sport if the budgetary restrictions were to be forced through .
It prompted a crisis meeting between Fota and the FIA a fortnight ago , talks which failed initially to provide an acceptable compromise .
But at a meeting at the Monaco Grand Prix last week , it was agreed in principle to delay the cap until 2011 , while motorsport boss Max Mosley has made other concessions to the teams on governance .
And it appears enough progress has now been made on that to convince teams to sign up to the new season - on the condition that a new financial agreement with F1's management is reached by 12 June .
606 : DEBATE
Still think the FIA will knock one of the big teams out of the championship next season .
I think Toyota could be the one 's that get refused entry
Hammydigrassi
" It could be the end ( of the budget cap row ) but we wo n't know for certain until the FIA publish its list of accepted teams and drivers for the 2010 championship on 12 June , " reported BBC Five Live 's F1 commentator David Croft .
" At the moment , it 's the current 10 teams plus Prodrive , USF1 and the Campos team from Spain .
Those teams will be offered technical assistance from the current entrants who , in return for that , want a sliding scale of cost - cutting .
" That means instead of a £ 40 m cap next year , say a spend of around £ 80 m that reduces to somewhere around £ 40 m by 2011 .
" The teams have tried to meet Max Mosley halfway on this one - it remains to be seen now if he agrees to their terms . "
A statement on behalf of Fota said : " Fota confirms all its members ' long - term commitment to be involved in the FIA Formula 1 World Championship .
" It has unanimously agreed further and significant actions to substantially reduce the costs of competing in the championship in the next three years . "
The FIA now has until 12 June to confirm its intentions .
Toyota Motorsport boss , and Fota vice - chairman John Howett , believes his team 's intention to commit to Formula
One for the next three years ends the speculation regarding their future in the sport .
" It is Toyota 's sincere wish to be part of Formula 1 in 2010 , and the conditions attached to our entry , if agreed , would enable us to commit to the sport until the end of 2012 , " confirmed Howett .
" As explained in the Fota statement , our entry is conditional upon the specific conditions which have been outlined being satisfied .
" We are optimistic we can work productively with the Federation to build a solid foundation for the future of Formula 1 , based on lasting stability and sound governance . "

I remember the first “ blushda ” video lesson back before youtube was even out .
It was in wmv format ( those were the days ) .
Well some years later we ’re still doing it , albeit with better gear and more bandwidth all around .
This lesson is about a cool rudiment that you can do a lot with .
Enjoy !

Since I was first introduced to Dave DiCenso ’s drumming a couple of years ago , he has easily become one of my all time favorite drummers .
He has a unique combination of chops , groove , and feel .
He clearly gets the language of drumming and knows hot to tell stories with it .
His first book has been released here on Alfred Publishing ’s web site .
Entitled “ Universal Rhythms for Drumset ” , Dave describes in detail more about the book here on his web site .
As disappointed as I am that Dave has n’t made a video instead , I ca n’t help but recommend his book .
With right instructions it helps decrease the appetite and stimulates the desire for Buy Phentermine Online exercising .
Good luck with the book Dave .
You deserve it .

The first demo of DaggerXL is now out , to read about it and download go to the Downloads page .
While several features are still missing , this establishes a good amount of the dungeon crawling gameplay .
This includes :
Stat system with character screen ; inventory system with inventory screen ; basic ( incomplete ) UI ; looting treasure and bodies as well as the ability to drop items ; melee combat using stats , armor , weapon , skills , enemy stats ( such as AC ) and types of swings made ( different mouse movements ) to determine the outcome ; enemy AI and movement ; collision and player physics ; interactive objects such as elevators , switches and doors ; and lighting and authentic rendering .
Other game play features missing in this demo will continue to be worked on as I approach the second demo which will include a different environment – the city !
So try out the demo but remember to read the directions first .
Daggerfall must be fully patched to play because DaggerXL uses data from the data files and the executable itself .
Update : A new version of the demo has been released , visit the download page to get it .
Fixes and changes :
The crashes are fixed .
Looting range has been fixed .
Looting bodies and treasure piles should work much better now .
The inverted stab / overhead swing are fixed .
The FOV matches Daggerfall much better now .
CPU_Light mode has been added .
VSync can now be enabled .
A God Mode cheat has been added to help with testing .
Custom control bindings can be setup .
An experimental extended feature has been implemented – Fake Bumpmapping .

Connotative Use / Meaning420 is a phreak 's ( and not just a hippie 's ) favorite number for a variety of reasons , or maybe for no reason at all , but colloquially the number says pot -- " let 's smoke pot " , or " someone 's smoking pot " , or " gee , i really like pot " , or " time to smoke pot " , either by time ( 4:20 a.m. or p.m. ) , date ( April 20th ) , or otherwise ( e.g. State Route 420 ) .
April 20th at 4:20 is marked by annual events in Mount Tamalpais , CA ( an informal gathering ) ; Marin Conty , CA ( the 420 Hemp Fest ) ; Ann Arbor , MI ( the Hash Bash ) ; and Washington , D.C. ( buildup towards the July 4th Smoke - In ) .
Original Source(s ) Conventional wisdom :
The most common tale is that 420 is the police radio code or criminal code ( and therefore the police " call " ) in certain part(s ) of California ( e.g. in Los Angeles or San Francisco ) for having spotted someone consuming cannabis publicly , i.e. " pot smoking in progress " ; that local cannabis users picked up on the code and began celebrating the number temporally ( esp. 4:20 a.m. , 4:20 p.m. , and April 20 ) ; that the number became nationally popularized in the late 1980s and , more ferverently , in the early - to mid-1990s ; and is colloquially applied to a variety of relaxed and / or inspired contexts , including not only pot consumption but also a " good time " more generally ( in contrast to the drug war surrounding ) .
Conventions are legends : 420 is not police radio code for anything , anywhere .
Checks of criminal codes ( including those of the City of San Francisco , the City of Los Angeles , Los Angeles County , the State of California , and the federal penal code ) suggest that the origin is neither Californian nor federal ( the two best guesses ) .
For instance , California Penal Code 420 defines as a misdemeanor the hindrance of use ( " obstructing entry " ) of public lands , and California Family Code 420 defines what constitutes a wedding ceremony ( Marco ) .
One state does come close : " The Illinois Department of Revenue classifies the Alcoholic Liquor Act under Part 420 , and the Cannabis and Controlled Substances Tax Act are next , under Part 428 . "
( RB 5/19/99 ) True story ? : " According to Steven Hager , editor of High Times , the term 420 originated at San Rafael High School , in 1971 , among a group of about a dozen pot-smoking wiseacres who called themselves the Waldos .
The term 420 was shorthand for the time of day the group would meet , at the campus statue of Louis Pasteur , to smoke pot .
``Waldo Steve , ' a member of the group who now owns a business in San Francisco , says the Waldos would salute each other in the school hallway and say ``420 Louis ! '
The term was one of many invented by the group , but it was the one that caught on .
`` It was just a joke , but it came to mean all kinds of things , like ` Do you have any ? ' or ` Do I look stoned ? ' ' he said .
``Parents and teachers would n't know what we were talking about . '
The term took root , and flourished , and spread beyond San Rafael with the assistance of the Grateful Dead and their dedicated cohort of pot-smoking fans .
The Waldos decided to assert their claim to the history of the term after decades of watching it spread , mutate and be appropriated by commercial interests .
The Waldos contacted Hager , and presented him with evidence of 420's history , primarily a collection of postmarked letters from the early ' 70s with lots of mention of 420 .
They also started a Web site , waldo420.com .
``We have proof , we were the first , ' Waldo Steve said .
``I mean , it 's not like we wrote a book or invented anything .
We just came up with a phrase .
But it 's kind of an honor that this emanated from San Rafael . ' "

There are a variety of other explanations , all much more interesting than " police code " , and many plausible .

Terrorism charges against ' RNC Eight ' dropped Rachel Oswald
Published : Thursday April 9 , 2009
Print This Email This Citing ' distraction , ' prosecutor intends to focus on ' core illegal conduct '
Terrorism charges against the eight protesters arrested for plotting to disrupt the Republican National Convention have been dropped while lesser felony charges remain in place .
" The Ramsey County attorney 's office said [ Thursday morning ] that it would file amended complaints in the cases of the men and women known as the ' RNC 8 . '
The charges of conspiracy to commit riot and conspiracy to commit criminal damage to property will remain , but other charges of conspiracy to commit riot and conspiracy to commit criminal damage to property ' in furtherance of terrorism " will be dismissed , ' writes Twincities.com .
Since their arrest , the eight protesters have received national attention and support from the greater activist community .
The terrorism charges against them came from Minnesota 's 2002 Patriot Act .
" We believe the terrorism charges would have been a distraction at trial , " said Ramsey County Attorney Susan Gaertner in a press release .
" Dismissing those charges will help us focus on the core illegal conduct that occurred .
Under the circumstances , the terrorism charge just complicates the case . "
Police arrested the eight individuals in raids in the days before the RNC last year .
Confiscated items in the raids included flammable liquids , empty glass bottles , rags and cement blocks .
The ' RNC 8 ' are contending that they did nothing wrong and were only expressing their Constitutionally - protected rights to freedom of speech and dissent .
The Minnesota Independent reports that the decision to drop the terrorism charges could be motivated by politics on Gaetner 's part .
Gaertner is seeking Democratic - Farmer - Labor Party backing for governor .
But her pursuit of terrorism charges against the eight protesters has not gone down well with party activists .
 She obviously got too much bad publicity about it and shes backing away ,  said Jordan Kushner , an attorney for one of the defendants , to The Independent .
 But the problem is that all the charges are politically motivated and unjustified . 
Ramsey County prosecutors will make a motion to amend the complaint against the protesters and dismiss the terrorism counts at a hearing on May 26 .

This story about Chuck Grassley 's response to a constituent 's pointed question comes by way of the Huffington Post :
After sharing his family 's personal struggle with the burden of high health care costs , an audience member asked , " My question is ... why is your insurance so much cheaper than my insurance and so better than my insurance ? "
The question made Grassley cranky .
He responded , first , by suggesting the questioner " go work for John Deere , " since they " do n't pay anything " for their insurance plan .
When the questioner refused to let the senator wriggle out of answering the question , Grassley revealed how little he knew about his own insurance plan .
Another audience member had to help the senator out by describing the details of the plan .
After she finished , the original questioner again asked , " Okay , so how come I can't have the same thing you have ? "
Grassley 's response : " You can .
Just go work for the Federal government . "
NASHVILLE , Tenn .
( AP ) — Country star Mac Davis , who launched his career crafting the Elvis hits “ A Little Less Conversation ” and “ In the Ghetto , ” and whose own hits include “ Baby Don't Get Hooked On Me , ” has died .
He was 78 .
His longtime manager Jim Morey said in a press release that Davis died in Nashville on Tuesday after heart surgery and was surrounded by family and friends .
Davis had a long and varied career in music for decades as a writer , singer , actor and TV host and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2006 .
He was named 1974 ’s entertainer of the year by the Academy of Country Music and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .
“ Thank you , dear Lord Jesus , for letting us know the man to whom you gave the most incredible talent , ” said Reba McEntire in a statement .
“ He entertained and spread joy to so many people .
What a wonderful legacy he left all of us with his music .
Mac was one of a kind .
I ’m so blessed to have been one of his many friends . ”
Born in Lubbock , Texas , and raised in Georgia , Davis was inspired by fellow Lubbock native Buddy Holly , but it was Elvis who gave him his first musical big break .
Davis worked as a staff songwriter in Los Angeles for Nancy Sinatra 's publishing company when in 1968 Presley cut “ A Little Less Conversation . ”
Although it had a little success at the time , the song became a bigger hit after Presley 's death , being covered by more than 30 artists and became Davis ' most licensed TV soundtrack song .
The song reached the top of the UK charts in 2002 after it was used in a Nike commercial and was featured in the hit movie “ Ocean 's 11 . ”
Davis also helped craft the song “ Memories ” that was a cornerstone of Elvis ’ big 1968 comeback TV special .
“ A small town boy who ’d achieved the greatest kinds of fame , he remained a good guy , a family man , ” said country star Kenny Chesney .
“ That was Mac : a giant heart , quick to laugh and a bigger creative spirit .
I was blessed to have it shine on me .
And Mac , who was joyous , funny and created a family around him , never stopped writing great songs , creating music and inspiring everyone around him . "
Davis got a recording deal of his own in 1970 , recording “ Hooked on Music , " “ It ’s Hard to be Humble , ” and “ Texas in my Rearview Mirror , ” and getting crossover success on pop charts .
He had his own TV series , “ The Mac Davis Show ” on NBC , and also acted in TV and film , including alongside Nick Nolte in the football film “ North Dallas Forty . ”
He even starred on Broadway , in “ The Will Rogers Follies ” and toured with the musical .
The group Gallery had a hit on his song “ I Believe in Music . ”
“ He was the songwriter behind some of the most iconic and timeless songs that transcend genres and generations and was named a BMI Icon in 2015 , ” said BMI President and CEO Mike O’Neil .
“ Beyond his extraordinary talent , Mac was a dedicated friend and advocate for songwriters everywhere . ”
He also wrote songs recorded by Kenny Rogers ( “ Something ’s Burning ” ) , Dolly Parton ( " White Limozeen " ) and Ray Price ( “ Lonesomest Lonesome ” ) .
He was still writing later in life , getting co-writing credits on songs by Avicii ( “ Addicted to You " ) and Bruno Mars ( " Young Girls . " )
“ Today our country community lost an amazing entertainer , songwriter and artist , ” said Sarah Trahern , CEO of CMA .
“ I remember watching Mac ’s TV show as a kid as well as his three years co-hosting the CMA Awards with Barbara Mandrell , which proved his command of the TV medium as well as the music . ”
( CNN ) --
A suburban Philadelphia swim club has invited children from a largely minority day - care center to come back after a June reversal that fueled allegations of racism against the club , a spokeswoman said Sunday .
Some kids from the Creative Steps Day Care center say club members made racial remarks .
The development came during a hastily called Sunday afternoon meeting of the Valley Club in Huntingdon Valley , Pennsylvania .
Club members voted overwhelmingly to try to work things out with the day - care center , which accused some swim club members of making racist comments to black and Hispanic children contracted to use the pool , said Bernice Duesler , the club director 's wife .
Duesler said the club canceled its contract with the Creative Steps day - care because of safety , crowding and noise concerns , not racism .
" As long as we can work out safety issues , we 'd like to have them back , " she told CNN .
She said the club has been subpoenaed by the state Human Rights Commission , which has begun a fact - finding investigation , " and the legal advice was to try to get together with these camps , " Duesler added .
Alethea Wright , Creative Steps ' director , said , " They should have done that before . "
Wright has repeatedly lambasted the club for its tepid response to the charges and said the children in her care were " emotionally damaged " by the incident .
" These children are scarred .
How can I take those children back there ? " she said .
However , Wright 's lawyer , Carolyn Nicholas , said the center will give the Valley Club 's offer " due consideration " once it is received and looks forward to sitting down with the parties .
" The children are our primary concern , " Nicholas told CNN .
Swimming privileges for about 65 children from Creative Steps were revoked after their first visit June 29 .
Some children said white members of the club made racist comments to the children , asking why " black children were there " and raising concerns that " they might steal from us . "
Days later , the day - care center 's $ 1,950 check was returned , Wright said .
Club director John Duesler told CNN that he had underestimated the amount of children who would participate , and the club was unable to supervise that many kids .
He called his club " very diverse , " and said it had offered to let day camps in the Philadelphia area use his facility after budget cuts forced some pools in the area to close .
Wright has rejected the camp 's contention that the swim club 's pool was overcrowded .
The club had accepted a 10 - to - 1 ratio of children to adults and was considering adding up to three lifeguards , according to e-mails obtained by CNN .
But John Duesler said last week that the Valley Club also canceled contracts with two other day - care centers because of safety and overcrowding issues .
The Pennsylvania Human Rights Commission launched an investigation last week after allegations of racism at the Valley Club .
The commission said that as part of any investigation , the two sides eventually could be asked to sit down face - to - face with its investigators .
" We always encourage opposing parties to communicate with one another if they feel they can resolve these issues amicably , " Commission Chairman Stephen Glassman said .
Bernice Duesler said she was n't yet sure how the club will " reach out " to Creative Steps and the other two camps .
And Wright said she still has concerns about the issue .
" Are the members who made those comments still there ? " she asked .

Toxic Equity Trading Order Flow on Wall Street
The Real Force Behind the Explosion in Volume and Volatility By Sal L. Arnuk and Joseph Saluzzi
A Themis Trading LLC White Paper
INTRODUCTION
Retail and institutional investors have been stun ned at recent stock m arket volatility .
The general thinking is that everything is related to the global financial crisis , starting , for the most part , in August 2007 , when the Volatility Index , or VIX , started to climb .
We believe , ho wever , that there are more fundamental reasons behind the explosion in trading volume and the speed at which st ock prices and indexes are changing .
It has to do with the way electronic trading , the new for - profit exchanges and ECNs , the NYSE Hybrid and the SEC ’s Regulation NMS have all come together in unexpected ways , starting , coincidently , in late summer of 2007 .
This has resulted in the proliferation of a new generation of very profitable , high - speed , computerized trading firms and methods that are causing retail and institutional investors to chase artificial prices .
These high frequency traders make tiny amounts of money per share , on a huge volume of small trades , taking advantage of the fact that all listed stocks are now available for electronic trading , thanks to Reg NM S and the NYSE Hybrid .
Now that it has become so profitable , according to
Traders Magazine ,
more such firms are starting up , funded by hedge funds and private equity ( only $ 10 million to $ 100 million is needed ) , and the exchanges and ECNs are courting their business .
This paper will explain how these traders – namely liquidity rebate traders , predatory algorithmic traders , automated market makers , and program traders – are exploiting the new m arket dynamics and negatively affecting real investors .
We conclude with suggestions on what can be done to mitigate or reduce these effects .
To illustrate most situations , we will use a hypothetical institutional order to buy 10,000 shares of a stock at $ 20.00 that has been input into algorithmic trading systems , which most buy side traders use .
Algorithmic or “ algo ” trading syst ems chop up big orders into hundreds of smaller ones that are fed into the market as the orders are filled or in line with the volume of the stock in question .
Typically , such orders are easy to spot as t hey commonly show that the trader has 100 or 500 shares to sell or bu y .

Apple Rejects Google Voice Apps From App Store
So , surprise surprise , Apple has rejected Google ’s official Google Voice app , and has removed from the App Store several Google Voice - related apps that had previously been accepted .
Jason Kincaid at TechCrunch , echoing many other critics of the decision , blames AT&T :
Of course , it ’s not hard to guess who ’s behind the restriction : our old friend AT&T .
Google Voice scares the carriers .
It allows users to send free SMS messages and get cheap long - distance over Google Voice ’s lines .
It also makes it trivial to switch to a new phone service , because everyone calls the Google Voice number anyway .
[ Well , so much for my speculation .
A reliable little birdie has informed me that it was indeed AT&T that objected to Google Voice apps for the iPhone .
It ’s that simple . ]
[ Update 22 Aug 2009 : So much for being “ that simple ” .
According to both Apple ’s and AT&T ’s response to an FCC inquiry , the decision was Apple ’s alone . ]
But does anyone really think AT&T pulls the strings in this relationship ?
Google Voice does n’t just interfere with the carrier ’s business model , it interferes with Apple ’s iPhone business model .
Not just AT&T but all iPhone carrier partners pay Apple a hefty subsidy for every iPhone sold , and that subsidy is based on assumptions about how much the average iPhone customer is going to pay in monthly service charges for voice , data , and SMS .
I can see why people are pissed that Apple has come out against Google Voice for iPhone , but I ca n’t see how anyone is surprised .
And , to play devil ’s advocate for a moment , I ’m not sure the decision is entirely unreasonable .
Do n’t think about it in terms of Apple ’s relationship with its carrier partners , but instead think about it in terms of Apple ’s competition with Google .
Google Voice is a mobile phone service provided by the maker of one of the biggest competitors to the iPhone OS .
What if Google Voice were instead Microsoft Voice ?
And what if Windows Mobile were as modern and competitive as Android ?
Would you be as surprised then that Apple is discouraging iPhone owners from using the service ?
Just saying .

Iraqi security forces arrested five U.S. contractors suspected of playing a role in last month ’s slaying of an American in Baghdad ’s Green Zone , Iraqi security officials said Sunday .
The suspects could face charges in an Iraqi court , which would make them the first Americans to stand trial before the Iraqi judiciary since the U.S. and Iraqi governments signed a bilateral security agreement late last year that in part allowed for such cases .
Maj . Gen. Hussein Ali Kamal , the head of the Interior Ministry ’s intelligence service , said the men were being held for questioning in connection with the death of Jim Kitterman inside the sealed - off enclave , home to the Iraqi government and embassies .
“ An investigation unit at the Interior Ministry investigated the murder and reached the conclusion that the Americans who worked with [ the victim ] . . . are suspected of killing him , ” Kamal said .
“ These people are under arrest and will be interrogated according to a judicial order . ”

Kamal declined to say how many suspects were being held , but an Iraqi government spokesman told Reuters news agency that five U.S. nationals had been arrested .
Kitterman , a 60 - year - old Texan who owned a construction company , was found dead May 22 .
He had reportedly been stabbed , blindfolded and bound , and left inside his car .
A relative of two of the suspects insisted that the men were innocent and would be released within a couple of days .
John Feeney said the suspects included his father , Donald Feeney Jr. , brother Donald Feeney III and two other employees of his father ’s security company , Corporate Training Unlimited , or CTU .
A fifth man who lived on their compound was also taken into custody , John Feeney said .
He spoke by telephone from North Carolina , where CTU has its U.S. headquarters .

“ We ’re pretty positive that . . . they ’ll be released in a couple of days , ” Feeney said .
The five men were arrested Friday morning when about 40 Iraqi security officers , accompanied by Americans in civilian clothes , surrounded the CTU compound , Feeney said .
He said that at the time of Kitterman ’s death , his father was not in the country and his brother and two of the other men were at a U.S. Embassy party .
He described his father , an Army Special Forces veteran , and Kitterman as good friends .
At one time , Kitterman had an office at the CTU compound , he said .
A U.S. Embassy spokesman confirmed that five Americans were being held by the Iraqis and had been visited by consular officials .
They looked well - treated , he said .

The spokesman declined to say why they were being held .
In November , the Iraqi and U.S. governments signed an agreement under which Iraq regained control of its security .
According to the pact , U.S. forces are scheduled to withdraw from Iraqi cities by the end of this month and from the country by the end of 2011 .
The agreement did away with the immunity from prosecution in Iraqi courts that Western contractors had enjoyed since the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 .

Times staff writer Usama Redha contributed to this report .
Kolo Touré is scheduled to leave Arsenal 's training camp in Austria this evening to fly back to England to complete his move to Manchester City after the two clubs agreed a fee of £ 14 m for the defender .
Touré is expected to fly directly into Manchester to take a medical examination tomorrow and finalise the personal terms of a contract that will see him join the growing band of players at City who earn in excess of £ 100,000 a week .
He will become the second Arsenal player to move from Arsenal to City this summer , following Emmanuel Adebayor for a combined outlay of £ 39 m .
In total , City have now made six signings in preparation for the new season , with Roque Santa Cruz , Gareth Barry , Carlos Tevez and Stuart Taylor being added to the club 's payroll for a total of £ 94 m .
An extensive recruitment programme , overseen by the billionaire Abu Dhabi royal family , has been offset by the departure of 12 players , but Touré 's imminent arrival consolidates City 's position as the biggest spenders in the Premier League by some distance this summer .
To put it into context , Manchester United have spent around £ 17 m in the same period , despite banking £ 80 m from Real Madrid for the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo .
Chelsea have spent around £ 20 m whereas Liverpool have made only one major signing , Portsmouth 's Glen Johnson , for £ 18 m and Arsenal have made a considerable profit , their one big - money recruit being Thomas Vermalen , Ajax 's Belgium international defender , for £ 10 m .
City now hope to take their summer spending well beyond the £ 100 m mark by prising their last remaining target , Joleon Lescott , away from Everton , their interest in the player remaining enthusiastic despite his club steadfastly refusing to offer them any positive signs .
Information has reached City that Lescott is determined to go through with the transfer but it is also clear that the process of extracting him from a club of Everton 's own ambitions may have some distance to go , and will be considerably more complicated than the negotiations for Touré .
It 's an increasingly familiar sight during the rainy season : a young woman , seated on a train , gripping the handle of her umbrella vertically between her knees .
But as she begins to doze she relaxes her grip , and her legs drift apart .
Physician and author Kimihiro Yoneyama , 57 , finds himself aghast at the spectacle of these " kasa - mata onna " ( women with umbrellas between their thighs ) , and when it comes to complaining , he does n't beat around the bush .
" Especially when they wear skirts , it 's a problem of where to direct your eyes , " Yoneyama grumbles to Sunday Mainchi ( July 12 ) , adding it would be more appropriate for them to carry folding umbrellas .
Rakugo comedian Yonesuke Katsura , 61 , is another middle - aged male who disparages what appears to be a decline in female modesty in public .
While aboard the JR Chuo line between Shinjuku and Kanda stations , he looked on in amazement as a young woman applied cosmetics .
During a span of approximately 20 minutes , she completely transformed herself .
" I can't understand this .
She had no awareness that she could be seen by other people .
They might as well yank out their false teeth in front of everyone , " Katsura grumbles .
What a change from the good old days , when Japanese brides were even advised to avoid letting their husbands peer at their sleeping face .
Another of Katsura 's pet peeves is the clatter generated by women 's casual footwear -- especially mules , which produce a terrible racket when the wearer descends the steps at a rail station .
" Who do they think they are , the ' oiran ' on parade in Yoshiwara ? " he asks , making a reference to old Edo 's highest - ranked courtesans , who used to appear in public processions wearing enormous , stilt - like wooden clogs .
" Some women wear mules to the office too .
I feel like telling them , ' You 're not on holiday at some oceanside villa ! ' "
Sports commentator Takenori Emoto , 61 , meanwhile , is unhappy over women 's shrill voices .
" You drop into an izakaya and they are really loud .
On occasion , I 've even asked the staff , ' Has your shop been booked for a private party ? '
And if I request one to tell her companions to turn down the volume a bit , she 'll just get angry . "
Emoto also complains that more women charge straight ahead like they own the sidewalk , expecting others to move out of their way .
Meiji University professor Takashi Saito offers an analysis of what 's behind these changes in female behavior .
" As with the old expression ' bojaku bujin ' ( outrageous or imprudent ) , it 's come to this because women feel no awareness over being observed by others .
They 're concerned about those in their circle of acquaintances but have no consideration for anyone else .
The trend is to treat others as if they did n't exist . "
Well , it 's one thing for males to mutter on the pages of a magazine ; but the next time they encounter a woman doing something they dislike , can they summon up their courage and tell her off ?
Probably not a good idea , advises Saito , who warns such criticisms might be construed as sexual harassment .

AP IGNORES CRITICISM ….
Yesterday , the Associated Press reported that the House Democratic health care plan cost “ $ 1.5 trillion . ”
By the afternoon , the AP reporting did n’t attribute the price tag to anyone ; it just stated the figure as fact .
House Dems threw a fit , which was understandable — the day before the AP blasted the $ 1.5 trillion figure to the world , the Congressional Budget Office pointed to a roughly $ 1 trillion cost over 10 years .
The AP not only went with the much higher figure , it made no reference to the CBO score .
That , however , was yesterday .
I ’d hoped the AP would at least notice the criticism , and clarify the issue in the future .
No such luck — this AP report ran about a half - hour ago .
Votes were planned Thursday in the Education and Labor and Ways and Means committees on a $ 1.5 trillion plan that majority House Democrats presented this week .
No source , no reference to the CBO figure released Tuesday , and no mention of the fact that House Democrats reject the “ $ 1.5 trillion ” figure .
Naturally , others are picking up on the AP ’s reporting , and relaying the disputed figure .
Time ‘s Mark Halperin noted this morning that House committees are expected to vote today “ on the Democrats ’ $ 1.5 trillion plan . ”
I do n’t mean to sound picky , but reporting like this not only misinforms news consumers , it also has the potential to adversely affect the larger policy debate .
If the AP is intent on using the $ 1.5 trillion figure , it could at least add some language to reflect the concerns , such as “ a number Democratic leaders dispute , ” or , “ though the CBO puts the figure closer to $ 1 trillion . ”
Something .
I realize that the exact price of the proposal is unclear at this point .
We ’re dealing with estimates on legislation that ’s still being shaped , and it ’s possible the final figure may exceed , or not , the current figures .
But in light of the published CBO score , the AP ’s reporting is sloppy and incomplete , and runs the risk of undermining reform efforts .

Enter a new fact :
Shuffletron
Shuffletron is a music player for Linux .
It runs in the terminal , with a textual interface , and has support for search , labelling files using arbitrary tags , a queue , and an alarm clock mode .
It is designed to let you spend more time playing music and less time clicking around a GUI : the tagging features help organize and make note of interesting songs , and the search features allow quickly finding specific songs when you want to hear them .
It starts up quickly and copes well with tens of thousands of files .
It is written in Common Lisp ( but do n't let that put you off ) .
For audio , MP3 playback , and ID3 parsing , it uses my Mixalot suite of libraries .
Here 's what it looks like in action :
Update 3/19/10 : The Shuffletron source code now lives at github .
The 0.0.5 version in progress has some useful new features , notably a random play command , and commands for tagging / untagging all songs in the selection .
Also , a bug where dates were printed correctly has been fixed .
Behavior of blank lines has been changed to function as the " back " command rather than resetting the selection ( I might revert this if it proves more annoying than useful ) .
There 's also code for a status bar which displays the current artist / title at the top of the terminal , currently disabled .
Update 7/6/09 : Shuffletron 0.0.4 is released .
Only one superficial change to the player ( numbers printed when scanning new ID3 tags were wrong ) , but fixes a bug in libmpg123 that caused crashes on certain files .
Thanks to Leslie Polzer for identifying this issue .
All binary releases ( both 32 and 64 bit ) include their own copy of libmpg123 now .
Update 7/5/09 : Shuffletron 0.0.3 is released .
New binaries should solve the problems encountered with the previous release .
New features include :
Queue manipulation : drop , tag all , and transfer between queue and selection .
Random play commands ( play a random song from the library , or a random song matching a query )
Stop / play commands ( these are n't as fundamental as they sound .. )
killtag command to eliminate every occurrence of a tag
Thanks go to Alex Charlton , Robert Lieberman , and Leslie Polzer for reporting issues with the previous binaries , and Luis Oliveira and Stelian Ionescu for assistance with CFFI and Osicat issues .
The current version of Shuffletron is 0.0.4 .
It requires libmpg123 , and installing the program rlwrap is strongly recommended .
Binary releases include their own copy of the libmpg123 library .
Binary releases are available for the following platforms :
Shuffletron 0.0.4 for Linux / x86 ( 32 - bit ) : download
Shuffletron 0.0.4 for Linux / x86_64 ( 64 - bit ) : download
Compiling from source requires SBCL or a recent version of the Clozure CL compiler ( SBCL is recommended ) .
Compiling a binary follows the standard make / make install process and uses the implementation 's respective application delivery support to produce an executable .
Clozure CL users may have to edit build - ccl.lisp to tweak the ASDF search path .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iranian state television said shots were fired during a mass rally in support of defeated presidential candidate Mirhossein Mousavi in Tehran Monday and that people were running away .
“ There has been sporadic shooting out there ... I can see people running here , ” a reporter of Iran ’s English - language Press TV said in a live call from Tehran ’s Azadi Square .
“ A number of people who are armed , I do n’t know exactly who they are , but they have started to fire on people causing havoc in Azadi Square , ” he said .
Many tens of thousands of people had gathered in the square and a nearby thoroughfare to show support for Mousavi ’s call for the election to be canceled .
In accordance with our 2009 Resolutions to get allot better at absolutely everything we do , we are changing the way we filter our beers .
No longer will our beers be sterile filtered , so look forward to BrewDog beers with even more flavour , aroma , mouth - feel and body !
We almost inadvertently fell into the sterile filtering of our beers .
Conventional wisdom in the UK about how beer can be presented really lags behind that in the rest of the world .
Due to our brewing education readying us for a job with Inbev or Heineken , there was only three schools of thought on how beer can be put into bottles with any kind of shelf life ; pasteurized , sterile filtered and bottle conditioned .
Pasteurization , or temporary cooking of beer to kill off any biological instability in your beer , is what ruins about 95 % of the world ’s beer .
As we have no space for bottle conditioning we reluctantly decided we would have to sterile filter our beers .
We were advised by UK industry experts that this was the only way to get the shelf life we needed on our bottled beers .
This filtration technique is not without its drawbacks however as it is a very tight filtration and can strip out a lot of the flavour , aroma and mouth - feel of a beer .
It was only by travelling and meeting other craft brewers that we discovered that there was an alternative method that was much better for our beers .
We are grateful for the help and advice of our friends in the international craft beer community in helping us find a much better way of presenting our beers .
Complete process control and a light filtration .
This gentle filtration merely removes the hop bits from dry hopping and the char from the whisky cask aged beers and makes the beers almost bright to the naked eye .
The aromas that come through when you do n’t sterile filter is quite amazing .
The intense aromas and flavours that our beers had before just got even more hoppy , even more citrus , even more smoky and even more outrageous .
As we have said many times before , BrewDog is about making the best beer we possibly can .
We do n’t proclaim to have all the answers .
If there is something we can do better we ’ll be the first to hold up our hands and do our darnedest to embrace and improve .
The new filtration , or perhaps lack of it , will add a lot to our bottled beers and hopefully add allot to our customer ’s enjoyment of them .
We recently bottled batches of very lightly filtered Paradox Smokehead and Paradox Springbank , the difference is amazing .
We are just a young brewery and learning all the time .
Thanks for being on this journey with us .
Improving absolutely every single aspect of everything we do will always be all we are focussed on .
And if we have some fun and unsettle a few institutions along the way then that is cool too .
We have some pretty exciting plans for the rest 2009 and we hope you all want to be part of them .

File this in the " exporting democracy " category , or not : a recent report from Europe serves as a reminder that serious problems with e-voting are n't just an American malady , although it 's much easier to move back to paper ballots if your country is fairly small .
Just ask the Irish , who have announced their decision to scrap their e-voting system and return to paper .
Ireland has already put about $ 67 million into building out its e-voting infrastructure , but the country has apparently decided that it would be even more expensive to keep going with the system than it would be to just scrap it altogether .
In a statement , Ireland 's Environment Minister John Gormely blamed the decision partly on the economic crisis , which has had an impact of nearly Icelandic proportions on the country 's real estate market and banking system .
" It is clear from consideration of the Report of the Commission on Electronic Voting that significant additional costs would arise to advance electronic voting in Ireland .
This decision has been taken to avoid such costs , especially at a time of more challenging economic conditions .
The financial and other resources that would be involved in modifying the machines in advance of implementation could not be justified in present circumstances " , Minister Gormley said .
Ireland 's decision that it can't bear the continued costs of e-voting is merely the latest in an ongoing string of such decisions , in which states like Ohio and Florida have said that it 's just too expensive to limp along with what is , in essence , a failed , poorly planned , large - scale IT infrastructure deployment .
Few governments that scrap their existing e-voting systems go all the way back to paper like Ireland , though .
In the case of Florida , for instance , the state moved totally to optical scan machines ( and then it still managed to screw up an election ) .
Michael Schumacher will make a shock return to Formula 1 to replace injured Ferrari driver Felipe Massa .
The seven - time world champion retired at the end of 2006 but will drive at the European Grand Prix on 23 August .
Ferrari said the 40 - year - old will stand in for as long as Massa is sidelined by the serious head injuries he sustained in Hungarian Grand Prix qualifying .
" For team loyalty reasons I can't ignore this unfortunate situation , " said the former Ferrari driver .
His spokesman Sabine Kehm had told the BBC on Tuesday that although Schumacher - who was working as a consultant for Ferrari - was not willing to make a full - time return to F1 , he would not rule out standing in for Massa .
ANDREW BENSON BLOG
Schumacher is not a man who makes these sort of decisions lightly , and he will have taken a long , hard look inside himself before making this decision
And the German racing legend has now decided to come out of retirement and make a sensational return to the sport .
" It is true that the Formula 1 chapter has long been closed for me , " added Schumacher , who won five world titles for Ferrari .
" The most important thing first : thank God , all news concerning Felipe is positive and I wish him all the best again .
" This afternoon I met with team principal Stefano Domenicali and Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo and together we decided that I will prepare myself to take the place of Felipe .
" As the competitor I am , I also very much look forward to facing this challenge . "
Schumacher has not driven an F1 car since April 2008 and competed in the last of his 249 grands prix in October 2006 .
And the most successful F1 driver of all time now has slightly more than three weeks to prepare himself for the European Grand Prix in Valencia .
The ban on in - season testing means Schumacher will not be able to turn a wheel of the 2009 specification Ferrari before first practice on Friday 21 August .
SCHUMACHER'S F1 RECORD 1991 : Makes F1 debut for Jordan , switches to Benetton 1992 : First Grand Prix win ( Belgium ) , finishes third in the championship 1994 : Wins first world title with Benetton , winning eight races 1995 : Retains world title , winning nine races 1996 : Joins Ferrari 1997 : Finishes season second but is disqualified from championship 1999 : Breaks leg at Silverstone when leading world championship 2000 : Ends Ferrari 's 21 - year wait for a world title , winning nine races 2001 : Retains world title , again winning nine races 2002 : Quickest ever world title win , with 11 race wins 2003 : Breaks Juan Manuel Fangio 's record of five world titles 2004 : Wins seventh and final world title 2006 : Retires at the end of the season 2009 : Announces comeback to fill in for injured Felipe Massa Nevertheless , the team have chosen Schumacher - who won 91 grands prix in a glittering career - ahead of reserve drivers Marc Gene and Luca Badoer .
" Ferrari intends to entrust Michael Schumacher with Felipe Massa 's car for as long as the Brazilian driver is not able to race , " read a team statement .
" Michael Schumacher has shown his willingness and in the next few days he will undergo a specific programme of preparation at the end of which it will be possible to confirm his participation in the championship , starting with the European Grand Prix . "
There are six more races to go after Valencia , including trips to Belgium , Italy , Singapore and Japan .
Schumacher will undergo an intensive training programme to determine whether he is fit enough to return to the rigours of F1 racing .
Since retiring from the sport , Schumacher has occasionally taken part in motorcycle events but in February he suffered neck and back injuries in a motorbike accident .
Those injuries could affect his ability to drive an F1 car , with huge pressures placed on the neck because of the varying G - forces .
Massa could be out for the rest of the season after undergoing surgery on a fractured skull sustained when a spring from Rubens Barrichello 's Brawn hit him on the helmet when he was travelling at more than 160 mph during qualifying in Hungary on Saturday .
The Brazilian is set to leave intensive care and is making progress , although there is also concern about damage to his left eye .
Schumacher is close to Massa , who was his team - mate in his final season , and has taken a close interest in the Brazilian 's career .
BBC Radio 5 Live F1 commentator David Croft believes Schumacher is coming back partly because of that close relationship .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" I think he 's coming back because it is to replace Felipe Massa , temporarily .
He is very close to Felipe , they 've had a great relationship over the years , " stated Croft .
" I think it 's his way of doing something to help Felipe , and doing something to help Ferrari at the same time , because if you look at the alternatives Ferrari had , they were n't really alternatives .
" Who else is there who could come into Ferrari and hit the ground running , who knows the car , who knows the team , who could give them a podium ?
" The European Grand Prix , which was not one we were looking forward to at the start of this year , has now got a real spice to it .
" Lewis Hamilton against Michael Schumacher for the first time ever ?
Jenson Button up against Michael Schumacher ?
How will Kimi Raikkonen respond ?
It 's going to be fascinating . "

I just heard Rachel Maddow mention this , so I had to share .
She believes that this story is payback for Cheney 's recent smackdown of Bush for the Scooter Libby non-pardon , and that it will be a big deal .
And since we 're into big deals here at TPC :
Top Bush administration officials in 2002 debated testing the Constitution by sending American troops into the suburbs of Buffalo to arrest a group of men suspected of plotting with Al Qaeda , according to former administration officials .
Some of the advisers to President George W. Bush , including Vice President Dick Cheney , argued that a president had the power to use the military on domestic soil to sweep up the terrorism suspects , who came to be known as the Lackawanna Six , and declare them enemy combatants .
How sick is it that we consider that kind of BushCo thinking " par for the course " ?
Mr. Bush ultimately decided against the proposal to use military force .
Probably because he could n't pronounce Lackawanna .
A decision to dispatch troops into the streets to make arrests would be nearly unprecedented in American history , as both the Constitution and subsequent laws restrict the military from being used to conduct domestic raids and seize property .
As if that would stop His Dickiness .
The Fourth Amendment bans “ unreasonable ” searches and seizures without probable cause .
And the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 generally prohibits the military from acting in a law enforcement capacity .
I seem to remember posting about this possibility back when .
Nobody seemed to notice .
But you know what they say : Good things come to those who wait .
In the discussions , Mr. Cheney and others cited an Oct. 23 , 2001 , memorandum from the Justice Department that , using a broad interpretation of presidential authority , argued that the domestic use of the military against Al Qaeda would be legal because it served a national security , rather than a law enforcement , purpose .
That would be the same Justice Department that wrote up those spiffy little torture memos .
“ The president has ample constitutional and statutory authority to deploy the military against international or foreign terrorists operating within the United States , ” the memorandum said .
Of course it did , because that 's what Boy Georgie 's DoJ deemed .
The United Deem of America .
Deem and Deemer ?
The memorandum — written by the lawyers John C. Yoo and Robert J. Delahunty — was directed to Alberto R. Gonzales , then the White House counsel , who had asked the department about a president ’s authority to use the military to combat terrorist activities in the United States .
Ding !
The memorandum was declassified in March .
But the White House debate about the Lackawanna group is the first evidence that top American officials , after the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , actually considered using the document to justify deploying the military into an American town to make arrests . [...]
Former officials in the administration said this debate was not as bitter as others during Mr. Bush ’s first term .
The discussions did not proceed far enough to put military units on alert .
See how they could all get along when they put their minds to it ?
Still , at least one high - level meeting was convened to debate the issue , at which several top Bush aides argued firmly against the proposal to use the military , advanced by Mr. Cheney , his legal adviser David S. Addington and some senior Defense Department officials .
Reminder : Read The Dark Side by Jane Mayer .
Learn all about Addington , His Dickiness , and their band of merry despots .
Among those in opposition were Condoleezza Rice , then the national security adviser ; John B. Bellinger III , the top lawyer at the National Security Council ; Robert S. Mueller III , the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ; and Michael Chertoff , then the head of the Justice Department ’s criminal division . [...]
Scott L. Silliman , a Duke University law professor specializing in national security law , said an American president had not deployed the active - duty military on domestic soil in a law enforcement capacity , without specific statutory authority , since the Civil War .
That , of course , was when His Dickiness was just a young boy .
Senior military officials were never consulted , former officials said .
Richard B. Myers , a retired general who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said in a recent interview that he was unaware of the discussion . [...]
Despite this guidance , some Bush aides bristled at the prospect of troops descending on an American suburb to arrest terrorism suspects .
“ What would it look like to have the American military go into an American town and knock on people ’s door ? ” said a second former official in the debate .
Um , like Iraq ?
Chief James L. Michel of the Lackawanna police agreed . “
If we had tanks rolling down the streets of our city , ” Chief Michel said , “ we would have had pandemonium down here . ”
Um , like Iraq ?
Back in Firefox 3 , we introduced support for color profiles in tagged images , but it was disabled by default .
In Firefox 3.5 we were able to make the color correction process about 5 x faster than it was in Firefox 3 so we ’ve enabled support for color correction for tagged images .
Most images on the web are untagged .
If you do n’t know the difference between tagged images and untagged images the odds are good are you wo n’t notice this change .
However , we suggest that you read on to learn about what it might mean for you if you want to include them and how future Firefox releases might change the interactions between CSS colors and images .
What ’s a color profile ?
People who spend a lot of time taking photographs or any kind of high - resolution color printing will understand that many output devices – LCDs , CRTs , paper etc – all have very different interpretations of what various colors mean .
For example , uncorrected red will look very different on an LCD vs. a CRT .
You can see this if you set up two very different monitors next to each other and the operating system does n’t do color correction – colors will look more washed out in one of them vs. the other .
JPG and PNG images both have support for color profiles .
These color profiles allow Firefox to take colors in the image and translate them into colors that are independent of any particular device .
While images contain color profiles it ’s also important to note that output devices like monitors also have color profiles .
As an example an output device may be better at displaying reds than blues .
When you ’re getting ready to show something that ’s “ red ” on that device it might need to be converted from the neutral # ff0000 value to # f40301 in order to show up as red on the screen .
What this means is that there are actually two conversions that take place with color profiles .
The first is to take the original color information in the image and , using the color profile , convert it into a device - independent color space .
Then once it ’s in that independent space you convert it again using the output device ’s color profile to get it ready to display on the output device .
So what about CSS colors ?
It ’s important to understand how color profiles work and how they are converted to properly understand how CSS interacts with these color spaces .
In Firefox 3.5 we consider CSS colors to already be in the device output ’s color space .
Another way of saying this is that CSS colors are not in the neutral color space and are not converted into the output device like tagged images are .
What this means is that if you have a tagged image where a color is expected to match the CSS that ’s right next to it , it wo n’t .
Or at least it ’s likely that it wo n’t on some output device – maybe not the one that you happen to be using for development .
Remember that different output devices have different color profiles .
Here ’s an example of what that looks like :
In Firefox 3 , this will look like one contiguous block of purple .
In Firefox 3.5 and Safari you will notice that there ’s a purple box within a purple box ( unless your system profile is sRGB . )
This is because the image is color corrected while the surrounding CSS is not .
This is where the statement about the future comes in .
In a future release of Firefox we are likely to make it possible for people to turn on color correction for tagged images and CSS .
You can test this setting today by changing the pref listed on the page on color correction on the Mozilla Developer Center to “ Full color management . ”
In that case untagged images should continue to work as we will be rendering both CSS and untagged images in the sRGB color space .
Image support and tools
PNG ’s can be tagged in three different ways .
First they can have an iCCP chunk that contains the associated ICC profile .
Second they can be explicitly tagged as sRGB using a sRGB chunk .
Finally , they can contain gAMA and cHRM chunks that describe the image ’s gamma and chromaticies .
Using any of thse methods will cause Firefox to color correct the image .
You can remove all of the color correction chunks resulting in an untagged image using pngcrush :
pngcrush - rem gAMA - rem cHRM - rem iCCP - rem sRGB infile.png outfile.png
Alternatively , you can use TweakPNG and delete the gAMA , cHRM , iCCP and sRGB chunks by hand .
When discussing still 's people often think of the old moonshiners from prohibition timesÂ hiding in the woods from the law , making illegal white lightning .
Â
It 's not often that someone now days would have a use for a still right ?
Wrong !Â
Although a still can be used for moonshine it has several other legal uses , such as ethenol / methenol fuel , remove salt from seawater ( making it drinkable ) , and extracting essential oils from your favorite plants / flowers .
There are two basic types of stills , a reflux still and a pot still .
Â
In this article I am going to explain how to make a pot still .
Â
Before you decided to start distilling at home it is very important that you research the laws for your area .
Â
You would n't want any undo trouble for yourself .
Okay the basic operation of a still is simply to take the steam from a boiling liquid and condense it back to a liquid state again .
Although a pot still can be made with any type of cooking pot with a lid I recommend that you use a pressure cooker .
A pressure cooker is preferable for a few reasons : the lid already has a hole in it for steam to escape , the lid is designed to lock on allowing steam to only exit through the steam hole , and most importantly it is designed with safety devices witch wonâ€™t allow it to pressurize and explode .
From here on out I am going to assume you decided to use a pressure cooker .
Now that you have your pressure cooker ( / pot ) we need to make a condenser to attach to it .
You will need the following items :
Small submersible fish tank style water pump
18 â€ of 3â€ pvc
3â€ pvc caps --- two of them
Ñ˜â€ soft copper pipe --- about 5â€ ™
3/8 tubing soft --- about 10â€ ™
Pvc glue
1â€ hose clamps
Small tube of silicon caulk
Wine bottle cork
All of these items can be purchased from your local Lowes / Homedepot or local hardware store .
Tools needed :
Drill
Ñ˜â€ drill bit
Flat screw driver
Maglight C battery sized
Copper tubing cutter
Small hand held tubing bender
Okay now take your soft copper pipe , it usually comes in a small roll so unroll a few feet of it being extra careful not to kink it .
Leaving one foot of pipe at the beginning start slowly rolling the pipe around the Maglightâ€™s handle .
Again be very careful not to kink the copper tubing .
Roll the pipe around the lights handle at least ten times making a small coil .
If you kink the tube you have to cut off the kink and start again , kinks are dangerous because they can create back pressure in your still .
When you have your coil finished cut the rest of the copper pipe off leaving an extra foot of straight pipe at the end , just like at the beginning .
Now take one of the 3â€ pvc caps and drill a Ñ˜â€ hole into the side of it , about an inch up from the edge .
With the other 3â€ pvc cap drill the same size hole into the top of it just offset from the middle about an inch or so .
Push one of the straight sections of the copper pipe into the hole on the side of the 1st 3â€ cap .
Slide the copper coil into the 18â€ pvc pipe and fit the other pcv cap onto the free end of the copper tubing bend the tubing to match up with the hole using the hand held bender ..
Before you push the caps onto the pvc pip make sure you put a fair amount of pvc glue onto the caps .
So now you have about one foot of copper pipe coming out of the top of the pvc then your coil inside the pvc and again about one foot of copper coming out the bottom of the pvc .
Feel free to take a minute to pat yourself on the back cause you are almost done .
Take the drill and drill 2 hole into the pvc thatâ€™s housing your coil .
One just under the top cap and another right above the bottom cap being very careful not to drill through your copper pipe inside .
Cut two 1â€ pieces of your leftover copper pipe and use the caulk to hold these pieces into the two holes you just drilled .
When the caulk is dry ( 24 hours ) use the same caulk to seal the other holes in your pvc where the coil top and bottom come out , wait to dry ( 24 hours ) .
Cut your 3/8 tubing in half connecting it onto the two 1â€ copper nipples in the side of the pvc pipe using two of the hose clamps to ensure it wont leak .
On the other end of the bottom tube connect the submersible water pump , so when in use water can flow into the bottom of the 3â€ pvc and out the top .
Bend the top of the copper pipe with the pipe bender to fit onto the steam exhaust hole on your pressure cooker .
Drill the right size hole in each end of the wine bottle cork to fit the Ñ˜â€ copper pipe on one end and the existing nipple on the pressure cooker on the other end .
Congratulations you have a still .
Next article will be on how to use your still to make ethenol / methenol fuel , remove salt from seawater ( making it drinkable ) , and extracting essential oils from your favorite plants / flowers .
Thank Ray for this comic .
This is probably what the last Mega Man sprite comic should have been , but we just could n’t quite get it right .
I ’m glad Ray decided to bring the idea back because it was always a good one to me .
Also , thanks again for all the comments about Sarah and Lily !
I ’ll post some more pictures soon and I ’ll be sure to talk about my little one in the next podcast !
I ’ve been waiting so long to do that second panel that I would have been happy with it being its own comic ….
but I figured you guys would probably want a little bit more than that ….
WASHINGTON 
The federal government is opening the immigration files of millions of refugees , war brides , " enemy aliens " and other foreign nationals in the USA in the first half of the 20th century .
A gold mine for historians , genealogists , scholars and descendants , the files include private details on such public figures as Spanish artist Salvador Dali as well as family heirlooms confiscated from Chinese laborers .
" Individually , these files represent the story of just one immigrant , " says Gregory Smith of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service , " but as a collection , they document the story of American immigration ... with its many wonders and its many blemishes . "
The immigration service signed an agreement Wednesday to transfer at least 21 million files to National Archives facilities near San Francisco and Kansas City .
A searchable index is at www.uscis.gov/genealogy.
The files were compiled under the Alien Registration Act of 1940 .
They include photos , visa applications , birth certificates , personal letters and transcripts of interrogations of celebrities and unknowns .
Documents in Guerino DeMarco 's creased brown file show the gardener was arrested in 1942 and held for three months at New York 's Ellis Island after visiting his mother in Italy .
Another Italian , Raffaele Annunziata , registered when he arrived from Salerno in 1948 .
Like others , he certified that he and his kin were not " idiots , " " imbeciles , " " feeble - minded " or " insane , " and that he was not a " professional beggar " or " anarchist . "
French crooner Maurice Chevalier , a 1930s Hollywood star who spent World War II in Europe , applied for re-entry in 1949 .
He wrote that he would live with his son on a farm in Alabama .
The application apparently was turned down .
The actor did not return until the mid-1950s , after suspicions that he collaborated with the Nazis and later harbored communist sympathies had dissipated .
Dali lived in the USA during World War II .
His thick file contains many forms he filled out over the years .
The surrealist artist , best known for the melting timepieces in his painting The Persistence of Memory , apparently could n't remember his height .
Various documents list him as 5 feet 4 inches tall , 5 - 7 , 5 - 8 and 5 - 10 .
A bad memory could mean deportation for thousands under the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 , the nation 's first race - based immigration law .
For 60 years , strict quotas forced Chinese immigrants to endure lengthy interrogations .
Some came under false identities as " paper sons " of Chinese Americans .
Jennie Lew , a San Francisco documentary maker whose father claimed such kinship , says the files and artifacts , once " a source of fear and torment , " hold special meaning .
" This opens an important and hidden chapter in our history , " Lew says .

Yesterday I wrote Perception is Reality - we need a director of marketing .
After a few hours I was caught on IRC by some people who said the main problem why companies are not picking Perl or why they are leaving Perl is that they cannot find good Perl programmers .
As reaching programmers to learn perl is not the job for a marketing director hence we do n't need a marketing person .
Let 's set aside all the other areas where professional marketing could help the Perl world and let 's focus on the issue of the impossibility to find good Perl programmers .
I think if we compare it with Python , Ruby and to some extent even with PHP the situation is n't better there either .
I do n't think it is a problem specific to Perl .
On the other hand if you look at Java , people do n't have the same problem .
Java does not have a lack of programmers
There are several reasons for this .
One of them is that most of the universities teach Java but not any of the dynamic languages .
The other reason is that in Perl / Python / Ruby they are looking for good programmers while in Java they are looking for programmers .
I am not sure I know what they mean by that but that 's usually the phrasing I hear .
The explanation I get sometimes is that in Java you need one expert and you can get by with many beginners .
In dynamic languages you usually need a lot less people but they must be really good if you want maintainable code .
This might be less so with Python and Ruby but the difference is neglectable .
So are Python and Ruby in better situation than Perl ?.
If a company or a team in a company decides to use one of the dynamic languages they need to overcome the lack of Perl / Python / Ruby programmers .
One of the ways is to take some of the Java or C# programmers and teach them the language .
Either by formal training or by letting them learn on their own .
In either case it requires an investment on the side of the company and the willingness on the side of the programmer .
Perl has a clear disadvantage here that boils down to three issues .
It is harder to learn Perl than Python or Ruby
Perl is not as sexy as Python or Ruby
Team leaders and managers think about Perl that it is dead , unmaintainable , etc ...
The first problem can be reduced or eliminated by improving Perl , the language or by the various projects such as Enlightened Perl , Modern Perl or by creating a really good IDE for Perl .
The second issue might be also changed by the above improvements but that is already mostly a question of perception .
The third issue is clearly something we programmers and system administrators do n't know how to deal with .
There is where we need the professional help .

Pimp My Spectrum keeps them alive
There was a time – a time more than 25 years ago now – when kilobytes were considered large units .
Before modern RAM manufacturing techniques , before advanced digital storage methods , before 10 M bps internet connections , there was a golden era of computing , led by limited technology , in which programmers got the job done by pushing individual bits around .
It 's an approach to computing that 's now lost in the mists of time .
Or is it ?
There was a time when a team of clever programmers from Spain conspired to fit a high - definition textured rolling landscape , a music player , a fancy light show and some highly complex camerawork inside a miniscule 4Kb executable .
But this time was n't years ago , it was just months back – and what 's more , they were successful .
" In the '80s , when the demoscene was the only community related to computers , we were alone , " says Inigo Quilez , coder for the demoscene group RGBA .
" But not any more .
We are in the middle of so many things which are so alive that even if we do n't look too much to them , we simply cannot die .
We will exist forever , in an evolved manner of course .
And that 's good . "
AMAZINGLY SMALL HD :
At only 4Kb in size , Elevated has an astounding amount of detail
Winner of the 4kB competition at this year 's Breakpoint party , RGBA 's demo ' Elevated ' – an international collaboration with Danish group TBC – fits within a quarter of the RAM of the original , un-upgraded 16 kB ZX Spectrum .
That 's 4,096 bytes , or 32,768 individual bits .
" Just so people get an idea of how much four kilobytes is , " says Quilez , " let 's say that it's what one of those little static icons on your desktop takes .
Or that one second of music in MP3 format , which is already pretty well compressed , takes a lot more than four kilobytes .
Yet we managed to show almost four minutes of music and animation at full high - definition image quality . "
It 's rare to look at modern software and see it as a genuine achievement – we 're more used to bemoaning the never - ending encroachment of bloat that comes with newfangled coding techniques – but it 's impossible to look at Elevated as anything but phenomenal .
Cramming something so gorgeous into such a tiny space is not easy .
Most of Elevated is procedurally generated , so its complex and massive data structures are generated within system RAM at runtime using a variety of mathematical techniques .
" Elevated is , more than anything else , a huge formula that the computer evaluates , " says Quilez .
" The formula encodes shapes , textures , colours and rhythms , and the computer ' expands ' the visual content .
The formula and its subpart or subformulas are designed to mimic a terrain , which is more or less simple and has been done thousands of times since mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot first did it in the early ' 80s .
Colours are simply numbers for the computer , and the colour of each pixel of the screen is the result of evaluating this big formula . "
The road behind
So how did we get as far as Elevated and its ilk ?
It 's fair to say that the demoscene has grown from nefarious roots .
8 - bit computers , particularly the Commodore 64 , allowed a sect of young programmers to form around their open , powerful and flexible architectures .
Computer clubs helped knowledge ( and illicitly copied software ) to spread , and the C64's poor BASIC interpreter – around 30 times slower than the equivalent assembler – encouraged young hot - shot programmers to explore the deeper aspects of machine code .
There 's a historical cloud over what happens next , but here 's approximately what went on : a stumped gamer asks a hacker for help to get through a particular game .
Said hacker dives into the code , removes the monster that is so infuriating the player and leaves his mark within the game .
Both cheating and cracking are born in one swoop .
Inserting one 's name into games via the process of decompilation soon becomes a popular pursuit , as does the removal of copy - protection systems .
Between 1982 and 1985 , various groups worldwide – commonly populated with professional programmers – begin competing to crack and release games in the quickest time , some showing skill beyond the original software coders .
CHEQUERED PAST : Development team Fairlight are often reminded about their early roots in piracy
For instance , when German group JEDI illegally converted Epyx 's Summer Games from the American NTSC to the European PAL format , Epyx was so pleased with the conversion that it went on to sell the cracked version officially .
It was in 1985 that competition really started hotting up , both in terms of speed and publicity .
Cracker intros ( also known as ' cracktros ' ) started appearing at the beginning of copied games .
In the early days , these could not yet be described as ' artistic ' , and generally featured pertinent information displayed within scrolling text bars .
German group GCS was the first group to add moving sprites to its intros .
Dutch group
Bert added sprite animation .
Before long , others added music , fractals , bouncing balls , parallax scrolling and rudimentary 3D graphics .
Soon the scene was blossoming .
For many individuals , demo creation became less about the dubious practice of cracking games and more about the technological achievement of pushing a machine beyond its apparent limits .
Dutch groups 1001 and The Judges , who were still involved with piracy , competed so fiercely on the C64 that they began releasing intros so large and complicated they no longer had room to fit the requisite game on the disk .
This was the point at which the true demo emerged .
With the onset of the 16 - bit era , which brought more toys , more RAM and more challenges , the demoscene really came into its own .
University of Georgia researchers have developed a successful way to grow molecular wire brushes that conduct electrical charges , a first step in developing biological fuel cells that could power pacemakers , cochlear implants and prosthetic limbs .
The journal Chemical Science calls the technique " a significant breakthrough for nanotechnology . "
UGA chemist Jason Locklin and graduate students Nicholas Marshall and Kyle Sontag grew polymer brushes , made up of chains of thiophene and benzene , aromatic molecules sometimes used as solvents , attached to metal surfaces as ultra - thin films .
" The molecular wires are actually polymer chains that have been grown from a metal surface at very high density , " said Locklin , who has a joint appointment in UGA 's Franklin College of Arts and Science and on the Faculty of Engineering .
" The structure of the film resembles a toothbrush , where the chains of conjugated polymers are like the bristles .
We call these types of coatings polymer brushes .
To get chains to pack tightly in extended conformations , they must be grown from the surface , a method we call the ' grafting from ' approach . "
Using this approach , the scientists laid down a single layer of thiophene as the film 's initial coating , then built up chains of thiophene or benzene using a controlled polymerisation technique .
Their research , funded by the Petroleum Research Foundation , was published in the June issue of the journal , Chemical Communications .
" The beauty of organic semiconductors is how their properties change , based on size and the number of repeating units , " said Locklin , who is a member of UGA 's Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center .
Thiophene itself is an insulator , said Locklin , " but by linking many thiophene molecules together in a controlled fashion , the polymers have conducting properties . "
More importantly , he said , " this technique gives us the control to systematically vary polymer architecture , opening up the possibility for various uses in electronic devices such as sensors , transistors and diodes . "
The ultra - thin films are between 5 and 50 nanometres — too small to see , even under a high - powered optical microscope .
Locklin said it 's difficult to harness a fuel source in the body , such as glucose , for use in biofuel cells that could replace the need for batteries in an implanted device .
And while humans have enzymes in the body that do a good job of converting chemical energy into electrical energy , " they are n't very useful in this application because they have natural protective insulating layers that prevent good electron transport from active site to electrode , " he said .
" Hopefully our molecular wires will provide a better conduit for charges to flow . "
While " flexible electronics " is a large and growing area of research , it 's still in its infancy , Locklin said .
" For example , we do n't yet understand all of the fundamental physics involved in how electrical charges move through organic materials . "
The next step for Locklin is to develop appropriate applications .
For example , his polymer brush technique might be used in a range of devices that interface with living tissue , such as biochemical sensors , prosthetic limbs , pacemakers or bionic ears .
" The film itself might be used in transistors — or in photovoltaic devices such as solar cells , " said Locklin .
In 1938 , after the Kristallnacht pogroms in Germany , where rampaging Nazis assaulted thousands of Jews , ransacked synagogues , and wrecked thousands of businesses , a poll revealed that almost 70 percent of students in colleges and universities in the United States opposed offering their country as a haven for Jewish refugees in Central Europe .
This response , according to Stephen Norwood , a professor of history and Judaic studies at the University of Oklahoma , was symptomatic of the callous indifference among America ’s college administrators , students , and faculty to the plight of German Jews throughout the 1930s .
In “ The Third Reich in the Ivory Tower , ’’ Norwood draws on incidents at Harvard , Columbia , the Seven Sisters women ’s colleges , state universities , and Catholic institutions to excoriate the nation ’s educational elite for its “ truly shameful ’’ appeasement of Hitler ’s Germany and for suppressing protests against fascist atrocities .
When Nazis burned 20,000 Jewish and other “ un - German ’ ’ books in 1933 , Norwood points out , college and university officials remained silent .
Or worse .
Although he had led a campaign to rebuild the library at the University of Louvain in Belgium after it was burned during World War I , Nicholas Murray Butler , the president of Columbia University , did not join efforts to establish an American Library of Nazi Banned Books .
Butler expelled Robert Burke , a student leader of a mock book burning on campus .
And he approved the decision of the chairman of the art history department not to reappoint Jerome Klein , a popular instructor , two months after Klein circulated a petition protesting a visit to Columbia by Hans Luther , Germany ’s ambassador to the United States .
In assessing the role of college and university presidents , Norwood sets the bar very high .
He believes that they should have known , as early as 1933 , the year Hitler took power , that the Nazis would act on their promise to rid Germany of Jews .
And he expects them not only to have permitted protests against the policies of the Third Reich , but to have initiated , endorsed , and participated in them .
Their sins of commission and omission , he insists , sent a signal to the Nazis that the seizure of Jewish businesses , dismissal of Jews from their professions , and savage beatings “ were not their concern . ’’
Consider , for example , his indictment of James Bryant Conant , president of Harvard .
In May , 1934 , Norwood writes , Conant “ did nothing to discourage ’’ the warm reception Harvard alumni , student leaders , and professors accorded the crew of the Nazi warship Karlsruhe on its visit to Boston .
He “ welcomed ’’ Ernst “ Putzi ’’ Hanfstaengl , the foreign press chief of the Nazis , to his 25th reunion at Harvard - and “ refused to intervene ’ ’ when the Massachusetts Supreme Court sentenced two women who protested the visit by chaining themselves to a railing near the speakers ’ platform during commencement to six months at hard labor .
He “ permitted ’’ the Nazi consul general in Boston to place a wreath bearing the swastika emblem in Harvard ’s chapel - and sent a delegate to the University of Heidelberg ’s 550th anniversary pageant .
Acknowledging that Conant turned down Hanfstaengl ’s offer of a $ 1,000 scholarship to permit a Harvard undergraduate to study in Germany , Norwood notes , however , that the president did not follow the example of Williams College , which terminated exchanges with German universities in 1936 .
By encouraging study abroad in Germany “ without reservation , ’’ he adds , in a chapter on the Seven Sisters , administrators helped spread Nazi propaganda and “ suggested to the American public that the Third Reich was a legitimate member of the community of nations . ’’
As Norwood should know , college and university presidents defended cultural exchanges as a good way to enhance mutual understanding between the people of Germany and the United States .
Many of them , moreover , sincerely believed that weighing in on contemporary political conflicts , by denouncing the Nazis or refusing to welcome officials of the German government , was inappropriate - and inimical to the interests of the institutions they led .
Then and now , the dilemmas faced by administrators in higher education are not amenable to easy resolution .
“ The Third Reich in the Ivory Tower ’’ does make a compelling case that presidents dozed , dithered , and ducked during the great and gathering storm of Nazism .
Some of them , who had not hesitated to denounce the “ communist , ’’ “ atheistic ’’ Soviet Union , continued to do business as usual with Hitler and his minions , even when the Nazis intensified their persecution of Jews .
And Norwood is surely right to suggest that blasting book burning as a grave threat to free inquiry and academic freedom was well within the job description of the leaders of American higher education .
In the 1930s , of course , leaders in higher education did n’t have the luxury of hindsight .
With or without it , moreover , some of their rhetoric and behavior , taken in the name of what we ’ve come to call “ constructive engagement , ’’ deserves to be defended .
Or , at least judged to be worthy of the plea : “ guilty with an explanation . ’’

Bananas provide food , wine and beer - and now maybe fuel as well
By Matt McGrath
Science reporter , BBC World Service
You 've heard of " green " fuel .
Now get ready for yellow as scientists have found a way to turn banana waste into a sustainable fuel source that could be relevant to many countries across Africa .
Rotting banana skins are mashed into a pulp , then mixed with saw dust
The simple , low - tech idea , was developed by researchers at Nottingham University .
They used banana skins to create briquettes that can be burned for cooking , lighting and heating .
It could alleviate the burden of gathering firewood , the dominant energy source in many parts of the continent .
This would help reduce deforestation , which makes a significant contribution to global climate change .
Go yellow
In some African countries , like Rwanda , bananas are an important and versatile crop , used for food , wine and beer .
But experts estimate that the edible fruit makes up just a small part of what the plant produces .
The banana skins bind other materials together really well , they act like glue
Joel Chaney , Nottingham University According to scientists , for every one tonne of bananas , there are an estimated 10 tonnes of waste , made up of skins , leaves and stems .
It was on a visit to Rwanda that Joel Chaney , a PhD student from the University of Nottingham came up with the idea of developing a low - tech approach to turn this banana waste into an efficient fuel source .
Back in the laboratory at the University 's faculty of engineering , Joel showed me how to make bananas burn .
He first mashes a pile of rotting skins and leaves .
This pulp is then mixed with saw dust , compressed and dried to create briquettes that ignite readily and throw out a steady heat , ideal for cooking .
" The banana skins bind other materials together really well , they act like glue , " says Mr Chaney .
The banana mixture dries into briquettes which can be burned on a stove
" We can then either form the material into a ball by hand , or use a press to squeeze the materials together and squeeze the liquid out .
" Once we 've pressed them we can lay the briquettes outside in the sun , and within about two weeks we have some dried fuel . "
The emphasis of the project has been on developing a simple technology that can be used in developing countries without the need for a large financial outlay .
Over the years there have been many attempts to develop new stoves and fuel sources in Africa that have failed because they were too expensive or did not take on board local needs .
These briquettes are made by hand , we have n't used any mechanical equipment at all
Mike Clifford , Nottingham University Mike Clifford is associate professor in the department of engineering at Nottingham .
Standing around a stove in the laboratory that 's using banana briquettes to boil water , he says he is really pleased with the project .
" This is working really well .
These briquettes we 've made by hand , we have n't used any mechanical equipment at all .
No technology and we 've had a really good result , " he says .
" We 're starting from very basic problems and we are making the solutions as simple and accessible as possible to the people that need them .
" It 's almost seen as a new colonialism , imposing solutions on people in developing countries , we are very keen not to do that . "
Saving firewood
The scientists believe that banana fuel might help reduce dependence on wood as an energy source across Africa .
The briquettes are easily made , no machinery is required
In some of the continent 's biggest banana - producing countries like Rwanda , Tanzania and Burundi , more than 80 % of current energy needs are met from burning wood .
This has a very damaging impact on the environment leading to deforestation which contributes to climate change .
Gathering wood for fuel is also a time consuming job , mainly done by women .
" In some areas wood fuel is getting depleted and you are getting deforestation .
Women sometimes have to walk over six hours a day to get firewood , " says Joel Chaney .
" This is a way to use waste from crops like bananas , to make them burn in a better way because loose residue most often just burns too rapidly .
" Imagine just putting some straw onto your fire at home .
It just goes up in flames , you can't cook food over it , while the briquettes provide a way to cook food in a much better way . "
The Nottingham researchers say their low - tech approach is a small step along the way of meeting the millennium goals and helping people out of poverty .
They say that they are happy to give the idea away for free and are encouraging people who want to use the idea to get in touch .

The business community in Vanuatu is strongly supportive of the government 's offer of soft loans to try and restore the economy in the wake of the Covid - 19 pandemic
Gary Wolf wrote a Wired cover story about craigslist called " Why Craigslist Is Such A Mess " .
It 's a somewhat strange article because it is highly critical of craigslist 's design , management , and lack of innovation .
But you cannot read that article and not come away impressed with Craig Newmark , Jim Buckmaster , and the ethos of craigslist .
Here are some stats I pulled from the piece :
this site not only beats its competitors — Monster , CareerBuilder ,
Yahoo's HotJobs — but garners more traffic than all of them combined
With more than 47 million unique users every month in the US
alone — nearly a fifth of the nation 's adult population — it is the most
important community site going and yet the most underdeveloped
One recent report , from a consulting firm that counted the paid ads ,
estimates that revenue could top $ 100 million in 2009 .
Should
craigslist ever be sold , the price likely would run into the billions
more than 16,000 employees .
Amazon has more than 20,000 .
Craigslist has
30 Craigslist gets more traffic than either eBay or Amazon.com .
eBay hasmore than 16,000 employees .
Amazon has more than 20,000 .
Craigslist has30
Only programmers , customer service reps , and accounting staff work at
craigslist .
There is no business development , no human resources , no
sales .
As a result , there are no meetings .
Craigslist has done this by doing very little .
As Gary points out , the service 's interface has not changed in a very long time , if at all .
The company has no marketers .
To quote Gary again , " By eliminating marketing , sales , and business development , craigslist's
programmers have cut out all the cushioning layers that separate them
from the users they serve . "
I do not believe we should criticize a company that operates like this .
We should learn from it .
Of all the Internet companies out there , the one that serves as the most iconic for our firm is craigslist , not Google .
We dream of funding a company that can be worth a billion dollars with only 30 employees .
We 've never done it and I do n't know if we ever will .
But we are going to try again and again and again .
My partner Brad wrote a post on the USV blog recently about the freeconomics debate and he ended with this observation .
The much more interesting conversation is about the appropriate
economic model for a social network that depends on the contributions
of its participants and increases in value as more people use it .
One
possibility is that the economic models of these networks will look
more like Craigslist than Yahoo .
Recent estimates peg Craigslist's
revenue at more than $ 100,000,000 .
Not much compared to Yahoo's
billions , but Craigslist still employs only 28 people .
Even allowing
for substantial bandwidth , and server costs , it is still hard to
imagine how their costs are more than $ 5,000,000 .
Since Craigslist
collapsed a multibillion dollar classified advertising business into a
fabulously profitable $ 100,000,000 business , perhaps we should be
talking about the potential deflationary impact of more " zero billion
dollar " businesses .
As the radical efficiencies of the web seep into
more sectors of the economy , and participants in social networks
exchange attention instead of dollars , will governments at all levels
need to make do with less tax revenue ?
That 's a scary thought in an era
of high deficits unless traditional governments can learn from the
efficent governance systems of social networks and provide more for
less .
And of course , that is exactly Craig 's point :
" People are good and trustworthy and generally just concerned with
getting through the day , " Newmark says .
If most people are good and
their needs are simple , all you have to do to serve them well is build
a minimal infrastructure allowing them to get together and work things
out for themselves .
Any additional features are almost certainly
superfluous and could even be damaging .
A system like Craigslist does result in a lot spam , fraud , and abuse .
But it is also certainly the most efficient and cost effective way to make a market .
We should all be studying this system , understanding why it works so well , and how we can replicate it on our businesses , institutions , and governments .
I think we have no other choice .
One in 10 Britons suffer migraines
Studies have indicated a strong link between migraine with aura - the type associated with bright flashing lights - and a hole in the heart .
Scientists found repair of the defect cut the severity of migraine attacks by 37 % .
Details of the study , led by doctors in London and Shrewsbury , were presented to the American College of Cardiology .
PATENT FORAMEN OVALE
A flap or valve - like opening in the wall between the two upper ( atrial ) chambers of the heart
It is frequently found before birth , but seals shut in about 80 % of people
When pressure is created inside the chest - for instance by coughing - the flap can open , allowing blood to flow in either direction
This can allow blood to bypass the filtering system of the lungs
If debris is present in the blood , such as small blood clots , it can pass through the left atrium and lodge in the brain , causing a stroke
Around one in ten in the UK suffer from migraines - more than diabetes , asthma and epilepsy combined .
A migraine is a severe headache often accompanied by bright flashing lights in front of the eyes and long periods of sickness .
There is currently no cure for the condition .
Some sufferers struggle by with available drug treatments , but for many it seriously affects their ability to live a normal life .
Unfiltered blood
A hole in the heart , known technically as a patent foramen ovale ( PFO ) , is a minor defect in the wall that separates the two upper chambers of the heart , the atria .
In most cases it causes no health problems , but can , in a small minority of people , lead to a stroke .
It has changed my life dramatically
Zoe Willows
It is also thought that failure completely to filter the blood of impurities in the normal way may result in migraines .
The link was in part discovered after work on divers , who are more susceptible to decompression sickness - the bends - if they have a PFO .
Several who had the heart problem fixed , also found their migraines got better .
The latest study screened 432 migraine with aura patients , and found 24 % had a moderate or large PFO - six times greater than the number found in the general population .
Six months after the procedure to repair the defect , patients reported a 37 % reduction in migraine burden - calculated by multiplying the number of headaches by their length .
In patients who underwent a sham procedure the reduction was just 17 % .
The researchers had hoped to achieve a 40 % reduction - but argue the results are still significant .
Better life
Dr Andrew Dowson , of King 's College Hospital , London , one of the lead researchers , said : " For the first time we can see trends in a prospective study to suggest that PFO closure may be an effective way to treat certain types of migraine .
" A reduction in headache burden for a patient with severe migraine may allow that individual to gain more control and lead a more fulfilling and productive life .
" The key now will be establishing the criteria that will help to determine which patients should be referred to the interventional cardiologist for further treatment . "
Anne Turner , of the Migraine Awareness Association , said : " Migraine is a very individual condition and although we 've got lots of effective treatments available , it is very much a matter of trial and error to find the one that works for you .
" This study has opened a whole new avenue which may provide a potential answer for some people . "
Dramatic improvement
Zoe Willows , 29 , from Reading , took part in the trial .
She used to have five or six severe migraine attacks each month during which she would experience numbness down one side of her body , blurred vision , and an inability to speak as well as an intense headache .
Since the procedure last July to close the hole in her heart Zoe has only had one migraine attack - coming out of the operating theatre immediately after the procedure was completed .
She said : " It has changed my life dramatically .
I have got so much more energy . "
