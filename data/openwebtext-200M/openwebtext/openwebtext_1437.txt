Secretive Conservative Group Counseled Sanfords
' The Fellowship ' Offers Spiritual Guidance , Relationship Advice for Elite ; Jenny Sanford Advised on Sex Life
Jenny Sanford , wife of South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford , said her husband looked to leaders of an elite , conservative , Christian group known as " The Fellowship " for guidance during a rough patch in their marriage .
Sanford writes in her memoir , " Staying True , " which hit bookstores today , that an adviser from the Fellowship , to whom she gives the fake name " John , " counseled her to work through her anger at her husband and to put her marriage and family above all else .
Jenny Sanford does not specify if she was counseled by the well - connected Fellowship Foundation in Washington , but Mark Sanford publicly cited the Fellowship 's role in helping him and his family confront his affair during a June 2009 press conference .
His wife 's account highlights the extent of the Fellowship 's involvement as counsel , and says they even dished out advice on the couple 's sex life .
" We went so far as to talk about sex and he told me not to withhold it as punishment as that would make everything worse , " she wrote .
Watch Barbara Walters ' exclusive interview with Jenny Sanford on " 20/20 " Friday at 10 p.m. ET
Behind closed doors , the group has been known to offer spiritual guidance for its members , who gather for prayer at a row house on Washington , D.C. 's C Street that is funded by the society .
But the secretive organization has come into the spotlight for its role in the affairs of members Mark Sanford and Sen.
John Ensign , R - Nev. , where they reportedly became entangled in their members ' private lives .
Fellowship Counsels Members , Wives on Relationships
Jeff Sharlet , who says he lived with the Fellowship in 2002 and wrote a book about it called , " The Family : The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power , " said the group has a record of reaching out to powerful figures during ethics scandals , courting and counseling them in a quest to " infiltrate the world with Jesus . "
The male - dominated group preaches subservience , according to Sharlet , and often counsels members ' wives to stay in relationships at a high price .
" As Christians are to Christ , so women are to men -- you have to submit to him , " Sharlet said .
" That 's the conservative evangelical world they 're in .
...
They 'll counsel you and help you through this , but your job is to be there for your husband , especially if he 's in a position of power . "
Efforts to reach the Fellowship were unsucessful .
Sanford Told to Focus on Forgiveness
After Sanford learned of her husband 's infidelity , she turned to " John " at the Fellowship again at her husband 's recommendation .
This time , " John , " who Sanford described as someone who " understood men in power well , " advised her on " how to handle " her husband .
Rather than seek revenge , Sanford writes , " John " suggested that she focus on forgiveness and let him confront Mark directly with her grievances .
Leave the punishment to others , he urged .
" John " served as a crucial ally for Sanford , backing up her decision not to let her husband travel to the Davos Economic Forum in Switzerland or visit his Argentine lover , Maria Belen Chapur , last year .
Cubby Culbertson , a spiritual adviser who counseled Mark Sanford during his time at C Street , accompanied the governor on a trip to New York to see Chapur , Jenny Sanford said .
Sanford refers to Culbertson in her memoir as her husband 's babysitter on the trip .
But his ultimate goal was to help Mark " regain his moral focus . "
Culbertson declined to comment for this article .
After 20 years of marriage , Sanford filed for divorce in December .
Sen. Ensign and the Fellowship
The Fellowship also reportedly counseled another of its members , Ensign , who admitted to an affair with Cynthia " Cindy " Hampton , the wife of his former co-chief of staff Doug Hampton , in June 2009 .
Doug Hampton spoke with ABC News ' Cynthia McFadden in November 2009 about his boss ' affair and the cover - up , revealing that he turned to the Fellowship in early 2008 to intervene .
At the time , Ensign was a resident at the C Street House .
Hampton said he was not advised by the Fellowship to cover up the affair , but instead to " be cool . "
He said they felt they needed a more powerful voice to confront Ensign , and reached out to C Street resident and conservative leader Sen .
Tom Coburn , R - Okla .
" 'We need help .
We 're not big enough , ' " Hampton said , recalling his conversation with the Fellowship .
" ' [ Ensign ] is a United States senator and so even though we 're friends , we 're close , we 're brothers in Christ , we need power to confront this : Sen .
Tom Coburn , the hit man . "
Hampton said that on Valentine 's Day 2008 , the C Street leadership and Coburn helped him confront Ensign .
" Tom [ Coburn ] really kind of takes the helm , " Hampton recalled .
" Oh , he 's smoking .
He is one upset man .
...
And then John kind of breaks down , [ saying ] ' I made a mistake , I really screwed up . ' "
Coburn originally denied he was ever part of brokering a settlement .
In a statement to " Nightline " responding to this story , Coburn 's spokesman John Hart confirmed that he did offer to help Hampton in the negotiation , but says the conversations were " initiated by Doug , not ... Coburn . "
Hampton provided " Nightline " with a letter , which he said the group at C Street forced Ensign to write and send to Cindy , ending the relationship .
" I used you for my own pleasure , " Ensign wrote .
" God never intended for us to do this . "
According to Sharlet , the Fellowship relies heavily on the biblical narrative of King David in its teachings .
Despite David's " mixed record " for adultery , he is revered because he was chosen by God for power .
Though the organization has taken steps toward transparency , the Fellowship continues to operate under the radar .
Fish is an excellent source of omega - 3s .
Some of the best are salmon , sardines , herring and mackerel .
We need to do our own cooking because restaurants replace omega - 3s with omega - 6s which are bad oils .
Preparing our own food is much healthier for us .
Baked fish is the best way to prepare fish .
It reduces the chances of strokes while frying fish increases our chances .
It is very important how we prepare it to be the best benefits from the omega -3s .
In today ’s time omega - 6s are taking over .
Almost everywhere we eat outside the home and also in lots of groceries we buy has this in them .
Too many omega - 6s causes diseases and inflammation which is very painful .
These are the fats are body do n’t need .
To make sure we are getting the right about of omega - 3s in our diet , we should also be taking a fish - oil supplement .
1. EPA ( eicosapentaenoic acid ) and DHA ( docosahexaenoic acid ) are the omega - 3s that fish oil produces .
EPA helps with depression and has been proven to help with some bipolar disorders .
DHA helps the brain function healthier .
When you ’re buying fish - oil supplements look for the ones that have both of these in them .
Some only have one or the other in them .
2. Omega - 3s also reduces inflammation which is the cause of so many very painful diseases .
I sometimes get inflammation build up in my lower back and it puts me out of commission for awhile because of the swelling which causes so much of the pain I experience .
I have to keep inflammatory drugs in my medicine cabinet .
When my doctor tells me it ’s ok to start taking omega - 3s in my diet , I should n’t have as much problems with pain then .
They help with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus which are very painful diseases .
It ’s very hard to live with joint pain that ’s why taking omega - 3s are so important .
It ’s good to know there are things we can do to help with chronic pain .
Always talk with your doctor to see what dosage of supplements you should be taking because everyone is different and response to things differently .
3. Omega - 3s is very good for the heart .
It ’s been proven to reduce the risk of heart attacks .
It thins out the blood which is very important for heart patients .
Never take fish oil supplements without consulting with your doctor first because he may already have you on blood thinners .
He may even add some to your diet along with your medication .
This can only be determined by you and your doctor .
Only he will know the right kind of treatment that is right for your condition .

AVATAR IS a visually stunning marvel of film technology , as many reviewers will tell you , but what really stands out in James Cameron 's newest film is its unabashed critique of corporate greed and its inspiring tale of solidarity and resistance against occupation .
Set on a distant planet called Pandora , Avatar re-enacts the genocide of indigenous populations by colonial capitalism , and links this history to the rapacious resource wars of our own times .
The film is not a moralistic wringing of hands that relies on " white - guilt fantasies " as some commentators have claimed ; rather , it is an uncompromising defense of the principle of self - determination and the right to resist exploitation and plunder .
Listing some of Cameron 's blockbuster films -- The Abyss , Aliens , the Terminator films and The Titanic -- is enough to remind us that we are dealing with a master of visual effects technology .
Fans of his earlier work wo n't be disappointed with Avatar 's special effects -- the 3 - D version in particular is a breathtaking experience .
As the New York Times reviewer Manohla Dargis writes :
Avatar unflinchingly indicts imperialism and defends the right of the oppressed to fight back
This is n't the 3 - D of the 1950s or even contemporary films , those flicks that try to give you a virtual poke in the eye with flying spears .
Rather , Mr. Cameron uses 3 - D to amplify the immersive experience of spectacle cinema ...
After a few minutes the novelty of people and objects hovering above the row in front of you wears off , and you tend not to notice the 3 - D , which speaks to the subtlety of its use ...
Similarly , we find ourselves dazzled by the brilliantly rendered planet of Pandora , replete with bioluminescent flora and fauna , ethereal floating mountains and touch - me - nots that look like giant seashells .
All of this , no doubt , represents advances in special effects not seen since the Wachowski brothers invented " Bullet Time " for The Matrix , and Peter Jackson brought Gollum to life in The Lord of the Rings .
Only the most jaded and cynical of moviegoers would deny Cameron 's accomplishments in this area .
HOWEVER , FOR all the gushing praise that Cameron has received from critics for the film 's technological accomplishments , reviewers have been less enthusiastic about Avatar 's political message .
Some of them seem to be so dazzled by the spectacle that they do n't even notice its ideological significance .
Review : Movies Avatar , written and directed by James Cameron , starring Sam Worthington , Zoe Saldana , Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang .
In the New York Times , Ross Douthat dismisses it as a " long apologia for pantheism - - a faith that equates God with Nature . "
Similarly , while Dargis ' review acknowledges the film 's " anti-corporate message , " she seems unmoved by its uncompromising anti-imperialist message .
On the other hand , left - wing critics have panned the film 's politics for its director 's " banal and conformist outlook " ( David Walsh 's review at wsws.org ) and as " a fantasy about race told from the point of view of white people " ( Annalee Newitz 's much - circulated post for the sci- fi Web site io9.com ) .
Let 's concede a couple of points at the outset .
James Cameron is n't Gillo Pontecorvo , and Avatar is no Battle of Algiers .
It 's a popular science fiction thriller , and a damn good one at that .
It thus conforms to some of the conventions of the genre , employing stock characters like the mercenary Col. Miles Quaritch ( Stephen Lang ) , and predictable plotlines such as the romance that ensures a happy ending .
No doubt the dialogue is , at times , contrived and clichéd , and the film could have used a better script .
Nevertheless , its narrative arc is compelling , and the transformation of its central character , disabled marine Jake Sully ( Sam Worthington ) , is convincing .
Jake is your archetypal warrior hero , except for his disability ( he is paralyzed from the waist down ) , which draws sneers from the other marines ( one refers to him as " meals on wheels " ) .
When we first encounter him , he is awakened from a state of hibernation in the gravity - free environment of a spaceship .
Here , as the characters hover and float around , we fail to notice Jake 's paralysis .
When we see him in his wheelchair for the first time , his comrades taunt him , and we see , through his eyes and from his perspective , the mammoth scale of the war machines and armaments being deployed by the mercenary forces on Pandora .
His disability , in other words , is n't incidental .
It 's central to his character , because his disability marks him out as an underdog among the top dogs , so to speak .
His disability sets him apart as someone who might not necessarily conform to all that he sees around him .
Moreover , as the plot unfolds , we learn that his colonel is trying to hold him hostage to his disability , promising him the use of his legs in return for acting as the colonel 's stooge .
Early in the film , we learn that Jake cannot afford the medical care he needs to be able to walk again , and that although he is n't looking forward to the mission on Pandora , he can do little else , given the state of the economy .
White man though he is , Jake Sully is nevertheless himself a victim of oppression .
And crucially , Jake 's liberation is contingent upon his identification with the natives of Pandora , the Na'vi , a tribe of 12 - feet tall , blue - skinned humanoids with prehensile tails .
IN THIS sense , Avatar can't simply be dismissed as a " white man 's guilt " narrative , as Annalee Newitz does in her post on the sci- fi Web site io9.com .
Newitz rightly points out that the trope of the white man who " goes native " is an old one , which has its origins in European colonial ideology .
Sure enough , as Newitz points out , in contemporary Western culture in general and Hollywood in particular , the fantasy of " going native " often ends with the white man not only assimilating into the " native " culture , but emerging as their leader in their quest for salvation or liberation from some oppressive force or circumstance .
Think here of films as diverse as Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom , The Last Samurai and City of God .
Certainly , Jake feels conflicted and guilty about what his comrades are about to do to the Na'vi and to Pandora .
And certainly , this is at least partially a result of his falling in love with Nyteri ( Zoe Saldana ) , the female Na'vi warrior .
And yes , Jake 's avatar emerges as the leader of the Na'vi in their struggle against the human plunderers .
But surely this in itself is insufficient grounds to condemn the film as just so much unreconstructed Orientalism .
By plugging into the avatar , Jake 's consciousness is quite literally embodied in the " other " ; in this sense , he comes closer to genuine empathy with the Na'vi than can be realistically conceived ( hence the term " science fiction " ) .
If we grant this central premise of the film , then it seems to me somewhat churlish to suggest that Jake Sully is nothing but a 21st century T.E. Lawrence or Indiana Jones .
Furthermore , Jake 's Na'vi self initially rebels against the human incursion into Pandora as an act of self - preservation .
He attacks the giant bulldozers that arrive on the scene while he is asleep ( and back in his human incarnation ) with a desperation that the audience can identify with , as they seem intent on mowing down everything in their path , including Jake and Nyteri .
It 's not too much of a stretch to suggest that the bulldozers destroying the Na'vi forests are like the Israeli bulldozers in occupied Palestine , and that Jake 's defiance of them is like the courageous stance of activists like Rachel Corrie .
By slow degrees , Jake comes to identify with the " other " and their way of life .
Once he becomes fully aware of the mercenary calculations of the corporation that will stop at nothing in its bid to extract the precious " unobtanium , " Jake switches sides , as do the team of scientists led by the strong - willed Grace Augustine ( Sigourney Weaver ) .
To suggest that this act is little more than a demonstration of " white man 's guilt " is , I think , to render meaningless the idea of solidarity .
Jake 's speech rallying the Na'vi , and calling on them to reach out to the other tribes reminded me of Tecumseh and of later anti-colonial revolutionaries who rallied diverse colonized peoples against their common oppressors .
The conclusion of the film , which shows the chastened humans being escorted back to their waiting spaceship , just as surely harkens back to the images of the withdrawal of the defeated American forces from Vietnam .
In the context of the wars and occupations in Iraq and Afghanistan , this is cultural dynamite .
And in the context of Barack Obama 's Nobel Peace Prize lecture on " just war , " Jake Sully 's wry admission is timely : " I was a soldier who tried to bring peace , but sooner or later everyone has to wake up . "
ANOTHER ELEMENT of the film 's anti-imperialism that critics seem to have missed is its subtle criticism of the negative historical role played by anthropologists and other social scientists working for colonial powers .
Grace and her team of scientists are employed by the same corporate entity that has hired Col.
Quaritch and his trigger - happy mercenaries .
In this respect , the scientists in the film are like those employed by the U.S. Army 's " Human Terrain System , " whose stated purpose is to " improve the military 's ability to understand the highly complex local socio-cultural environment in the areas where they are deployed . "
But Grace is no military lackey , and her team 's meticulous attention to the scientific project , as well as their moral and ethical sensibilities drive them to oppose Col.
Quaritch and their corporate sponsor , in the form of Parker Selfridge ( Giovanni Ribisi ) .
The film 's insistence that the aims of social science can't be reconciled with those of imperialism stands in stark contrast to the complicity of academics currently involved in the Human Terrain System program .
Like most sci- fi films , Avatar offers a withering critique of the world that we live in .
But unlike most recent sci - fi films , it is filled with a utopianism that we have n't seen in a while .
Is this a nostalgic longing for lost innocence ?
By presenting the Na'vi and their way of life as akin to indigenous cultures destroyed by colonialism , does the film run the risk of grasping at an irrecoverable past ?
Perhaps here too Avatar offers more than at first meets the eye .
There is something undeniably futuristic about Pandora itself , where flora and fauna alike are interconnected as if part of one gigantic neural network .
The network of energy that binds everything on Pandora is ultimately responsible for Jake 's resurrection as his Na'vi avatar .
The process that transfers his consciousness from his human body to his Na'vi body seems to involve millions of tendrils that resemble tiny optical fibers .
Interestingly enough , this postmodern , high - tech aesthetic stands in stark contrast to the decidedly modernist , industrial design of the humans ' arms and armaments , which recalls the gritty and clunky aesthetic of Battlestar Galactica .
Such utopianism in our time might seem unjustified , if not incongruous , but it is certainly a breath of fresh air .
There are those who will squirm at the film 's obvious references to our contemporary reality ( as when the campaign against the Na'vi is referred to as " shock and awe " ) , and those who will wince at its sometimes clumsy dialogue .
But there 's no denying that millions of moviegoers around the world are flocking to a film that unflinchingly indicts imperialism and corporate greed , defends the right of the oppressed to fight back , and holds open the potential for solidarity between people on opposite sides of a conflict not of their choosing .
Back in December , I looked at which goalies were benefiting from a high penalty kill save percentage .
By the time December rolls around people begin to look at overall save percentage statistics and see some weight in them because the sample size is getting larger .
This is very true when it comes to save percentages at even strength for starting goaltenders ( though there will of course still be quite a bit of variation ) but penalty kill save percentage is still often based on very few shots .
Thanks to some recent work by Gabriel Desjardins , we can see just how much penalty kill save percentage , even over an entire season ( or two seasons ! ) tends to regress toward league average .
Thus , a very high save percentage on the PK is an indication that a goaltender 's overall save percentage has a good chance of declining as the season goes on and a very low save percentage on the PK is an indication that a goaltender 's overall save percentage has a very good chance of increasing as the season goes on .
Already by January 9th we had begun to see this regression take place .
After the jump we 'll take another look at what our leaders have done since December 8th and which goalies might look better than they are as we ( well , some of " you " I suppose ) head into the playoffs .
Just by way of reminder , the average save percentage on the penalty kill is something close to .866 ( thanks to Tyler Dellow for that ) .
So all of the " goals saved above average " numbers have used .866 as average .
Here are the results for the guys who were on top in December , both from the start to December 8th and then from December 9th until today :
So as we can see the leaders on December 8th have been varying degrees of worse since then and some of them have taken big falls .
Some of the teams they play for have also taken a corresponding big fall .
The Thrashers , Bruins , Oilers and Islanders all have n't fared as well since December and the amount of pucks going in on the PK is one of the ( often many ) reasons why .
Pavelec 's performance is the biggest turnaround .
There 's an 11 - goal difference between his performance on the PK in the first half and his performance in the second half .
That 's an awful lot of ground to make up for anyone and the Thrashers are n't exactly long on talent .
Over an entire season , the sample gets a little bit larger and we can put a little bit more confidence in the numbers , especially as the extreme outliers tend to come back to the mean .
It 's like the difference between a goalie 's overall save percentage after five or six games ( not all that meaningful ) compared to that same stat over ten or fifteen games ( still not great , but it 's going to be better ) .
So let 's look at which potential playoff goalies have the highest PK save percentage and who might be over - rated heading into the playoffs :
Avalanche fans will be pleased to see that I 'm not calling on them to be one of the team 's most likely to be hit by a regression ... although Anderson is next on the list .
At any rate , these are the teams for whom goaltending has been a strength but may not be quite as good as it's looked .
The teams that should probably be the most worried about this are Ottawa , Detroit and Philadelphia because they 're all relying on goalies who do n't have a particularly strong track record in the NHL .
And for Oiler fans , we can be secure in knowing that our goalies are not worse than they appear , at least because of this .
Jeff Deslauriers now sits right around league average at .870 , Nikolai Khabibulin was a somewhat below average .846 before his injury and Devan Dubnyk is a worse - than - Vesa - Toskala .784 .
So , uh , yay ?
Mr Gough completed his first naked ramble across Britain in 2003 .
He was arrested 15 times during the journey and spent 140 nights in jail , mainly in Scotland where the authorities take a stricter approach to public nudity than in England and Wales .
He finished his second hike with his then girlfriend Melanie Roberts three years later .
VIERA , Fla . --
Outfielder Elijah Dukes was released by the Washington Nationals on Wednesday , a sudden move with 2 1 / 2 weeks left in spring training .
" I do n't know what to say .
It felt a little funny , " Dukes said told The Associated Press as he packed his car at the team hotel Wednesday afternoon .
" I guess I was n't expecting it .
...
That 's part of baseball .
No big deal , no hard feelings .
Just part of the game . "
The 25 - year - old Dukes was expected to be Washington 's starting right fielder this season , but the Nationals announced the decision before their exhibition game at the Houston Astros .
Wednesday was the last day the Nationals could put him on waivers and pay him 30 days ' termination pay at the minor league rate of his split contract instead of 45 days at the major league rate .
So he is owed a little under $ 41,000 , instead of about $ 109,000 , which he would have been due had he been released later in spring training .
Manager Jim Riggleman , general manager Mike Rizzo and team president Stan Kasten all emphasized that the move was based on Dukes ' performance and was not connected to any off - the - field issues .
Rizzo , though , did say he thinks Dukes ' departure improves the team 's makeup .
" Elijah was great , " Riggleman said .
" He 's done his work .
He 's got no issues .
It 's just a baseball decision . "
Asked if any off - the - field incident could have precipitated his release , Dukes said : " Nothing happened .
If something had happened , I 'd know about it . "
Indeed , while with Washington , Dukes appeared to have put his troubled past behind him .
He had suspensions in the majors and the minors for various confrontations with umpires , coaches and teammates while in Tampa Bay 's organization ; arrests for assault and for marijuana possession ; and paternity suits .
Crunch Time for the Banking Cartel
Who Wins the Great War ? - “ Just over a year ago , the United States underwent a seemingly radical change , seemingly overnight .
Its financial system had been revealed as insolvent under the weight of huge liabilities and worthless assets .
The government refused to allow all the bankrupt institutions to fail , and thus permit the market to do its job of purging the rot from the system .
Instead , the authorities saved their favorites , effectively merging bank with state .
They did so under cover of a witches ’ brew of subsidies , guarantees and quasi-nationalizations bearing bizarre acronyms like TARP ; PDCF ; TAF ; TSLF ; and my personal favorite , the ABCPMMFLF , otherwise known as the Asset - Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Fund Liquidity Facility .
And those were just the visible programs .
The Fed , our central bank , dropped interest rates to zero and monetized additional trillions of dollars worth of problem assets , away from prying eyes .
The nature and source of these assets remain matters of speculation , because the Fed to this day refuses to tell us what it bought and from whom .
When the smoke cleared , we Americans found ourselves the subjects of a gangster state , in thrall to a clutch of greedy , corrupt and incompetent banks which only days before had failed .
We were now the guarantors of trillions of dollars in worthless assets that had generated billions in profits for those same banks in recent years .
Their gains remained their gains ; but their losses were now our losses .
Our money , the reserve currency of the world , was now backed by toxic waste .
The events of last fall were , to all appearances , a bloodless coup , taking us from freedom to fascism virtually overnight . ”
Viva la Restoration Remarks of Robert K. Landis , finews.ch Gold Conference Zurich , Switzerland , November 17 , 2009
For years now , ( at least since the U.S. Congress authorized establishment of the Working Group on Financial Markets in 1987 ) the evidence has become increasingly convincing that a Fed - led Cartel * has been intervening in most Major Markets , and not just in the Gold and Silver Markets .
But The Cartel ’s Special Focus has been Intervention in the Precious Metals Markets , regularly successfully taking down the prices of Gold and Silver .
The Motivation for this is clear .
To the degree that Gold and Silver become increasingly Widely recognized as the Ultimate Measures and Stores of value , they delegitimize the Cartel ’s * Fiat ( Colored Paper – Intrinsic Value Zero ) Currencies and Treasury Securities .
* We encourage those who doubt the scope and power of Overt and Covert Interventions by a Fed-led Cartel of Key Central Bankers and Favored Financial Institutions to read Deepcaster ’s December , 2008 Letter containing a summary overview of Intervention entitled “ A Strategy for Profiting from the Cartel ’s Dark Interventions & Evolving Techniques ” and Deepcaster ’s July , 2009 Letter entitled " A Strategy For Profiting From The Cartel ’s Dark Interventions & Evolving Techniques - II " in the “ Latest Letter ” Cache at www.deepcaster.com.
Also consider the substantial evidence collected by the Gold AntiTrust Action Committee at www.gata.org for information on precious metals price manipulation .
Virtually all of the evidence for Intervention has been gleaned from publicly available records .
Deepcaster ’s profitable recommendations displayed at www.deepcaster.com have been facilitated by attention to these “ Interventionals . ”
To Date , The Cartel has not lost a round in their repeated attacks to take down Gold and Silver prices ( see Deepcaster ’s Free Reports available at www.deepcaster.com), or in their Interventions in other Major Markets either , for that matter .
BUT , The Cartel ’s Interventional Regime is now under unprecedented pressure .
Does the recent all - time - nominal high in Gold indicate the Cartel is finally losing Control ?
What about the many signs that The Cartel is still in control of Gold and Silver ( and Equities and Crude Oil ) prices ?
The Consequences of either result ( continued Cartel Control , or lost Cartel Control ) will be profound .
For example , If The Cartel has , for the first time , lost control , Gold could , and arguably should , go to $ 6,300 / oz .
soon .
The $ 6,300 / oz .
figure comes from no less an Establishment Figure than Dylan Grice , investment analyst at the French Investment Bank Societe Generale .
( It is the price of Gold at which the $ 1.7 Trillion Fed Monetary Base would be fully Gold - backed . )
So let ’s listen in on a Debate between “ BUT ” and “ OTOH ” ( On The Other Hand ) regarding whether The Cartel has or has not lost control .
Our Profits and Wealth Protection depend on the Result .
OTOH , if The Cartel has lost control , why has Gold not already exceeded its inflation - adjusted 1980 high ( approximately $ 2,300 / oz ) , given the unprecedented Uncertainties and Disasters in the financial markets in recent months .
BUT the Bank of India recently bought 200 Tonnes of Gold , confirming India ’s Cultural View that Gold is the historic Store and Measure of Value .
Such Central Bank purchases put upward pressure on the demand for and price of physical Gold , and will continue to .
OTOH , the Central Banks have used Gold and Silver Purchases as the Ultimate Weapon to support their Treasury Securities and Fiat Currencies .
That is , recent Central Bank Buying could be for the purpose such buying has served the Central Banks in the Past – after buying , they all Sell in concert to drive down prices , thus plundering the longs .
And if the U.S. Dollar Bounces , even temporarily , Gold , Silver , Equities and Commodities will be impelled downward and fast .
BUT in spite of all the foregoing , Gold has been making record Nominal Highs in recent Weeks .
OTOH
The Cartel still has in place a wholly panoply of Interventional Tools – TOMOS , POMOS , TARP FUNDS , TSLF Lending , PDCF funds etc .
This Interventional Arsenal has not gone away .
Rather , Congress strengthened it via all the Bailouts , etc. bills .
BUT the unprecedented liquidity which has been and increasingly is pumped into the economy via everything from Bailouts to Borrowings , virtually guarantees the U.S. Dollar Price of Equities , Precious Metals , and other commodities is up .
OTOH the recent appreciation in nominal U.S. Dollar value of Precious Metals is illusionary , the Dollar having lost over 35 % of its purchasing power over the last seven years , basis the USDX .
Besides , the Real Numbers are very different from the bogus Official Statistics .
Consider the Real Numbers as calculated by Shadowstats.com , which determines them the old fashioned way there were determined before their serious political manipulation began in the 1980 ’s and 1990’s .
Official Numbers vs. Real Numbers
Annual Consumer Price Inflation reported November 18 , 2009
- 0.18 % 7.13 % ( annualized November Rate )
U.S. Unemployment reported November 6 , 2009
10.2 % 22.1 %
U.S. GDP Annual Growth / Decline reported November 24 , 2009
- 2.51 % - 5.71 %
The Cartel Controls the Statistics and the Markets .
BUT , that ongoing debasement of the U.S. Dollar simply guarantees that the Real Price of Gold and Silver will continue to rise .
They are Real Money .
The Fiat U.S. Dollar and other Fiat Currencies are Not .
OTOH , if Shadowstats is correct we are in a Deepening Depression and all Real Assets including Gold , Silver and Crude Oil decrease in price during a Depression .
BUT , Prices of key Real Assets have been either increasing , or flat , and not decreasing , in the last few months .
OTOH , The Cartel has held Real Assets such as Crude Oil in a Trading range for Weeks Crude has traded between $ 77 bbl and $ 83 bbl since mid-October .
For example , the Silver Price has been non-confirming of Gold ’s rise .
It is still below its approximate $ 22 21st Century record high .
The Cartel is still in control .
Moreover the performance of the Gold shares basis the HUI , has been underwhelming at best , non - confirming Gold Bullions rise .
BUT the Real Numbers show that CPI is still over 7 % notwithstanding all the deflationary pressures of the last year and a half .
In these circumstances Gold and Silver are Bound to Continue to rise regardless of the Rigged Numbers .
And The Fed must increasingly Monetize ( Buy ) U.S. Treasury Debt since U.S. creditors of China and Japan increasingly unwilling to do so , further impelling Gold and Silver higher .
Indeed , the U.S. Treasury will have to finance $ 3 Trillion of Maturing Debt in the next 12 months .
In addition , the U.S. owes Foreign Creditors at least $ 1.3 Trillion in the next 12 months .
No amount of Intervention can overcome these Realities .
OTOH , if The Cartel had lost control Gold would be above its 1980 Inflation - adjusted high , and Silver would have shot above its 21st Century $ 22 high .
BUT , Gold and Silver are headed above those highs rapidly .
We interrupt this debate here because it could continue indefinitely .
Deepcaster does , it must be said , come down on one side of this debate .
His Conclusion ( Takedown or No Takedown ) Forecasts and Recommendations are available in his latest Letter and Alerts in the “ Latest Letter ” cache and “ Alerts Cache ” at www.deepcaster.com.
But Deepcaster ’s Key Conclusion is : It is Crunch Time for The Cartel .
If they do not Control and Takedown Gold and Silver Prices in the Next Few Weeks they will have been seriously wounded .
Regardless of which side of the debate the reader favors , there are a few crucial facts on which most open - minded observers should agree .
And these facts are crucial to profitable Investing and Trading decisions during Crunch Time for the Cartel .
-- Regardless of whether The Cartel ultimately loses or wins , it will continue to try to manipulate the Markets .
And that will continue to make it essential to monitor the Interventionals , ( as well as the Fundamentals and Technicals ) as Deepcaster does .
--
There will be no quick Recovery -- Past Corporate Earnings and Economic Growth have been generated mainly from ever - increasing Consumer and business spending , and that spending has been enabled mainly by increasing debt .
-- But Consumer Debt can expand no more with Real Unemployment at 21.1 % and ARM rates Resets , and thus foreclosures , rising for two more years at least .
-- And Government spending will increasingly be limited , with decreasing tax revenues and decreasing creditors ’ willingness and ability to buy government debt .
-- With the Consumer on the Sidelines what would Make Earnings Increase .
Exports ?
NAFTA et. al. have wounded the U.S. manufacturing base .
And the lower Dollar wo n’t help .
China ’s Yuan still moves in lockstep with the U.S. Dollar .
-- Yet record Multi-Trillion past , present , and future Expenditures and borrowings , virtually guarantee future price inflation .
So Economic Activity is likely headed Down and Inflation up .
A recipe for pure Stagflation , or more likely , an Inflationary Depression .
We hope for the best , and prepare for the Worst .

( CNN ) -- Paula Sladewski , a 26 - year - old who once modeled for Playboy , was identified Wednesday by Miami police as the person found dead and " burned beyond recognition " in a trash bin on Sunday .
Now , police are asking for the public 's help to put her killer behind bars .
Whoever the murderer is , police said , they are nothing short of a " monster . "
" It 's so horrific .
They 'd have to be a monster .
It 's a dastardly act , " North Miami police spokesman Lt. Neal Cuevas told CNN .
" It 's the most heinous thing that a person can do to another person . "
Sladewski's body was found Sunday night after firefighters extinguished flames coming from a large trash bin near a propane business .
When they put out the fire , they saw a body .
But there was barely any way to identify it .
" It was just total , total , disfigurement , " Cuevas told CNN .
" You could n't even tell that it was a woman or a man or even what race . "
Cuevas , who was in the area when the call came in , said the trash bin and body were still smoldering when he arrived .
Police were able to identify the body through dental records late Tuesday night , he said .
Police are trying to figure out how a model from Michigan , who appeared in a 2003 Playboy video , ended up burned beyond recognition inside the trash bin -- and who put her there .
" This was a brutal , horrible , disgusting murder , and this monster or these monsters need to be brought to justice , " Cuevas said .
The only timeline police have comes from Sladewski's boyfriend , who was vacationing with her .
Because he was the last one to see her , police are considering him a person of interest , but he has not been named as a suspect .
Police said they would consider whoever was the last known person to see her alive a person of interest .
Right now , they have no suspects , Cuevas said .
The boyfriend is " devastated and traumatized " by news of the death , said his attorney , Marc Beginin .
" He desperately wants this crime solved and anybody involved brought to justice , " Beginin said .
The boyfriend , whom police did not identify , reported Sladewski missing to police and also tried to find her by calling hospitals and jails , interviewing people and hiring a private investigator , Beginin said .
The boyfriend also has met with investigators for 12 hours , the attorney said .
" The Miami police are pursuing all leads and doing their jobs .
However , ultimately , he does n't need to be a person of interest , " he said .
The couple arrived in Miami on Thursday to ring in the new year by watching Lady Gaga perform , police said .
Cuevas told CNN that Sladewski's boyfriend said they went to Club Space on Saturday and remained until about 7 a.m.
Sunday , when they got into an argument .
When he was thrown out of the club after the altercation , Sladewski decided to stay , her boyfriend told police .
That was the last time her boyfriend saw her , according to police .
Cuevas said when Sladewski did not return to their hotel by Monday , her boyfriend called police and filed a missing person report .
Sladewski's sister , Kelly Farris , was battling back tears at a news conference Wednesday night .
She said her sister had been dating the man for about two years , and he had called her Monday to say she was missing .
Farris said she had last seen her sister , who lived in Michigan and California , at Christmas .
" She loved life , she was full of life , " Farris said , beginning to sob .
" She went on a lot of vacations .
She was a great person . "
Farris said her family was devastated by the news of Sladewski's death , especially given the nature of how she was found .
" I could n't imagine anything like this happening , you know , " Farris said .
" We can't even give her an open casket .
We can't even see her again . "
Farris pleaded with anyone who saw her sister at the club or afterward to contact police .
" She did not deserve to die in this way , " she said .
And until her sister 's killer is found , Farris said she can't imagine what she will do .
" I can't see myself going back to work , " Farris said .
" I can't see myself living a normal life until I know whoever did this pays for it . "
AFTER a five - month absence to deal with his personal tribulations , Tiger Woods announced on March 16th that he would return to playing professional golf at this year 's US Masters tournament in April .
Sports stars have had mixed fortunes when returning to competition after a break .
This week Michael Schumacher , who raced a Formula One car for the first time after a three - and - a - half year retirement , finished sixth in the Bahrain grand prix .
George Foreman spent ten years as a pastor before getting back in the ring to regain the world heavyweight boxing crown at the age of 45 .
But Bjorn Borg , almost unbeatable in his day , made an ill - advised comeback to the tennis courts , losing every match with his old wooden racquets against competitors armed with more modern equipment .

The U.N. Development Programme estimates that less than 1 percent of the need for wheelchairs in developing countries is met by local production , partly because small workshops ca n’t exploit economies of scale to be profitable .
Moreover , the wheelchairs that are available are n’t designed for people who must push themselves over rough roads and muddy walking paths often encountered in the Third World .
As a result , millions of people must rely on others to carry them or be stranded inside their homes .
What is needed is an affordable device that can carry users comfortably and efficiently off - road , but is also small and maneuverable enough to use indoors .
Amos Winter , a PhD candidate in mechanical engineering , along with a team of undergraduates and international design collaborators , has designed such a device , which he describes as performing like a combination of a desk chair and a mountain bike — " something you can comfortably sit in all day and maneuver around the office , but also use to efficiently commute to and from work . ”
Constructed from widely available , cheap bicycle parts , the Leveraged Freedom Chair ( LFC ) features two large levers attached to a bicycle drivetrain that helps the chair power through mud and over rocky paths .
Winter recently returned from East Africa , where he spent three weeks in January surveying six disabled people who had tested prototypes of the LFC .
Using feedback from the four - month trial , as well as a $ 50,000 grant he recently received from the Inter - American Development Bank ( IADB ) , Winter is currently tweaking the LFC design in anticipation of advancing it to large - scale production , which would provide local manufacturers with the tools to produce 500 to 1,000 units per month .
According to the U.S. Agency for International Development , 20 million people in developing countries require wheelchairs ;
Winter estimates that 70 percent of those people live in rural areas where regular wheelchairs simply do n’t work .
He has been studying the problem of wheelchair production in Third World countries since the summer of 2005 , when he traveled to Tanzania on a public - service fellowship and saw firsthand how wheelchairs that rely on hand - rim propulsion are too difficult to use on rough terrain and for long - distance travel .
He also learned that hand - powered tricycles are too big to use indoors and usually have only one gear .
His solution “ for people who grew up in a village where they were literally dragging themselves to school ” is the LFC .
By pushing two levers located on each side of the LFC , a user can change mechanical advantage by simply moving hand position in order to go fast on flat ground or to produce enough torque to travel over sand or through mud .
The removable levers hook into a bicycle drivetrain that has been converted to work on a wheelchair and is made entirely of bicycle parts that can be found throughout the developing world .
This means that the LFC can be made and repaired anywhere one has access to a hacksaw , welder , drill and vice .
Winter has been developing the design ever since the concept won the MIT IDEAS Competition in 2008 , partly in conjunction with a wheelchair design class he teaches at MIT ’s Mobility Lab .
Winter founded this lab in 2007 so MIT students could collaborate with local manufacturers and experts from the developed world to produce mobility aid technologies .
One of those experts is Matt McCambridge , a designer for Whirlwind Wheelchair International , a San Francisco - based nonprofit that produces durable , low - cost wheelchairs in developing countries .
McCambridge likes the simplicity of the LFC design , but says he has been most impressed with the intentionally slow , methodical implementation of the LFC .
He praised Winter for conducting user testing early , “ rather than inventing something in the lab , then using donor money to make thousands of them and forcing them on disabled people who really have no option but to smile and say , ‘ thank you . ’ ” McCambridge believes that Winter ’s process should produce solid results that grow slowly .
The implementation began last summer , when Winter launched his first trial in East Africa with collaboration from the Association for the Physically Disabled of Kenya .
He and Mario Bollini ‘ 09 , Danielle DeLatte ‘ 11 , Benjamin Judge ‘ 11 and Harrison O’Hanley ‘ 11 , spent a month in Kenya building eight prototypes of the LFC .
Each chair cost slightly less than $ 200 to make , which Winter said is roughly the price of a regular wheelchair in Kenya .
Weighing about 65 pounds , or five to 10 pounds more than a regular wheelchair , the LFC was customized for the trial participants , who range in age and live near varied terrain in Kenya , Tanzania and Uganda .
Winter returned to Africa with MIT senior Tish Scolnik four months later to interview the participants and test the efficiency of the LFC for each user .
What they learned from the “ phenomenal feedback ” is that although the LFC is more efficient than a regular wheelchair for plowing through mud and over big stones , it is still too wide and heavy .
Winter will make the chair lighter by lowering the seat four inches and shifting the wheels back two inches , which will eliminate the need for the bulky mounting brackets that are currently used to attach the rear wheels to the chair .
In addition to reducing the width and weight , Winter will focus on improving the LFC for indoor use so that it functions just as well as a normal wheelchair when the levers are removed .
He uses the desk chair / mountain bike analogy to describe how the LFC is intended to be used all day .
Although someone might spend many hours each day sitting in a desk chair , it would be horrible to use that chair to commute to work , especially if the commute involved dirt roads .
Similarly , while the mountain bike would be great for the commute , it would be awkward and uncomfortable to sit on all day at the office .
“ What we have now is an LFC that is great off - road and is comfortable to sit on , but is still too big to comfortably use indoors , ” Winter said .
With the trial results , guidance from manufacturing collaborators and help from a group from his design class , Winter will use the IADB grant to design a new prototype and produce about 30 chairs for another trial that will begin in August in Guatemala .
One crucial goal of the trip is to develop the manufacturing equipment that will be used to build the chairs for large - scale production , which Winter hopes will begin in 2011 .
Until then , he continues to review the feedback from the East African users , including Abdullah Munish , a Tanzanian spinal injury survivor who lives in a hilly town with rough roads and who has tested various wheelchairs over the past decade .
Munish said that in terms of capability and functionality , the LFC is “ number one ” compared to other wheelchairs .
“ It is strong and stable in African terrain , and you can travel long distances and uphill without using too much energy , ” he told Winter .
“ I would say that we have [ a ] life saver … I just call it my little angel machine . ”

BBC News , Jerusalem
As relations between Britain and Israel continue to unravel , in Jerusalem many Israelis feel that the outside world still fails to understand the problems - and threats - their country is facing .
Uzi Arad is a very important man .
He 's now the director of Israel 's National Security Council , and National Security Adviser to the prime minister - a position he 's held since Benjamin Netanyahu took office .
Uzi Arad 's cordial relationship with Britain 's MI6 is no longer Uzi Arad has a reputation for fighting fiercely and territorially among the sharp edges that exist at the height of the Israeli power pyramid .
He was always hospitable whenever I , on occasion , used to visit him at home - before he took up his current job .
He 'd spent more than 20 years in Mossad - Israel 's secret intelligence service , and before he was appointed one of its directors , he was stationed for a time in London .
Once , at his house , he took me into his expansive library .
He reached onto a shelf and extracted a book called Mandarin - the memoirs of the British diplomat Sir Nicholas Henderson .
Uzi Arad opened the inside front cover .
There , in green ink , was an inscription : " To Uzi , with the thanks and appreciation of your British friends for your co-operation and help and best wishes for the future . "
The message was signed C - the initial that has always denoted the head of Her Majesty 's Secret Intelligence Service .
' Does n't look good '
Such cordiality evaporated this week with the expulsion of a senior Israeli London - based diplomat who , by common consent , appears to have been the Mossad London station chief .
The Government 's anger was stoked by the apparent use of fake British passports in the assassination of the top Hamas operative Mahmoud al - Mabhouh in Dubai in January .
In the careful language of the Foreign Secretary , David Miliband , the Serious Organised Crime Agency " was drawn to the conclusion that the passports used were copied from genuine British passports when handed over for inspection to individuals linked to Israel , either in Israel or in other countries " .
It does n't take much for the gales of public opinion to blow in Israel - and barely had David Miliband finished his statement in Westminster than the gusts a continent away began whipping .
Mahmoud al - Mabhouh and his alleged asassins were caught on CCTV A right - wing Israeli Member of Parliament reached into strangely Maoist terminology , and called the British " dogs " .
A commentator in a right - of - centre newspaper argued that " millions of Muslims live in Britain , and Gordon Brown needs their votes in the upcoming elections " .
At the other end of Israel 's brightly coloured political spectrum , a resident of one of the country 's most stalwartly socialist kibbutzim , or rural collectives , e-mailed me to say that " if Israel was directly or indirectly involved in the Dubai incident then there 's no limit , apparently , to the arrogance and stupidity of this regime / administration " .
But between the howls and harrumphs there were quieter noises .
Some dwindled quickly into silence , and I found the voices I normally turn to in the Israeli intelligence community politely declining to speak or hanging up after the briefest of " it does n't look good " comments .
One diplomat with a close connection to London did allow himself to be slightly more phlegmatic .
" This is a standard dance the British have to go through , " he told me .
" Of course , they wo n't admit it .
They 'll sell it hard .
But I see no reason for them or for us to shift gears over bilateral co-operation . "
Fundamental point
What is clear is that few Israelis are shedding tears for Mahmoud al - Mabhouh .
On a street - corner in Jerusalem , half - way between the prime minister 's residence and the official home of the president , Eitan was drawing heavily on a cigarette , outside his shop .
" Personally , I do n't like violence , " Eitan told me .
" But the thing is , Hamas does n't want to talk .
And if someone is going to hit you , then sometimes you have to hit them first . "
Behind Eitan 's shrug is a wide belief in Israel that the rest of the world does n't quite get it - that Israel is the only homeland the Jews have , that it 's small and that it 's trying to survive in a hostile neighbourhood .
Despite US displeasure , the building of a Jewish settlement continues
It 's that feeling which fuels the declamation " Jerusalem is not a settlement " , repeated this week in Washington by Benjamin Netanyahu - and that the Israeli government will carry on building in the city wherever it chooses , even if that means the occupied territory of East Jerusalem , amid growing American displeasure .
And that is the much more fundamental point here .
There may be a moment of iciness between Britain and Israel over the forged passports .
Mossad London station chiefs may not , in the near future , receive cosy book inscriptions from the boss of MI6 .
But Israel 's belief in its exceptionalism , and the impatience currently shown by two of its closest allies , may point to a deeper rupture .

Karl has finally done it .
The wordmeister has been hoisted with his own petard .
The master of imagery and message has bungled it big time .
With all the world watching as he channeled Glenn Beck , Rove admitted the real reason Republicants are dead set against health insurance reform .
Debating David Plouffe on This Week , Rove lost his footing and stepped in it all the way up to his second chin :
For God 's sake , will you stop throwing around epitaphs and deal with the facts for once , David ?
Wow .
Look up " Freudian slip " in the dictionary and you will find Rove 's picture next to it .
No doubt about it .
This was a slip of epic proportions .
The best part ?
It fits like a glove .
SOCIALISM - The Real History from Plato to the Present : How the Deep State Capitalizes on Crises to Consolidate Control
Digital is no longer just a category of media — it ’s become core to our lives .
Understanding this shift in consumer behaviour is central to every brand ’s success .
As this landscape and our client needs evolved , so have we .
Future - proofing our clients ’ businesses over the past two decades has taught us that data trumps conjecture and that a clear line of sight to your consumer ’s needs , desires and behaviours is the cornerstone of a brand that ’s worth their time , attention and affection .
However , data alone wo n’t do .
Insights must inspire an intentional and calculated effort by a mass of people , disciplines and talents to deliver an emotive , undeniable and captivating performance that elicits a powerful response with your audience .
Brands built on this merger of insight and intuition are the ones that connect with people and outlast the competition .
What software do you use ?
For the actual creation of the work I use Illustrator and 3ds Max with either Vray or defult scanline as the renderer - depending on what style and vibe I want the work to have .
For comp'ing I use Photoshop and After effects .
That being said i think you can use any software you like as it is n't about what program you use , it 's what you do with it .

Many people are familiar with the famous quotation by President John F. Kennedy , “ Life is unfair . ”
But few people today remember or know the context of this quote .
It was something he said , in part , with respect to what would become the Vietnam War .
In 1961 , the newly - elected president decided to send more than a thousand American “ military advisors ” to South Vietnam , where the pro-Western regime of President Ngo Dinh Diem faced mounting threats from Communist insurgents and the North Vietnamese army .
In 1962 , Kennedy increased the American presence in Vietnam to nearly 10,000 troops .
When Army reservists began being called up to serve there , after recently being stationed on another Cold War front in West Berlin , some complained that they had “ done their time ” and expressed their resentment by holding public demonstrations .
One reservist even began a hunger strike .
President Kennedy was asked about this opposition during a press conference held on March 21 , 1962 .
He responded by saying that calling up the reservists “ strengthened the foreign policy of the United States . ”
After making this political point , Kennedy waxed philosophical .
“ There is always inequity in life , ” he said .
“ Some men are killed in a war and some men are wounded , and some men never leave the country , and some men are stationed in the Antarctic and some are stationed in San Francisco .
It ’s very hard in military or in personal life to assure complete equality .
Life is unfair . ”
Since then , those last three words have often been quoted , generally without any context .
When put into the original context , this quote might not fit the liberal image of JFK that many people have .
In fact , Kennedy was a committed Cold Warrior .
He essentially accepted the “ Domino theory ” articulated by his predecessor , President Dwight D. Eisenhower , and believed the spread of Communism needed to be stopped — by military means if necessary .
Thus , Kennedy shared Eisenhower ’s concern that a potential takeover of South Vietnam by Communists could cause more “ falling dominos ” in Southeast Asia .
Eisenhower was the first president to send American servicemen to Vietnam .
In the early 1950s , he sent a handful of U.S. “ military advisors ” there to aid France in its unsuccessful effort to keep Vietnam as a colony .
After the French were ousted and Vietnam was split into South and North Vietnam in 1954 , Eisenhower sent more “ military advisors ” to help support Ngo Dinh Diem ’s fledgling government in South Vietnam .
But the numbers were still relatively small ; from 750 to 1,500 U.S. servicemen between 1955 and 1960 .
When Kennedy became president , he took more significant steps toward getting the U.S. entangled in what we now call the Vietnam War .
In 1961 , he sent 3,200 American “ military advisors ” to South Vietnam .
He increased that number in 1962 .
By the time of his assassination on November 22 , 1963 , Kennedy had sent a total of more than 16,000 U.S. servicemen to Vietnam and more than 100 had been killed .
Kennedy ’s successor Lyndon Baines Johnson dramatically escalated U.S. involvement in Vietnam .
By 1968 , LBJ had committed more than half a million US troops to the war .
When Richard M. Nixon became president in 1969 , he began to withdraw American troops , pushed the South Vietnamese government to increasingly fight the war on its own and entered fruitless peace negotiations with the North Vietnamese .
Nixon resigned in 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal and Gerald Ford became president .
By that time there were only a small number of American troops left in Vietnam .
Most were there primarily to guard the U.S. embassy in Saigon .
Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese on April 30 , 1975 , bringing the Vietnam War to an ignominious end .
More than 58,000 American servicemen and women were killed during the course of the war .
Somewhere between 1 and 3 million North and South Vietnamese men , women and children were killed .
Ultimately , all of those deaths did not prevent Communists from controlling South Vietnam .
Today , nobody in the U.S. seems to care that Vietnam is a Communist state .
Life , as President Kennedy noted , is unfair .

This is an awesome topic that I love to share with people whenever I can .
Innovation is something that can be thought of in several different ways , however there are good ways , and then there are better ones .
Innovation can be basically anything that solves a problem that has not been previously solved , or it can be something that solves a problem that was previously solved , while solving other problems at the same time ( these are the better ones ) .
There are really two perspectives into innovating .
One is purely the scientific aspect of it .
The physics , the research , the testing , the technology .
Then there is the practical , social side of innovating , which does not always agree with the scientific side .
The process of innovation should contain both views , almost at the same time .
It is not enough to innovate and solve one problem technically , while socially creating another problem .
A quick example of this may very well be gas powered vehicles .
They ’ve solved a huge problem in enabling faster travel , but they ’ve also caused a sort of social dilemma , because people are almost forced to use them in some fashion , and they are now proven to have negative impacts on air quality and perhaps weather .
Innovation should be approached from the view of the true designer : the architect , who builds not only for aesthetics , but for purpose , and function .
The architect builds for the social function , while utilizing the best scientific practices and innovations available .
But the purpose is always foremost , for the people .
People are weird .
They do not really seem to fit any set pattern as a whole .
There is an infinite variation , and this must be accounted for in design .
Innovations when designed for people , tend to solve the most problems , and leave the least behind .
The best innovations , the truly beautiful ones , seem to leave no problems behind , and just fit , like a puzzle piece finally being snapped into place .
When designing Beat - Play ’s music search solution , I ended up solving several social problems :
How do I find new music ?
How do I find good music ?
How do I not waste time searching for music ?
The way I solved these problems was to think about it from the approach of the social first .
The first step is always to survey what already exists .
I studied the different methods of how music was found and shared now .
I found some methods that were better than others , and I looked at the best ones , and searched out the problems there .
It turned out that I found some .
The best solutions available at this point for finding music are Pandora or Last.fm , where the music is suggested and played for you , allowing you time to focus on other things .
This is a great innovation , but I saw flaws .
It went right back to thinking socially .
Pandora finds songs based on other songs , using basically scientific data and variables to link songs together into an automated playlist .
This I knew , was the wrong way to think about it .
People are not defined by any given variable .
They are defined by many variables that vary all the time .
Music is no different .
It is a mere extension of people .
There needed to be a social way for people to find music .
So my idea came to me almost rather simply .
It was to use social networks , and people to create a user ’s playlist , instead of a computer .
On Beat - Play you can follow friends or favorite bands , who you share a taste in music with , and who are infinitely as variable as you are ; and the music those people like enough to save , will automatically get played in your radio .
This enables you to find the best new music literally as simply as a mouse click , without searching through mounds of bad music , wasting hours before finding a good song .
And it keeps you updated .
Also this method does not limit a person ’s playlist to one genre of music , or a certain group of artists , like Pandora does , unless the user wants these limits on .
This solution is so beautiful because it solves several other problems at the same time .
When you hear music on your radio coming from your friend ’s playlists , if you like it , you save it into one of your playlists , and it then gets sent to anybody following you .
For the best artists , this is an amazing way for fans to spread the music for them .
It ’s actually a form of free promotion and distribution in addition to being a much better way for fans to find the music .
It can even be a great way for artists to gain advertising revenue by tracking plays , which could then result in the best music being free .
The more the people love and share the music for free , the more the artists will get paid , making everyone happy , and rendering piracy irrelevant !
That is what I mean by snapping in a puzzle piece .
This solution fits on all sides , perfectly with it ’s surroundings .
This solution came by simply analyzing the environment that the innovation must exist in , which is always an incredibly social one .
If we inject this social perspective into our innovations , we can adapt what we know about the scientific , physical stuff , to coincide with the social factors , to form the ultimate solutions .
Design thinking is an extremely powerful thing , especially when approached in the right way .
The formula is simple : Search out the problems , and then fix them , integrating what you know both about the social and scientific or technological environments currently present .
If you do that , you will do great things .
Innovation is everyone ’s responsibility .
There are too many problems for us not to all try and solve them .
Good luck .
Think social !

The new government agencies that will be created as the result of Obamacare will worsen the quality of American medical care by restricting physicians and hospitals to use their best judgment , according to Rep .
Tom Price , R - Ga. , a physician and chairman of the Republican Study Committee .
In fact , he says , the bill would create 159 new governemnt agencies to regulate insurance and medical care for Americans .
Writing for AOL News , Price says in an op -ed that the healthcare overhaul being contemplated by House Democrats will sacrifice “ the quality of health care that has made this nation 's practice of medicine the envy of the world . ”
“ Quality remains one of the six principles of patient - centered health care that Republicans have advocated , ” Price writes .
“ Yet , all Americans find in the Democrats ' government - centered vision are various boards of bureaucrats -- not practicing physicians -- determining what is considered quality care . ”
The plan will take away the right of individuals to make the best decisions about their healthcare in consultation with their physician .
“ An individual patient is far better served when health care decisions are informed by the advice of their doctor , not the dictates of Washington , ” Price writes .
“ So when one reads the details of the legislation pending before Congress and finds the creation of 159 new government offices and programs , there is little else to feel but fear and concern for what will happen to the level of quality care in this country . ”
The GOP has pushed a series of common - sense measures , Price says , that include tort reform and efforts to reduce waste and mismanagement in government programs like Medicare .
“ Republicans are championing reform with no new bureaucratic boards making medical decisions , no $ 500 billion cuts to Medicare , no new mandates , and no one standing between you and your doctor , ” Price writes .
“ We can fix what ails our current system without destroying it if we abide by the principle that quality in health care must not be sacrificed . ”

It 's the second episode of the second series and there 's the usual mix of contributors , reviews and jokes as the news channels continue to provide enough rubbish to make a show out of .
Simon Jenkins fails to acknowledge that the Falklands have moved on ( The Falklands can no longer remain as Britain 's expensive nuisance , 26 February ) .
Argentina 's endeavours to force its colonial ambitions on a small country , against the freely expressed wishes of its people , ignore our basic right to self - determination .
" Anyone who studies the tortuous history and law of the Falklands will know that Argentina 's claim to the islands was certainly strong , " Jenkins says .
But their claim to a territory 300 miles away is neither logical nor valid .
Falklands inhabitants did not replace an indigenous population because there was none .
The islands were claimed by Britain in 1765 , long before Argentina existed as a country , and have been permanently settled since 1833 .
Some families , like mine , can now boast eight or nine generations on the islands .
The Falklands are an overseas territory of the UK , with internal matters governed by a democratically elected legislative assembly , of which I am a member .
Jenkins talks of Argentina regularly protesting about their rights to the islands to " the UN 's decolonisation committee , supported by other post - imperial states in South and North America " .
But the annual vote in this committee is a sham – the Islands are not a colony and the debate there is therefore an irrelevance .
More relevant are the European convention on human rights and the international covenant on civil and political rights , both of which endorse the principles of self - determination .
We have repeatedly attempted to work with Argentina , and agreed a joint declaration on co-operation on oil exploration in 1995 .
This was renounced by Argentina in 2007 .
Co-operation on sustainable fisheries through a joint commission was a way for the Falklands and Argentina to conserve South Atlantic stocks through the exchange of scientific data and the setting of sustainable catch levels .
Argentina not only withdrew from the commission but set unsustainably high quotas in some fish stocks .
Jenkins states that " Argentina has not threatened military action over the Ocean Guardian " ( the oil rig currently drilling in our waters ) .
But it is clear that our large neighbour is attempting to achieve by economic warfare what it failed to achieve by military means .
It has threatened sanctions against companies holding licences to fish in Falklands waters and tried to exclude our representatives from participating at international conferences .
It prevents charter flights from other South American countries flying to the islands , and is now attempting to disrupt our oil exploration by threats to hinder shipping .
These are hardly the acts of a friendly and peaceful neighbour .
We remain eternally grateful to those who liberated us from the Argentine aggression in 1982 .
By referring to that time as " the silliest of wars " , Jenkins insults their memory and diminishes their incredible achievement .
Jenkins believes us to be an " expensive legacy of Empire " .
He should be aware that the Islands are self - financing – except for defence , which is purely because of the continued Argentine claim to my country .
And our government has expressed the wish to contribute more to these costs , should oil be discovered in commercial quantities .
FICO is Shocked by Default Data
FICO , the outfit that computes your vaunted “ credit score , ” has just noticed that consumers with high scores are more likely to default on their mortgages than their credit cards .
Last year , the firm says , folks with FICO scores of 760 or higher defaulted on real estate loans at three times the pace they defaulted on plastic .
This should n’t be any surprise to FICO .
We noticed a few days ago that the number of consumers current on their cards but delinquent on their mortgages exploded by 50 % in the year after Lehman went belly up .
FICO has access to this data in real time .
But it appears flabbergasted by this development , marveling in the first paragraph of a press release that “ most credit cards are unsecured credit and mortgages are secured by real estate . ”
Earth to FICO :
If you ’re in an underwater home , why would n’t you commit strategic default and use the difference between a mortgage payment and rent on a similar home to pay down those cards ?
You might not even have to move if your mortgage lender does n’t want to follow through on foreclosure and book the loss !
Still , FICO ’s CEO told Bloomberg TV he ’s stunned the phenomenon is n’t limited to subprime : “ Now we ’re starting to see at the high end of the marketplace people with good FICO scores having serious delinquency problems . ”
There ’s a hint of panic in the man ’s words , as if he senses his entire business model is going down the toilet .
Good riddance .
Millions of mortgages were issued in the last decade on the basis of nothing more than the “ score ” issued by this company , which reveals exactly nothing about a borrower ’s income , or how his debt load compares to his income .
FICO was n’t the cause of the housing bubble , just a trifling enabler .

An editor here at ProPublica received this " Census " form in the mail last week .
In big , bold letters at the top it announces , " 2010 CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT CENSUS . "
The form even has a " Census Tracking Code . "
But it 's not from the Census Bureau .
It 's actually a survey from the Republican National Committee .
The mailer includes questions such as : " How much does it concern you that the Democrats have total control of the federal government ? "
" Do you think the record trillion dollar federal deficit the Democrats are creating with their out - of - control spending is going to have disastrous consequences of our nation ? "
And , " Do you believe the Obama Administration is right in dramatically scaling back our nation 's military ? "
At the end , it asks for a donation to the Republican Party .
Other people -- including the Democratic governor of Montana and a Democratic representative in Georgia -- have gotten the survey too .
Have you received a faux census recently ?
Fax us a copy at 212-785-2634 .
Or , if you do n't have it on - hand , e-mail us the approximate date , your ZIP code , and any additional information .
The faux Census form does n't appear to be illegal .
The United States Postal Inspection Service 's general counsel reviewed the survey in January and determined that it did not violate the Deceptive Mailings Prevention Act of 1990 ( PDF ) .
The act prohibits any mail from flat - out impersonation of a federal organization .
In this case , using the word Census , even with a capital " C , " does not equate to impersonation of the U.S. Census Bureau , said Pete Rendina , an Inspection Service spokesman .
The survey also does n't appear to violate any Federal Election Commission fundraising rules , said Judith Ingram , FEC spokeswoman , because it includes disclaimers about who is allowed to donate .
But why would the RNC send something under the guise of the Census ?
We called Mark Weiner , the founder of Winning Mark , a progressive - leaning direct - mail campaign consultant , and he said using the term " Census " could earn the document a second glance , thus increasing the response rate and maybe even influencing an independent voter with its slanted questions .
" You 're trying to leverage the most valuable commodity -- other people 's money , " he said .
" This is obviously piggybacked on a lot of advertising around responding to the real Census . "
The RNC did n’t respond to our questions about why it chose to have its survey mimic a Census form .
But spokesman LeRoy Coleman issued this written response : " The document clearly indicates that it is an RNC mailer .
The purpose of this document is to gather Republican opinion from across the country and raise a little money . "
Rep. Carolyn Maloney , D - N.Y. , filed a bill today ( the " Prevent Deceptive Census Look Alike Mailings Act " ) ( PDF ) that would require more prominent disclosures on any mailing that uses the word " census , " although it would n’t outlaw the practice altogether .
Maloney 's office says the congresswoman had filed a complaint about the mailer with the Inspection Service , and she filed her legislation after learning the Inspection Service wo n't be issuing penalties .
The Democratic National Committee told us that it had never sent out anything disguised as a Census form .
But here 's where you come in :
Have you ever received anything like this before , from Republicans , Democrats or a company ?
We 'd like to hear about it .

The " failures of Vietnam " hampered the US in planning for the post - conflict reconstruction of Iraq , the UK inquiry to the war has heard .
Former Defence Secretary John Reid said this " terrible mistake " meant that military chiefs " were n't thinking of detailed nation - building " .
But , he added , the US forces quickly learned their lesson and were now " ahead of " the UK in this respect .
Mr Reid became defence secretary in May 2005 , two years after the invasion .
The insurgency was growing at the time , although Mr Reid said the danger of " civil war " had been exaggerated , and the British press had been " salivating at the prospect " .
' Pulled down pillars '
But the US - instigated disbandment of Saddam Hussein 's civil service had caused problems , as had the disintegration of the Iraqi army .
Mr Reid said : " There was a recognition that , having pulled down the pillars , that this was not going to rise again - this state - like a phoenix from the flames . "
There has been strong criticism of the US for focusing on the war itself and not dealing in sufficient detail with the post - conflict reconstruction of Iraq .
Peter Biles , BBC World Affairs correspondent : John Reid , once a parliamentary enforcer for Tony Blair , has come to the former prime minister 's defence .
He gave a contrasting view of the Blair government to the one portrayed by Clare Short on Tuesday .
Mr Reid said he had had every opportunity to ask questions in cabinet , and had never felt any inhibition in telling Mr Blair he was wrong .
" Some cabinet ministers were constantly telling him he was wrong , " Mr Reid added .
Ms Short , however , had claimed that her views were stifled at the crucial moment in March 2003 when the cabinet received the attorney general 's advice on the legality of the Iraq war .
Mr Reid closed his evidence by recording his " deep sadness at the loss of life " in Iraq .
" There are families who hurt grievously and that 's perfectly understandable , " he said .
It is a shame the bereaved families who came to see Mr Blair give evidence last Friday did not get a similar message of regret .
Mr Reid told the inquiry : " We cannot truly appreciate the US approach to this without also recognising the legacy and the inherited culture of American military doctrine from Vietnam onwards ...
He added that " the US took a view that , as a result of Vietnam , it was not going to be dragged into reconstruction again .
" Because of the failures of Iraq , the terrible mistake was not to recognise that Iraq was not Vietnam , that Afghanistan was not Vietnam .
" The inheritance of that was that American soldiers fought on the battlefield and away from nation - building . "
Former head of US Central Command , general Tommy Franks , was among those whose view had been moulded by the Vietnam experience , Mr Reid said .
However , he added : " I think they did learn it [ the importance of reconstruction ] .
I think they are better at learning than we are .
They are better at critical self - assessment than we are .
In this country we want a stick to beat people with ...
" I think they came from behind us and they are now ahead of us . "
A declassified document released on Tuesday shows defence chiefs warned that sending extra troops to Afghanistan while the UK was still committed in Iraq would lead to " some pain and grief " .
' No overstretched '
In particular , " pinch points " including helicopter support , specialist intelligence and medical provision would remain for longer than had been hoped , a letter sent to Mr Reid says .
Asked at the inquiry whether the decision to move UK troops into Afghanistan 's violent Helmand province in spring 2006 had led to military sources being overstretched , Mr Reid said : " I think we were stretched .
I think we were taut , but my military advice was , ' We are not overstretched .
We can do this '. "

Mr Reid added : " There is only one perfect science and that is hindsight . "
Earlier , the inquiry heard that Gordon Brown , when chancellor , had insisted on a " complete guillotine " of defence spending in December 2003 - just nine months after the invasion of Iraq was launched .
Former Ministry of Defence permanent secretary Sir Kevin Tebbit called the £ 1bn cut " arbitrary " .
He said : " In the December of 2003 , the chancellor of the day instituted a complete guillotine on our settlement , and we were , from then on , controlled by cash rather than resources ...
" It meant that we had to go in for a very major savings exercise . "
But the settlement of 2004 resulted in " almost £ 4bn of extra cash "
This agreement had been reached " at about 10 at night by the chancellor , the defence secretary and myself - about six hours before the whole public spending settlement was published " , Sir Kevin said .
He added : " I think it 's fair to say that the Treasury as a whole did n't want us to get as much as we got . "
" The final settlement in 2004 was a normal , hard negotiation ...
The guillotine that came in 2003 was an arbitrary issue . "
Sir Kevin said : " That would not have made an effect on Iraq or Afghanistan ... but [ would have involved ] a longer - term restructuring of the defence programme . "
Several witnesses have told the inquiry that preparations for what became a long campaign , including equipment provision , were inadequate .
Last week , former Prime Minister Tony Blair told the inquiry that planning for the immediate aftermath of the initial military campaign had not been " cavalier " .
The Iraq inquiry is looking at the UK 's role in the build - up , conduct and aftermath of the Iraq war , in which 179 service personnel died .
It is expected to report next year .

By the end of each week , I was ready to escape to the desert .
The monastery of Deir Mar Musa is perched atop a mountain , and it can be reached only by climbing 350 stairs .
The monastery had been built into the cliff some 1,500 years before , and the building occupies a space that appears to be nestled exactly between earth and sky .
Soon I was visiting the monastery almost every weekend .
Whenever I arrived in the courtyard , that young French novice monk would appear , asking me if I would like some tea .
I soon learned that Frédéric was in his third and final year of novitiate , having arrived on a journey through the Middle East several years before and more or less staying put .
In that time he had come to look exactly as one might imagine a desert monk to look .
He possessed a mane of wild curly hair , the requisite leather belt and sandals , and hands often swollen from beekeeping .
Beyond offering and accepting tea , he and I did n’t speak much .
He seemed too otherworldly for me , and I had just had my heart broken by a man in Boston , leaving me suspicious of men in general , even novice monks .
We became friends only when I decided to become a nun .
Two months after I arrived in Damascus , I left the city for the monastery to undergo the monthlong Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius .
I spent weeks in silence .
I prayed .
In my afternoons on top of desert mountains , I wrestled with a difficult family past , a history of depression and the feeling of helplessness I experienced when confronting the chaos of a region I had come to love .
Finally , I chose to offer up my life to God .
In the words of my childhood religion teacher , I decided to “ help carry the cross . ”
I never knew if God accepted my offer .
My body did n’t .
A few weeks after I decided to become a nun , I grew so sick that it hurt to breathe .
I spent two weeks in my bed in Damascus waiting to die , allowing my 73 - year - old neighbor to ply me with 7 - Up , which he insisted could cure any malady from flu to cancer .
My neighbors referred to my illness as “ the sickness of sadness . ”
Actor / writer / director / producer Tommy Wiseau ’s independent film
The Room has been famously dubbed “ the Citizen Kane of bad movies . ”
In an interview , Wiseau 's responses were lengthy , waffling and borderline incomprehensible .
Actor / writer / director / producer Tommy Wiseau ’s independent film
The Room has been famously dubbed “ the Citizen Kane of bad movies . ”
Essentially a melodrama about a sordid love triangle between nice guy protagonist Johnny ( Wiseau ) , his best friend and his two - timing girlfriend , The Room has generated substantial notoriety on the indie circuit since its original release in America in 2003 .
A devoted fan base has embraced the film ’s undisguisable awfulness , attending late night U.S. screenings and engaging in bizarre in - cinema activities such as hurling plastic spoons in the air every time a particular picture appears on the screen .
Nobody knows much about Wiseau – where he comes from , who he really is and how he was capable of making a film so cataclysmically bad .
In the wake of the film ’s Australian release ( it is now playing at Melbourne ’s Cinema Nova ) Wiseau phoned Cinetology from his office in LA .
He speaks broken English in a thick , apparently Eastern European accent ( though he wo n’t confirm this ) and was good enough to candidly discuss the film ’s innumerable flaws .
Note that chunks of our 45 minute interview have been removed ; some of Wiseau ’s responses were lengthy , waffling and borderline incomprehensible .
As you know Tommy The Room has been famously described as the Citizen Kane of bad movies .
When you first read that description were you happy ?
Sad ? Indifferent ?
How did it make you feel ?
Well my response to your question will be you can laugh , you can cry , you can express yourself but please do n’t hurt each other .
My comment is , you know , it is what it is .
I am pro freedom .
So if that is what you want to call it , that is fine by me .
I speak pretty well so I do n’t have to worry about it .
Sure .
But having invested so much work in this film – so much time and effort and resources – when somebody then calls it the Citizen Kane of bad movies , how do you react emotionally ?
Does that upset you ?
No , to upset me it takes two , three years !
The Room originally was designed for the audience for people to enjoy it .
So you see in America – I ’m American – it just does n’t affect me like people think .
You know what I ’m saying ?
We have lot of fans and I know in Australia we have great support in your country , you probably heard about it .
So I ’m happy to say actually The Room connects all the people in the entire world .
We did seek release also in Canada , do n’t know if you know about it .
Also in UK and London .
So it does n’t affect me in response to your question .
It is what it is .
Of course it would be nice if people say much more positive things but you see we in America , we are a little crazy sometimes with statement .
Also The Room as you probably know , we have been screening it for entire six years .
A lot of people is talking about it .
And I am thrilled by them .
I love all the public , let ’s put it this way .
OK ?
You said Tommy that the film is designed for people to enjoy it but if you look at the script and you look at some of the themes of the film it ’s actually very serious , at least on paper .
It ’s a melodrama , it ’s about a love triangle , it ’s violent , it ’s ultimately a tragedy .
This is n’t the sort of film you would design for people to enjoy , is it ?
Actually contrary to your statement , you are partially right , partially not .
It all depends on the angle you take .
You see The Room – by the way , your question is very creative .
You have a lot of symbolism in The Room .
I , as a writer myself , I question who is behind the words ?
How people can react ?
And you see by design
The Room is not for me , it is for people to see it , for people to learn about relationships and you see if you create great environment …
Here in America , have you ever visited United States ?
Yes I have .
Yeah so you know dilemma what we have right now , about expression .
Young person cannot express like you see on the street .
People think you are crazy , whatever .
I travel a lot right now back and forth in the States due to popularity of The Room , but the fact is , let me see …by the way let me correct you if I may .
It is not a melodrama .
It ’s a black comedy , which leads to the melodrama .
So if you ’ve seen the Room – by the way , did you have a chance to see it ?
Yes I ’ve seen it .
Of course .
OK cool .
So you see the idea behind it is that by design I wanted people to react .
Of course I did not predict everything what happened with The Room .
You ask me , I am a very honest guy .
At the same time I am thrilled to say as I responded already to your question that the reaction and I would say happiness indirectly from fans that we get right now , it is fantastic .
And we are getting all the numbers .
We are almost number one on the movie cult following whatever they call it , whatever category they give us .
I do n’t go by category , I really do n’t .
I just wanted people to enjoy it .
Have fun with it .
And you ’re right , I agree with you Luke , it is big issues , what I am dealing with .
You said that the film is not a melodrama , it ’s a black comedy .
It ’s my understanding that The Room was initially marketed as a drama but it was later marketed as a black comedy simply because audiences started laughing at everything .
But moving on , there is quite a lot of mystery that surrounds
The Room and as you said it has a very large and significant cult following .
I ’ve read a few stories on the internet that say it is unclear where you go the money from to make the film , and on a more personal level that it ’s unclear where you ’re from and who you really are .
So could you confirm for my readers today : a ) where did you get the money , b ) where are you from and c ) in your own words , who are you ?
Well first of all I am an America .
Number two , to respond to your question about the budget , you see it ’s like this , there is a plan ( that ) you have to work very hard to accomplish .
If you ’re not thinking about 100 % you have 20 % .
You have to work very hard in your profession , marketing etcetera to save the money .
I had several producers who actually put into the project and that is where the money comes from .
To respond to your third question , I ’m basically an American slash citizen in America .
So basically I did travel several countries but I am America .
My backgrounds are you know as follows – acting , school , production , film etcetera etcetera .
You could write a book about it .
So sometimes what you read on the internet is incorrect statement .
Undoubtedly that must be true .
I did read that you were an American but I also noticed that you have what sounds like an Eastern European accent .
Whereabouts were you born ?
Well I am New Orleans , but I do n’t have a strange accent , I do n’t have Middle Eastern accent , my accent is relate to education if you ask me .
That is the story .
Some of them what they print is incorrect …
They try to correct my age already – I am 41 , I am not 100 years old !
You see again this is the thing what we have in America , this free amendment , pro-choice , people express themselves , and some of the establishment is if you ask me is off the wall – completely incorrect .
So that ’s the story .
Sure , but as you would know Tommy , you do n’t sound like a stereotypical American .
How would you describe your accent ?
You know I will tell you one thing , one day I will lose ( my accent ) but I also speak several different languages and what ’s where the accent comes from .
You know , my accent varies .
It depends you know where I am , who I am talking to .
I do n’t see any problem with my accent .
You see in America you probably know this , people come from New York , they have accents .
And they come from New Orleans , Louisiana , they have accents .
California it is slightly different .
I am here now , I am calling you from Los Angeles .
So wherever in a certain environment , we say , oh you are from New York !
What ’s happening man !
Hahaha !
Yes I understand that .
I love an interesting accent but you ’re not actually telling me where your accent comes from and you ’re being a bit secretive about it .
But that ’s OK , we ’ll move onto the next question .
The Room all - up cost around six million dollars , which is cheap for a feature film but not for a film that looks as low - key as yours .
The Room looks like a low budget daytime TV soap opera .
Looking at the film , I ca n’t see where all the money went , so I ’ve decided that you must have either been involved in some sort of tax fraud or money laundering operation .
That is completely nonsense .
Are you kidding me ?
To answer simple question I will tell you this way – you have to realise that , er , are you familiar with 35 mm film ?
Yes .
Then let me tell you it ’s extremely expensive !
Keep in mind we had two crews !
We had 300 , 400 people !
Why not just shoot it on digital ?
Excuse me ?
How come you did n’t just shoot the film on digital ?
Well let me correct your statement here .
I know that you shot The Room on digital as well as 35 mm , but surely …
Let me correct this because the assumption is completely incorrect .
Firstly we shot The Room at the same time on both formats – HD and 35 .
Keep in mind for each camera you need double crew !
When I say double crew , because you see sometimes we are shooting let ’s say eight hours , some of the people , relate to the crew they are in union , so you have to change the people while shooting .
So you have double cost there …
This an incorrect assumption , completely false !
Let me tell you that several times we have over 300 people on the lot !
We use the green screen and not two but seven different locations …
We had two different units – one San Francisco , one Los Angeles .
Plus keep in mind that The Room has been shot at the same time on the same place with both cameras …
The Room is the only one , the only feature movie shot on both formats at the same time in the entire world !
That ’s a fact !
You can say whatever you want but again the assumption is incorrect because the reason I wanted to shoot in both formats – 35 as well as HD – was because I think it would be cool to have a book relate to it .
There was tremendous interest about HD and I was right too because right now I have not hundreds but thousands of emails .
I am working currently , speaking of HD and 35 , to finish my book , what is different …
People do n’t realise .
You can chop it down the way you want it !
You may say this is like soap opera but guess what ?
I have a surprise for you !
There ’s no way in the world you can produce this very cheaply !
Again , people try to tamper .
I do n’t know if you read about this too .
They try to tamper with my project so we change , I changed , the crew four times .
Sure Tommy , thank you , I understand it ’s very expensive to make a feature film so I ’ll move on to the next question .
Watching the performances in this film …
No , wait a minute , I did n’t finish .
Let me give you another example because I am very good at this , you know I studied this for many years prior ( to ) shooting The Room .
By the way , your question is great question .
You challenge me .
You know , I like that .
There is nothing wrong with that Luke .
At all .
So let me just two more minutes if you do n’t mind .
Because also you have to look at the cost by ratio .
We have a ratio of one to five .
What this means , every shot we shoot five times .
OK ?
Then we have a process of , that we are directly recording with the digital and I can see the daily almost instantly but we still have a daily from 35 , because we want to see what the lighting is , you see .
And then you have a process of editing it etcetera etcetera .
So I rest my case .
That is the story with that .
Thank you for that , Tommy .
No problem .
If I am you I will probably ask similar questions because this is very interesting .
Good questions .
Thank you .
I found , Tommy , that watching the performances in The Room is like watching a train crash at an excruciatingly slow pace .
Did you direct the actors to act bad , or are they just bad actors ?
Well let me tell you , I will also add to your statement if I may , it ’s a roller coaster ride .
( Tommy laughs )
Are you sure it ’s not a train crash ?
Well you can name it that , I do n’t know .
The way you said it , I think there is nothing wrong with that .
If you ask me , there is nothing wrong whatsoever .
I ’m just like whatever , you know ?
I have nothing to say except I will say it is a roller coaster ride .
I am glad you say that because it is a good comment as far as I am concerned .
So back to the question : did you direct the actors to act bad or are they just bad actors ?
No no no .
Well , you see , it ’s your statement .
Bad , good , whatever .
If you feel the acting is bad , whatever .
You see we have a process of rehearsal .
Let me also straighten out something here , I do n’t know if I said already .
This is 12 years of my life , for your information .
This does not happen in one minute .
And hopefully you can write this .
It ’s 12 years work prior to ( the ) shoot .
It ’s not like I wrote this in one second , OK ?
Now to respond to your question , we had a process of rehearsing .
We had – and I am not exaggerating with numbers – we had probably over 5000 head shots to choose from .
Different characters .
All the characters were based on the play because originally it was supposed to be a play , if you ask me .
Long story short , the actors , some of them decided not to give me certain colours .
So for me it does n’t matter if the actor play bad or good , whatever your definition .
To me it ’s more important ( to have ) chemistry between actors as well as what the actor can give you .
If you look at somebody , somebody act , let ’s say in this case you say badly – which is OK to say that if that is what you want , if that is your statement .
My statement would be the actors did an excellent job , if you ask me .
But even if you define what is good , what is bad , you still have reaction and chemistry .
And for me that is much more important than to create a certain story .
Because you do have a plot with The Room , but sometimes maybe it is difficult to follow .
That ’s why , I say , you need to see it a few times because there is no way you can grasp all of it .
That is my point .
The sex scenes in The Room are very strange .
And they ’re strange because they ’re bizarrely off - putting .
Watching the characters ’ bodies connect is like watching clumps of dead flesh press against each other .
When you were looking at the footage in the editing room , did you realise this ?
Or did you think it looked sexy ?
Well by the way great observation , I like that .
In the editing room we decided to reshoot some of it , believe it or not , because it was too polished .
I said wait a minute we do n’t want it too polished !
Let me say to your statement , you know , we are part animals , part vampires .
You see , human behaviour in certain situations – I say to myself , Tommy be nice – in certain situations we like to act in a certain way , OK ?
And this is why I like your statement .
Except some of your assumptions are incorrect .
But great observation because you see we act what we are .
I must say Tommy there is a part of me that really enjoyed watching you on the screen because your presence is very , um , ah , let ’s say anti-Hollywood .
But when you are on the screen you look and sound most of the time like you ’ve been drinking heavily .
What were you drinking when you were filming The Room ?
In documentary made behind the scenes you can see very clearly that I was drinking Red Bull , for your information .
Are you sure it was n’t whiskey ?
On the set we did n’t actually have any whiskey , any vodka , whatever people say .
It ’s nonsense .
You see , we actors in Hollywood , of course we drink !
But not on the set , you know ?
What were you smoking then ?
It ’s the same thing , you do n’t smoke anything .
( Laughing )
You just act .
I think Johnny , in this case me , is very well drawn but you see I do n’t want to pat myself on the shoulder .
You audience , you media , decide to do whatever you decide to do .
( Laughing )
So you promise me you were sober ?
100 percent sober .
The Room has generated a lot of strange reactions from audiences , like people jogging up and down the aisles , hurling footballs , even throwing plastic spoons in the air .
What ’s the strangest reaction you ’ve seen someone have to the film ?
Well sometimes when I have a Q and A people ask me , can you marry me ?
That ’s pretty strange to me , when you do n’t know the person and they say can you marry me , of course in this case a girl .
We have had a lot of different reactions .
Yes , people jogging .
I was surprised but whatever people want to do , I always say – you can laugh , you can cry , you can express yourself but please do n’t hurt each other .
So it ’s OK with me .
Have people ever hurt each other while watching the movie ?
Well no I ’m just saying to keep in mind , do n’t hurt each other .
What is behind the words in this case would be I want you to , if you can , be respectful to the other person .
That ’s the message , indirectly .
Your screen presence is bizarrely magnetic .
It ’s a little bit like the sun in that you ca n’t look but you ca n’t look away .
How have women reacted ?
Have you become a sort of independent film sex symbol ?
Let me tell you that women do like it for some reason .
( Laughing )
Yes they do like it .
I leave it that way .
It ’s so bizarre for me , let me tell you .
It ’s bizarre beyond comprehension .
I do not understand it , but they do like it for some reason .
What do you think it is about you that attracts women ?
Is it the long hair ?
Is it the accent ?
I have no idea to be honest with you .
Actually I have more women now , more than ever , and more girls for some reason .
I am just laughing , I am sorry Luke , this is the thing – you were right on the money , for some reason we have more girls now than guys in the theatre !
I just do n’t understand .
Well , you ’re a sex symbol Tommy .
Well thank you .
The last screening we had on Monday , there was close to 900 people .
And there were a lot of girls .
It was just , wow !
I rest my case .
You ’re a very unconventional actor .
So , what with all this attention from women , have you ever contemplated starring in a porno movie ?
Actually people have asked me that .
No , I am not for that .
I am Catholic for your information , so that is my background .
So I want to say absolutely not .
The story as you know is about a back - stabbing woman – a liar and a cheat who goes out of her way to create a love triangle and jumps from one man to the next .
Is the script based partly on your own experiences with women ?
Hmmm , well you see my take is slightly different .
I would say two is better than three ( and ) three is crowd .
We learn about relationships and back stabbing is bad .
For example , somebody loves , there is nothing wrong to love somebody .
When the character of Denny , he say I love Lisa , and he is very surprised when Johnny say “ well that ’s OK !
No problem . ”
You see that ’s what we have , a process of learning .
There is nothing wrong if you say to somebody , you say to your friend or girlfriend or wife , or whoever you have .
It is still OK for human beings to love another human being for just to say it to a person and to feel good about it .
You see there is nothing wrong with that .
If a lot of people love each other the world will be a better place to live .
As you know those words are from The Room .
And you know , it is what it is .
It is a process of learning .
It does n’t matter where you look .
Even in Australia , we have positive reviews from you guys , so I am happy to say that The Room actually connects all the people in the world .
Tommy I have a crazy theory about The Room .
Do you want to hear my crazy theory ?
Absolutely .
I give you extra time .
For one more question I give you extra five minutes .
Go for it .
Thanks very much , I appreciate it .
My theory is that you guys deliberately made a really bad movie with the intention of marketing it as one of the worst movies of all time .
That ’s what you did , is n’t it ?
Actually no , that is incorrect , if you ask me my opinion about it .
This is your statement ?
Well it ’s my theory .
You ’re Catholic , so you can pretend you ’re at church now .
I ’m a priest and you are at the confessional .
My theory is that you deliberately made this a bad movie so that people could enjoy it – as a bad movie .
No , that is not where The Room comes from if you ask me .
That is a wrong statement .
I will 100 percent disagree with you because again The Room is based on my work .
12 years of work .
Very intensive research .
I studied psychology .
My background is partially psychology , partially film production .
There is certain symbolism and without the symbolism within The Room you would not have The Room .
We cannot just say OK we will make a bad movie because we feel like it .
And we decided to market it as a bad movie – no .
Some of the attention The Room got from big stars , as you know , who make over 20 million , 30 million dollars .
This is not just a coincidence , because these stars want to be part of the history , they promote The Room indirectly on TV shows in America .
These are the facts .
I do n’t want to give you the names , you probably know all about it .
Let me also stress something else here , since we talk about The Room .
I submitted The Room to distribution to big studios .
A big studio starting with “ P ” – I will not give you the name but you can discover what the studio is , there is only one in Hollywood starting with P – and they say “ thank you very much Mr Wiseau , maybe next time . ”
I say thank you very much , no problem .
I submitted the film to the Academy Awards .
These are the facts .
I designed The Room very meticulously .
Again as I mentioned to you it is 12 years work .
So I disagree with your statement , but I appreciate your theory .
The production took me almost eight months to shoot The Room and that does not include the editing .
Everybody has different opinions about it .
But we have a history with The Room and we go based on the facts .
And based on the facts I cannot agree with your statements .
Are you disappointed that The Room did n’t get nominated for any Oscars ?
Yes I am disappointed .
But you have to understand that my background is also business so I have great respect for studio system in America as well as the process of submitting to Academy Awards .
I have nothing to hide .
These are the facts .
I am disappointed .
We also submitted it to Golden Globe awards .
We got good reaction from the people .
We did n’t win anything but at the same time we are proud of it .
The Room is currently playing every Saturday night at 11 pm at Melbourne ’s Cinema Nova .

TROUBLE - plagued Attorney - General Michael Atkinson has fallen on his sword to make way for fresh blood in a new Labor ministry .
He will remain in Parliament until the next election in 2014 , Adelaide Now reports .
Mr Atkinson said that it would be irresponsible , given the Government 's majority of one , to create a by - election in those circumstances .
Mr Atkinson also praised Premier Mike Rann , saying he " prevailed against all the odds and he can stay as Premier for as long as he likes " .
" I believe there should be renewal , " he said .
" I have had 20 years in Parliament .
" I think there ought to be renewal in the ministry .
I think there are talented people on the Labor backbench who deserve a go .
" I do n't think we want all the ministry leaving in a bunch about 2014 and so it 's important that renewal be staged . "
Mr Atkinson said one of the factors in the decision had been wanting to watch his son Johnno play soccer for Woodville - Belgrade .
" He was supposed to play his first game last night at 7 pm and like so many times in my time in Parliament I was n't there , " he said . " I am pretty disappointed about that .
" So I resolved that every time Johnno walks on the pitch this year his dad is going to be there even if it embarrasses the hell out of him . "
Mr Atkinson said no one had suggested he stand aside .
He had started phoning people about it yesterday and had confirmed the decision this morning .
He left at a time when the crime rate was down 33 per cent or 38 per cent depending which measure you use .
" Over eight years we have brought the criminal justice system in SA much closer to society 's values , " Mr Atkinson said .
Mr Atkinson , who was first elected to Parliament in 1989 , made the shock announcement outside a Prospect church just after 10.45 am today .

Fred Morrison did n't cure a disease , go to the moon , or invent some high - tech gadget .
But he made many of our lives just a bit happier with a simple toy that prompted dreams of flying saucers and sparked intramural games .

According to his son , " old age caught up " with Morrison as he dealt with a battle against cancer .
Yet somehow , this remark appears to be the only sad line in Morrison 's obituary .
The man 's life sounds like it contained as much joy as he brought to children and adults around the world with his invention .
In fact , even the events which led to the creation of what is now known as a Frisbee sound happy :
Morrison and his future wife , Lu , used to toss a tin cake pan on the beach in California .
The idea grew as Morrison considered ways to make the cake pans fly better and after serving as a pilot in World War II , Morrison began manufacturing his flying discs in 1948 .

From there the simple plastic disc would change name from " Pluto Platter " to " Frisbee , " but it would remain an staple in memories of summers in the park , beach games of Frisbee golf , and late night Ultimate Frisbee competitions .
So , while Fred Morrison 's passing is a sad event , it 's heartwarming to hear that he led a good life as he gave us an excuse to laugh and giggle as we send pieces of plastic whizzing through the air .

Almost without fail , January — which is always too cold , too dull , and too overdue for an antidote for holiday excess — puts me in the mood for rice pudding and this year was no different .
I played around with it all month .
I made my standard .
I made a “ creamiest ” version I found online that landed me with an undercooked eggy puddle and a wobbly belly .
I made a baked version that never came together .
And I caved to my husband ’s repeated request for chocolate rice pudding which is something you will never see on this site because it was , hands down , the most revolting looking dish I ’ve yet to ladle into a bowl .
( I added 3 ounces of bittersweet chocolate added to my old favorite , and nixed the almond .
See ?
Now I ’ve saved myself a photography challenge ! )
But it took me until February got me daydreaming of warmer climates to figure out what I ’d really been looking for : arroz con leche .
Now , here ’s the thing — I did it wrong .
I mean , it ’s inevitable that it will seem wrong to someone who grew up eating it .
There are as many versions of arroz con leche as there are Spanish - speaking grandmas who stir it up , and rarely are two versions alike .
That ’s the best part .
Here ’s what they have in common :
Most are thinner than you may expect from rice pudding , not overly sweet and generally just scented with cinnamon and lemon or orange zest ( though I ’ve seen lime used too ) .
Many use a can of sweetened condensed milk , some us evaporated milk as well .
Raisins are optional but common .
Some use an egg or even two , many do not .
Vanilla is sometimes used , often skipped .
There are Dominican version , Peruvian version , Cuban versions , Colombian versions , Spanish versions and guys , all I want to do right now is go visit each of them , audition them on their home turf .
Road trip , anyone ?
Alas , I am in New York City where more (! ) snow (! ) is predicted and lazing about is the order of the day .
I ’m trying to make the most of it , I really am and this pudding , it helps .

Arroz Con Leche
Adapted from Ingrid Hoffmann
Do you like Cozy Shack rice pudding ?
Has the rice pudding you fell in love with at New Jersey diners and New York delis been elusive to you at home ?
Well , step right up !
( Can you see me in my cape and top hat , waving you into the circus tent ?
No? Sigh . )
Look no further !
All of your rice pudding dreams will come true right before your very eyes !
Ahem , more soberly : I made a few changes to the original ingredients , adding salt and swapping large peels for finely grated zest .
Some fun ideas for next time : Swapping out some of the milk for an equivalent amount of coconut milk .
Swapping a jar of store - bought dulce de leche for the sweetened condensed milk .
Original recipe says it serves 4 , I say 8 , easily
1 cup long - grain white rice
2 cinnamon sticks ( I had very large canela sticks — see bottom for more info — so I only used one )
2 strips of lemon or orange zest ( can use a peeler to get a larger piece )
3 whole cloves or a tiny pinch of ground cloves
4 cups water
1 egg
3 cups whole milk ( updated to note that many people , including my mother , successfully made this with lower fat milks )
1 ( 12 - ounce ) can sweetened condensed milk ( I realized after the fact that my can had been 14 ounces , had no averse effect )
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon vanilla
1/2 cup raisins ( optional )
Soak the rice , cinnamon sticks , lemon or orange zest and whole or powdered cloves in the water in a heavy saucepan for 1 hour .
After soaking , bring the rice mixture to a boil on high heat , uncovered .
When it starts to boil ( about 5 minutes ) , lower the heat to medium and cook for 10 to 12 more minutes or until water is almost evaporated .
While rice is cooking , beat the egg in a bowl .
Add the milk and stir well to mix .
Add the egg mixture , condensed milk , salt , vanilla extract and raisins , if using , to the rice and cook over medium - low heat , stirring carefully , until it thickens slightly or until desired consistency about 25 to 35 minutes ( see notes that follow ) .
( About cooking time : Many reviewers said 25 to 35 minutes was way too much cooking time for them , and that 15 to 20 minutes would have been better .
I was all ready to pull my pot off early , but actually needed almost 30 minutes .
Still , want to give you a heads up that yours might be done sooner . )
( About “ desired consistency ” : I cooked mine until all but 10 percent of the liquid had been absorbed , which yielded a creamy , not - too - thick pudding .
If you like your arroz con leche thinner , pull it off the stove when more liquid is left .
This pudding does most of its thickening as it cools , but the end result should still be thinner than traditional rice pudding . )
Remove citrus zest and cinnamon sticks .
Let cool uncovered , then chill the rest of the way in the fridge .
Mexican cinnamon : A long time ago , I bought a jar of canela ( Mexican " soft cinnamon " ) sticks from Rancho Gordo and this was the perfect time to bust it out .
The cinnamon flavor is just a little different than we ’re used to , a little less loud and one note , a little dynamic .
It smells exactly like a cross between a cinnamon stick and apple cider .
Seriously !
When simmered with the pudding for almost an hour , the pudding had an almost spicy edge to it and an unmistakable flavor I associate only with arroz con leche .

This was the toughest article I 've ever had to write .
It was n't supposed to be like this .
This was n't supposed to be how this season went , not with the team healthy and with a new coach and an enthusiastic and smart general manager taking over .
Great things were n't expected , but improvement and progress were .
I do n't think any of us expected a Stanley Cup Finals team to suddenly appear , and we were prepared to back a team that would have it 's ups and downs as it struggled under a new system and with a limited payroll .
Yet what we now have in front of us is a Dallas Stars team that has lost its heart and its will to fight .
They do n't believe in one another and it's painfully evident as each game progresses , and that is what has made being a fan of the Dallas Stars right now so tough .
Many fans can deal with losses , with a down period as the team transitions from one era to the next .
But to continue to watch a team that is having the life sucked out of it in front of our very eyes is demoralizing in ways Stars fans never thought imaginable .
It 's easy to stick with a team when they 're losing , especially if there are signs of hope for a better future .
It makes dealing with the down times bearable , and it makes you as a fan feel even better when they come out on the other side and things are looking up again .
It 's nothing new to be a fan of a failing team that frustrates its fanbase to no end ; this is just something that is completely new to fans of the Dallas Stars .
There are 18 games left between now and the Olympic break .
The Stars then play one game before the March 3rd trade deadline .
In those 19 games , if the Stars continue this path of building mediocrity and fall even further behind in the Western Conference standings , then expect for major changes to take place .
There is a good chance that things start to happen even before the break .
After the break , I get into the fundamental issues facing the Dallas Stars and the paths the team might take on their road to recovery .
There are many teams in the NHL that have lived with being mediocre for a long ; the Dallas Stars and their fans should not be as content to just live without success and should demand more .
That process starts now .
What is the reality of the situation ?
This was not the best year for the Stars to struggle , and to struggle even worse than they did last season .
At 47 points , the Stars sit in 10th place in the Western Conference , most of which is locked in a brutal battle for positioning from 1st all the way to 8th .
For most of the year there has n't been much difference between the 8th place team and the 10th , but over the past two weeks we 've seen the pack start to pull away .
The Stars are just six points behind Nashville , but if the Stars do n't find a way to immediately solve the woes that plague them that number will continue to grow .
In less than two weeks , the Stars could be facing a near insurmountable deficit between themselves and the playoff teams .
Yet it 's not as if the Stars have completely imploded and at this point the team has not had more than three losses in a row .
Yet the league - high eleven shootout and overtime losses both hurt them and help them at the same time , and are incredibly misleading about the true nature of this team .
It 's easy to play the ' what if ' game , but let 's say the Stars had won half of those shootouts and had not allowed several last - second game - tying goals .
Then the Stars a this point would be around the 6th spot in the West and this would be nothing but a minor hiccup in a long season .
Yet those losses are part of the fabric of this team and speak to some of the underlying and concerning issues facing the Dallas Stars moving forward .
We can talk about statistics and records and points until we 're blue in the face , but the true nature of this team is more than apparent on the ice and how they play the game .
The lack of leadership is appalling .
And that falls on Brenden Morrow
On the post - game show after the loss to the New Jersey Devils , I became quite emotional when discussing Brenden Morrow and his leadership of the Stars .
For the longest time , he was the heart and soul of this team and was the driving force behind propelling incredible comeback victories and an insanely magical run in the playoffs .
Morrow is a quiet , unassuming type of guy off the ice and is a very down to earth guy .
I 've met him before and he was a very well spoken and gracious guy who took the time to talk to some adoring fans .
He 's not the sort of guy who is going to go into the locker room and kick some trash cans and yell at his teammates or give a big victory speech before a big game .
He leads through his actions on the ice .
The way he would do the dirty work in the corners , would be the first to come to the aid of a teammate , how he made a living causing havoc in front of the net and would score goals with defensemen draped all over him .
His grit , determination and never - give - up mentality is what made him the natural leader of the team and it's exactly why he 's wearing the " C " on his chest right now .
Except that leadership is gone .
Whether it 's because he 's still not fully recovered from his knee injury , whether it 's a natural decline in abilities or whether he 's just undergone a complete philosophy shift in how he plays the game , Brenden Morrow is no longer the player he used to be .
During today 's interview with Bob and Dan on The Ticket , Morrow stated that he contemplated really getting into it with Sean Avery and even dropping the gloves .
Yet he said that " the prospect of getting injured or hurting my hand and missing the Olympics " outweighed his desire to teach that knucklehead a lesson .
And perhaps therein lies the problem .
Perhaps one of the reasons we have n't seen Morrow be himself on the ice , to be the physical presence and the sparkplug for the team is that he 's playing not to get injured .
He 's had two serious injuries in the past three years ( knee and wrist ) , and it seems as if now he 's wary of another injury robbing him of a one in a lifetime chance to represent his country in the Olympics .
Debating the merits of NHL players appearing in the Olympics is for another time but if Morrow , the team captain , is playing timid and is not giving it his all then how can we expect the rest of the team to as well .
Now , it 's tough to say that Morrow is specifically holding back but these comments today combined with how he disappears on the ice when the team needs him most speaks volumes about the Stars as a whole .
Heart .
Will .
Fight .
None of these words describe the Dallas Stars .
Anyone watching the past two games will come to the exact same conclusion : this is a team that is not playing as a team .
They do not stand up for one another , there is no cohesiveness among the players and there is a certain closeness that is lacking when compared to the successful teams of the past .
It was n't just last night against the Rangers either , and we started to see signs of this last season as well .
Whenever a player on the ice is taken out with a dirty hit , is ganged up on in a scrum , is bowled over in the crease , is literally taken out after a goal is scored ... the emotional response by the rest of the team is minimal at best .
There have been times when the Stars have actually stood up for a teammate ( Krys Barch fighting Hordichuk comes to mind ) but for the most part it 's appalling how this team just stands idly by while a teammate is abused .
Against the Rangers , the Stars were in a battle against a team that was easily beatable and then the Stars started to get manhandled .
The Rangers realized they could walk all over this team without so much as anything close to retaliation , and that speaks to the current mindset of this team .
They play with no heart , with no resolve or resiliency and seem incapable of overcoming adversity , let alone even being able to step up and play hard in a must - win game with the season slipping away .
This is why these Dallas Stars are so frustrating to watch .
It 's apparent they have the talent and ability as a group of individuals to really be a great and dynamic team and we 've seen flashes of that at times throughout this season .
Yet these players just do n't believe in themselves or each other right now , and that 's leading to the myriad of issues we 're seeing up and down the ice .
No defense for the defense .
Bob Sturm , friend of Defending Big D and radio host for 1310 The Ticket , has a lengthy blog post up today giving his thoughts on why the Stars are struggling .
He builds on a theme he 's stated several times in the past and gives a great argument here : that the Stars are simply seeing the effects of spending minimal payroll for a young defense .
I 'm not going to rehash everything he writes about because I want you to read it yourself , but I did want to repost some statistics he has on the defense and where the Stars are in relation to the rest of the Western Conference :
Rank Team Money on Dmen 1 . Detroit $ 23.8 m
2 . Calgary $ 23.4 m 3 . Edmonton $ 23.2 m 4 . Vancouver $ 21.4 m 5 . Colorado $ 20.8 m 6 . Minnesota $ 19.0 m
7 . Chicago $ 18.8 m 8 . St Louis $ 18.7 m 9 . San Jose $ 17.9 m 10 .
Anaheim $ 17.3 m 11 . Phoenix $ 16.2 m 12 . Los Angeles $ 14.9 m 13 . Columbus $ 14.2 m 14 . Nashville $ 12.6 m 15 . Dallas $ 8.7 m
That is staggering .
Over this past summer the one thing most of us were in consensus about was that the Stars needed to add an experienced , big , dominant defenseman that could lead this team in Zubov 's wake .
Stephane Robidas is having a career season and is one of the few players on this team playing his heart out each night , but he alone cannot carry the Stars .
We watched as the Stars stood idly by while quality defensemen were signed elsewhere for affordable prices at market value , and Joe Nieuwendyk had his hands tied by the team 's budget .
Imagine if the Stars had been able to sign Mattias Ohlund and Karlis Skrastins ; even Jay Bouwmeester was signed for an affordable price .
Yet you can't put this team 's woes squarely on Tom Hicks ' shoulders .
Sure , the extra monies would be nice to have , especially when the Stars are struggling and are in desperate need of a big trade .
But it 's not impossible to be successful with a young and cheap blueline ; Detroit is proving that spending a ton of money is n't the exact answer either .
Who could have known that Matt Niskanen would regress to this point ?
He was supposed to be a future star and showed the potential to be a special player .
Yet he 's become the whipping boy for the Stars ' defense and continues to struggle on a nightly basis .
Trevor Daley has woefully underachieved in a system he was supposed to thrive in ; for a player that was touted as an offensive threat his entire career , Daley has become nothing more than a joke at this point , and that 's just pitifully sad .
If the young defense played at the same level and intensity as Nicklas Grossman and Mark Fistric , then perhaps the Stars would n't be having the problems they are now .
You do n't need a team full of superstar defensemen to be successful , but at the very least a team requires their defensemen to not be horrendously unreliable on a nightly basis .
Where do the Stars go from here ?
If the current trend continues , the Stars will be grossly out of contention in the Western Conference within two weeks .
As it stands , they have 19 games and nearly two months before the trade deadline on March 3rd .
No one knows what Joe Nieuwendyk 's ultimate plan is and I doubt even he knows at this point .
Yet it 's a certainty that at this point he 's starting to form a very good opinion about each and every player on this team and how they fit into his longterm goals for the Dallas Stars .
Let 's remember that 95 % of this team was inherited by Joe Nieuwendyk , and he took over as General Manager with a very specific idea for the type of team he wished to build .
Tom
Hicks did n't hire him to just bring in a coach and this sit idly by and hope for the best .
A G.M. change is done to do exactly that : make change .
Whether Marc Crawford is or is n't the right coach for this team is n't the question ; the question is how does Nieuwendyk build a team that fits perfectly with the coach he has selected .
So does he do commit an act of extreme firesale and blow this team up at the trade deadline , getting maximum value for the players he does n't need ?
Here is who is scheduled to become either a UFA or an RFA at the end of the season :
Mike Modano
Jere Lehtinen
Fabian Brunnstrom ( RFA )
Steve Ott
James Neal ( RFA )
Tom Wandell ( RFA
Krys Barch
Toby Petersen
Nicklas Grossman ( RFA )
Matt Niskanen ( RFA )
Marty Turco
Alex Auld
I think it 's fairly safe to say that James Neal is staying .
The Stars would also be wise to stick with Tom Wandell , who is one of the few players giving it his all and seemingly fits perfectly into the type of team Joe Nieuwendyk would build .
Nicklas Grossman is also a player the Stars should keep .
As far as the rest of the free agents , who should stay ?
Who has shown that they deserve to be a part of the future of the Dallas Stars ?
Four months ago I would have fought tooth and nail for Steve Ott , but now I 'm not as certain in my conviction .
The offensive prowess he showed last season has disappeared and he has n't been as effective as an agitator either .
Toby Petersen perhaps should stay , but we 've yet to see him become more than a fourth line option and while that not necessarily a bad thing , the Stars have pressing needs elsewhere , especially with some of the younger talent in the system .
Which brings us to the Dallas Stars prospects .
I know we all want to see a big trade , but this team is proving right in front of our eyes that a team is not built through free agency and trades alone .
Loui Eriksson , James Neal and Jamie Benn are all proof that you do n't need a big - name free agent to make an impact on a hockey team .
Hell , at this point a big free agent acquisition is the last thing the Stars need .
What the Dallas Stars need to do is build upon the nucleus of talented forwards they have in the system and in the juniors and NCAA , and augment that with some key defenseman additions .
And if the Stars want to get max value this season for some of the players on the team , then they 're going to have to part with someone who not only has future value for other teams but frees up salary as well .
The big name here is Brad Richards , but he 's proven this season that he still has the ability to carry and elevate the play of those around him .
He 's been tremendous , and he's a player I 'd love to see the Stars keep for a long time .
Yet his salary is exorbitant and his value will never be higher than it is now .
Yet others , such as Mike Ribeiro and Trevor Daley are distinct possibilities .
We 're all waiting for the big trade to come down that sends Marty Turco packing , and while I have been doubtful this would happen it 's starting to look like a possibility .
Yet the question is whether teams would be willing to not only pick up his big contract ( a little under $ 2.5 million for the rest of the season ) and an aging goaltender who has become a liability in net recently .
Nieuwendyk could opt for a big firesale or a calculated restructuring of the team from the inside out that starts with a few trades and is carried out further over the summer .
Yet if the Stars continue playing like they have the past month , the former will likely happen much quicker than the latter .
The clock is ticking ; the Dallas Stars cannot survive a lengthy rebuilding process .
I wrote about this last month , how the Dallas Stars fans are treading in territory they have yet to see .
Already this team is at an all time low when it comes to popularity in the metroplex , with declining attendance and even worse television ratings .
The revenue is slipping and the Stars must start winning again to raise the bar back to where it was before .
Ever since coming to Dallas the Stars have been known as a winning franchise .
Never before has this team had more than two losing seasons in row , nor have they missed the playoffs two years in a row .
If the Stars do go into full rebuilding mode , then the track back to success must be much faster than that which is tolerated in other cities .
This is a delicate time for the Dallas Stars and it's fans , and the past week has been perhaps the worst for fans in a long time .
It 's one thing for the Stars to lose , it 's something else entirely for them to just give up and expect the fans to be right there with them along the way .
The Dallas Stars are a proud franchise ; it 's about time for them to act like it again .
White Plains , New York ( CNN ) -- Ex -New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik was sentenced to 48 months in prison Thursday after pleading guilty to charges of lying to Bush administration officials who vetted his unsuccessful 2004 nomination for homeland security secretary .
The sentence , handed down by U.S. District Judge Stephen Robinson , exceeded the 27 - to 33 - month prison term recommended by federal prosecutors .
" With great power comes great responsibility and comes great consequences , " Robinson said in court .
Kerik , accompanied by his wife and son , addressed the court before his sentencing .
" I make no excuses , " the former police commissioner said .
" I take full responsibility for my actions .
I have learned from this .
I know I will be punished , but I only wish you would allow me return to my wife and two little girls as soon as possible . "
Kerik , 54 , pleaded guilty in November to tax fraud and six other felonies and has been under house arrest in Franklin Lakes , New Jersey , since then .
He must surrender to authorities to begin his sentence by May 17 .
After the sentencing , Kerik told reporters he wanted to " apologize to the American people for the mistakes I 've made and for which I have just accepted responsibility . "
" As history is written , I can only hope that I will be judged for the 30 years of service that I 've given to this country and the city of New York , " he said .
In court papers , prosecutors said Kerik denied to a White House official that there was " any possible concern " about his relationships with contractors involved in renovating an apartment of his or that he had any financial dealings with prospective city contractors .
Kerik had been scheduled to go to trial on a variety of corruption charges , including allegations that he received and concealed benefits of about $ 255,000 in renovations to his Riverdale , New York , apartment from a company seeking to do business with the city of New York .
He pleaded guilty to that charge and several tax - related counts in November .
Kerik was New York police commissioner from 1998 to 2002 , a tenure that included the September 11 , 2001 , attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed more than 2,700 people .
He spent a brief stint in Iraq training the country 's police force after the U.S. invasion in 2003 , and President Bush nominated him to be homeland security secretary in 2004 .
However , Kerik withdrew from consideration after allegations surfaced that he had employed a nanny with a murky immigration status .
In 2006 , he pleaded guilty to accepting tens of thousands of dollars in gifts while he working as city corrections commissioner .
Under his plea agreement , he paid $ 221,000 in fines and avoided jail time .
His admission dogged the 2008 presidential campaign of his longtime patron , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , who said his endorsement of Kerik had been " a mistake . "
Kerik made an unsuccessful appeal for clemency to Bush in 2008 , according to court papers released in October .
Robert Campbell / Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory FORGETFUL FLY
In this cutaway photo of a fly head , green fluorescent protein marks the brain region where erasable memory is stored .
Text Size A A
The act of forgetting is essential for clearing space in the brain for new information , yet the biochemistry underlying this process has never been ascertained .
Now , Yi Zhong , a neuroscientist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory , in New York , and coworkers have for the first time identified a molecule that the brain uses to erase short - term memory ( Cell 2010 , 140 , 579 ) .
The molecular eraser is Rac , a small G - protein previously known for its participation in signaling pathways that control cellular processes such as transcription and cytoskeletal organization .
The researchers believe Rac acts through the protein cofilin to control polymerization of actin , which affects the structure and interaction of neurons and , hence , memory .
Zhong and colleagues at Beijing 's Tsinghua University " have crystallized the notion that the brain mechanisms for remembering are balanced by a mechanism for active forgetting , " notes Ronald L. Davis , a neuroscientist at Scripps Research Institute Florida , in Jupiter .
" Moreover , they have ushered in a completely new line of research — the cell biology of active forgetting — by identifying Rac as critical for active forgetting , " Davis writes in an accompanying commentary .
Working with the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster , an organism often used for neuroscience lab studies , the researchers found that ramping up Rac activity accelerates decay of short - term memory .
In contrast , blocking Rac 's activity causes memories that normally last just a few hours to endure for more than a day .
Zhong speculates that long - term memory , which is stored in a different part of the brain , is n't affected by Rac because the protein 's pathway does n't operate in that brain region .
Because Rac is found in all organisms , these findings might be relevant for humans , Zhong says .
If so , the Rac pathway could serve as a target for enhancing memory or erasing unwanted bad memories .
Of course , the Rac pathway is only one of the biochemical factors that influence memory .
That means that people 's different memory capabilities might derive not only from differing powers of forgetting , Zhong says , but also from differing powers of memory formation and retrieval .

A variety of British vegetable grown in darkness and harvested by candlelight has joined French champagne and Italian Parma ham in having its name protected by the European Union , officials said on Thursday .
Yorkshire Forced Rhubarb has been awarded Protected Designation of Origin status by an EU programme which aims to protect regional and traditional foods throughout Europe .
It means the name can be used by only the 12 remaining growers of the foodstuff in the protected area , the so - called “ rhubarb triangle ” , which is in the county of Yorkshire , northern England .
The EU designation will guarantee the product is authentic and prevent imitation across Europe .
“ Yorkshire Forced Rhubarb has been recognised thanks to the quality of this traditionally grown product and the enthusiasm and commitment shown by all involved , ” said British Environment Secretary Hilary Benn .
The rhubarb is grown in darkness and then picked by candlelight using traditional methods to produce a sweet and tender variety , environment department officials said .
Although officially classified as a vegetable , rhubarb is normally used in sweet desert dishes .

The folding plug .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A design student , frustrated at having his brand new wafer - thin laptop scratched by the unwieldy and bulky plug attached to it , set about re-designing the standard British 3 - pin plug that has remained unchanged for over six decades , and invented a plug that folds to a mere one centimeter thickness .
Min-Kyu Choi , a design student from the Royal College of Art in London , won the 2010 Brit Insurance international award for Design of the Year with his folding plug , beating 90 rivals including fashion designer Alexander McQueen ’s last collection , a twin - seat electric aircraft from China , and a social housing project from Monterrey in Mexico .
Mr Choi said he was disappointed when he bought his MacBook Air slimline laptop , which is thin enough to fit in an envelope , only to find a bulky 4.5 cm plug attached to it .
The design of the British three - pin electrical plugs has remained unchanged since it was standardized in 1946 .
He said when he found the computer had been scratched by the plug on a trip to the university he decided to design a plug that could fold flat to make it almost as thin as the laptop , and to prevent the pins causing damage .
The folding plug .
The UK Folding Plug transforms from a bulky three - pin plug into a portable , hassle - free plug ideal for people on the go .
The design of the lower section allows it to be rotated 90 degrees so the two pins are parallel with the top pin , making the unit less than 10 mm thick and able to be tucked easily in a laptop bag .
The design is fully protected by patents and it meets the British Standard regulations , and like the ordinary British plug , contains an easily replaceable fuse .
Mr Choi has also designed an adaptor the same size as a standard British plug that takes three of the folding plugs .
Artist Antony Gormley , who was chairman of the award judging panel , said the plug was an elegant design that had been thought through and was modest and responsive , and “ could make a difference to everyone ’s life . ”
It is also likely to make Mr Choi extremely wealthy if it is well marketed .
The folding plug will be officially launched later this year , and will remain on show at the Design Museum in London until 31 October .

Local activists are planning a protest at the Walmart store in Comstock Park in support of Joseph Casais , an employee at the Battle Creek store who recently was fired for using medical marijuana .
Casais , 29 , suffers from sinus cancer and has an inoperable brain tumor .
He is a registered medical marijuana user .
He worked at Walmart for five years and was fired in November after injuring his knee on the job and testing positive for marijuana during a subsequent drug screening .
The American Civil Liberties Union and marijuana advocacy groups have contested the firing .
Walmart has defended its actions on the grounds that marijuana use , still is a federal crime ( even though the federal government has said it wo n’t prosecute users who follow state law ) , arguing employers should have the right to set and enforce their own drug policies .
Medical marijuana was legalized in Michigan in 2008 .
A protest is scheduled for 4:25 p.m. today at Walmart in Comstock Park , 3999 Alpine Avenue NW , led by Protest for Peace and Students for a Sensible Drug Policy of Michigan State University .

Justice Department : We ’ve Convicted at Least 390 Terrorists Since 9/11
Created : March 26 , 2010 12:40 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Just how many terrorists have American civilian courts convicted ?
The Justice Department is happy to let you know .
In filings provided to the congressional intelligence and judiciary committees — and now to the press — the Department itemized all the people it ’s successfully prosecuted since 9/11 .
It divides them into two categories : the first is for ” violations of federal statutes that are directly related to international terrorism and that are utilized regularly in international terrorism matters ” and the second is for those convicted of a terror - supporting offense , like “ fraud , immigration , firearms , drugs , false statements , perjury , and obstruction of justice , as well as general conspiracy charges . ”
All told , that ’s 150 convictions in the first category , and 240 in the second , for a grand total of 390 people convicted on terror - related charges from September 11 , 2001 to March 18 , 2010 .
And there ’s more , according to the Justice Department ’s filing , since its total “ does not include defendants whose convictions remain under seal , nor does it include defendants who have been charged with a terrorism or terrorism - related offense but have not been convicted either at trial or by guilty plea . ”
But the military commissions have convicted three people since 9/11 , so that ’s something .
Greg Sargent scans this all in so I do n’t have to .
Looks like the Justice Department is trying to fight off any attempt to move Khalid Shaikh Mohammed ’s prosecution into a military commission as part of a White House deal with Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) .
Born to parents with Quaker leanings , Thomas Paine grew up amid modest circumstances in the rural environs of Thetford , England .
As the recipient of what he termed " a good moral education and a tolerable stock of useful learning , " little in Paine 's early years seemed to suggest that he would one day rise to a stunning defense of American independence in such passionate and compelling works as Common Sense ( 1776 ) and The American Crisis essays ( 1776 - 83 ) .
Paine 's early years were characterized by a constant struggle to remain financially solvent while pursuing a number of nonintellectual activities .
Nevertheless , the young Paine read such Enlightenment theorists as Isaac Newton and John Locke and remained dedicated to the idea that education was a lifelong commitment .
From 1753 to 1759 , Paine worked alternately as a sailor , a staymaker , and a customs officer .
Between 1759 and 1772 , he married twice .
His first wife died within a year of their marriage , and Paine separated amicably from his second wife after a shop they operated together went bankrupt .
While these circumstances seemed gloomy , Paine fortuitously made the acquaintance of Benjamin Franklin in London in 1773 .
Impressed by Paine 's self - education , Franklin encouraged the young man to venture to America where he might prosper .
Arriving in Philadelphia in 1774 , Paine quickly found himself energized by the volatile nature of Revolutionary politics .
Working as an editor of Pennsylvania Magazine , Paine found a forum for his passionate radical views .
In the years that followed , Paine became increasingly committed to American independence , and to his conviction that the elitist and corrupt government that had ruled over him in England had little business extending its corrosive colonial power to the States .
Moved by these beliefs , Paine published Common Sense ( 1776 ) , a test that proved invaluable in unifying American sentiment against British rule .
Later , after joining the fray as a soldier , Paine penned the familiar lines in " The American Crisis " : " These are the times that try men 's souls . "
Fifteen years later , Paine wrote his other famous work , Rights of Man ( 1791 ) .
Drawing on his eclectic experiences as a laborer , an international radical politician , and a revolutionary soldier , Paine asserted his Lockeian belief that since God created humans in " one degree only , " then rights should be equal for every individual .
Here at Southeast Discovery , we were extremely impressed with the caliber of this coastal community 's master plan , as well as with the level and quality of amenities , when we first visited River Dunes in North Carolina in 2009 .
River Dunes ' most impressive attribute is its stunning waterfront location in Oriental , North Carolina and the beautiful views of the wide - bodied Pamlico Sound .
River Dunes ’ 14 miles of coastline is well protected being miles inland from the Atlantic coast , thereby greatly minimizing the direct impact of hurricanes and coastal storms .
The centerpiece of River Dunes is Grace Harbor , home to some of the most impressive yachts on the North Carolina coast and possibly the entire eastern seaboard , and a highly respected marina staff .
River Dunes vacation homes , or permanent residences , are ideal for those who want access to big water .
But , the development is all the more appealing because of how lovely these North Carolina waterfront homes are .
The quality of architecture on display in the homes for sale at River Dunes is some of the most striking you 'll find in any coastal North Carolina community .
Whether it is the Harbor Club building , the harbor side cottages , the pool cabanas or the various waterfront homes for sale in River Dunes , the attention to detail and quality of materials at River Dunes has resulted in some timeless architecture , while the eco-friendly plan won River Dunes a National Sustainability Award .
The location of River Dunes is a bit off the beaten path : about 40 minutes east of New Bern , North Carolina and 90 minutes north of Wilmington , North Carolina .
But the out of the way location of these North Carolina waterfront homes is a large part of the waterfront community 's draw .
River Dunes in North Carolina is a well - planned and executed development offering outstanding vacation or permanent homes in a uniquely prime location , and should be near or at the top of the list for sailors and yachtsman .
A new study presented by Fox News ( watch the vid , peeps ) says that going to college will make someone ’s political opinions lean left and suggests that democratic faculty push their liberal agendas on students .
What ’s troubling about the study ’s conclusion is that the college grads become more liberal but NOT more knowledgeable ; more than 35 % of us ca n’t even name the three branches of the U.S. government !

Now , I can only speak for my school , one public university out of many , but I can definitely back the validity of these findings based on my experiences during the 2008 Presidential Election when everyone had Obama fever .
I was kind of surprised when my professors brazenly bashed Republican ideals and tooted Obama ’s horn during a lecture that was supposed to be about graphing the value of x .
Despite all the propaganda , I made a conscious effort to educate myself about both candidates .
I did internet research , read books , and looked up their past political experience .
I wanted to form my own opinion , and when election day rolled around , I was well - informed on many different issues facing the country and who promised to do what about them .
After much deliberation , I voted for McCain via my absentee ballot .
I was n’t annoyed that all of my friends voted for Obama .
It ’s their right .
I was annoyed that they had no idea why they voted for him .
When I asked them , I mostly got blank stares and shoulder shrugs .
If I was lucky enough to get an actual response , it was either “ because he ’s young and cool ! ” , “ because he ’s black ! ” , or from some of my more promiscuous friends , “ because he ’s pro-choice ! ”
This study definitely made me think .
College is supposed to be a place of higher learning , but what is it really teaching us ?
We should become more educated and learn to think for ourselves , but is this really what happens ?
Are people with degrees more liberal , and if so , is college to blame ?
What do you guys think ?
Touchscreens and multitouch technology make up a significant majority of Apple 's research into future user interface improvements , and the iPhone introduced some of those UI paradigm shifts into our increasingly mobile computing .
Since almost all interaction with the iPhone — and presumably the hopefully imminent Apple tablet — involves a touchscreen , Apple hopes to improve on touchscreen technology by using each individual LCD pixel as a touch sensor .
Apple has filed a patent application , published today , for a " display with dual - function capacitive elements . "
By mixing display and sensing functions into each individual pixel , it would make touchscreens thinner , lighter , and brighter than they currently are today .
The way current touchscreens found on most smartphones work is by overlaying a touch - sensitive panel on top of a traditional LCD panel .
The touch - sensitive panel is essentially a grid array of capacitors , most commonly made from the transparent conductor indium tin oxide ( ITO ) .
When your fingertip comes in contact with the small magnetic fields present in the capacitors , it causes the voltage along those capacitors to fluctuate .
A processor translates these fluctuations into touch positions .
The need for additional layers covering the LCD screen means it is thicker , and despite the fact that ITO is transparent , the touch layer does block some light coming from the LCD display underneath .
Apple 's solution involves using each individual pixel as a capacitive sensor , eliminating the need for an additional layer for a separate touch sensor .
Part of the magic of Apple 's patent relies on forming an IPS LCD display using a low temperature polycrystalline silicon instead of the more common amorphous silicon .
Materials engineering nerds may want to look at the patent for a more detailed explanation , but suffice it to say that the poly - Si allows for a much faster switching frequency for driving the individual pixels .
( For those unaware , the individual pixels in an LCD panel switch on and off at a rate much faster than we can perceive — it 's this same switching that can cause eye fatigue from staring at your screen all day . )
Apple 's idea takes advantage of the faster switching of poly - Si to drive the pixels one instant , and use the capacitive properties of the individual pixels as touch sensors the next .
The switching happens fast enough to give a clear , bright display , as well as responsive touch sensing .
The elimination of the separate touch - sensing layer also makes for a thinner , lighter , brighter , and simpler touchscreen unit .
Apple proposes its solution for mobile devices , making references to iPhones , iPods , and even MacBooks , but do n't be surprised if such an innovation also makes its way into an Apple tablet .

An over turned IDF jeep is seen after a stabbing attack in the West Bank junction of Tapuah , near Nablus Wednesday .
( AP )
AP contributed to this report .
The terrorist who stabbed an IDF soldier to death at the Tapuahjunction on Wednesday afternoon was a Palestinian Authority policeofficer from Yabed , according to IDF sources .
The IDF soldier was named as First - Sgt. Ihab Khatib , 26 , from the northern village of Marar .
He served as a logistics non-commissioned officer in the Kfir Brigade .
Khatib was waiting in his Sufa jeep in a queue of traffic when he was stabbed in the chest through an open window .
In the soldier 's attempt to speed away , the vehicle overturned .
The PA officer , identified as Mahmoud Hattib , was then run over and lightly hurt by a local securityofficer from the nearby settlement of Rehelim .
He was then arrested bypolice .
Defense officials assessed that Hattib worked alone .
Khatib was evacuated to Petah Tikva 's Beilinson Hospital , where he succumbed to the knife wounds .
The soldier is survived by a father , a mother , two brothers and three sisters .
Several years ago , his uncle was killed in action .
In the Second Lebanon War , his aunt was killed when a Katyusha rocket fired by Hizbullah hit her house .
The Binyamin and Samaria Citizens ' Committee blasted Defense Minister Ehud Barak after the deadly attack .
“ It ’sno small wonder that when the defense minister is busy implementing theracist settlement construction freeze and with vain arrests ofsettlers , the terrorists and their accomplices are celebrating , ” read astatement from the organization .
“ Today , the settlement freeze monitorsvisited Kfar Tapuah while the terror attack took place right undertheir noses .
” In December , after months of quiet in the WestBank , 45 - year - old father of seven Meir Chai was killed in a drive - byshooting attack near the northern Samaria settlement of Shavei Shomron .
Chaiwas the fourth person killed by terrorists in the West Bank in 2009 .
InMarch , two traffic policemen , Senior Warrant Officers YehezkelRamazreger and Chief Warrant Officer David Rabinovitch , were shot deadin the Jordan Valley , and in April , 13 - year - old Shlomo Nativ wasstabbed to death near his home in the Gush Etzion settlement of BatAyin .
The commander of CFB Trenton , a career officer with 23 years in the military , has been charged with two counts of first - degree murder in the deaths of two women - a corporal at Trenton and a Belleville woman who vanished 11 days ago .
Col .
Russell Williams , 46 , was also charged Monday in with sexual assault in connection with two home invasions in the Tweed area , Det. Insp. Chris Nicholas said at a news conference today in Belleville .
The charges came “ due to a singularity in those incidents , ” Nicholas said .
“ We linked those crimes to a single suspect . ”
Jessica Lloyd , 27 , vanished Jan. 28 and police said on Monday that her body had been found .
A second woman , Cpl. Marie France Comeau of the 435th squadron , Trenton , was found dead in her home in Brighton on Nov. 25 , 2009 .
The home invasions occurred in September .
“ Geography played a role ” in the investigation , said Belleville Police Chief Cory McMullan .
Williams has had a full and high profile 23 - year career in the military .
He has been responsible for some of Canada ’s most significant recent military operations , including overseeing the backbone of Canada ’s contribution to the crisis in Haiti – a 24 - hour “ air bridge ” that links Trenton with Port au Prince , Jacmel and Kingston , Jamaica .
He also was responsible for co-coordinating re-supply for Canada ’s mission in Afghanistan and air support at the Vancouver Olympics .
Earlier in January , Williams made an appearance and was photographed with defence minister Peter MacKay and General Walter J. Natynczyk , Chief of the Defence Staff during an inspection of a Canadian aircraft that was on its way to support relief efforts in Port - au - Prince .
During his career he has also been responsible for flying Canadian dignitaries around , including the Governor General .
At a late afternoon news conference , Maj. Gen .
Yvan Blondin , flanked by other miliatary personnel , offered his condolences to the loved ones of those who had been murdered .
He also announced that Williams has been relieved of his command .
Blondin said the entire base “ was shocked ” by the news of the charges .
Blondin flew to CFB Trenton this afternoon from his base in Winnipeg .
He is Williams ’ direct commander and spent the afternoon meeting with staff on base as well as members of the community .
“ We are as touched as the community , ” he said .
He told the news conference that the operations of the base – which are vital to Haiti , Afghanistan and the Vancouver Olympics – “ must and will continue . ”
As to Williams and the charges , Blondin said : “ We do n’t know the results of the investigative process … we do know charges have been laid . ”
Blondin said that the military does not perform pyschological evalutations before it promotes its officers .
Promotions are based on perfomance and those who are promoted for leadership “ are extraordinary , ” he said .
As Williams ’ commander , Blondin said that ’s what he saw – extraordinary performance during his military career .
He assured the media that due process will take place .
Earlier Monday afternoon Williams appeared in the provincial courthouse in Belleville in hand and leg shackles .
He entered the courtroom confidently , dressed in a blue prison - issue jumpsuit and booties .
He was remanded in custody and will appear by video on February 18th .
A publication ban was ordered , typical in bail hearings , and there is a publication ban is on the names of the sexual assault victims .
A family friend , who did not want to be identified , told The Canadian Press earlier that Lloyd ’s family was told about the discovery of the woman ’s body on Sunday night .
The last time anyone heard from Lloyd was at 10:36 p.m. on Jan. 28 when she sent a text message to a friend .
She was reported missing the next day after she failed to show up for her job with the Tri-Board Student Transportation Services in neighbouring Napanee .
Lloyd ’s purse and her glasses were still in her apartment when they went there to check for her .
Police had used ground and helicopter searches to look for Lloyd , and friends and acquaintances distributed flyers around the Belleville area and had set up several Facebook groups to spread the word about her disappearance .
“ The community is devastated , ” said Tweed reeve Jo-Anne Albert .
“ Everyone has followed the news and hoped and prayed that this young lady would be found and brought home to her family .
So it ’s definitely not the outcome that we wanted . ”
Albert and her staff can’t believe it , she said .
Tweed is a peaceful community and this is the first time something like this has happened there , she said .
Everyone has been involved because of how close Lloyd lived to Tweed , said Albert , who did not know Lloyd or her family personally .
Comeau ’s boyfriend discovered her body inside her Raglan St. home , neighbours said .
He had come to check up on her after she missed a shift as a flight attendant with 437th transport squadron at CFB Trenton .

“ He came out white as a ghost , just saying , “ She ’s been killed .
She ’s dead , ’ ” one neighbour said .
Chanci Mackenzie , who lived next door to her , said Comeau , 37 , had moved to the newly - developed street in September , 2008 .
She was quiet and kept to herself , perhaps the result of being a French speaker in a mostly Anglophone neighbourhood .
But in their brief encounters , Mackenzie said Comeau was always friendly .
“ She was really nice , really pleasant , ” she said .
“ It ’s a very new street .
We all moved in at the same time and we were still all getting to know each other . ”
Since her death , Comeau ’s friends and family have commemorated her life on a Facebook page .
“ Marie , you were such an absolutely ( sic ) beautiful angel here on earth with your warm and embracing nature and the love you had for everyone who surrounded you , ” wrote Marion Chalut .
Adam Morrison , a friend of Comeau ’s for eight years , wrote , “ I will truly miss you and your open mind as well as your beautiful smile and always shining personality . ”
Comeau ’s death rattled the small community , home to dozens of military personnel .
Now that Col. Williams has been charged , the area is in shock .
“ The phone has n’t stopped ringing .
People from the base calling around , ” said one neighbour , who asked not to be named .
“ ( Williams ) is someone who is very much respected in the military community … it makes it even more personal . ”
An active member of the local community , Williams made a public appearance this past fall at a Belleville Bulls ’ hockey game when the team announced plans to dedicate the 2009 /2010 season to the men , women and families of 8 Wing Trenton .
He also was front and centre at Trenton when the Olympic flame torchbearer was announced for his base .
Williams , who has a degree in Economics and Political Science from the University of Toronto and a Master of Defence Studies from the Royal Military College , enrolled in the Canadian Forces in 1987 .
He received his wings in 1990 and was posted to three Canadian Forces flight training schools where he was an instructor .
Williams , who has no children , is said to be a keen photographer , fisherman and runner .
In 1992 , Williams was posted to the 434th ( Combat Support ) Squadron in Shearwater , Nova Scotia , where he flew the CC144 Challenger – a military plane used to transport high - ranking officials such as the Prime Minister and the Governor General .
He is married to Mary Elizabeth Harriman , who lives and works in Ottawa as the associate executive director of the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada .
According to a neighbour who asked not to be identified she comes to their house in Trenton on weekends .
“ Mary Elizabeth is a beloved member of our staff …
She ’s taking an extended leave of absence to focus on this matter , ” said spokeswoman Eileen Melnick - McCarthy , declining to comment further .
In January 2009 he was posted to the Canadian Forces Language School in Gatineau for a 6 - month period of French language training , during which he was promoted to his current rank .
He took over as commander of 8 Wing CFB - Trenton in July , 2009 .

Researchers at NYU School of Medicine have found that elevated cerebrospinal fluid levels of phosphorylated tau231 ( P - tau231 ) , a damaged tau protein found in patients with Alzheimer 's disease , may be an early diagnostic biomarker for Alzheimer 's disease in healthy adults .
The study published this month online by Neurobiology of Aging shows that high levels of P- tau231 predict future memory decline and loss of brain gray matter in the medial temporal lobe - a key memory center .
Prior studies found the medial temporal lobe to be the most vulnerable brain region in the early stages of Alzheimer 's disease accumulating damaged tau proteins in the form of neurofibrillary tangles .
Tangles are one of the signature indicators of Alzheimer 's disease , in addition to beta amyloid plaques .
" Our research results show for the first time that elevated levels of P - tau 231 in normal individuals can predict memory decline and accompanying brain atrophy , " said lead author Lidia Glodzik MD , PhD , assistant research professor , Department of Psychiatry at the Center for Brain Health and Center of Excellence on Brain Aging at NYU School of Medicine .
" Our findings suggest that P - tau231 has the potential to be an important diagnostic tool in the pre-symptomatic stages of Alzheimer 's disease . "
Researchers evaluated 57 cognitively healthy older adults and studied the relationships between baseline cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers , longitudinal memory performance and longitudinal measures of the medial temporal lobe gray matter using Magnetic Resonance Imaging , or MRI .
Two years later , researchers found that 20 out of 57 healthy adults showed decreased memory performance .
The group with worsened memory had higher baseline levels of P - tau231 and more atrophy in the medial temporal lobe .
The higher P - tau231 levels were associated with reductions in medial temporal lobe gray matter .
Authors concluded that elevated P - tau231 predicts both memory decline and medial temporal lobe atrophy .
" Identifying people at risk for Alzheimer 's disease is the necessary first step in developing preventive therapies , " said co-author Mony de Leon , EdD , professor , Department of Psychiatry and director of the Center for Brain Health at the Center of Excellence on Brain Aging at NYU School of Medicine and Research Scientist at the Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research .
" This study shows that Alzheimer 's disease pathology may be recognized in the normal stages of cognition .
This observation may be of value in future studies investigating mechanisms that cause or accelerate dementia . "
This study was done in collaboration with the Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research ( NY ) , Applied NeuroSolutions , Inc. ( IL ) , QiLu Hospital of Shandong University ( China ) , The Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital ( Sweden ) and the Institute for Basic Research ( NY ) .
Funding for this study was provided by the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) in Bethesda , Maryland .

For almost a year and a half Republicans have been nurturing a dream that they could turn Barack Obama into Jimmy Carter by stopping the passage of health care reform , but with the House passage of the health care bill by a vote of 219 - 212 , Republicans have not only seen their dream of turning Obama into a one termer shatter , but their dream is dead , and Obama remains strong .
Remember Jim DeMint ’s dream of breaking Obama :
DeMint said , “ ‘ If we ’re able to stop Obama on this , it will be his Waterloo .
It will break him , ' ” House Republicans continued to meander along with the talking points that worked so well for them during the summer town hall meeting .
Rep. Nathan Deal ( R - GA ) claimed that the health care bill was historic because , “ unprecedented and unconstitutional mandates on our states . ”
Rep. David Nunes ( R - CA ) claimed that the bill was , “ the cornerstone of [ a ] Socialist utopia . ” Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) summed up the GOP position as the Republicans , “ decided apparently that they benefit from virulence , hatred , disruption . ”

In comparison to the insane ramblings of gloom and doom coming from the Republican side , Democrats seemed sane .
Throughout the hours of debate , it was as if the two sides were not even debating the same issue .
Rep. Tim Bishop ( D - NY ) said , “ Amidst angry and at times even hateful rhetoric , amidst the misinformation and scare tactics , there exists one simple truth , and that truth is that the current system is unsustainable . ”
Rep. John Lewis ( D - GA ) said , “ This may be the most important vote that we cast as members of this body .
We have a moral obligation today , tonight to make health care a right and not a privilege . ”
The entire GOP strategy for turning Barack Obama into a one termer centered on stopping health care reform , and giving him his defining defeat .
They wanted to make Obama look like another weak Democrat .
They risked everything on health care , and tonight they lost big .
The Republican Party had a glimmer of hope and relevancy , but it was extinguished tonight .
Democrats should pray every night that the Republicans ignore the economy this fall and run on the decided issue of health care reform .
By doing so , they will be playing into the Democrats hands .
Even worse for the GOP , Obama and the Democrats are now free to focus on the economy and jobs for the next 8 months until the mid-term elections , and Obama now can add an historic piece of legislation to his stellar resume .
The Republican hopes of defeating Barack Obama in 2012 hinged on stopping health care reform .
They tried to turn Superman back into Clark Kent , and now all they have left is white rage , a pile of tea bags , and 18 months of doing nothing for the American people .
The mystery deepens — where did that decline go ?
Frank Lansner has done some excellent follow - up on the missing “ decline ” in temperatures from 1940 to 1975 , and things get even more interesting .
Recall that the original “ hide the decline ” statement comes from the ClimateGate emails and refers to “ hiding ” the tree ring data that shows a decline in temperatures after 1960 .
It ’s known as the “ divergence problem ” because tree rings diverge from the measured temperatures .
But Frank shows that the peer reviewed data supports the original graphs and that measured temperature did decline from 1960 onwards , sharply .
But in the GISS version of that time - period , temperatures from the cold 1970′s period were repeatedly “ adjusted ” years after the event , and progressively got warmer .
The most mysterious period is from 1958 to 1978 , when a steep 0.3C decline that was initially recorded in the Northern Hemisphere .
Years later that was reduced so far it became a mild warming , against the detailed corroborating evidence from raobcore data .
Raobcore measurements are balloon measures .
They started in 1958 , twenty years before satellites .
But when satellites began , the two different methods tie together very neatly –telling us that both of them are accurate , reliable tools .
You can see how similar the data from both methods is :
So what do the raobcores tell us about the period before satellites started recording temperatures ?
They make it clear that temperatures fell quickly from 1960 - 1970 .
The decline in the original graph in National Geographic in 1976 is apparently backed up by highly accurate balloon data , and was based on peer reviewed data : Budyko 1969 and Angell and Korshover ( 1975 ) .
These two sets overlap from 1958 to 1960 , and correlate well , so stitching them together is reasonable thing to do and it does n’t make much difference which year is chosen from the overlap period ( indeed any other choice makes the decline slightly steeper ) .
What ’s thought provoking is that the raobcore data above is for 30N - 30S , covering all the tropics on both sides of the equator , and yet still shows the decline .
That begs the question of whether the Southern Hemisphere data has been adjusted too .
It would be good to see the raobcore sets further up towards the arctic .
It would also be good to look at the Southern Hemisphere .
Where are the data sets and peer reviewed papers on temperature from 1965 to 1980 ?
I ’d like to follow that up .
Three decades of adjustments
When did the “ funny business ” begin ?
By 1980 Hansen and GISS had already produced graphs which were starting to neutralize the decline .
His graphs of 1987 and then 2007 further reduced the decline , until the cooling from 1960 to 1975 was completely lost .
Watch how the cooling trend of the 1960′s to 1970′s is steadily adjusted up so that 0.3 degrees cooler gradually becomes 0.03 rising ( notice the red and blue horizontal lines in the graphs above ) .
Mathews Graph 1976 : 1955 – 1965 was around 0.3C warmer than 1970′s
Hansen / GISS
1980 : 1955 – 1965 was around 0.1C warmer than 1970′s
Hansen / GISS
1987 : 1955 – 1965 was around 0.05C warmer than 1970′s
Hansen / GISS
2007 : 1955 – 1965 was around 0.03C cooler than 1970′s
And in 1974 , there was the fore - runner of the “ It ’s worse than we thought ” message .
…
Frank has more information and details on his blog Hide the decline .
If 1958 temperatures were similar to the 1990′s , it rewrites the entire claim of all the unprecedented warming of late .
Lansner also remind us of the photos taken in the arctic by submarines that surfaced around the north pole .

Di solito sono un ottimista : ma conosco da troppo tempo la subcultura di chi , se perde una partita di Champions League , esce dal campo con la scusa che un riflettore non funziona bene .

Ora siamo un po ' più in Sudamerica e un po ' meno in Europa .
E - ancora una volta - il problema non sono né Polverini né Formigoni , ma lo sghignazzare prepotente sulle regole , la logica violenta per cui vince chi ha più muscoli e non chi ha ragione , insomma la gigantesca lezione di diseducazione civile in cui si sono performati .

WASHINGTON - More than 2,500 Minnesota National Guard soldiers who are owed a total of $ 10 million in overtime pay for their deployment in Iraq three years ago are still being told the check 's in the mail .
Now members of the Minnesota congressional delegation are pressing the Pentagon to make good on the long - overdue checks to the state 's famed 34th ( Red Bull ) Infantry Division , which served in Iraq longer than any other U.S. military unit .
Confronting Defense Secretary Robert Gates in an Armed Services Committee hearing Wednesday , Rep. John Kline , R - Minn. , thundered : " My question is when can these soldiers expect to receive these payments ? "
The response , which came from Under Secretary Robert Hale : " I 'll take that for the record . "
Kline , a retired Marine colonel , translated Hale 's answer in an interview afterwards : " We got no answer in terms of a date or a time . "
" It 's frustrating as heck , " said Rep. Tim Walz , D - Minn. , a former National Guardsman , who attended the hearing .
" There 's no doubt they have drug their feet bureaucratically on this . "
What Kline and Walz did get , however , was a promise to get an answer within weeks , which they think will resolve the pay issue within months .
" The important thing is they know we 're watching , and they 're now on the record , in front of cameras , so they have to do something , " Kline said .
That would be good news to Red Bull tank commander Jason Malley .
The U.S. government owes him $ 4,400 in overtime pay for a deployment that was extended to 23 months during the 2007 Iraq surge ordered by former President George W. Bush .

As many as a third of the 34th 's soldiers were n't so lucky ; their unemployment rate is more than four times the state average .
Scientists used under water microphones to listen to the whales Scientists on Shetland believe they may have discovered a previously - unobserved technique being used by killer whales to catch herring .
Researchers from Aberdeen and St Andrews Universities recorded the whales emitting a low - pitched noise which caused the fish to bunch up .
The mammals then stun the fish with their tails before eating them .
The scientists said this behaviour has not been seen anywhere else in the world .
The findings have come to light in the BBC2 series " Simon King 's Shetland Diaries " .
Whale researcher , Dr Volker Deecke , demonstrated how his team used underwater microphones to record unusual sounds made by killer whales .
These are sentient animals , with complex family structures , but being so close you really get the sense that there is so much more to these creatures than we currently know
Simon King
They included a low - pitched noise that the researchers believe caused the herring to bunch up in a tight shoal .
The whales then slap the shoal with their tails to stun the fish before killing and feeding on them .
It is only a theory at this stage and studies will resume in the summer , but the evidence is described as compelling , even though this behaviour has n't been seen before in any orcas anywhere else in the world .
The use of a herding call was first described from Iceland by research colleagues of Dr Deecke .
However , it was believed that this hunting technique was confined to Iceland , as other killer whale populations feeding on herring did not appear to use it .
Acoustic research Scientists said the fact that the herding call had been recorded in the waters around Shetland suggested that the large groups of killer whales seen feeding offshore are part of the Icelandic herring - feeding population .
Volker Deecke said : " It illustrates the value of doing acoustic research when trying to determine the population identity of killer whale populations .
Simon King on Shetland " Even a short recording of sounds can answer questions that could take years of work using other methods such as photographic identification of individuals " .
Simon King said : " There is something about the beast from the deep rising up .
It is just amazing .
" These are sentient animals , with complex family structures , but being so close you really get the sense that there is so much more to these creatures than we currently know " .
The research was funded by the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland with additional support from Scottish Natural Heritage and SEERAD .

South Australian Attorney - General Michael Atkinson has stepped up his personal attack on video game campaigners , likening them to bikie gangs .
The gamers4croydon group is running a candidate for next month 's SA election , demanding there be a R - 18 classification for video games .
Mr Atkinson remains opposed and has told the ABC's Good Game program of threats made to him .
" About two o'clock in the morning I had a threatening note from a gamer shoved under my door , " he said .
" I feel that my family and I are more at risk from gamers than we are from the outlaw motorcycle gangs who also hate me and are running a candidate against me .
" The outlaw motorcycle gangs have n't been hanging around my doorstep at 2:00 am , a gamer has . "
Mr Atkinson holds a veto power on reviewing national classification laws and remains opposed to relaxing a ban on R - rated computer games .
" The reason that I think interactive games are different is that in interactive games the person playing is doing the actions and I therefore think it has a higher impact - impact has always been a consideration in censorship or classification , call it what you will , " he told Good Game .
" I 'm sure most people can distinguish the fantasy of a computer game from the reality , but it is the small number we know can't that leads to mass murder in American high schools and in Thailand ... led to a gamer playing out the fantasy of hijacking a taxi cab and murdering the driver .
It happened , " the Minister also told ABC Stateline in an interview back in 2008 .
Mr Atkinson admitted his three sons disagreed with his view on games classifications .
Discussion
Even though a discussion paper on the classification issue has now been released , Mr Atkinson thinks it has shortcomings .
" It would have been a fairer and more accessible paper to the vast majority of society if it had included still images of the games about which there 's an argument , " he said .
" I think it 's very hard for those members of the public who do n't play games to relate to the debate . "
Kat Nicholson is standing against Mr Atkinson in his Adelaide seat of Croydon at the March 20 poll .
" I really think Australia needs an R - 18 classification .
I believe it 's better for parents , it 's better for children because parents can better monitor the content that their children are accessing , " she said .
" A lot of parents for example do n't realise that games that should be R-rated are being MA - rated here and this is educating them , this is making them realise it needs to be changed .
" I believe adults have the right to make adult choices regarding this matter . "
Many companies want outside help with redundancy programmes

George Clooney is up for an Oscar for his latest film role in which he plays a man who fires people for a living .
But what 's it really like to sack people ?
In the past 15 years , Janet Shearer has personally made thousands of employees redundant .
But Janet is n't some cold - hearted , cost - cutting chief executive .
She 's the managing director of a British firm that sacks other companies ' employees .
Those who have seen George Clooney 's latest film , Up in the Air , will be familiar with the job .
It 's not rich tea and sympathy and being really fluffy
Janet Shearer , HR consultant Clooney 's character Ryan Bingham is a " corporate downsizer " , PR - speak for somebody who flies around the country sacking people .
The character delights in racking up frequent - flier miles from his cross-country journeys .
Clooney 's portrayal has earned him an Oscar nomination - and given audiences a glimpse at an occupation that may sound unpleasant .
Every day Clooney tells workers - in cold , assembly - line style - that they are about to become unemployed .
When Natalie , a young go - getter , wants to improve efficiency even more by scripted sacking via videoconference , Bingham shows her the emotions involved in ending someone 's professional life .
Those scenes are portrayed by real workers who have lost their jobs .
Grim announcement
Even for those who have never been made redundant , the scenario is n't hard to envisage - an employee gets called into a room and informed they 're surplus to requirements .
But when a downsizer gets involved , the grim announcement is n't coming from their manager or chief executive - it 's from a stranger .
When Charlotte was made redundant from her company of 12 years , it caught her off guard .
There had been whispers among employees that they were going to have to relocate or be made redundant , but the union had n't said anything .
Some people seem well suited to the task of firing people
Then she received a letter saying her job was at risk and got called into a meeting with Ms Shearer , whom she 'd never met .
" [ The management ] do n't actually care , that 's your first thought , " Charlotte says .
" They 're hiding behind their glass doors . "
The business of ending someone 's employment has the potential to be fraught on both sides of the desk Ms Shearer says it 's difficult to predict exactly how a person will respond to being made redundant .
She agrees that dignity and respect are key to handling the situation - and it does n't hurt to have some tissues at the ready .
" It can be difficult , but you just try to see that you can support them , " she says .
" It 's not rich tea and sympathy and being really fluffy
But if they wanted to grieve and let that out , absolutely . "
Tied up in red tape Charlotte , for her part , took Ms Shearer up on that offer .
" I do n't do calm , " Charlotte says .
" I was very vociferous [ Janet ] just sat there and let me get on with it .
I went in there a bit hostile , really .
I thought , ' I 'm going to give her a rough time ' . "
George Clooney is a downsizer with a human side Even after first meeting , she notes : " I still was n't sure .
Give her her dues , she did try to make us feel good . "
Small and medium - sized companies in the UK often bring in outside firms to help with their redundancy programmes , but they still continuously contribute to the process .
Chief executives at those companies have to defend themselves against allegations that they 're too afraid to face the people they 're sacking .
Carol Ann Guilford , the managing direct of HR Solutions , says although they may be afraid of making someone redundant , it 's a different kind of fear .
" It 's not necessarily [ facing ] employees , " she says .
" The red tape surrounding employment law is the thing that makes them more scared . "
The executives are n't the only ones who get scared - employees who have been made redundant run the gamut of emotion .
Many simply sit in shock .
Cold process Just as Clooney is stoic making his grim announcement , corporate downsizers remain calm in the face of uncomfortable responses - the tears and suicide threats , the " why mes " and " who do you think you ares " .
" When you first [ sack someone ] , you always get upset , " Ms Guilford says .
" It 's a very cold process and you have to manage it with dignity and respect .
You can't have emotions involved . "
The Trades Union Congress , which represents more than six million union members , does n't encourage the outsourcing of redundancy programmes .
They say involving an outside party could communicate a lack of responsibility toward workers and generate resentment .
For many , being laid off is one of the most traumatic experiences in their lives Richard Tadman , the managing director of Connect , a company that tries to help redundant employees find new jobs , also thinks that totally outsourcing redundancies makes the employer look bad - like they had " almost washed their hands of the process " .
" It 's a bad enough message without having a third party do it , " he says .
But Ms Shearer , of JDS Human Resources , describes the third party as a " bridge " between the employer and employee , not a barrier .
Although Charlotte says her initial reaction was that Ms Shearer was " working for them " , she eventually felt the whole redundancy process was less daunting as a result of the consultant 's help .
" If you go in with the management team , you go in with the hope you can negotiate , " she says .
" [ Janet tried ] to ensure you understand . "
In the UK , strict legal protections mean that one false step could easily land an employer in a tribunal for unfair dismissal .
So it 's unlikely Clooney 's rapid - fire style will be adopted anytime soon .
In fact , Ms Shearer says most downsizers do their homework about the company and worker .
Clooney 's consulting sessions with dozens of employees in a single day would take much longer in the real world .
Ms Guilford recently worked with a company that made 90 employees redundant .
The one - on - one meetings alone took a month - and anything faster might be viewed as unprofessional .
Similarly , Clooney 's high - flying lifestyle , hopping from one beleaguered company to the next , is quite different from the typical consultant's .
" I do n't know anyone who just does redundancies in HR , " says Judy Crook , of Right Hand HR .
" I certainly do n't fly around the country doing redundancies . "
But one aspect of Up in the Air indisputably rings true .
" It 's not about the individual , unfortunately , " Ms Crook says .
" It 's about the job . "
As for Ms Shearer , handling thousands of redundancies over the years could have taken its toll , but she 's found a secret to survival - and the answer to one of the film 's most pointed questions .
" Knowing you 've been fair and done something in the best way lets you sleep at night . "
Below is a selection of your comments .
I used to work as a personnel manager for a major retailer that was taken over by a competitor .
There were many overlaps , both at head office , where I worked , and in stores .
I survived the takeover , but the price was that I had to go around closing down surplus outlets and making the staff redundant .
I was fortunate to be headhunted by another company , but unfortunately my new employer was also taken over by a rival and I faced repeating the experience .
I resigned my well - paid job to avoid having to put more people out of work and changed to a poorly paid ( by comparison ) job as a teacher .
My experience is that there is a personal cost to corporate restructuring that is felt by everybody involved - except the board members who get to give themselves huge bonuses for cutting wage - bills .
Jon , Caterham , UK I think this job is very cold and totally horrid , having worked with the unemployed & even being on the other side working with employers .
You can bring in HR specialist but the hiring / firing is the responsibility of the employer , and during redundancy it is even more important to show some empathy for your workers - without whom the organisation would have ended up at death 's door even sooner .
So companies take note , this is not the way forward , show some heart and act with some integrity .
Sabeena Aslam , Manchester , UK I have been made redundant four times in 20 years .
Each occasion has had its moments , good and bad :
1 ) Being made redundant on 23 December , the day after the company Christmas party , with no warning .
2 ) being made redundant from a large US company where the redundancy payment was based on salary , age and length of service .
News came the day before my 50th birthday , on being told this , the " downsizer " changed the date of my release to provide me with a 50 % increase in my final salary .
A thoughtful touch .
3 ) En route to a sales meeting , being invited to meet my manager in a motorway services " for a coffee " .
Quickly done , but by the time I got back to my car , my mobile phone had been blocked , so that I was unable to call anyone with the news .
4 ) Being made redundant on 12 Sept 2001 , and just being grateful that I was still alive .
Nigel H , Leicester , UK I 've sat on both sides of this table , and frankly I 'm not certain which I 'd prefer to be on .
It 's a horrible task to tell someone they 've lost their job , especially if you know the person reasonably well , and even more so if you know the loss of income is going to be particularly painful .
The reality is that it 's not personal , but of course that 's no comfort if you have families to feed and little prospect of replacing the income .
Although it 's never easy to accept this news , it 's pointless begging for your job .
My advice to anyone facing redundancy is to let the emotions flow at home , or outside .
And approach the reality as a job in itself - the key thing to do is focus on what the ex-employer can do to help you find new work , and always remember to help yourself .
Finding a job can be a full - time job , and should always be considered as such .
Do n't slack off ... not until you have a signed contract .
Good luck .
Nic , London
What probably irks people about this is not only that their employer does n't have the guts or respect for them to tell them face to face , but is blowing enormous sums of money that could have kept them employed , in hiring some " consultant " to do it for them .
I do n't think any employer would be that happy if an employee sent someone in to resign on their behalf , so it should n't be acceptable the other way round either .
Ian White , London Providing the consultant is n't just delivering the message and compensation package etc , then it can be seen as fairer - eg : if they are responsible for overseeing the selectivity criteria - then at least you know it is n't a manipulated decision from your manager .
Hazel Smythe , Milton Keynes I have been an HR Manager for six years and redundancies are the worst part of my work .
Last year I managed three rounds of redundancies , including members of my own team .
I can understand why companies choose to bring in external consultants as it can be a very personal matter in a small business , which is not the intention of the process .
As Ms Crook says , it is about the job not the person .
I always lived by " do unto others as you would have them do unto you " .
Unfortunately redundancies can be a miserable fact of life but treating people with dignity and respect , allowing them to vent when required , whilst keeping your own head to help them , means that it does n't have to be a completely negative experience .
There needs to be genuine consultation , and if that happens , my experience has been that most employees will feel that as much as been done as possible to avoid the dismissal .
And after all of the meetings are over and the P45s issued , there is the inevitable survivors ' guilt for those left behind - including the HR team .
No one enjoys it but you can do the best possible job and take some comfort in that .
Allie , Cambridge
Over the last six years , I 've had to fire a handful of people for reasons of incompetence .
It 's horrendous .
EU legislation designed to protect the employee means that you can't just take someone for a coffee and a chat about how it 's not working out .
Instead you have to do a brutally cold process that far from protecting the employee , crushes them and their self - esteem .
The law in this area needs revisiting - it 's currently quite inhuman .
Daniel Graham , London I 've been made redundant twice - once the young boss described it as the " Gorky Park " option when he met me in a street and walked me to a park where he handed over a letter which told me I 'd lost my job - ironically the terms were actually quite good , just the locus and mode of delivery was appalling .
The second time was a full corporate affair , HR , line manager and junior Partner all waiting for me in a room - position identified as redundant , five weeks consultation to look at alternatives .
None offered at the end of this time .
Neither was a pleasant experience .
Nigel , London I was made redundant from a job a couple of years ago .
My boss called me into his office along with a complete stranger then proceeded to avoid eye contact with me the entire time while the stranger fired me .
I was appalled .
Ellie , Leeds
I 've just been made redundant at a school along with eight other members of staff - all we got was a three - minute phone call , the principal did n't even have the decency to do it face to face .
One month later , I 'm still waiting to be told what redundancy package I 'll get after 10 years service .
I once had to make redundant 880 night shift workers in the Middle East , but at at least I did the decent thing , and called them in in groups by department .
Chris B , Crediton Some 30 years ago I was tasked with closing a shipyard repair facility at Bromborough .
About 200 skilled workers were summarily made redundant by absent directors .
These were the skilled men who ensure the fleet worked and earned profits to support others .
All they saw was an implanted southerner to do the miserable task and thank them .
Directors absent , yard deserted and machinery abandoned .
This scenario was repeated in Southampton in three years .
I left almost immediately but only after a one - sided interview with the MD .
It is impossible to forget the anguish caused by such actions by absent decision makers .
Keith Stout , Fareham Hampshire , UK Years ago , I survived a 50 % cut in my department .
After a weekly staff meeting , half the people had yellow PostIt notes attached to their office doors like flags waving in the hallway .
My door did not have a flag .
Each said , " Come see me , M " .
After the first person exited M's office , it was clear what those flags meant .
I found a different position in the company and moved into it less than a month later .
I believe all the people let go were better off than staying with such a poor manager .
It is years later now .
I never allow anyone on impacted teams to know who is and is n't being let go until they know first .
They are told individually , personally , and never in a group .
I 'm happy that I have n't had to fire anyone in years .

Neuroeconomic theory : Using neuroscience to understand the bounds of rationality
Juan Carrillo , Isabelle Brocas
Why do people persistently make seemingly irrational decisions ?
This column introduces neuroeconomic theory , which uses neuroscience and neurobiology to try to shed light on the black box of human decision - making .
People often fail to make “ rational ” decisions .
Economic agents are subject to multiple biases that affect the way they perceive events , act upon them , and learn from experience .
Most of these anomalies are remarkably persistent and are widely documented in real world and laboratory environments by behavioural data .
To cite just a few , individuals have systematically biased beliefs about :
the prospects of their entrepreneurial endeavours ,
the amount they need to save for retirement , and
the size of the mortgages they can afford .
1
These behaviours cannot be ignored since they may have disastrous consequences for the economy – as we have recently witnessed during the subprime mortgage crisis .
Knowing what type of mistakes and biases are prevalent is an important starting point .
The main challenge , however , is to understand why they emerge , so that they can be predicted and , possibly , avoided .
A grey cloud over economics
Economics has always relied on a careful modelling of decision - makers .
They are described by utility functions that represent their goals , and they interact at ( Nash ) equilibrium .
Nevertheless , the discrepancies between theoretical predictions and observed behaviour have haunted the field for many decades .
To cope with this mismatch , behavioural economists have developed new theories of decision - making that are a better fit for the behavioural data than traditional models .
The methodology consists in building models to demonstrate the relationship between a cause ( such as a preference for a particular object ) and a behavioural anomaly .
This line of research formulates possible explanations for behavioural data , but it is nevertheless subject to shortcomings .
Often the cause is not observable , and there is no evidence of the relationship provided by the model .
Most notably , the freedom provided by the introspection method leads to a model selection problem .
Also , the cause of the behavioural anomaly may simply lie elsewhere .
Introducing neuroeconomic theory
Neuroeconomics offers a solution through an additional set of data obtained via a series of measurements of brain activity at the time of decisions .
Experimental neuroeconomics can be seen as a subfield of experimental economics , where behavioural data is enriched with brain data .
Neuroeconomic theory proposes to build brain - based models capable of predicting observed behaviour .
Experimental neuroeconomics is controversial .
While some consider it to be an irrelevant body of research , there are those who claim it is essential ( see Camerer , et al. 2005 , Gul and Pesenderfor 2008 ) .
In fairness , the field is probably too young to tell .
Surprisingly , the discussion has been centred on empirical issues regarding the collection method , amount , cost , and quality of brain data – the broad implications have not received as much attention .
Indeed , the new set of data provided by experimental neuroeconomics will shed light on the causes of behaviour ( and therefore of the behavioural anomalies ) and help build new theories capable of explaining and predicting decisions , a long - term goal of economics .
Neuroeconomic theory offers to do precisely this .
So far , research in that direction has been very limited and its impact has been largely ignored .
The objective of neuroeconomic theory is to build models based on evidence from the brain sciences , such as experimental neuroeconomics , but also other fields in neuroscience and neurobiology .
Measurement of brain activity provides information about the underlying mechanisms used by the brain during choice processes .
In particular , it shows which brain regions are activated when a decision is made and how these regions interact with each other .
This knowledge can then be used to build a model that represents this particular mechanism .
Contrary to behavioural economics , the model does not rely on introspection or plausible assumptions but rather on an existing and documented biological property of the brain .
Advantage 1 : A guideline for constraints
The methodology used in neuroeconomic theory has two advantages .
Primarily , evidence from the brain sciences provides precise guidelines for the constraints that should be imposed on decision - making processes .
This can help uncover the " true " motivations for the " wrong " choices and improve the predictive power of the theory .
Behavioural theories that account for biases in judgment build on specific models of preferences over beliefs or non-Bayesian updating processes .
Rather than guessing a cause for biases , neuroeconomic theory builds a model based on the existing physiological properties underlying learning and belief formation .
In principle , this can help pinpoint biological foundations for anomalous choices .
For example , research in neurobiology demonstrates that the brain cannot encode all the information contained in a signal .
A decision is triggered when “ enough ” information supporting one alternative is obtained , and the brain uses a variety of biological mechanisms to filter information in a constrained optimal way .
In a recent paper we show that these properties of the brain result in a behavioural tendency to confirm initial priors ( Brocas and Carrillo 2009 ) .
Behavioural data reports precisely that individuals stick too often to first impressions .
These confirmatory biases may all emerge from the same set of physiological information processing constraints .
Further work in that direction may help uncover the causes of other biases and determine whether they are all related to the same physiological limitations .
Advantage 2 : Uncovering “ exogenous ” preferences
The second advantage is that by explicitly modelling physiological properties , it is possible to provide foundations for some elements of preferences traditionally considered exogenous , such as risk aversion , ambiguity aversion , or time - preference rates .
Choices involving risk , uncertainty , or time delays may require complex trade - offs .
Measures of brain activity allow us to determine if the evaluation process is centralised or if different brain systems compete to influence the final decision .
Neuroeconomic theory proposes to model the actual brain organisation , determine the behaviour that emerges from it , and evaluate which theory fits best .
One example is “ discounting ” .
The standard neoclassical theory derives time - preference rates from a set of axioms on the preferences of individuals .
A nice property of these axioms is that discounting must be represented by a time - consistent function .
To account for the observed tendency of individuals to procrastinate , behavioural economists have modified this function by introducing a parameter of time - inconsistency whereas decision theorists have modified the original axioms .
In both cases , the motivation for the new theories is a behavioural observation that cannot be reconciled with the original theory .
Instead , our recent research uses neurobiological evidence to model inter-temporal choices as the result of a conflict between two brain systems , one interested in immediate gratification and one that can form a mental representation of future rewards .
Using this approach we are able to derive from first principles three properties of dynamic choices commonly observed in the data : positive discount rate , decreasing impatience , and heterogeneity of discount rates across activities ( Brocas and Carrillo 2008 ) .
A similar methodology can be applied to rationalise other observed characteristics of preferences .
Conclusion :
The individual as an organisation
Neuroeconomic theory will soon play a crucial role in the building of new reliable theories capable of explaining and predicting individual behaviour and strategic choices .
The main message is that the individual is not one coherent body .
The brain is a multi-system entity ( with conflicting objectives , restricted information , etc. ) and therefore the decision - maker must be modelled as an organisation .
We conclude with an analogy .
Before the so - called modern theory of the firm , organisations were modelled as individual players characterised by an input - output production function .
The systematic study of interactions between agents and decision processes within organisations ( acknowledging informational asymmetries , incentive problems , restricted communications channels , hierarchical structures , etc. ) led to novel economic insights .
Applying a similar methodology to study individual decision - making is , in our view , the most fruitful way to understand the bounds of rationality .

We will not discuss here whether these behaviors are ' irrational ' or simply result from preferences different from those that are usually assumed .

This wiki provides information and documentation for the University of Leicester student CubeSat project , PLUME ;
the Picosatellite of Leicester University Micrometeoroid Experiment
Very sadly PLUME is defunct , after several years of work .
The project is now in a state where it is not fair to ask for any more support or consideration from our colleagues and friends in industry and academia .
It is grim news indeed that we have not managed to produce a finished spacecraft after years of magnificent support from the Space Research Centre here in Leicester and our generous backers and collaborators across the world .
Like any worthwhile scheme , we will always benefit from the experience of running and constructing the satellite in our future careers .
None of us will ever forget the help we got that made it possible to work so well for so long .
I personally am indebted to everyone I worked alongside - everyone who read the documentation and contributed time and effort to the project , all while managing a rigorous and demanding degree , and particularly those who did so after the original PLUME team had started to graduate and disappear .
Probably none of the email addresses on this wiki work anymore .
PLUME had a reputation for being quite well documented , and I hope other student engineering and space science projects can benefit from reading about our work .
I want to archive the documents here at some point , but I wo n't check the forum too often and cannot be expected to answer questions there .
I wish you all the best in your future endeavors , whoever you are !

MOBILE , Ala . --
Mobile police used pepper spray and a Taser on a deaf and mentally disabled man Friday after they were unable to get him to come out of a bathroom at a Dollar General store , authorities said .
After forcibly removing Antonio Love from the bathroom of the Azalea Road store , officers attempted to book the 37 - year - old , on charges of resisting arrest , disorderly conduct and failure to obey a police officer , but the magistrate on duty at the jail refused to accept any of those charges .
Love 's family members said they had no idea where he was during the time that
police had him in custody .
Brodrick Love said the officers dropped his brother
off in the parking lot of their apartment building without saying what happened or why his brother had been missing for six hours .
Love 's family members have filed a formal complaint against the officers .
Christopher Levy , a Police Department spokesman , said the officers did n't find out that Love had a hearing impairment until after they got him out of the bathroom and found a card in his wallet indicating he was deaf .
The officers ' decision to take Love to jail -- even after they discovered his disability -- as well as their conduct throughout the incident is still under investigation , Levy said .
Use of the Taser and the pepper spray appear to be justified according to the department 's policy , he said .
Love , whose family said his mental abilities are about that of a 10 - year - old , wrote them a narrative of the incident as he recalled it .
The hand - scrawled , six - page note and the official police account of the confrontation are strikingly similar in their recitation of the chain of events .

Solar energy has long been one of the great hopes for fighting climate change and liberating the world from fossil fuels .
And it ’s easy to see why solar has captured the collective imagination :
All those photovoltaic panels look so shiny , futuristic , clean , and green .
That ’s not quite the case .
Any form of energy production has its dirty side and solar is no exception .
While its impact is nowhere near that of coal - fired power plants , photovoltaic modules are made from a witch ’s brew of toxic chemicals .
Arsenic , cadmium telluride , hexafluoroethane , lead , and polyvinyl fluoride are just some of the chemicals used to manufacture various types of solar cells .
None of this poses much , if any , threat during a solar panel ’s working life .
Solar modules — which are linked together to form a solar panel — for instance , are solid state and encased in glass or other protective material to keep them dry .
The problem , as the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition pointed out in a 2009 report , comes at the beginning and end of a panel ’s life .
Toxins potentially can be released during the manufacturing process — putting workers at risk — and when panels finally hit the scrap heap decades later .
“ The solar PV industry has the potential to provide enormous environmental benefits , ” according to the Silicon Valley Toxics report , “ but the toxic materials contained in solar panels will present a serious danger to public health and the environment if they are not disposed of properly when they reach the end of their useful lives . ”
The report compared the nascent but fast - growing solar industry to the electronics industry of past decades , which left a legacy of toxic pollution in the 1970s and ’ 80s .
Unlike the early electronics industry — which in Silicon Valley was literally built on plumes of contaminated groundwater — solar companies are taking a more responsible approach , as any green business must .
Companies such as thin - film module maker First Solar have implemented take - back and recycling programs from the get - go .
In labs at the University of Washington and elsewhere and at startups such as German ’s Heliatek , researchers are working on developing so - called organic solar cells that generate electricity — albeit very inefficiently so far — without using toxic chemicals .
Then there are companies like BioSolar that aim to take the toxics out of solar by substituting environmentally friendly materials .
The company , based in the Southern California city of Santa Clarita , is developing a plastic made from plant material — called bioplastic — that can be used as components in solar modules .
“ The solar industry will have some of the same problems the electronics industry had unless we plan now , ” says David Lee , BioSolar ’s chief executive .
“ The solar industry involves a lot of toxic chemicals and we have to look at the lifecycle of these materials , from mining to manufacturing . ”
That , of course , is easier said than done .
Most bioplastics are used to make disposable things — cups , plates , and trash bags — and are designed to be biodegradable .
A bioplastic used in a solar cell is built to last for the typical 25 - year life of the cell .
It must be able to withstand the high temperatures generated by photovolatic modules and be water tight to keep moisture at bay .
BioSolar ’s solution was to develop a proprietary process that strengthens petroleum - and toxin - free bioplastics so they can withstand temperature and moisture yet still be recycled or biodegrade in a landfill .
The company ’s first product is Bio Backsheet , a replacement for the the material that forms the protective back of a solar cell .
Standard so - called backsheets are usually made of polyvinyl fluoride , a chemical compound that can contain lead , chromium , cadmium , selenium , arsenic , and antimony .
“ Existing backsheets are extremely hard to recycle , ” says Lee , who holds a Ph.D. in electrical engineering .
“ The only way to get rid of them is by burying them in the ground . ”
According to Lee , BioSolar ’s Bio Backsheet can be safely recycled at the end of a solar module ’s life or disposed of in a landfill .
It will degrade — eventually I ’ll have to check but I suspect I ’ll just get a vague estimate — but without causing environmental contamination .
So far , BioSolar has only manufactured limited quantities of the Bio Backsheet , mainly so that solar module makers can test the product .
Lee says BioSolar is working with several solar companies who are testing the product , which he declined to identify .
BioSolar is also developing bioplastics that can be used to replace chemical - based substrates that form solar cells .
[ A customary word of caution about startups :
It ’s impossible at this stage to verify BioSolar ’s claims or whether its products will live up to their billing .
Founded in 2006 , BioSolar was initially funded by family and funds before going public in 2007 .
It trades in the over - the - counter market and has accumulated losses of $ 2.6 million since its inception , according to financial filings . ]
While BioSolar talks about greening the solar industry , the company ’s pitch to photovoltaic module makers is just as much about saving money as the world .
“ We all know that everyone loves green products , ” says Lee , “ but unless the cost is less , manufacturers do n’t pay much attention . ”
Lee is aiming to produce bioplastic solar cell components at half the cost of their chemical - based counterparts .
If he succeeds , solar power may finally start to live up to its clean , green billing .

'' To be honest , I can only drink it in halves .
To finish an evening , it is fine , but the taste lasts with me for four hours at a time . ''
The recent post about Indianapolis kicked off quite a debate on the blog and it struck me that it might be an idea to look at where Formula 1 wants to be , where it can go in practical terms , and whow it could all be paid for , without undermining the international price of a race .
The first question that must be addressed is does F1 need America ?
Clearly then answer to this is no as we have gone many years without one in the past .
Is it desirable to have a US Grand Prix ?
Yes , absolutely .
The United States is still the world ’s largest consumer market .
It is the major market for automobiles and , despite the recession , there is money to spend .
It is a mature market and people understand motor racing .
The American are a nation that likes shows and fairs and in the right place – and at the right price – it could be a huge success .
So where is the right place ?
Indianapolis managed to pull in crowds but they were lost in the vastness of the place .
It is clear that corporate America , and indeed the corporate world in general was not interested in being in Indiana .
This is important for sponsorship dollars .
Indianapolis is nice enough city , it has a great racing tradition , it is a brand , but it did not fit well with F1 .
It is much more a beer - and - hot - dog audience than the wine - and - prawn F1 set .
So where is better ?
There are a number of elements that need to be addressed when considering this .
There are the good racing venues , but there must be analysed not as racing fans would do , but rather as to whether a race is sustainable in that region .
If one looks at Europe , even the great Spa - Francorchamps struggles to survive because it is located in the wrong place .
Spa needs government backing to survive .
Is the US government going to pay for a race ?
No .
Are there state governments or cities that might ?
Perhaps .
But they need a good reason to do so .
Thus if F1 is to make it in America , it needs either to be willing to make an investment , or it needs an area that has a reason to want F1 .
Bernie Ecclestone has long dreamed of New York City .
It is a great dream , but New York City does not need any more tourists .
Its hotels are always well - filled .
It does not need to alter its image .
It is New York and F1 has nothing really to offer .
Thus its value to the city is minimal .
If , for example , there was a desire to revitalise an area of the city , to give it some glitz , then F1 might work but the revamping of the many docklands , old military bases and industrial lands has gone ahead without much F1 interest .
NASCAR tried to build a speedway on the marshes of New Jersey and ran into trouble even there .
Elsewhere in the east there is potential if someone can be found to invest .
If New York is impossible , Formula 1 would be happy with Miami , but again it is finding the right venue that is important .
Running a race on the infield at Miami Homeland , for example would probably not be a bad idea and permanent venues , such as the Palm Beach International Raceway , which has a 2 - mile road course , would require considerable investment .
There might be potential for other venues in Virgina an the Carolinas , but the fear with these is finding spectators .
The IndyCar event in St Petersburg , Florida , has been a big success but the track is too short for F1 and in any case there is a contract with IndyCar which runs until 2013 .
There is a tradition of racing in the downtown area that dates back to 1985 , but after 1990 complaints about noise stopped the race until 2003 .
As previously explained , the timing of the races is important for the live TV audiences – which is what sells a sport to the sponsors .
The major audiences these days are in Asia and so F1 needs a time zone that will allow Asians to watch races , without having to get up in the middle of the night .
Thus the West Coast is difficult .
That would work if there were four or more races a year in the time zone ( ie , two in America , one in Mexico , one in Canada and one in Brazil ) .
This would create regional prime time interest and then more fans might watch the races in Europe and Asia .
It is really a two - way equation .
A US F1 race needs an audience in Asia and Europe and in order to grow the sport there need to be follow - up possibilities for fans .
It would help to have a team and drivers , but one cannot hope for everything at the same time !
The West Coast has a number of great venues , some of which might work well for F1 : Sears Point is within easy reach of San Francisco , the wine country of Sonoma and so on .
It would be good , but the facility is a little basic in F1 terms .
Laguna Seca would be terrific , but the same applies .
The circuit needs better infrastructure .
The Monterey Peninsular probably has the accommodation for the F1 circus , but it would not leave much room for fans .
The area is close enough to the Bay Area to draw crowds but the roads could use improvement , but access from the south and Los Angeles is a long haul , unless there is some serious improvement done .
Tourism is already the peninsula ’s main industry .
With the exception of Long Beach , I think Laguna is the one place that might work , but only if there was financial help from the region .
Long Beach would have been perfect for Formula 1 , but when the opportunity to buy the race came up in 2005 , Formula
One did not move .
That was a sign that the sport really had no interest in getting into the United States if that involved investing money .
Instead the race was acquired by Kevin Kalkhoven and Gerald Forsythe , ensuring that the circuit would continue promoting US open - wheeler racing .
In March 2008 , the Grand Prix Association of Long Beach signed an agreement with the City of Long Beach to continue running races until 2015 , with an additional five - year option .
So F1 is locked out there .
The price of that transaction was $ 15 m , which is peanuts in the world of Formula One .
To put that into perspective , for the year ending December 2008 , the Long Beach Grand Prix ’s turnover was $ 15.5 m so the 2005 deal was a real bargain .
And a huge opportunity lost for Formula 1 .
The other project that has been discussed of late is one in the desert region to the south of Palm Springs where attempts are being made to build up tourism , mainly related to casinos , as California is losing much trade to Las Vegas .
The plans have been plodding slowly along but it seems that funding is needed if the area is to get a Grand Prix and the state of California finances are not good .
Las Vegas has always attracted Bernie Ecclestone , because there is so much cash flowing about there , but all attempts to take racing into Vegas have flopped .
The city exists to feed the casinos and anything that disrupts that business is bad for business .
The only way that could work now was if a casino owner decided to put a race track inside of its facilities .
The only man who might have done that was Steve Wynn , but he decided not to do that when he revamped the old Desert Inn golf course .
That was an opportunity lost .
The Pacific North West might offer some kind of potential particularly as IndyCar has turned its back on Portland International Raceway .
At under two miles this is really too short for F1 and has a crowd capacity of only 86,000 , but there is room for expansion in the infield and it has the advantages of being a long established race , a well - located circuit and it even has a light rail station and freeway access next to the venue .
The parkland setting means that it has the potential to develop in much the same way as Albert Park .
The Portland metropolitan area boasts a population of two million and there is easy access to the cities of Seattle and Vancouver , just across the border in Canada .
Portland is also known as a technology town , with the biggest employer being Intel and something like 1200 technology firms clustered there .
In many ways , with enlightened government , Portland is perfect for Formula 1 .

SSV Normandy SR - 1 Model : USS Prime Info : ------------------- ( From Completemasseffect.com )
The SSV Normandy [ 1 ] is an experimental ship that is commanded by Captain Anderson and later by Commander Shepard .
The designation of this three - deck ship " SR - 1 stands for Stealth Reconnaissance type ship , hull number one " .
The Citadel Council helped fund the project that created the Normandy .
The Normandy has a flight crew of roughly 25 with a complement of roughly 10 marines .
The Normandy is a prototype " deep scout " frigate , developed by the Systems Alliance with the assistance of the Citadel Council .
It is optimized for solo reconnaissance missions deep within unstable regions , using state - of - the - art stealth technology .
Stealth
For centuries , it was assumed that starship stealth was impossible .
The heat generated by routine shipboard operations is easily detectable against the absolute - zero background temperature of space .
The Normandy , however , is able to temporarily " store " this heat in lithium heat sinks deep within the hull .
Combined with refrigeration of the exterior hull , the ship can travel undetected for hours , or drift passively for days of covert observation .
This is not without risk .
The stored heat must eventually be radiated , or it will build up to levels capable of cooking the crew alive .
Tantalus drive Another component of the stealth system is the Normandy ’s revolutionary Tantalus drive , a mass effect core twice the standard size .
The Tantalus drive generates mass concentrations that the Normandy " falls into " , allowing it to move without the use of heat - emitting thrusters .
The heat sink and Tantalus drive systems allow the Normandy to loiter undetected in an enemy system to monitor traffic , or drop infiltration teams on enemy worlds .
Should the Normandy ’s design prove useful in field tests , it is expected that a follow - up class incorporating " lessons learned " will be produced .

Wie wenig überzeugt selbst überregionale deutsche Tageszeitungen noch von ihren eigenen Produkten sind , zeigt ein aktuelles Beispiel : Über den Schweizer Dienstleister Trigami kauft sich die Süddeutsche Zeitung derzeit Lob für ihre iPhone - App in Blogs und im iPhone - AppStore .
Sicherheitshalber hat die Zeitung bei der entsprechenden Ausschreibung gleich mitgeliefert , was man an ihr besonders gutfinden sollte – könnte ja schließlich sein , dass man das selbst gar nicht bemerkt .
Hinweis : Update am Ende des Artikels .
Laut Trigami war es ein interner Fehler .
Über Trigami habe ich auch hier im Blog bezahlte Postings veröffentlicht – wenn sie thematisch passend waren und ich die Freiheit bekam , selbst über den I nhalt zu entscheiden .
Das ist jetzt schon fast zwei Jahre lang nicht passiert , weil es schlichtweg keine passenden Ausschreibungen mehr gegeben hat .
Das Angebot der Süddeutschen hat mich in seiner Peinlichkeit dann doch noch mal überraschen können .
Eine “ Qualitätszeitung ” kauft sich Bloggerlob ?
Ja , so ist es tatsächlich .
Bei Trigami nennt sich diese Werbeform “ Advertorial ” .
Auf Deutsch heißt das schlicht : Der Kunde bestimmt , was im Posting des Bloggers steht .
Oder wie Trigami es so treffend selbst beschreibt : “… redaktionelle Werbetexte , geschrieben von Bloggern , 100 % positiv durch Inhaltskontrolle Ihrerseits . ”
Das muss die Zuständigen bei der Süddeutschen wohl überzeugt haben .
Wer als Blogger das Angebot der Süddeutschen annimmt , soll zunächst die iPhone - App der Zeitung herunterladen .
Wozu das genau notwendig sein sollte , war mir auf den ersten Blick nicht so recht klar , denn nicht nur ein praktischer Lobeshymnen - Baukasten wird dem Blogger frei Haus geliefert ( s.u. ) , auch passende Screenshots sind gleich dabei .
Im Prinzip reicht das schon aus , um den gekauften Bericht zusammenzuschreiben .
Eine eigene Meinung ist ja sowieso nicht gefragt .
Aber es gibt diesen bemerkenswerten Hinweis im Beschreibungstext der Trigami - Ausschreibung :
Nach dem Runterladen der Gold Applikation müsst
Ihr bitte einen möglichst positiven Kommentar im App Store hinterlassen
Interessant .
Was Apple wohl dazu sagt ?
Ich werde mal nachfragen .
Update : Pressesprecher Georg Albrecht hat mitgeteilt , dass es von Apple keinen Kommentar dazu gibt .
Damit die Blogger nicht lange rumrätseln müssen , was sie an der Süddeutschen und ihrer App bloß toll finden könnten , sind die Vorzüge der Zeitung , der Website sueddeutsche.de und der iPhone - App auch gleich schreibgerecht aufbereitet .
Folgende “ Vorteile des Produktes ” soll man “ aufzeigen ” :
Die bekannt hohe journalistische Qualität von SZ und sueddeutsche .de kann jetzt auch komfortabel mit dem iPhone genutzt werden
sueddeutsche.de hat eine Meinung
sueddeutsche.de bezieht Stellung
sueddeutsche.de berichtet nicht nur , sondern kommentieret ( sic ! ) das Geschehen sachkundig und professionell
die Autoren von sueddeutsche.de sind ihre Stärke
gutes Mittel zum Komplettieren des Informationsbedürfnisses des interessierten , modernen Menschen von heute
Man kann seinen Kollegen / Bekannten zeigen , dass man auf Qualität setzt
Erstaunlich bei alldem , dass sich ausgerechnet die Süddeutsche Bloggerlob einkauft , die mir in der Vergangenheit nicht gerade als internetfreundlich oder auch nur ansatzweise internetkompetent aufgefallen ist .
Man denke da nur an den Ausspruch “ Seuche Internet ” oder die verblüffte Feststellung , dass Besucher einer Internetkonferenz Laptops dabei haben und auch nutzen .
Ich jedenfalls interpretiere die Trigami - Ausschreibung so , dass ein Blogger nicht auf den ersten Blick erkennen kann , was für eine überragende Qualität er mit der Süddeutschen geliefert bekommt , wenn man ihm die entsprechenden Lobhudeleien nicht ins Blog diktiert .
Dafür gibt es zwei mögliche Ursachen wie mir scheint : Blogger sind zu dumm oder die Süddeutsche ist zu schlecht .
Entscheidet selbst .
Wer sich für die Ergebnisse der Trigami - Ausschreibung interessiert , kann dieser Tage bei Google einfach nach süddeutsche iphone trigami suchen .
Hier einige Beispiele :
Damit will ich nicht die Blogger bloßstellen , die das Angebot angenommen haben .
Das muss jeder für sich selbst entscheiden .
Und immerhin müssen schon aus rechtlichen Gründen alle gekauften Texte mit einem “ Anzeige ” - Hinweis versehen sein , so dass Leser sehen können , womit sie es zu tun haben .
Peinlich finde ich solche Postings aber für die “ Qualitätszeitung ” Süddeutsche , die sich auf diese Weise offenbar Blogposts und Bewertungen in Apples AppStore einkauft .
Update
Wie Remo Uherek von Trigami in diesem Kommentar schreibt , war es ein interner “ Kommunikations - Fehler ” , dass die Kampagne der Süddeutschen als “ Advertorial ” gestartet wurde .
Ein Advertorial verspricht “ 100 % positiv ” zu sein .
Freie Meinungsäußerung ist hingegen in der “ Text - Review ” möglich .
Zuvor hatte Peter Bilz - Wohlgemuth von der Süddeutschen in diesem Kommentar darauf hingewiesen , “ dass wir mitnichten „ lobende Blogposts “ haben wollen ” .
Einen Überblick zu aktuellen Reaktionen und dem Verlauf der Geschichte gibt es übrigens hier im Blog von Trigami .
SAN FRANCISCO – Super Mario Galaxy 2 will bring a wild new world and an old - school videogame feel to Wii on May 23 , Nintendo said at its press event here Wednesday .
In the game 's new Spin - Dig Galaxy , players can drill through to the other side of the planet to fight a globe - hopping boss , said Nintendo 's Nate Bihldorff , who showed off tantalizing bits of gameplay to attendees at the media summit .
Bihldorff promised that Super Mario Galaxy 2 ( pictured ) will feature new kinds of platforming and puzzle - solving challenges .
Metroid : Other M , another highly anticipated sequel from a high - profile franchise , will be released June 27 , said Cammie Dunaway , Nintendo vice president of sales and marketing .
" When you finish playing this , you 're going to feel like you know Samus in a way that you 've never known her before , " Dunaway said .
During the press event at the W San Francisco hotel , Nintendo also laid out plans to release several WiiWare titles in March , and said the DSi XL will hit the United States March 28 .
We 'll be trying out the supersize $ 190 handheld and playing some upcoming portable games , including Wario Ware : DIY , America 's Test Kitchen and the latest Pokemon .
Read the full live - blog archive below for more details on upcoming Nintendo launches .
Hands - on impressions of many games unveiled during the event will go live on Wired.com later Wednesday .
Live - blog archive of Nintendo's Q1 Media Summit , Feb. 24 , 2010 — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — ——
–
9:01 AM – There are a lot of people in attendance today .
Lots of Nintendo's internal Treehouse developers , many journalists from all over , etc .
Sitting in the very front row like a good student , flanked by 1up 's Jeremy Parish and Gamasutra 's Christian Nutt .
Stalwart companions both .
Maybe sitting a little too close .
Stop touching me :(
9:06 a.m. – Lights just blinked on and off .
That probably means " sit down , we are ready to turn this mother out . "
9:08 – Nintendo PR director Marc Franklin takes the stage to welcome us .
It is on .
Get ready .
9:09 – They 're going to have a cooking demonstration with America 's Test Kitchen later !
That was pretty much all I was hoping for .
9:10 – Dunaway takes the stage .
Says that we 'll be playing 15 Wii games and 9 DS games today , with the focus on the first half of 2010 .
" All of you hoping to hear something about the ( holidays ) , you 'll just have to come see us at E3 . "
That said , she says , the first half is " absolutely packed . "
9:12 – Dunaway going over sales records set by Nintendo in 2009 – 11.2 million units of DS sold in 2009 .
That sort of thing .
Nintendo also set a new record for number of games sold for one platform in one month in December : 24.9 million units of Wii software ( first - and third - party ) in December 2009 .
9:13 – Nintendo DSi XL coming out on March 28 in the U.S. for $ 190 .
You already know all about the Nintendo DSi XL , of course , since you read Wired.com .
9:15 – Dunaway talking about the America 's Test Kitchen cooking app , showing it on the DSi XL .
It looks quite a bit like Nintendo's last cooking title , just with new licensed branding .
9:17 – Nintendo bringing 100 Classic Books DS app to the U.S.
It 's a DS cartridge with books like Dracula , Journey to the Center of the Earth , etc. June 14 , $ 20 .
( Not ESRB rated . )
9:18 – Nintendo's Nate Bihldorff takes the stage to show off Super Mario Galaxy 2 .
We 're going to be playing this today , he says .
They jump right into the gameplay – showing a new galaxy called the Spin - Dig Galaxy , and you can pick up a drill and dig right through to the other side of the planet .
This lends itself to new kinds of platforming / puzzle - solving , Bihldorff says .
9:20 – Continuing to show Super Mario Galaxy 2 .
He 's doing a quick rundown of the gameplay mechanics for those in attendance who may not be familiar with the first game .
Is there any such person here ?
9:23 – Fighting a boss that runs around the planet – you have to drill through the planet , come out the other side , so you can drill him in the stomach .
Looks like a great use of the feature , lots of fun , etc .
9:25 – Before we finish up this Mario demo , they 're going to show us Yoshi .
Moving around is the same as using just Mario , but the pointer turns into a little red ball , and this controls Yoshi's amazing tongue .
You can click on enemies to eat them .
Yoshi gains different powers by eating different things – one fruit is a Blimp Fruit and it lets Yoshi balloon up and fly around .
The pointer on the Wiimote , Bihldorff says , allows for " pretty awesome control " – you can click on stuff as you 're jumping around .
There 's a segment where you 're running around on a 2 - D plane , on a rotating cylinder – very old - school feeling , he says .
Looks very complex !
9:29 – That concludes the Mario Galaxy demo .
I 'll be playing quite a bit of it later today , so look for hands - on impressions this evening .
9:31 – Dunaway back on stage .
Launches on May 23 .
Wow .
9:32 – Long- anticipated shooter Sin and Punishment : Star Shooter for Wii will launch June 7 .
International online leaderboards .
9:33 – One more Wii game for the first half , called Fling Smash .
You fling a hero around and smash him into things , I guess .
Impressions later , naturally .
Will be out in the summer .
9:34 – Pokemon for DS on March 14 .
Picross 3D for Nintendo DS on May 3 .
9:5 – Dan Adelman , manager of the WiiWare and DSiWare businesses at Nintendo of America , is up to speak about downloads .

9:36 – Adelman announces Wario Ware : D.I.Y. for March 28 .
It 's a DS game where you create your own mini-games , then wirelessly send them to a WiiWare game called Wario Ware : D.I.Y .
Showcase , then play them on your TV .
You already know about this !
9:37 – Two new WiiWare games in the Art Style series : Light Trax and Rotozoa .
9:39 – Talking about Mega Man 10 for WiiWare .
Has a new " easy mode . "
Coming March 1 . Max & The Magic Marker , recently released in Europe , coming to the U.S. on March 8 .
9:40 – Finally , a release date for the anticipated indie WiiWare game Cave Story : March 22 .
March looks like a big month for WiiWare .
Indie Games Festival finalist Super Meat Boy will also come out on WiiWare , Adelman says , this summer .
So will indie cult hit And Yet It Moves , also this summer .
Also Rage of the Gladiator , a one - on - one 3 - D combat game that supports Motion Plus .
9:43 – DSiWare games : Metal Torrent and X - Scape , which is a 3 - D shooter .
Hm , did n't the Argonaut guys do a 3 - D shooter called X on the Game Boy ?
Could that possibly be related to this ?
Hmm !
9:44 – Nintendo's Bill Trinen here to demonstrate Photo Dojo , a DSiWare game where you take photos of yourself and make a fighting game out of them .
This has been out in Japan a while – cool to see it come to the U.S .
9:45 – Doing a pretty extensive demo of this .
You take pics of yourself in a variety of fighting - game poses , record your own sound effects , then play what is basically a stripped - down Street Fighter with your pictures and your voice as the character .
9:46 – Just watching someone play this , a cacophony of recorded sound effects and ridiculousness , is pretty funny .
" Bill Trinen PUNCH ! " his avatar yells .
9:54 – We move on to third - party games .
We 're looking at a DSi- exclusive cartridge game from Majesco called Ghostwire , an " augmented reality " game in which you see the world around you , overlaid with OMG ghosts , through the DSi cameras .
9:55 – Wii version of Prince of Persia : The Forgotten Sands coming May 18 .

9:58 – Demo of Monster Hunter Tri for Wii .
Will feature free online play when it launches in the U.S. ( the online play is pay - to - play in Japan ) .
10:03 – April 20 , 2010 in the U.S.
They 're doing a demo now .
10:13 – Sorry , been having some pretty massive technical difficulties on my end .
They did a very extensive Monster Hunter demo , and now Dunaway is back for one more bit of news : Nintendo of America will publish Square Enix 's Dragon Quest IX for Nintendo DS in the U.S.
Not surprising , if you 've been following along closely with Game|Life .
10:15 – DS cartridge game Game and Watch Collection 2 coming to Club Nintendo .
Not available anywhere at retail .
So is the Ultra Hand WiiWare game .
These are both prizes for the Club Nintendo customer - loyalty program .
10:17 – Just one more thing , says Dunaway :
She wants to talk to us about Metroid : Other M. " When you finish playing this , you 're going to feel like you know Samus in a way that you 've never known her before . "
This is a game that requires complete immersion , she says – private , enclosed gameplay areas on - site today .
Yes : Metroid : Other M is playable today , launches June 27 .

The Co-operative Group has seen profits surge as it attracted thousands of bank account customers disillusioned with Britain 's big banks .
The acquisition of the Somerfield supermarket chain and the merger of its financial services arm with Britannia Building Society have also boosted Britain 's biggest mutual retailer .
The Co-op is paying its 5 million members - up 1.5 million over the last year - a dividend of £ 55 m , 16 % higher than in 2008 .
The " divi " was re-introduced by the group in 2006 after 30 years .
The group , which traces its roots to the founding of the co-operative movement in Rochdale in 1844 , today reported a 38 % jump in new current accounts as consumers deserted the bigger banks in droves in the wake of the financial crisis .
It gained 140,000 new customers , taking the total to 1.2 million , and doubled its share of the current account market to 4 % .
" We 're already seeing a flight to trust , " said Peter Marks , the chief executive .
" People are weary of big business , especially in the financial services sector .
They want to feel confident about where they 're putting their hard - earned savings . "
Operating profits at the financial arm , which owns brands such as the online bank Smile , rose 21 % to £ 177 m .
The Co-op , which now has 330 bank branches and customer deposits of £ 32.5 bn following the merger with Britannia , is hoping to make further inroads into the mortgage market , of which it has 3 - 4 % , with the launch of new products starting with a three - year tracker mortgage at 2.49 % tomorrow .
In the grocery business , like - for - like sales were flat in the first three months of the year - hit by the VAT increase and January 's heavy snow - but in line with the rest of the market .
" I think we will get a lift in the summer - if we have a summer - and England make progress in the World Cup .
We could have a decent summer , " said Marks .
Overall profits before payments to members soared 85 % to £ 402 m in the year to 2 January , with sales up 31 % to £ 13.7bn , the third consecutive year of double - digit growth .
Underlying profits are 20 % ahead , in line with recent years .
Like - for - like food sales were up 5.5 % on 2008 .
The Co-op , the UK 's fifth - largest grocer with 3,000 stores and 21 million customers every week , extended its Simply Value range which enjoyed 85 % growth last year while its premium range , Truly Irrestistible , also did well , with sales up 10 % .
" These are record results in what has been an historic year for the Co-operative Group , " said Marks .
" Our business has continued to thrive in spite of economic pressure , and we are on track with the integration of both Somerfield and Britannia .
And , it seems , our business model has never been quite so relevant .
Our Financial Services business has continued to flourish in spite of the global recession . "
He was cautious in his assessment of the months ahead , saying " 2010 is going to be a very tough year " .
" We 're not seeing an awful lot of feelgood factor around . "
This echoed comments from other retailers who fear that consumer confidence will be hit by post-election tax hikes and spending cuts needed to bring the government 's massive budget deficit under control .
The Co-op also runs Britain 's third - largest retail pharmacy chain as well as the number one provider of funeral services .
A puppy by the name of Ratbag may have saved her owner 's life by waking him during a fire in his West Coast house .
Far from being a ratbag , the six - month - old staffy - cross jumped on Jason Mathews ' bed as fire tore through the Hokitika house about 5.15 am on Monday ,
" ( Ratbag ) was sleeping in the room as well , but then I felt her jump on the bed .
She jumped down again and then back on ... then she started to growl .
That 's when I woke up , " Mr Mathews told the Hokitika Guardian .
" I sat up and my head was in the smoke .
I felt the heat of the smoke on my face and started choking .
I grabbed the dog in one arm and bailed out the window . "
It was not until he was outside and saw the house being gutted that he realised how lucky he had been .
Mr Mathews is now moving to a property where he cannot keep Ratbag " and she deserves a really good home " .

Frey wants you to be angry about the U.S. - Mexico border .
He wants you to feel such a deep sense of moral outrage that you ’ll get out of your chair and write a letter to your congressman .
That ’s why he invited me to the border town of El Centro , to stand in Imperial County ’s pauper ’s cemetery , a dusty field dotted with about 900 concrete markers the size of bread loaves .
Each was stamped with numbers or the name “ John Doe . ”
Several hundred marked the final resting place of Mexican and other Latin American migrants who ’ve died walking across the desert or drowned trying to cross the nearby All - American Canal .
Frey , a 46 - year - old filmmaker , blames the U.S. government for their deaths .
In all , some 6,000 people have died crossing the Texas , New Mexico , Arizona and California borders with Mexico since 1994 , according to human - rights groups .
About 500 more die every year .
In his new documentary film , “ The 800 Mile Wall , ” Frey says this tragedy is the foreseeable result of a policy that sealed off urban crossing routes , driving migrants into the desert .
“ Does n’t this qualify as an atrocity to you ? ”
Frey asked , after we ’d walked to the center of the cemetery on a warm winter day last week .
I thought about Frey ’s question for a moment and tried to imagine the individual stories that had brought all these people to this sad end .
I ’ve lived in Mexico and I have family in Guatemala .
I ’ve been to the urban neighborhoods and the rural villages of adobe and cinder - block where migrant journeys begin .
But I would n’t apply the word “ atrocity ” to what I ’ve seen , not in the sense that Frey means .
On our long drive to El Centro , he had compared the migrant death toll to horrors that no one would dispute deserve that stark label : genocide in Rwanda , ethnic cleansing in Bosnia .
“ Their deaths are systematic and they ’re the results of a policy , ” he said of the border crossers .
“ And it ’s not just a few .
It ’s thousands . ”
Some people , he said , think the death toll might be as high as 20,000 .
“ You wonder how long it will take people to get angry , ” he said later .
“ How long did it take in Darfur ? ”
Comparing the deaths at the border to massacres of Darfur makes for a poor analogy for lots of different reasons .
But Frey ’s hyperbole is understandable .
“ Maybe it ’s because I ’ve seen the bodies , ” he tells me .
Frey ’s film contains gruesome images and heart - breaking stories .
He interviews a tearful Guatemalan man who had to identify his wife ’s remains at an Arizona coroner ’s office before being deported .
We meet an artist who gathers the objects migrants abandon in the desert , including the journal of a girl crossing with her family .
The girl sketched a picture of the truck that drove her to the border , and the green grass she imagined on the other side .
We ’re shown the mummified remains of a woman -- we never learn where she ’s from -- who was traveling to the Bay Area to meet her fiance .
We see the long hair flowing from her skull and the bones that have been stripped by animal predators .
Frey told me he ’s going to take his film on a tour of the United States this year .
“ I think if Americans knew what was happening here , they would be compassionate , ” he said .
“ Maybe I ’m naive . ”
He wants to use the film as a tool to build support for an immigration reform bill in Congress that would allow migrants a safe crossing to the jobs that await them .
That ’s a laudable goal .
But there ’s something about the way he and a lot of other people see the issue of immigration that deeply troubles me .
As a son of immigrants , I just do n’t buy the constant portrayal of immigrants in U.S. media as either victims or victimizers .
A number of television personalities have sold the American people on the idea that Latino immigrants are a criminal force undermining U.S. society .
In “ The 800 Mile Wall ” the ill - fated migrants are all victims of forces beyond their control .
“ I know that they have free will , ” Frey said of the migrants .
“ But I do n’t know that they have a free choice . ”
Actually , nearly every adult who undertakes the journey does have a choice .
A fairly typical crossing story , I told Frey , might begin in a Mexican town where a young woman wants desperately to go to college .
She dreams of escaping the life of domestic labor that awaits her but ca n’t think of any other way to defy her parents .
Or it might begin in San Salvador , with a man who wants to emulate his wealthy cousin in Virginia .
In other words , many choose to go on la aventura , as it ’s popularly known , because it ’s the easiest avenue to social mobility .
It ’s not the best choice in the world .
It might be desperate or reckless , but it is a choice .
The dead migrants in that El Centro cemetery were n’t driven to their deaths by soldiers with guns , as in Bosnia , or by killers armed with machetes , as in Rwanda .
That ’s why I could n’t say it is an atrocity .
It ’s a complex tragedy born of inequality , yes .
The policy that leads people to risk their lives crossing the desert is cruel , yes .
But it ’s a risk people take , often knowingly and often from human motives as universal as restlessness and ambition .
“ This is really only a small slice of the immigrant story , ” I told Frey .
I ’d like to think we could build support for immigration reform by telling the full , nuanced story of the immigrant experience in the U.S.
But maybe that makes me the naive one .
These are desperate , polarized times .
People really should be angry about what ’s happening on the border .
They should see the horrors of “ The 800 Mile Wall ” and they should ask themselves deeper questions about why people are willing to risk death to come here .
And then they should write their congressman .

New Marlborough , Mass .
THE Obama administration is planning some big changes to how we measure the success or failure of schools and how we apportion federal money based on those assessments .
It ’s great that the administration is trying to undertake reforms , but if we want to make sure all children learn , we will need to overhaul the curriculum itself .
Our current educational approach  and the testing that is driving it  is completely at odds with what scientists understand about how children develop during the elementary school years and has led to a curriculum that is strangling children and teachers alike .
In order to design a curriculum that teaches what truly matters , educators should remember a basic precept of modern developmental science : developmental precursors do n’t always resemble the skill to which they are leading .
For example , saying the alphabet does not particularly help children learn to read .
But having extended and complex conversations during toddlerhood does .
Simply put , what children need to do in elementary school is not to cram for high school or college , but to develop ways of thinking and behaving that will lead to valuable knowledge and skills later on .
So what should children be able to do by age 12 , or the time they leave elementary school ?
They should be able to read a chapter book , write a story and a compelling essay ; know how to add , subtract , divide and multiply numbers ; detect patterns in complex phenomena ; use evidence to support an opinion ; be part of a group of people who are not their family ; and engage in an exchange of ideas in conversation .
If all elementary school students mastered these abilities , they would be prepared to learn almost anything in high school and college .
Imagine , for instance , a third - grade classroom that was free of the laundry list of goals currently harnessing our teachers and students , and that was devoted instead to just a few narrowly defined and deeply focused goals .
The Tudeh Party of Iran , Iran ’s communist party , has issued an appeal for “ solidarity action with the working people of Iran campaigning for peace and progress ” and with the broad Iranian progressive and democratic movement .
Since early January , the party ’s Feb. 21 message says , the Ahmadinejad regime “ has embarked upon a new wave of repressive measures designed to suffocate the opposition forces demanding a return to the ideals of the 1979 revolution in Iran : democracy , human rights and social justice . ”
Thousands of people have been arrested , nearly 100 protesters have been killed either by government security forces during protest demonstrations or under torture in detention centers , and 11 detainees have been condemned to execution , the Tudeh appeal says .
Among those arrested are activists and leaders of Iran ’s student movement , trade union movement , women ’s movement and well known academics and progressive writers and journalists .
“ International solidarity with these victims of suppression in Iran is of vital importance , ” the Tudeh Party says .
“ International pressure on the Iranian regime , to oblige it to abide by the internationally accepted norms and conventions governing treatment of peaceful political protest , needs to be maintained . ”
The appeal urges messages to the Iranian government supporting the following demands of communist , left , progressive and democratic organization around the world :
* The Iranian government to abide by the UN Charter and the Universal Convention on Human Rights .
* All death sentences to be commuted to terms of imprisonment decided in a court of law convened in accordance with the laws of natural justice and in which the accused have full access to defense lawyers and are able to defend themselves .
* All those detained to be protected from torture or other ill treatment , to be allowed access to their families , lawyers and any necessary medical treatment , and for them to be brought before a judge without delay so that they may challenge the lawfulness of their detention .
* Anyone held solely for their participation in protest demonstrations or for expressing their views to be released immediately and unconditionally .
* The authorities in Iran to ensure that their policing of any further demonstrations meets international policing standards , including a ban on the use of firearms and other lethal weapons
* An impartial investigation be conducted into the deaths of all those killed .
“ The situation is very desperate and the need for international solidarity is great , ” the appeal concludes .
The Tudeh Party ( Party of the Masses ) has a decades - long history of struggle against the shah ’s dictatorship and the current theocratic Islamic regime , and has had a mass following with wide support among Iranian trade unionists , intellectuals and artists and others .
During that time it has faced vicious persecution , with many of its leaders and members executed under both regimes , and has been forced to work underground and in exile .

​ It ’s full speed ahead for the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act ( OCTA ) , a ballot initiative which would legalize and tax marijuana in the Beaver State , as the Oregon Supreme Court has dismissed the only challenge to OCTA ’s ballot title .
The challenge — filed by Bradley Benoit from the Beaverton , Ore. , area — came from an earlier comment regarding OCTA ’s summary explanation .
The comment requested the summary of the measure describe in detail the fact that the Oregon Attorney General would be responsible for defending Oregonians , and the law itself , should a federal case arise .
The comment was addressed , and the Attorney General included Benoit ’s comments in the revised , certified ballot title , according to OCTA campaign spokesman Kyndall Mason
VANCOUVER 
For nearly 40 years , Erickson Air-Crane and its partners have been dispatching a fleet of helicopters around the world to fight forest fires , harvest timber and lift giant air - conditioning units to the tops of office towers .
This is the first time , however , the company 's specially fitted Sikorsky S - 64 has been hired to make it snow .
For the past week , the giant helicopter and a convoy of dump trucks have been shuttling tons of snow from higher elevations in a frenzied effort to salvage two Olympic events from the grip of El Nino .
The persistent warm weather pattern , which draws warm , humid air from the Pacific Ocean , has prematurely coaxed daffodils into bloom , produced veils of pink and purple on confused ornamental trees throughout the city and on Saturday brought families to sun themselves on the scenic waterfront concourses .
But in the mountains — specifically on Cypress Mountain , where snowboarders and freestyle skiers will soon be competing for Olympic gold — blue skies and balmy temperatures have produced nothing but anxiety .
January temperatures were the warmest on record and the trend is continuing this month , says Environment Canada meteorologist Matt McDonald , one of 30 forecasters working the Winter Games .
This year , the average temperature in January was 44.9 degrees , besting the previous warm record of 43.3 in 2006 and well above the historic average of 37.9 degrees , according to Environment Canada weather data .
McDonald says the mild temperatures are expected to continue , and rain — not snow — is expected for much of the week .
" It 's not looking so great for the day of opening ceremonies ( Friday ) , " McDonald says .
Mercifully , weather wo n't be a factor for the indoor opening ceremony , but it has sparked a " huge " effort on Cypress Mountain , says Tim Gayda , vice president of sport for the Vancouver Olympic Organizing Committee .
The centerpiece of that effort is the unusual snow - lift operation involving Erickson affiliate Canadian Air -Crane .
Starting last Wednesday , the helicopter 's giant bucket , with a capacity between 13,000 and 15,000 pounds , has dumped an average of 780 tons a day into the Cypress Mountain bowl , says Dennis Hubbard , a company spokesman .
Hubbard says the helicopter has been shuttling snow from nearby Mount Strachan , where a backhoe has been digging and loading buckets for the short flight to Cypress Mountain .
A team of three pilots , two project managers and three mechanics is keeping the helicopter — nicknamed the giant Swiss Army knife because of its many adaptations — in the air .
But poor weather also has dogged the operation .
Heavy fog suspended some flights Saturday and Sunday , says John Smith , Canadian Air -Crane marketing manager .
" We probably have a couple more days to go , " Smith says .
" We 've done a lot of things , but this is a first . "
Smith says the courses are taking shape nicely .
But mild temperatures likely will be a factor in maintaining the courses .
" This is a huge effort , " Gayda says , declining to disclose the cost of the snow - moving operation .
" We 've really thrown everything at it . "
Despite the problems , which also have forced the cancellation of some training at Cypress , Gayda says there are no plans to move the events .
" I am 100 % confident that the events will take place and we 'll have enough snow to get the job done . "
Hannah Teter , the 2006 women 's halfpipe gold medalist for the USA and a top contender to win in Vancouver , says , along with the quality of the snow used in the halfpipe , the weather can play a big factor in how a pipe rides .
" It is a delicate balance for the halfpipe , " she says .
" It really depends on the air temperature and the humidity .
If it 's really warm and humid , that makes for a sloppy pipe , and that will really affect everybody .
But we go ... all over the world , and sometimes the pipes are n't halfway decent .
You 've just got to buck up and try to ride it the best you can . "
Sarah Lewis , secretary general of the International Ski Federation , says she is impressed with the work at Cypress .
She also says conditions , and the cutback in training , are " the same for everybody " when the competition begins this weekend .
" We are in the hands of the weather , and it 's all about dealing with it .
The work goes on , " Lewis says .
" Hopefully , winter will come back , " Gayda says .
" It only takes a 24 - hour period to blanket the mountain . "

The European Commission has opened a public consultation on whether the US government should continue to get free access to European bank and financial data under the SWIFT agreement .
The US claims it needs access to our bank accounts in order to fight terrorism - it has had free access since shortly after 11 September 2001 .
But the Civil Liberties Committee of European MPs yesterday recommended the Parliament reject renewal of the treaty ; MEPs only recently got powers over external treaties .
This may sound like just hot air from Brussels , but the treaty is up for a vote next Thursday .
MEPs want the data protected in the same way as it would be in Europe .
Furthermore , today the European Commission adopted a decision changing the standard contract for companies that send data outside the European Union .
This provides protection for European citizens by essentially guaranteeing that exported data is stored and processed according to European law .
The changes , detailed here , extend this protection to outsourced companies which might process data on behalf of US firms .
In simple terms it extends data protection principles to sub-contractors used by the initial data importer , wherever that sub -contractor might be .
So when a US firm brings data out of Europe it must still follow EU law .
This is now extended so that the data is passed on to an outsourcer , that company must also follow EU law .
The consultation documents are here .
You have until 12 March to have your say .
The US is already making noises - Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called Europe 's foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton , AFP reports .
Ashton 's appointment was heavily criticised because of her lack of experience .
She might look like Olive from On the Buses , but Reg readers will be reassured to learn that she shares her living room with a full - size Dalek , Wikipedia tells us . ®
Shanghai Wonder : Bridge Made of Trash Collapses
In an absurd twist of fate and a rather distinct and unusual statement on the need to recycle , residents of Shanghai got the surprise of their life when earlier this month a major new bridge collapsed , revealing its components to be mostly rubbish and not concrete !
Spanning the Wusong River in central Shanghai , the river has represented an important shipping route since the 1930s , facilitating the transport of goods to the interior of China .
The Suzhou River Road where the bridge is located has been designated as a protected heritage zone and has become the setting for Shanghai ’s flourishing art scene .
Completed in 2009 , the bridge replaced a much older one with a more modern design .
It began to collapse after being in operation only a short period ; just after Christmas , when cracks appeared in the structure .
Some thought the ground might have become unstable or that it might have been the result of the inefficiency of the original construction company .
Subsequent inquiry revealed the latter to be the case .
Styrofoam , bags of garbage , scrap wood and plastic waste were used as construction materials in the structure .
By using less concrete in the construction , results were completely counter - productive .
Short - term savings were obliterated by the estimated costs of eliminating the rubbish and starting the construction all over again !
This lack of foresight makes sense only if the sobriety of the construction company management was an issue ( a fact which remains unknown ) .
Recycling has its place in our modern world , but this is ridiculous , not to mention extremely perilous if someone has the misfortune of enjoying the view of the river while standing underneath a girder weakened by Styrofoam and / or plastic !

TOKYO , Japan —
It 's like American Girl meets Hello , Kitty .
Cats in kimono .
Cats dressed in red curls like Anne of Green Gables .
Cats posing in Napoleon hats .
Cats in tiaras .
Cats in black lace .
Cat costumes created and sold by Takako Iwasa of Tokyo are creative , clever and catastrophically funny .
" First , dress her up , " instructs Iwasa - san , as she is known in Japan , to her website visitors .
" Cheer or yell .
Do whatever you like to enjoy the moment with your family .
Second , after you are enough with your joy , take a photo !
" And third , remove her clothes and give her a hug , say ' Thank you ! ' "
Prin featured on the front of a catalog .

In a culture where the word " cute , " or " kawaii , " is exclaimed like a siren , reactions to costumes for cats reach a new decibel .
Fans line up to meet Iwasa - san and her pets .
They are photographed and filmed .
Posters are available .
You think you 've seen funnier photos of cats before .
But only a sourpuss could breeze through the catalog of hats , wigs , dresses , suits and bling for cats without grinning like a Cheshire cat .
A modest Iwasa - san said she was not always cut out for tailoring .
" I was not good at needlework or drawing .
I did n't have any sense of art either , " she says .
But that changed when Prin — the site 's eponym and one if its two fashionista models — padded into her life .
Iwasa - san was struck with a desire to clothe her pure white cat .
She found some outfits in a teddy bear shop , but Prin outgrew the outfits in a year , and seemed destined to return to a life of nakedness .
Until Iwasa - san heard the voice .
" Take action this year . "
The inspirational direction was so loud , she looked around for its source , she said .
" I went outside and looked at other people , wondering if they heard the same voice , " Iwasa - san says .
" But they did n’t seem to hear . "
By her own admission , Iwasa - san almost missed her calling .
She ruminated for a week after she heard the voice .
" Costumes for dogs have been popular for 20 years , " she said .
" But we did n't have costumes for cats because we believed cats groom themselves and do n't like to wear clothes .
But , I met my cat , Prin , and suddenly thought , ' I want to dress her up ! ' "
Her eyes fell upon a coat her mother had made for Prin , and a lightbulb flashed inside her head .
After consulting six psychics — all who predicted a successful business — she finally launched her website in December 2000 .
" I had a computer and Prin in my home .
These were everything I needed to start the business , " she says .
By the next month , Cat Prin received positive feedback from a handful of Web surfers — and two orders .
Flick through her catalog and you will see pictures of Prin and her companion , Kotara , dressed as Anne of Green Gables or adorned in lacy Victorian - style hats and cloaks .
They are dressed as Hogwarts students and samurai warriors , and wear jaunty straw boaters .
They dress in rabbit ears , leopard spots , frog costumes and as cows .
She even designed one soft helmet that makes Prin look like a mouse .
And , yes , there is a Puss in Boots costume , too .
" Without costumes , Prin is just an ordinary cat .
But if she wears costumes , she becomes an alien from another planet , " she says .
While many of the costumes render the cats other - worldly , it 's Prin 's and Koutaro 's deadpan stares that lend the catalog an extra dimension .
Neither toy nor fop , the cats maintain their dignity among the felt , satin and lace .
Prin 's breed — Scottish Fold — is named for the feline 's folded ears , giving them an owl - like appearance .
Her large unblinking eyes and penetrating stare anchors photo after photo , allowing Prin a dignity whether she 's wearing the the curly brown locks of Robbespierre or a Tartan tam o'shanter .
While Cat Prin enjoys a status as popular sensation in Japan , you do n't see many costumed cats paraded in the streets of Tokyo .
" My clients do n’t take their cats out with costumes , " Iwasa - san says .
" They usually enjoy dressing up cats in their homes . "
Popular occasions include parties and photo shoots for birthday cards and blog posts .
Although humans seem to love CatPrin , feline reaction has been finicky .
" If we tried to put these outfits on our cat , Stormy , we ’d have to go to the ER afterwords ! " said blogger Michelle Lamar on MyGloss.com .
" I think about a half of my customers fail to dress up their cats because cats refuse to wear " the costumes , Iwasa - san says .
She slowly built up a customer base through word - of - mouth online .
In 2001 , Iwasa - san began to sell her costumes at the Parisian Printemps department store in the tony Ginza commercial center in Tokyo .
" It was like I was shot by thunder , " one customer told her .
" I have been waiting for these products for a long time . "
Today , Iwasa - san 's online store has recorded 100,000 hits in a day , and the average outfit costs 3,800 yen ( $ 40 ) .
Since that modest beginning , Cat Prin has seen both feedback and sales surge .
But profit is not her motive .
" I do n’t make big money with the business .
It is just enough to eat and enjoy my life with Prin , " she says .
Iwasa - san said she is happy to be a cat tailor .
" With the business , my dream has been realized . "
And beside Prin , she has " the voice " to thank .
" I always get my ideas for designs , " she says , " with inspirations caused by the voice from the sky . "

Admittedly , no one thinks clean coal is oxymoronic and misleading more than I do .
That said , we do appear to be hell bent on funding carbon capture and sequestration systems for coal - fired power plants .
The real problem with CCS , of course , is n’t so much the capture part as the sequestration part .
What do you do with all that carbon that you ’re pulling out during coal combustion .
The main technologies under consideration involve pulling the carbon out of the exhaust gases , then liquifying it and injecting it underground .
That last part is a technology originally developed by the oil industry for keeping dying oil wells productive ( the carbon dioxide forces more oil out of the ground ) .
Cost aside , the problems with applying that technique are pretty obvious — every coal - fired power plant would need to be sited somewhere near an appropriate storage location or we ’d need to build a network of tubes to shift the liquified CO2 around .
That , as Winnie - the - Pooh would say , is not a good plan .
So , if President Obama is going to insist on shoveling money into CCS research , I recommend he have Energy Secretary Chu get in touch with these folks .
Via Science Magazine ( $ ub req ) :
If international agreements can’t slash carbon dioxide emissions fast enough to tame global warming , how about sucking it out of the air ?
Technology using chemicals that bind CO2 already exists , but it ’s so expensive that using it on a large scale could increase energy demand — and the cost of energy — by at least one - third .
…
However , researchers in the Netherlands report a new copper - based catalyst that can capture CO2 , convert it to a different form , and then release it with a small fraction of the energy other techniques require .
“ This is an important fundamental advance , ” says William Tolman , an inorganic chemist at the University of Minnesota , Twin Cities .
“ But there ’s a long way to go before you could turn it into a catalytic process ” for reducing atmospheric CO2 , he adds .
Sure , sure , it ’s not ready for industrial applications — but still very promising .
The article seems to be talking in terms of a free - standing method for pulling carbon out of the air , but it strikes me as an ideal solution to the S part of CCS .
The researchers converted that carbon to an oxalate , which is the building block of various chemicals , from wood alcohol to antifreeze .
The important aspect here is that you want to fix that carbon in some permanent manner — not reuse it as fuel or something , which would release it right back into the atmosphere .
By turning the carbon into a solid or room temperature liquid , you make storage that much easier .
If I had to choose a path of research to throw a billion or two at , this would be it .
A never - before - published letter LSD - inventor Albert Hofmann wrote shortly after his 101st birthday to Apple CEO Steve Jobs , requesting support of LSD research , has been published in the new book  " This Is Your Country On Drugs : The Secret History of Getting High in America .
Steve Jobs never made a secret about his use of LSD , and in interviews he called it " one of the two or three most important things I have done in my life .
" According to the book , the donation Hofmann requested was not granted by Jobs .

Felipe Massa has revealed that he quizzed Nelson Piquet Jr and Flavio Briatore about the events of the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix even before the scandal broke , having always been sceptical about Piquet 's incident in that race .
Massa was leading in Singapore until the safety car came out due to Piquet 's deliberate crash .
A disastrous pitstop during the caution period then delayed Massa and left him unable to score in the race .
He subsequently lost that year 's world championship to Lewis Hamilton by a single point .
Speaking to reporters at a Ferrari media event in Italy , Massa said he had put his suspicions to Piquet prior to the truth about the incident being revealed .
" I spoke to him , yeah .
I spoke to him before [ it became public ] , " said Massa .
" We were going together to drive go - karts in Italy and I asked him about Singapore - I wanted to hear the right story because I was thinking that the combination [ of events ] was so perfect [ for Renault ] , what happened in that race .
" And he was laughing , he did n't want to say the truth .
I said 'okay , you 're laughing , but I understood .
Maybe one day we 'll speak again ' .
And after one month or less , the story came back in the press .
" I even spoke to Flavio about that in Bahrain last year .
I asked Flavio about Singapore and he said ' no , no , it 's impossible ' and he was even trying to laugh sometimes . "
Massa insisted he saw no reason to revisit the incident now that the 2008 championship was long gone .
" But if I spoke to them after I knew ?
It did n't change anything , " said Massa .
" Why should I go there and speak ?
We will not go back to the past .
We need to think about the present and the future .
The past is the past .
" Everybody knows what happened in 2008 .
I do n't think we 're going to win anything by going back through all these problems .
For sure it was very frustrating what was happening in that race , and it changed many things around the championship .
" But anyway , we need to think forward .
I hope these things do n't happen anymore - for the sport , not just the business .
I hope we 'll go back to fighting for the championship and I hope I can be a champion one day .
That 's the way I 'm thinking . "
However Massa did concede that he still sees no reason why the Singapore 2008 result could not have been annulled .
" If you see that something was not right in sport , that it was done in a way against the rules , I do not think it would have been a problem to change it , " he said .
" It would not have been nice for the sport in general , but things should be done within the rules .
That is my only opinion . "
Extensive radar mapping of the middle - latitude region of northern Mars shows that thick masses of buried ice are quite common beneath protective coverings of rubble .
The ability of NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to continue charting the locations of these hidden glaciers and ice - filled valleys -- first confirmed by radar two years ago -- adds clues about how these deposits may have been left as remnants when regional ice sheets retreated .
The subsurface ice deposits extend for hundreds of kilometers , or miles , in the rugged region called Deuteronilus Mensae , about halfway from the equator to the Martian north pole .
Jeffrey Plaut of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , and colleagues prepared a map of the region 's confirmed ice for presentation at this week 's 41st Lunar and Planetary Science Conference near Houston .
The Shallow Radar instrument on the orbiter has obtained more than 250 observations of the study area , which is about the size of California .
" We have mapped the whole area with a high density of coverage , " Plaut said .
" These are not isolated features .
In this area , the radar is detecting thick subsurface ice in many locations . "
The common locations are around the bases of mesas and scarps , and confined within valleys or craters .
Plaut said , " The hypothesis is the whole area was covered with an ice sheet during a different climate period , and when the climate dried out , these deposits remained only where they had been covered by a layer of debris protecting the ice from the atmosphere . "
The researchers plan to continue the mapping .
These buried masses of ice are a significant fraction of the known non-polar ice on Mars .
The ice could contain a record of environmental conditions at the time of its deposition and flow , making the ice masses an intriguing possible target for a future mission with digging capability .
The Shallow Radar instrument was provided by the Italian Space Agency , and its operations are led by the InfoCom Department , University of Rome " La Sapienza . "
Thales Alenia Space Italia , in Rome , is the Italian Space Agency 's prime contractor for the radar instrument .
Astro Aerospace of Carpinteria , Calif. , a business unit of Los Angeles - based Northrop Grumman Corp. , developed the instrument 's antenna as a subcontractor to Thales Alenia Space Italia .
The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter mission is managed by JPL for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate in Washington .
Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver was the prime contractor for the orbiter and supports its operations .
The California Institute of Technology in Pasadena manages JPL for NASA .
Iran to ban airlines not using the term ' Persian Gulf '
By Jon Leyne
BBC News
Airlines that fail to comply with the ruling will be banned or detained Iran has warned that airlines will be banned from flying into its airspace , unless they use the term " Persian Gulf " on their in - flight monitors .
The transport minister has threatened to impound planes that fail to comply .
The nation is most insistent that the stretch of water separating it from its southern neighbours should be known as the Persian Gulf .
To call it the Gulf , annoys the authorities ; to call it the Arabian Gulf , infuriates them even more .
WHAT'S IN A NAME ?
BBC style is to refer to the body of water between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula as the Gulf Iran calls it the Persian Gulf , also the more historically recognised term Saudi Arabia and most other Arab states insist on calling it the Arabian Gulf Conferences are held to make the matter quite clear , an ancient map with definitive proof of the correct name was sent on a world tour .
And recently a foreign member of the cabin crew working for an Iranian airline was sacked and expelled from Iran when he got it wrong .
Now the Iranian transport minister has given foreign airlines 15 days to change the name to Persian Gulf on their in flight monitors .
If they failed , they would be prevented from entering Iranian airspace , he warned .
And if the offence was repeated , foreign airliners would be grounded and refused permission to leave Iran .
Numerous Arab airlines fly into Iran every day , not to mention Europeans and others , so it remains to be seen how they will respond .
As for the minister , Hamid Behbahani , it may or may not be a coincidence that he is making a stand on this patriotic matter at a time when he is facing calls for his impeachment for alleged lack of competence .
Jon Leyne is the BBC's Tehran correspondent .
He is reporting from London after being forced to leave by the Iranian government for reporting on protests in June 2009 .

EMBALMERS deal with death every day , allowing mourners to view the bodies of loved ones as they looked in life .
They make bodies presentable for viewing and preserve them for movement across state and international borders or for interment in a mausoleum .
But the profession might be suffering an image problem .
Overseas specialists are being brought in to fill the gaps as a growing number of older workers retire and viewings at funerals increase .
'' At the moment we have a nationwide shortage of embalmers , '' Australian Funeral Directors Association president John Scott said .
‘‘ Peaceful profession ’’ ... Monika Mohr , an embalmer at Olsen Funerals , likes to help grieving families .
Credit : Lee Besford
Steven Kellaway , managing director of Olsens Funerals in Sutherland , said : '' Of the funerals we hold , 30 per cent have viewings .
'' This has increased by 30 per cent in the last five years due to more Italian , Greek and Chinese families wanting to view the body of the deceased or if the person has passed away suddenly , '' he said .
Here is a great resource for new machinists that almost seems like a secret because I have never seen it mentioned on any of the discussion groups or forums I belong to .
In 1995 the director of MIT ’s machine shop for the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory ( Robotics Group ) made ten videos , totaling more than seven hours , that teach students how to use machine tools .
They show how to set up and do basic machining operations on a mill , lathe , drill press and other common shop equipment , but they do not include recommendations about cutting speeds or feed rates because students are expected to look up that information on their own .
The instructor generally does an excellent job , but even seven hours is not long enough for all the material he tries to cover and there are some shortcomings .
For example , he could have shown a better technique for setting the height of a lathe bit , and the segment where he covers thread cutting on a lathe is almost useless .
Yet I was surprised to find that he also includes , and does a good job , showing some more advanced techniques , like using double - side tape to hold parts too thin to be held in a milling vise or lathe chuck .
You can watch the videos online or save them to your computer in either WMV ( Windows ) or FLV format .
[ Note : The WMV files download as AVI files .
Windows will complain about it but it will play them .
You might want to rename them with the .wmv extension .
I also suggest watching them at a video size of 200 % if you are using Window ’s Media Player . ]
I have added the times when many of the segments start but I have not had a chance to do that for all of the videos yet .

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has said Israeli settlement building anywhere in occupied territory is illegal and must stop .
Mr Ban is in the Middle East to meet Israeli and Palestinian leaders and press them to resume peace talks .
Israel 's controversial announcement of plans to build 1,600 more homes in East Jerusalem has inflamed tensions in the region and between Israel and the US .
The Palestinian leadership has said the plan is an obstacle to resuming talks .
Mr Ban 's statement comes a day after he made a similar call , speaking for the international Quartet of Middle East peace mediators - the UN , Russia , the EU and the US .
Meanwhile violence in the West Bank continued , with a Palestinian teenager shot dead and another badly hurt in clashes with Israeli troops near the city of Nablus , Palestinian medical officials said .
The Israeli military says its forces were responding to what it called a " violent riot " by Palestinian youths who were throwing stones at Israeli settlers , the BBC's West Bank correspondent Jon Donnison reports .
But it says no live bullets were fired , only tear gas and rubber bullets .
Diplomatic flurry Mr Ban 's first stop was in the West Bank town of Ramallah , where he met PM Salam Fayyad .
Palestinian protesters and Israeli troops have clashed in the West Bank The UN secretary - general was escorted to a West Bank observation point on the outskirts of Ramallah to see the Israeli West Bank settlement of Givat Zeev , home to 11,000 Israelis .
Mr Ban , who later went on to talks with Israeli President Shimon Peres , reiterated the Quartet 's stance on the settlements .
" The world has condemned Israel 's expansion plans in East Jerusalem .
" Let us be clear : all settlement activity is illegal anywhere in occupied territory , and this must stop . "
Mr Ban has stated the goal of an Israeli - Palestinian peace agreement - including a Palestinian state - within two years .
He said he hoped to see Jerusalem become the capital of both an Israeli and a Palestinian state .
The last time Mr Ban came to Israel was in the immediate aftermath of Israel 's military operation against Gaza 14 months ago , when he did not hide his anger over the high human cost of that operation .
At least 11 Palestinians were injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza 's airport On Sunday , the US special representative George Mitchell will also visit the region to try to get indirect talks going between the Israelis and Palestinians .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to travel to Washington , where he is expected to meet Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and possibly President Barack Obama .
Speaking to the BBC on Friday , Mrs Clinton indicated that hardening the tone with Israel had paid off , with talks now back in prospect .
" I think we are going to see the resumption of the negotiating track , and that means that is paying off , because that is our goal , " she said .
Israeli strikes
The diplomatic efforts come as at least 11 people were injured by Israeli air strikes targeting Gaza 's airport , Palestinian officials say .
HAVE YOUR SAY Common sense points in the direction of a one state solution .
Even if the state is a 51st of the US or a special administrative region of the EU does it matter ?
SgtPatrickHarper
The Israeli military confirmed the missile strikes near Rafah , in southern Gaza , which it said had targeted militants .
It was the second night of Israeli raids since a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip killed a worker on an Israeli farm on Thursday .
Friday 's missiles hit Gaza 's long disused international airport and tunnels dug by militants near the border with Israel .
On Thursday , Israeli missiles hit smuggling tunnels and a metal workshop in Gaza , but there were no reports of serious injuries .
An Israeli military spokesman said the strikes were a response to five rockets fired at Israel from Gaza in the past two days - including one that killed a farm worker from Thailand in a kibbutz in southern Israel .
He was the first person to be killed by rocket fire in southern Israel since the Israeli campaign in Gaza last year .

AudioSystem :: instance ( ) -> playSound ( VERY_LOUD_BANG ) ;
Either gets us where we ’re trying to go , but we stumbled into some sticky coupling along the way .
Every place in the game calling into our audio system directly references the concrete AudioSystem class and the mechanism for accessing it — either as a static class or a singleton .
These call sites , of course , have to be coupled to something in order to make a sound play , but letting them poke at the concrete audio implementation directly is like giving a hundred strangers directions to your house just so they can drop a letter on your doorstep .
Not only is it a little bit too personal , it ’s a real pain when you move and you have to tell each person the new directions .
There ’s a better solution : a phone book .
People that need to get in touch with us can look us up by name and get our current address .
When we move , we tell the phone company .
They update the book , and everyone gets the new address .
In fact , we do n’t even need to give out our real address at all .
We can list a P.O. box or some other “ representation ” of ourselves instead .
By having callers go through the book to find us , we have a convenient single place where we control how we ’re found .
This is the Service Locator pattern in a nutshell — it decouples code that needs a service from both who it is ( the concrete implementation type ) and where it is ( how we get to the instance of it ) .
A service class defines an abstract interface to a set of operations .
A concrete service provider implements this interface .
A separate service locator provides access to the service by finding an appropriate provider while hiding both the provider ’s concrete type and the process used to locate it .
Anytime you make something accessible to every part of your program , you ’re asking for trouble .
That ’s the main problem with the Singleton pattern , and this pattern is no different .
My simplest advice for when to use a service locator is : sparingly .
Instead of using a global mechanism to give some code access to an object it needs , first consider passing the object to it instead .
That ’s dead simple , and it makes the coupling completely obvious .
That will cover most of your needs .
But … there are some times when manually passing around an object is gratuitous or actively makes code harder to read .
Some systems , like logging or memory management , should n’t be part of a module ’s public API .
The parameters to your rendering code should have to do with rendering , not stuff like logging .
Likewise , other systems represent facilities that are fundamentally singular in nature .
Your game probably only has one audio device or display system that it can talk to .
It is an ambient property of the environment , so plumbing it through ten layers of methods just so one deeply nested call can get to it is adding needless complexity to your code .
In those kinds of cases , this pattern can help .
As we ’ll see , it functions as a more flexible , more configurable cousin of the Singleton pattern .
When used well , it can make your codebase more flexible with little runtime cost .
Conversely , when used poorly , it carries with it all of the baggage of the Singleton pattern with worse runtime performance .
The core difficulty with a service locator is that it takes a dependency — a bit of coupling between two pieces of code — and defers wiring it up until runtime .
This gives you flexibility , but the price you pay is that it ’s harder to understand what your dependencies are by reading the code .
With a singleton or a static class , there ’s no chance for the instance we need to not be available .
Calling code can take for granted that it ’s there .
But since this pattern has to locate the service , we may need to handle cases where that fails .
Fortunately , we ’ll cover a strategy later to address this and guarantee that we ’ll always get some service when you need it .
Since the locator is globally accessible , any code in the game could be requesting a service and then poking at it .
This means that the service must be able to work correctly in any circumstance .
For example , a class that expects to be used only during the simulation portion of the game loop and not during rendering may not work as a service — it would n’t be able to ensure that it ’s being used at the right time .
So , if a class expects to be used only in a certain context , it ’s safest to avoid exposing it to the entire world with this pattern .
Getting back to our audio system problem , let ’s address it by exposing the system to the rest of the codebase through a service locator .
We ’ll start off with the audio API .
This is the interface that our service will be exposing :
class Audio { public : virtual ~ Audio ( ) {} virtual void playSound ( int soundID ) = 0 ; virtual void stopSound ( int soundID ) = 0 ; virtual void stopAllSounds () = 0 ; } ;
A real audio engine would be much more complex than this , of course , but this shows the basic idea .
What ’s important is that it ’s an abstract interface class with no implementation bound to it .
By itself , our audio interface is n’t very useful .
We need a concrete implementation .
This book is n’t about how to write audio code for a game console , so you ’ll have to imagine there ’s some actual code in the bodies of these functions , but you get the idea :
class ConsoleAudio : public Audio { public : virtual void playSound ( int soundID ) { //
Play sound using console audio api ... } virtual void stopSound ( int soundID ) { //
Stop sound using console audio api ... } virtual void stopAllSounds () { //
Stop all sounds using console audio api ... } } ;
Now we have an interface and an implementation .
The remaining piece is the service locator — the class that ties the two together .
The implementation here is about the simplest kind of service locator you can define :
class Locator { public : static Audio * getAudio ( ) { return service_ ; } static void provide ( Audio * service ) { service_ = service ; } private : static Audio * service_ ; } ;
The technique this uses is called dependency injection , an awkward bit of jargon for a very simple idea .
Say you have one class that depends on another .
In our case , our Locator class needs an instance of the Audio service .
Normally , the locator would be responsible for constructing that instance itself .
Dependency injection instead says that outside code is responsible for injecting that dependency into the object that needs it .
The static getAudio ( ) function does the locating .
We can call it from anywhere in the codebase , and it will give us back an instance of our Audio service to use :
Audio * audio = Locator :: getAudio ( ) ; audio -> playSound ( VERY_LOUD_BANG ) ;
The way it “ locates ” is very simple — it relies on some outside code to register a service provider before anything tries to use the service .
When the game is starting up , it calls some code like this :
ConsoleAudio * audio = new ConsoleAudio ( ) ; Locator :: provide ( audio ) ;
The key part to notice here is that the code that calls playSound ( ) is n’t aware of the concrete ConsoleAudio class ; it only knows the abstract Audio interface .
Equally important , not even the locator class is coupled to the concrete service provider .
The only place in code that knows about the actual concrete class is the initialization code that provides the service .
There ’s one more level of decoupling here : the Audio interface is n’t aware of the fact that it ’s being accessed in most places through a service locator .
As far as it knows , it ’s just a regular abstract base class .
This is useful because it means we can apply this pattern to existing classes that were n’t necessarily designed around it .
This is in contrast with Singleton , which affects the design of the “ service ” class itself .
Our implementation so far is certainly simple , and it ’s pretty flexible too .
But it has one big shortcoming : if we try to use the service before a provider has been registered , it returns NULL .
If the calling code does n’t check that , we ’re going to crash the game .
I sometimes hear this called “ temporal coupling ” — two separate pieces of code that must be called in the right order for the program to work correctly .
All stateful software has some degree of this , but as with other kinds of coupling , reducing temporal coupling makes the codebase easier to manage .
Fortunately , there ’s another design pattern called “ Null Object ” that we can use to address this .
The basic idea is that in places where we would return NULL when we fail to find or create an object , we instead return a special object that implements the same interface as the desired object .
Its implementation basically does nothing , but it allows code that receives the object to safely continue on as if it had received a “ real ” one .
To use this , we ’ll define another “ null ” service provider :
class NullAudio : public Audio { public : virtual void playSound ( int soundID ) { /*
Do nothing .
*/ } virtual void stopSound ( int soundID ) { /*
Do nothing .
*/ } virtual void stopAllSounds () { /*
Do nothing .
*/ } } ;
As you can see , it implements the service interface , but does n’t actually do anything .
Now , we change our locator to this :
class Locator { public : static void initialize ( ) { service_ = & nullService_ ; } static Audio & getAudio ( ) { return * service_ ; } static void provide ( Audio * service ) { if ( service == NULL ) { //
Revert to null service .
service_ = & nullService_ ; } else { service_ = service ; } } private : static Audio * service_ ; static NullAudio nullService_ ; } ;
You may notice we ’re returning the service by reference instead of by pointer now .
Since references in C++ are ( in theory ! ) never NULL , returning a reference is a hint to users of the code that they can expect to always get a valid object back .
The other thing to notice is that we ’re checking for NULL in the provide ( ) function instead of checking for the accessor .
That requires us to call initialize ( ) early on to make sure that the locator initially correctly defaults to the null provider .
In return , it moves the branch out of getAudio( ) , which will save us a couple of cycles every time the service is accessed .
Calling code will never know that a “ real ” service was n’t found , nor does it have to worry about handling NULL .
It ’s guaranteed to always get back a valid object .
This is also useful for intentionally failing to find services .
If we want to disable a system temporarily , we now have an easy way to do so : simply do n’t register a provider for the service , and the locator will default to a null provider .
Turning off audio is handy during development .
It frees up some memory and CPU cycles .
More importantly , when you break into a debugger just as a loud sound starts playing , it saves you from having your eardrums shredded .
There ’s nothing like twenty milliseconds of a scream sound effect looping at full volume to get your blood flowing in the morning .
Now that our system is pretty robust , let ’s discuss another refinement this pattern lets us do — decorated services .
I ’ll explain with an example .
During development , a little logging when interesting events occur can help you figure out what ’s going on under the hood of your game engine .
If you ’re working on AI , you ’d like to know when an entity changes AI states .
If you ’re the sound programmer , you may want a record of every sound as it plays so you can check that they trigger in the right order .
The typical solution is to litter the code with calls to some log ( ) function .
Unfortunately , that replaces one problem with another — now we have too much logging .
The AI coder does n’t care when sounds are playing , and the sound person does n’t care about AI state transitions , but now they both have to wade through each other ’s messages .
Ideally , we would be able to selectively enable logging for just the stuff we care about , and in the final game build , there ’d be no logging at all .
If the different systems we want to conditionally log are exposed as services , then we can solve this using the Decorator pattern .
Let ’s define another audio service provider implementation like this :
class LoggedAudio : public Audio { public : LoggedAudio ( Audio & wrapped ) : wrapped_ ( wrapped ) {} virtual void playSound ( int soundID ) { log ( " play sound " ) ; wrapped_ .
playSound ( soundID ) ; } virtual void stopSound ( int soundID ) { log ( " stop sound " ) ; wrapped_ .
stopSound ( soundID ) ; } virtual void stopAllSounds ( ) { log ( " stop all sounds " ) ; wrapped_ . stopAllSounds ( ) ; } private : void log ( const char * message ) { //
Code to log message ... } Audio & wrapped_ ; } ;
As you can see , it wraps another audio provider and exposes the same interface .
It forwards the actual audio behavior to the inner provider , but it also logs each sound call .
If a programmer wants to enable audio logging , they call this :
void enableAudioLogging () { //
Decorate the existing service .
Audio * service = new LoggedAudio ( Locator :: getAudio ( ) ) ; //
Swap it in .
Locator :: provide ( service ) ; }
Now , any calls to the audio service will be logged before continuing as before .
And , of course , this plays nicely with our null service , so you can both disable audio and yet still log the sounds that it would play if sound were enabled .
We ’ve covered a typical implementation , but there are a couple of ways that it can vary based on differing answers to a few core questions :
Outside code registers it :
This is the mechanism our sample code uses to locate the service , and it ’s the most common design I see in games :
It ’s fast and simple .
The getAudio ( ) function simply returns a pointer .
It will often get inlined by the compiler , so we get a nice abstraction layer at almost no performance cost .
We control how the provider is constructed .
Consider a service for accessing the game ’s controllers .
We have two concrete providers : one for regular games and one for playing online .
The online provider passes controller input over the network so that , to the rest of the game , remote players appear to be using local controllers .
To make this work , the online concrete provider needs to know the IP address of the other remote player .
If the locator itself was constructing the object , how would it know what to pass in ?
The Locator class does n’t know anything about online at all , much less some other user ’s IP address .
Externally registered providers dodge the problem .
Instead of the locator constructing the class , the game ’s networking code instantiates the online - specific service provider , passing in the IP address it needs .
Then it gives that to the locator , who knows only about the service ’s abstract interface .
We can change the service while the game is running .
We may not use this in the final game , but it ’s a neat trick during development .
While testing , we can swap out , for example , the audio service with the null service we talked about earlier to temporarily disable sound while the game is still running .
The locator depends on outside code .
This is the downside .
Any code accessing the service presumes that some code somewhere has already registered it .
If that initialization does n’t happen , we ’ll either crash or have a service mysteriously not working .
Bind to it at compile time :
The idea here is that the “ location ” process actually occurs at compile time using preprocessor macros .
Like so : class Locator { public : static Audio & getAudio ( ) { return service_ ; } private : # if DEBUG static DebugAudio service_ ; # else static ReleaseAudio service_ ; # endif } ; Locating the service like this implies a few things :
It ’s fast .
Since all of the real work is done at compile time , there ’s nothing left to do at runtime .
The compiler will likely inline the getAudio ( ) call , giving us a solution that ’s as fast as we could hope for .
You can guarantee the service is available .
Since the locator owns the service now and selects it at compile time , we can be assured that if the game compiles , we wo n’t have to worry about the service being unavailable .
You ca n’t change the service easily .
This is the major downside .
Since the binding happens at build time , anytime you want to change the service , you ’ve got to recompile and restart the game .
Configure it at runtime :
Over in the khaki - clad land of enterprise business software , if you say “ service locator ” , this is what they ’ll have in mind .
When the service is requested , the locator does some magic at runtime to hunt down the actual implementation requested .
Reflection is a capability of some programming languages to interact with the type system at runtime .
For example , we could find a class with a given name , find its constructor , and then invoke it to create an instance .
Dynamically typed languages like Lisp , Smalltalk , and Python get this by their very nature , but newer static languages like C# and Java also support it .
Typically , this means loading a configuration file that identifies the provider and then using reflection to instantiate that class at runtime .
This does a few things for us :
We can swap out the service without recompiling .
This is a little more flexible than a compile - time - bound service , but not quite as flexible as a registered one where you can actually change the service while the game is running .
Non-programmers can change the service .
This is nice for when the designers want to be able to turn certain game features on and off but are n’t comfortable mucking through source code .
( Or , more likely , the coders are n’t comfortable with them mucking through it . )
The same codebase can support multiple configurations simultaneously .
Since the location process has been moved out of the codebase entirely , we can use the same code to support multiple service configurations simultaneously .
This is one of the reasons this model is appealing over in enterprise web - land : you can deploy a single app that works on different server setups just by changing some configs .
Historically , this was less useful in games since console hardware is pretty well - standardized , but as more games target a heaping hodgepodge of mobile devices , this is becoming more relevant .
It ’s complex .
Unlike the previous solutions , this one is pretty heavyweight .
You have to create some configuration system , possibly write code to load and parse a file , and generally do some stuff to locate the service .
Time spent writing this code is time not spent on other game features .
Locating the service takes time .
And now the smiles really turn to frowns .
Going with runtime configuration means you ’re burning some CPU cycles locating the service .
Caching can minimize this , but that still implies that the first time you use the service , the game ’s got to go off and spend some time hunting it down .
Game developers hate burning CPU cycles on something that does n’t improve the player ’s game experience .
Let the user handle it :
The simplest solution is to pass the buck .
If the locator ca n’t find the service , it just returns NULL .
This implies :
It lets users determine how to handle failure .
Some users may consider failing to find a service a critical error that should halt the game .
Others may be able to safely ignore it and continue .
If the locator ca n’t define a blanket policy that ’s correct for all cases , then passing the failure down the line lets each call site decide for itself what the right response is .
Users of the service must handle the failure .
Of course , the corollary to this is that each call site must check for failure to find the service .
If almost all of them handle failure the same way , that ’s a lot duplicate code spread throughout the codebase .
If just one of the potentially hundreds of places that use the service fails to make that check , our game is going to crash .
Halt the game : I said that we ca n’t prove that the service will always be available at compile - time , but that does n’t mean we ca n’t declare that availability is part of the runtime contract of the locator .
The simplest way to do this is with an assertion : class Locator { public : static Audio & getAudio () { Audio * service = NULL ; //
Code here to locate service ... assert ( service != NULL ) ; return * service ; } } ;
If the service is n’t located , the game stops before any subsequent code tries to use it .
The assert ( ) call there does n’t solve the problem of failing to locate the service , but it does make it clear whose problem it is .
By asserting here , we say , “ Failing to locate a service is a bug in the locator . ”
The Singleton chapter explains the assert ( ) function if you ’ve never seen it before .
So what does this do for us ?
Users do n’t need to handle a missing service .
Since a single service may be used in hundreds of places , this can be a significant code saving .
By declaring it the locator ’s job to always provide a service , we spare the users of the service from having to pick up that slack .
The game is going to halt if the service ca n’t be found .
On the off chance that a service really can’t be found , the game is going to halt .
This is good in that it forces us to address the bug that ’s preventing the service from being located ( likely some initialization code is n’t being called when it should ) , but it ’s a real drag for everyone else who ’s blocked until it ’s fixed .
With a large dev team , you can incur some painful programmer downtime when something like this breaks .
Return a null service :
We showed this refinement in our sample implementation .
Using this means :
Users do n’t need to handle a missing service .
Just like the previous option , we ensure that a valid service object will always be returned , simplifying code that uses the service .
The game will continue if the service is n’t available .
This is both a boon and a curse .
It ’s helpful in that it lets us keep running the game even when a service is n’t there .
This can be really helpful on a large team when a feature we ’re working on may be dependent on some other system that is n’t in place yet .
The downside is that it may be harder to debug an unintentionally missing service .
Say the game uses a service to access some data and then make a decision based on it .
If we ’ve failed to register the real service and that code gets a null service instead , the game may not behave how we want .
It will take some work to trace that issue back to the fact that a service was n’t there when we thought it would be .
We can alleviate this by having the null service print some debug output whenever it ’s used .
Among these options , the one I see used most frequently is simply asserting that the service will be found .
By the time a game gets out the door , it ’s been very heavily tested , and it will likely be run on a reliable piece of hardware .
The chances of a service failing to be found by then are pretty slim .
On a larger team , I encourage you to throw a null service in .
It does n’t take much effort to implement , and can spare you from some downtime during development when a service is n’t available .
It also gives you an easy way to turn off a service if it ’s buggy or is just distracting you from what you ’re working on .
Up to this point , we ’ve assumed that the locator will provide access to the service to anyone who wants it .
While this is the typical way the pattern is used , another option is to limit access to a single class and its descendants , like so :
class Base { //
Code to locate service and set service_ ... protected : // Derived classes can use service static Audio & getAudio ( ) { return * service_ ; } private : static Audio * service_ ; } ;
With this , access to the service is restricted to classes that inherit Base .
There are advantages either way :
If access is global :
It encourages the entire codebase to all use the same service .
Most services are intended to be singular .
By allowing the entire codebase to have access to the same service , we can avoid random places in code instantiating their own providers because they ca n’t get to the “ real ” one .
We lose control over where and when the service is used .
This is the obvious cost of making something global — anything can get to it .
The Singleton chapter has a full cast of characters for the horror show that global scope can spawn .
If access is restricted to a class :
We control coupling .
This is the main advantage .
By limiting a service to a branch of the inheritance tree , we can make sure systems that should be decoupled stay decoupled .
It can lead to duplicate effort .
The potential downside is that if a couple of unrelated classes do need access to the service , they ’ll each need to have their own reference to it .
Whatever process is used to locate or register the service will have to be duplicated between those classes .
( The other option is to change the class hierarchy around to give those classes a common base class , but that ’s probably more trouble than it ’s worth . )
My general guideline is that if the service is restricted to a single domain in the game , then limit its scope to a class .
For example , a service for getting access to the network can probably be limited to online classes .
Services that get used more widely like logging should be global .

Joel Surnow is no John Milton , but the producer of " 24 " , America 's favorite torture show , seems to be taking a good whack at a favorite liberal icon , or rather iconostasis , the Kennedys .
Here 's Alternet , waxing wroth :
Outraged Citizens Campaign Forces History Channel to Rethink Miniseries About the Kennedys
Robert Greenwald launches growing campaign that calls historically revisionist series backed by a producer with ties to Roger Ailes , " right - wing character assassination . "
Media observers are abuzz with talk of a History Channel mini-series called " The Kennedys . "
While the scripts for the eight - part show , slated to air in 2011 , are still unfinished , that has n't stopped 40,000 people from signing a petition calling the series " right - wing character assassination " and " politically motivated fiction . "
One would kinda like to know who the 40,000 " outraged citizens " are , and how they got mobilized .
Greenwald , a documentary filmmaker and stalwart committed Democrat , seems to have started the ball rolling .
Apparently Greenwald got hold of the scripts somehow ; they include a scene of Mattress Jack boinking somebody -- not Jackie , apparently ; someone named Judy -- in a swimming pool :
.... when a Secret Service agent comes to deliver time - sensitive information from McGeorge Bundy , his security advisor , the president does n't stop what he 's doing as the agent delivers the news .
I do n't know anything at all about Judy , but I remember McGeorge Bundy .
I have to think that Jacko made the right choice .
Apparently there 's also a scene in which Jack mulls the possibility of walling off East Berlin , before those nasty old Soviets had the idea .
This is certainly not something I ever heard before , and could easily be made up out of whole cloth .
But then on the other hand , if it turned out that Jack & Co. gave the idea some thought , I would n't be a bit surprised .
Anybody know where this might have come from ?
Just goes to show : liberals are the real conservatives ( * ) .
All these plaster deities to venerate !
Even so , it 's hard to imagine a less suitable object of veneration than the Kennedys , and Green Beret Jack in particular -- an unscrupulous mendacious chauvinist demagogue who ran in 1960 on the basis of a mythical " missile gap " ; a dedicated warmonger who immediately cranked up military spending after a long period of diminution under his predecessor ; a grandiose parvenu who puffed up the imperial iconography of the US presidency to unheard - of levels ; the father of the Vietnam war , and the architect of the still - enduring Cuban embargo .
You would think a " progressive " like Greenwald might have something better to do than burnish and defend this grotesque and bloodstained legacy .
But you would be wrong .

Why are my headlines always so weird ?
I do n’t know , but this one ’s true .
Actually , they ’re pretty much all true .
ANYway …
McDonalds is certainly no stranger to Nintendo due to the Nintendo Zone service ( also for the DS ) and all the crappy old GameCube games that now make up most McDonalds Playlands .
Man , I remember when they had jungle gyms !
Ahem , sorry .
Moving on !
So , according to Nikkei , McDonalds Japan recently announced that they ’re planning to implement this new program later this year .
They ’ll be installing about two DSes per site countrywide .
At about 3,700 shops , that ’s nearly 8,000 DSes !
The expected cost for this little venture is around 200 million yen .
The new DS training program , dubbed “ eSmart , ” will be used to train part - time ( and possibly full - time ) employees .
McDonalds claims that this new software can cut training time by half over conventional methods , citing among other factors the familiarity of the DS system .
With a shorter training time , McDonalds can save a lot of money , and pass the savings onto us .
Nah , just kidding ; it ’s all going in the execs ’ pockets .
Still , using video game consoles to train people is a pretty cool idea .
As the line between gaming and functionality continues to blur , we should see more things like Wii Fit in schools , RPG “ book ” reports , corporate “ raid ” projects , and FPS ’s as training for basic survival in south central Los Angeles .
Naturally , this being McDonalds , the whole training venture is a precursor to an implanted “ McChip ” that , when planted directly into the cerebral cortex , will allow McDonalds workers to flawlessly complete their job tasks without feeling the need to complain about unpaid overtime .
Embrace the future !

A scandal at British Airways – sexy pictures of stewardesses stripping off have been found on a hardcore porn website !
Please bring your seat into the upright position , fold your table away and fasten your seatbelts .
You will be in for a ride with these hot trolly dollies ...
The air hostesses ' uniforms were obviously too warm for them so they performed a sexy striptease show in the cabin .
Here is the naked truth : they lifted up their skirts to expose their firm backsides and sexy suspenders .
One stewardess smiled into the camera as she lay in the overhead baggage compartment .
They even posed erotically in front of the British Airways logo and in the cockpit .
It was clearly only for a bit of fun among colleagues .
But the striptease stewardesses were given a shock – the photos appeared on a hardcore sex website .
“ They were never intended to get out and it would never have occurred to the girls they would end up on a porn site , ” an insider told ' The Sun ' .
“ Some of the girls are worried their actions will rebound on them . ”
British Airways is n’t amused by the saucy pics .
The scandal photos went round after the airline had announced a cut in cabin crew jobs .
A strike was already in preparation .
An investigation will be launched into any employee found to have been posing for the sexy snaps , although British Airways insisted there was no proof any of the girls were actually employees of the airline .
BILD has blurred out the girls ’ faces in the photo gallery above .

The following few lines from that discussion :

The text : “ If you could reason with religious people , there would be no religious people . ”
The above picture suffers from some serious problems :
1 . The phrase attributed to House is not the precise phrase that he said .
2 . There is no mention of the episode number , so as to easily cross-check the information .
3 . There is no mention of any other source , so as to be able to look for more information .
Thus , if you look around the interwebz you may find numerous publications of the above picture , and quite often some reader asks whether anyone knows the episode from which the phrase was taken , and nobody gives an answer , because any search for the phrase fails due to the alteration it has undergone .

March 18 , 2010 - Johns
Hopkins scientists have found that a safe and inexpensive antibiotic in use since the 1970s for treating acne effectively targets infected immune cells in which HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , lies dormant and prevents them from reactivating and replicating .
Janice E. Clements , Ph.D. Janice E. Clements , Ph.D .
The drug , minocycline , likely will improve on the current treatment regimens of HIV - infected patients if used in combination with a standard drug cocktail known as HAART ( Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ) , according to research published now online and appearing in print April 15 in The Journal of Infectious Diseases .
“ The powerful advantage to using minocycline is that the virus appears less able to develop drug resistance because minocycline targets cellular pathways not viral proteins , ” says Janice Clements , Ph.D. , Mary Wallace Stanton Professor of Faculty Affairs , vice dean for faculty , and professor of molecular and comparative pathobiology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine .
“ The big challenge clinicians deal with now in this country when treating HIV patients is keeping the virus locked in a dormant state , ” Clements adds .
“ While HAART is really effective in keeping down active replication , minocycline is another arm of defense against the virus . ”
Unlike the drugs used in HAART which target the virus , minocycline homes in on , and adjusts T cells , major immune system agents and targets of HIV infection .
According to Clements , minocycline reduces the ability of T cells to activate and proliferate , both steps crucial to HIV production and progression toward full blown AIDS .
If taken daily for life , HAART usually can protect people from becoming ill , but it ’s not a cure .
The HIV virus is kept at a low level but is n’t ever entirely purged ; it stays quietly hidden in some immune cells .
If a person stops HAART or misses a dose , the virus can reactivate out of those immune cells and begin to spread .
The idea for using minocycline as an adjunct to HAART resulted when the Hopkins team learned of research by others on rheumatoid arthritis patients showing the anti-inflammatory effects of minocycline on T cells .
The Hopkins group connected the dots between that study with previous research of their own showing that minocycline treatment had multiple beneficial effects in monkeys infected with SIV , the primate version of HIV .
In monkeys treated with minocycline , the virus load in the cerebrospinal fluid , the viral RNA in the brain and the severity of central nervous system disease were significantly decreased .
The drug was also shown to affect T cell activation and proliferation .
“ Since minocycline reduced T cell activation , you might think it would have impaired the immune systems in the macaques , which are very similar to humans , but we did n’t see any deleterious effect , ” says Gregory Szeto , a graduate student in the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine working in the Retrovirus Laboratory at Hopkins .
“ This drug strikes a good balance and is ideal for HIV because it targets very specific aspects of immune activation . ”
The success with the animal model prompted the team to study in test tubes whether minocycline treatment affected latency in human T cells infected with HIV .
Using cells from HIV - infected humans on HAART , the team isolated the “ resting ” immune cells and treated half of them with minocycline .
Then they counted how many virus particles were reactivated , finding completely undetectable levels in the treated cells versus detectable levels in the untreated cells .
“ Minocycline reduces the capability of the virus to emerge from resting infected T cells , ” Szeto explains .
“ It prevents the virus from escaping in the one in a million cells in which it lays dormant in a person on HAART , and since it prevents virus activation it should maintain the level of viral latency or even lower it .
That ’s the goal : Sustaining a latent non-infectious state . ”
The team used molecular markers to discover that minocycline very selectively interrupts certain specific signaling pathways critical for T cell activation .
However , the antibiotic does n’t completely obliterate T cells or diminish their ability to respond to other infections or diseases , which is crucial for individuals with HIV .
“ HIV requires T cell activation for efficient replication and reactivation of latent virus , ” Clement says , “ so our new understanding about minocyline ’s effects on a T cell could help us to find even more drugs that target its signaling pathways . ”
The research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health .
Authors of the paper , in addition to Clements and Szeto , are Angela K. Brice , Sheila A. Barber and Robert F. Siliciano , all of Johns Hopkins .
Also , Hung - Chih Yang of National Taiwan University Hospital .

Derbies are one of the biggest facets of world football .

I could go on .
It is said that civil wars are those with most hatred and ( fortunately , without the killing in the thousands ) this can be said when two teams from the same city play against each other .
There is an intense dislike for people who share the same air and walk the same streets supporting another team .

The A - League has n’t had the same type of match ( if you discount Central Coast Mariners and Sydney ) .
The introduction of Melbourne Heart will be the first time two teams from the same city will be battling it out in the competition .
I must admit that I have my misgivings .
I look at the successful intra-city rivalries in world football and there is often something behind it .
Inter is an abbreviation of Internazionale .
A group of people were unhappy about the domination of Italians in the AC Milan team , and broke away from them , thus creating a different philosophy and mindset from the other team in that city .
Real Madrid have long been seen as the establishment club , with the Bernabéu Stadium alongside banks and businesses on the classy and aristocratic Castellana , while while Calderon is beside a brewery , with its Atlético fans being more working - class which comes particularly from the south of the city .
Of course , I can go on and more knowledgeable football people will be able to recount many more ( and we will not mention sectarian differences such as Rangers and Celtic ) .

So rivalries come from differences .
The team represent something that fans can identify with .
I am not sure that Melbourne Hearts does provide that difference .
There have been rumors that some of the fans who are disaffected by the ‘ new football ’ and have eschewed Melbourne Victory will follow the Heart and create a rivalry .
But why would that be the case ?
The other factor is that the health of the A - League , and consequently the health of football in Australia , is a major concern for me .
So while I want Melbourne Victory to be winning , I do n’t want Melbourne Heart to fail , either .
Having Hearts draw a small crowd , and being unsuccessful , would only be fodder for the ‘ anti - sokkah ’ brigade in the media .
Interestingly , this apparent lack of difference will not be the case for Sydney FC and Sydney Rovers , where the strong presence of football culture in the western suburbs of that city presents points of differentiation immediately .
So what should we call the derby ?

A TASMANIAN man has pleaded guilty to the rare charge of bigamy after forging divorce papers to marry another woman .
In what has been described by Tasmania Police as an " extremely rare and unusual " case , 43 - year - old Nicholas Trikilis appeared in the Hobart Magistrates Court yesterday charged with bigamy , The Mercury reports .
Trikilis did n't hide the fact he was a bigamist .
After filing fake divorce documents to marry his new bride , Katrina May Phillips , in April 2008 , Trikilis sent his wedding pictures to the Mercury in July of that year to celebrate the special occasion .
The happy snap published on July 8 , 2008 showed the couple , family and friends in the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens .
Ironically , the overdue divorce to his legal wife Kerri Anne Statton is scheduled to be heard in court tomorrow , but has been postponed until the current legal matter is resolved .
Trikilis , of Coningham , yesterday admitted forgery , using a forged document , giving defective notice of his divorce and giving false information offences all relating to the bigamy charge .
The call - centre operator admitted falsely trying to end his marriage to Ms Statton by signing a document on January 30 stating he was already divorced .
Trikilis then attended the Family Court in Hobart and presented the false document to Commonwealth public servant Elizabeth Gray on April 18 .
He married in a civil ceremony on April 26 .
Two days later , Trikilis filed the false divorce papers along with his marriage papers .
After being separated for almost a decade , Ms Statton learned of her separated husband 's new wife in late 2008 .
Magistrate Michael Daly yesterday asked police prosecutors for their help in previous sentences for bigamy , having not come across the charge before .
The last bigamy case in Hobart , in 2005 , involved disgraced former British policeman Richard Eames who , after leaving his wife of 26 years in Britain , married a Tasmanian woman so he could stay in the country .
Before sentencing Eames to 21 months ' jail with a 12 - month non-parole period , magistrate Ian Matterson said the problem with bigamy was that " you end up with two mothers - in - law " .
Trikilis will be sentenced on April 15 .

Mr. Maltzan stumbled into the role of socially conscious architect .
He arrived in Los Angeles in 1988 and was soon working for Frank Gehry , then still a cult figure for young architects looking for a way out of the malaise of postmodernism .
In 1993 , while at work on the early stages of the Walt Disney Concert Hall design , Mr. Maltzan was approached by Irwin Jaeger , a businessman , and Bob Bates , an artist , to look at a garbage - strewn lot at the edge of Skid Row where they were planning to build a home for Inner City Arts , an after - school program .
Image Inside the Carver Apartments is a cylindrical space in which sheet - metal fins climb its full height .

Iwan Baan
The project became Mr. Maltzan ’s first solo commission .
A complex of studio spaces clustered around landscaped courtyards , its sculptured white stucco buildings and raw interiors evoked the lyrical architectural forms of Alvaro Siza as well as the sculptural compositions of Mr. Gehry ’s work , suggesting a young architect easing into his own voice .
It also demonstrated an unusual sensitivity for those who taught and worked there .
The comforting scale of the gardens and studios , animated by light funneling through big skylights and windows set at the eye level of a small child , imbue these spaces with a warmth that is rare in low - budget construction .
The project attracted the attention of the Skid Row Housing Trust , an organization dedicated to providing permanent homes for the most vulnerable members of the downtown homeless population  people with a combination of disabling conditions like drug addictions , mental illnesses and physical disabilities who had drifted in and out of shelters for years .
Mr. Maltzan ’s first building for the trust , the Rainbow apartment complex , is surrounded by Skid Row ’s sprawling encampments .
To shelter the tenants from the nearby misery , Mr. Maltzan oriented its 87 apartments around a big ceremonial staircase and an outdoor courtyard .
From a shared top - floor terrace , tenants look over toward the glittering towers of the business district a few blocks away , which in this neighborhood can sometimes seem an unreachable oasis of prosperity and calm .
The project , completed in 2006 , offered a sharp contrast to the soul - crushing atmosphere of more typical homeless shelters , from which many of its tenants had been plucked .

There have been some tense moments during today 's health care summit at the Blair House , but not for Vice President Joe Biden , it seems .
Just moments before the afternoon session got underway , C - SPAN 's cameras picked up audio of Biden chatting casually with participants .
" It 's easy being vice president — you do n't have to do anything . "
Whomever Biden was chatting with said , " It 's like being the grandpa and not the parent . "
" Yeah , that 's it ! " replied Biden .
Biden spokesman Jay Carney tells POLITICO that the vice president was " obviously joking , as any review of his schedule and responsibilities would make abundantly clear . "
“ In the last month , the vice president has , among many other things , made his fourth trip to Iraq since being elected , delivered a major speech on the administration ’s non-proliferation agenda , produced a report on the Recovery
Act ’s first year to the president and played a key role in bringing about the president ’s bi-partisan Fiscal Commission , ” Carney said .
“ In the coming days and weeks , the vice president will deliver a first - year report from the Middle Class Task Force , which he chairs , and travel to the Middle East to meet with key leaders in the region . ”

US citizen Lily Sussman took a vacation in Israel , to visit extended family there and see the sights — all the usual tourist things .
On the way in , though , the security forces got rather serious .
After pulling her aside for questioning , reading her journal and even flicking through her camera to check the photos ( hint : do n’t take snaps of “ graffiti , which read “ Fuck ” scrawled next to the Jewish star of David ” ) , she was left alone .
An announcement was made over the airport speakers , which Lily remembers as something like “ do not to be alarmed by gunshots because the Israeli security needs to blow up suspicious passenger luggage . ”
In fact they did n’t blow anything up .
Instead , they put three bullets through the MacBook , gave it back to the now rather upset Lily and let her be on her way .
The security forces did n’t even ask for her password .
The amazing part is that not a single piece of information was destroyed :
The bullets miraculously missed the MacBook ’s hard drive .
And despite the holes rent on the casing , the body of the MacBook has kept together quite well .
If it worked , it would be the ultimate case - mod .
So what should we take away from this incident ?

VANCOUVER , British Columbia 
The line stretched out the door of the Vancouver Curling Club on Monday afternoon , the entrance blocked by a bouncer , befitting the rock - star status of the man inside .
Those fans came for Kevin Martin , the most famous , perhaps baldest and most decorated curler in the history of Canada .
He only ventures into public wearing a disguise .
He retains a publicist and approaches the popularity of hockey icons like Wayne Gretzky .
“ I ’m just an athlete , ” Martin says , and that is what makes him so intriguing .

Instead , he is the celebrated skip for Canada ’s undefeated and top - seeded curling team entering Thursday ’s semifinal against Sweden , which beat Britain on Wednesday .
More and more college campuses are creating anti-medical marijuana rules for their students and staff .
This last week , the University of Montana ( Missoula ) banned medical marijuana on campus ( click here ) .
Like other universities that have created similar rules , they are claiming that they ‘ are just adhering to federal regulations that prohibit the use of marijuana . ’
Here is the excuse provided by the University .
“ We ’re not unsympathetic to the medical conditions of these people , but we do n’t have the authority to do anything about it , ” said David Aronofsky , UM chief legal counsel .
I always point out the fact that the Obama memo does n’t cover ‘ medicine for profit ’ enterprises .
However , it CLEARLY protects patients that want to use their medicine .
To quote the memo “ For example , prosecution of individuals with cancer or other serious illnesses who use marijuana as part of a recommended treatment regimen consistent with applicable state law , or those caregivers in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state law who provide such individuals with marijuana , is unlikely to be an efficient use of limited federal resources . ” ( click here ) .
I ’m not sure how the UM attorney can read the memo , and interpret it as ‘ the feds are going to take away our funding if a student has their state approved medicine in their backpack . ’
To me , it seems pretty straight forward that patients are protected under the new federal guidelines .
The University of Montana is not completely ruthless though .
They used to have a rule that freshman had to live on campus .
However , now they will grant a waiver if the freshman is a medical marijuana patient .
Some universities are even more emphatic about their anti-medical marijuana crusade .
Colorado State University ordered their ‘ Extension Service ’ employees to refrain from providing advice or opinions to medical marijuana growers ( click here ) .
Apparently , the University is catering to a minority of employees that do n’t like the idea of medical marijuana .
“ Some of the agents did n’t want anything to do with it .
The bottom line is that under federal law it ’s still illegal . ” said Brad Bohlander , CSU spokesperson .
The extension service provides gardening and yard maintenance advice to the public , and has offices in almost every county in Colorado .
I think it is ridiculous to forbid gardeners from giving out advice to legal patients about their legal plants ; it should be up to the individual .
It ’s not like the employees are growing marijuana on campus , or consuming the medicine with the patient .
They are simply giving their opinion and advice …
I thought that ’s what colleges were all about ??
I thought they were supposed to be places were ideas flowed freely , but I guess not at CSU !
I wonder if these universities are worried about losing state funding because they are discriminating against a state program .
Or if they are worried about losing alumni donations from donors that are either medical marijuana patients themselves , or know someone that is ?
Just a thought .
Scott Horton adds to the legal ramifications of Dick Cheney 's remarkable confession of committing a war crime on national television :
Section 2340A of the federal criminal code makes it an offense to torture or to conspire to torture .
Violators are subject to jail terms or to death in appropriate cases , as where death results from the application of torture techniques .
Prosecutors have argued that a criminal investigation into torture undertaken with the direction of the Bush White House would raise complex legal issues , and proof would be difficult .
But what about cases in which an instigator openly and notoriously brags about his role in torture ?
Cheney told Jonathan Karl that he used his position within the National Security Council to advocate for the use of waterboarding and other torture techniques .
Former CIA agent John Kiriakou and others have confirmed that when waterboarding was administered , it was only after receiving NSC clearance .
Hence , Cheney was not speaking hypothetically but admitting his involvement in the process that led to decisions to waterboard in at least three cases .
What prosecutor can look away when a perpetrator mocks the law itself and revels in his role in violating it ?
Such cases cry out for prosecution .
Dick Cheney wants to be prosecuted .
And prosecutors should give him what he wants .

And this despite the fact that such bagged salads often display claims of ' prewashed ' or ' triple - washed ' and attract customers who consider them cleaner and safer .
First the soda fountains at fast food restaurants , and now this -- Consumer Reports has just published an investigation revealing that 39 % of the packaged salads tested contained " bacteria that are common indicators of poor sanitation and fecal contamination . "
And this despite the fact that such bagged salads often display claims of ' prewashed ' or ' triple - washed ' and attract customers who consider them cleaner and safer .
Instead , CR was looking for " total coliforms and for other bacteria , including enterococcus , that are better indicators of fecal contamination . "
The reason for the test was that currently , while there are federal limits on the amount of " indicator " bacteria that can be legally found in water , milk , raw meats , and processed foods , there 's no such standard for produce .
And so , CR set out to discover whether there was sh!t in your salad ( or at least , bacteria that commonly , though not necessarily , forms in feces ) .
Here 's what they found :
Several industry experts we consulted suggested that for leafy greens , an unacceptable level of total coliforms or enterococcus is 10,000 or more colony forming units per gram ( CFU /g ) or a comparable estimate .
In our tests , 39 percent of samples exceeded that level for total coliforms and 23 percent for enterococcus .

I got an extra battery so the first thing I 'm using this for is to prepare a battery for testing .
Need to figure out if it has different voltage cutoffs , need to figure out how to present the data and what to do with my site , .. hmmm .
March 16th : Mugen wants me to send me another battery to test , I agreed and mailed them back Jeremy 's battery .
Also mailed Sean / Telek his OEM 1500 mAh .
Thank you both fellas .
Also DeathmonkeyGTX offered to sponsor a test of the HTC 2150 mAh -- thank you !
March 13th : Finished no name # 2 3600 mAh ( 2466mAh : P ) .
In search of voltage cutoffs for Touch Pro / Fuze , please help .
March 12th : Mugen has expressed interest in sending me another battery to test , I expressed willingness .
And to you I express curiosity into which device to expand the testing .
March 8th : Finished round two of no name # 2 and fake OEM # 2 .
Waiting on another ebay OEM to verify authenticity and a fresh Andida courtesy of my main man Shawn Martell .
March 7th : Added intriguing head to head chart matches .
March 6th : Completed a few more including fresh standard legit OEM , also discovered two counterfeits
March 2nd : Completed no name # 1 , cheapest per mAh so far .
Dropped Jason 's battery off in the mail as promised .
Feb 28th : Completed tests of the Seidio , mailing it to jasonweaver .
Feb 27th : Just received Seidio 1750 mAh from jasonweaver in addition to 1500 mAh no name ebay cheapo .
Nice .
Feb 27th : Mugen 1800
mAh testing completed , table updated .
Thank you very much jcr916 who bought the battery and had it shipped to me , now I 'm going to mail it to him .
Feb 22nd : Thank you jasonweaver and jcr916 who are hooking me up with a barely - used Seidio and a brand new Mugen 1800 mAh respectively .
Those test results should be interesting as from what I 've gathered those two brands have the best reputation and are priced accordingly so let 's see if they deserve it .
Telek and I just laid down some dough for five more batteries this weekend .
So I 'll have a lot of testing to do shortly .
Stay tuned for the results !
New and used batteries welcome .
AT&T / HTC 2150 mAh Pricey worth it .
Really want to test this one .
* En route * HTC 2150 mAh - Same model as AT&T but cheaper , does n't come with door .
* En route ( same battery ) * Cameron Sino -
Found five favorable / neutral reports .
A new Seidio 1750 mAh - Tested a used one already but need data on a fresh battery .
Google Froogle search for more .
AT&T people , beware that if you order a battery that requires a deeper back cover but is for the Touch Pro2 and not the AT&T
Tilt 2 that the cover may not have a hole for the PTT button nor may it latch on .
Maybe you can burn one through with a hot screwdriver or you could just crazy glue .
Beware of the usual dangers of ebay obviously , only use sellers with high ratings and consider buying straight from the company 's website or Amazon or a name you 've heard of .
I have found over two counterfeits from sellers with high ratings .
Read your phone 's warranty before using a third party battery .
If you do get burnt with a counterfeit OEM , immediately give negative feedback using language like " counterfeit " and email the seller requesting both immediate restitution and that they remove their listings of that particular battery or at the least any reference in the listing to the battery being either an OEM or giving an OEM - like serial number , anything misleading , and in return offer to neutralize negative feedback .
Reporting fraud to ebay is up to you but I would take those steps first .
It 's a longshot but the information we really want from the dealer is their supplier but so far I have n't been able to get any of them to cough that information up .
If you 're not sure if the thing 's a counterfeit and want to find out , send it to me to test .
I am using the West Mountain Radio CBA III ( Computerized Battery Analyzer ) which you can buy along with some toys from these guys for $ 149 .
I bought something else from them , did n't like it and they offered to shave the cost of the thing I did n't want off the price of the CBA III without even asking me to return it .
Good people .
The CBA III is the most accurate and reliable device we could find for these testing purposes and we spent many hours arriving at the final testing procedure .
No corners cut .
There is no indication whatsoever that the results it 's produced are inaccurate , certainly not relative to each other given its consistency .
All testing procedures were identical including the current of 250 mA , starting voltage and bottom cutoff ( 4.14 V and 3.5V respectively , the top and bottom cutoffs of the Touch Pro2 , which I use to charge the batteries with original HTC wall charger ) .
The 250 mA current may be a little high and wo n't produce as flattering a result versus a 100 mA current , but it 's both a normal current we burn when we 're doing stuff on the phone , it keeps each of the three tests inside six hours usually and most importantly we use that current on every single test of every single battery so this is a standardized test .
Finally the OEMs get 95 % of their claimed rating on this current so we believe that that current is the sweet spot to supply you with information to use to buy your next battery .

We ’re going to call it a night .
Join us tomorrow ( or more accurately , later this morning ) for more coverage of developments in Washington as health care legislation moves forward .
Having just finished a triumphant news conference , Speaker Nancy Pelosi is now celebrating with her staff in her suite of offices overlooking the West Front of the Capitol .
Two huge rounds of cheers and applause echoed out into the Capitol Rotunda .
Staffers lined the walls of a corridor , as Ms. Pelosi toasted them for the Democrats ’ victory on health care legislation .
David M. Herszenhorn
Speaker Pelosi is now holding her news conference to tout the Democrats ’ votes tonight , flanked by a number of her party ’s leading lawmakers in the House .
She called tonight ’s vote an act of patriotism .
As President Obama spoke , Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. looked on .
Not far away , just outside the view of the cameras , a small group of White House advisers watched as Mr. Obama began trumpeting the virtues of the bill .
“ This is n’t radical reform , but it is major reform , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ This is what change looks like . ”
As the clock approached midnight , the climactic moment was underscored by the hugs and handshakes from the small team of aides .
The White House chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , put his arm around Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius .
( He wore jeans ; she did not . )
David Axelrod , a senior adviser , also was on hand , no tie or coat , just a smile .
“ Tonight ’s vote is not a victory for any one party , ” the president said .
He added , “ I know this was n’t an easy vote for a lot of people , but it was the right vote . ”
Mr. Obama praised those who supported the bill , saying : “ We rose above the weight of our politics . ”
He urged the Senate to quickly complete the final pieces of the health care legislation , which begins on Tuesday .
He said , “ Some have predicted another siege of parliamentary maneuvering in order to delay it .
I hope that ’s not the case . ”
“ It ’s time to bring this debate to a close and begin the hard work of implementing this reform properly on behalf of the American people . ”
Before he called it a night , he sought to place the day in a broader perspective .
“ What this day represents is another stone firmly laid in the foundation of the American dream , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ Tonight , we answered the call of history as so many generations of Americans have before us .
When faced with crisis , we did not shrink from our challenges .
We overcame them .
We did not avoid our responsibilities , we embraced it .
We did not fear our future , we shaped it . ”
After speaking for a little more than seven minutes — warning Americans of the “ frenzy of instant analysis ” to come — Mr. Obama turned and left the room .
He did not answer a question from a reporter as to when he intends to sign the bill into law .
Jeff Zeleny
President Obama , speaking from the East Room , says that the votes tonight prove that this was for the people and by the people .
He singles out Speaker Nancy Pelosi for her “ extraordinary ” work on health care legislation .
He says today ’s votes answered the dreams of so many , who hoped their voice would be heard .
“ It has been heard tonight . ”
The president , with Vice President Joseph R. Biden behind him , says this victory is n’t just for one party .
He once again brushes off the media handicapping of his or anyone else ’s political future based on the vote ’s tonight .
With the Senate expected to take up final action on the reconciliation measure the House just passed , the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid of Nevada , has issued this statement about tonight ’s vote :
Today , over a half million Nevadans are a step closer to quality , affordable health care .
Tens of thousands of Nevada small businesses are a step closer to getting critical relief to support health care for their employees .
Over 200,000 Nevada seniors are a step closer to a stronger Medicare program that puts money back in their pockets instead of padding insurer profits .
This story can be told all over America , and it represents the real impact of today ’s passage of health reform in the House .
I commend Speaker Pelosi and her team for leading passage of this common sense legislation that puts Americans back in control of their own health care , lowers skyrocketing costs , reduces the deficit , protects seniors and curbs insurance company abuses .
She and her colleagues in the House understand that this was never about politics ; it has always been about people who are struggling every day to keep their families healthy without going broke .
This is about the scores of people we hear from every day who need greater security and stability in their health care .
As the Senate prepares to complete our work on this historic effort , Senate Democrats reaffirm our commitment to reform because we know it ’s good for middle - class families , seniors and small businesses in Nevada and all across America .
Not just yet .
The White House press corps has been ushered into the East Room , where President Obama will deliver remarks .
The stately room , where Mr. Obama opened the legislative debate more than a year ago with the first health care summit , is quiet and still tonight .
There are no doctors or nurses , who have often served as an audience .
Instead , he will speak to an empty room — no spectators at this late hour — against the long backdrop of the Cross Hall .
Jeff Zeleny
Speaker Pelosi grins as she gavels : “ The bill is passed . ”
The vote was 220 in favor ; 211 against .
The Democrats got one more this time around from Representative Lynch ( see below ) .
My colleague David Herszenhorn notes that Democrats once again break out in cheers , while Republicans are silent .
Representative Stephen Lynch , Democrat of Massachusetts , is signaling he ’ll vote in favor of the House reconciliation bill , according to colleague David M. Herszenhorn .
If you recall , Mr. Lynch ’s decision to vote against the Senate bill drew the ire of labor leaders .
The Senate health care bill will be sent to President Obama for his signature , and while House Democrats are about to vote on revisions to it , the bill will become law — one way or another .
The Senate majority leader , Harry Reid of Nevada , has promised House Democrats that the Senate would quickly take up the reconciliation bill with the changes in it , and that he had secured the votes to pass it .
But while the Senate is bracing for a fierce floor fight over the reconciliation measure , the landscape was permanently altered by passage of the original Senate bill .
Should the reconciliation bill , which cannot be filibustered , collapse for any reason , the core components of the Democrats ’ health care overhaul would move forward .
Indeed , Senate Republicans were quickly faced with a need to recalibrate their message from one aimed at stopping the legislation to one focused on winning back a sufficient number of seats in Congress to repeal it .
Sheryl Gay Stolberg
Colleague David M. Herszenhorn reports that within the chamber , someone on the Republican side shouted “ Baby Killer ! ” while Representative Stupak , an anti-abortion lawmaker who decided to vote for the bill , was denouncing a procedural move .
He said it was n’t “ pro-life ” but an effort to kill the bill .
Here ’s our breakdown of the first vote on the Senate bill , known as HR 3590 .
This will show you by party , by region , who voted how .
Colleague David M. Herszenhorn says that the president watched the vote in the Roosevelt Room with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and staff .
Since Monday , the president has spoken with 92 lawmakers , either in person or by telephone , the White House said .
Now that the House has passed the Senate Health care bill , President Obama must think about the next step : signing the measure into law .
It is not as simple as it seems .
After more than a year of fighting for the measure , his top legislative priority , Mr. Obama will no doubt want to have an elaborate , high - profile signing ceremony at the White House — a kind of legislative victory lap .
But he ’s in an awkward spot .
Mr. Obama must sign the bill into law for the Senate to take up a package of changes to it under the budget procedure known as reconciliation .
But if he holds a big signing ceremony right away , Mr. Obama will be celebrating a bill that he himself says is in need of improvement .
The measure contains special deals that have become the subject of much derision — deals that would be stripped out in the reconciliation bill .
Alternatively , Mr. Obama could sign the bill quickly and quietly , with little fanfare .
But if you had worked as hard as Mr. Obama has for passage of the health overhaul , would n’t you want to throw a big party when it was all over ?
If Mr. Obama puts off his big bill signing celebration and the Senate fails to pass the reconciliation measure , he will have lost his opportunity for the victory lap .
And if Republicans succeed in forcing the Senate to alter the reconciliation measure , that bill could get sent back to the House for more work , and the signing ceremony could get caught up in the messy legislative process .
White House officials were weighing their options on Sunday , as Mr. Obama prepared for an appearance in the East Room following the final vote .
Whatever they decide , Mr. Obama will not sign the bill Sunday night .
The measure must first be formally “ enrolled ” and sent from the Capitol to the White House , a process that can take a few days although short cuts have been arranged in the past so that it takes just a few hours .
Sheryl Gay Stolberg
By a vote of 219 - 212 , the House has passed the bill previously approved in the Senate last December , known as HR 3590 .
It would appear that 34 Democrats voted against it ; 178 Republicans voted solidly against this bill .
Cheers have gone up in the chamber .
As they crossed 216 , shouts of “ Yes , we can !
Yes , we can ! ” went up .
Representative Rosa DeLauro , Democrat of Connecticut , pumped her fists in the air .
More cheers and hugs .
The House begins a 15 - minute vote on the Senate bill .
It still has other votes ahead , including on its reconciliation bill .
ProPublica did a side - by - side comparison of the Senate bill and House revisions and posted it late last week so that you can view the changes .
Speaker Pelosi closes her remarks by quoting a fellow lawmaker : “ We may not have chosen the time , but the time has chosen us . ”
She also pays tribute to the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy .
President Obama spoke to many members of Congress today by telephone .
But one call tonight was particularly important : Representative Bart Stupak .
A senior administration official confirmed that Mr. Obama had spoken to Mr. Stupak .
The call took place sometime after the president issued an executive order outlining prohibitions against the use of federal funds for abortion .
The order paved the way for Mr. Stupak and a group of lawmakers who oppose abortion rights to support the health care bill .
Was the topic of the call a presidential thank you ?
A senior administration official declined to comment .
Jeff Zeleny
Riffing off an old political adage that all politics is local , Ms. Pelosi says that when it comes to health care , it ’s all personal .
And she chuckles just slightly , when she says that for women , it ’s personal because being a woman will no longer mean being a pre-existing condition .
Ms. Pelosi stands to speak , amid boisterous cheers .
She says , Just think , members of Congress are joining those who passed landmark legislation like Social Security and Medicare .
Saying Americans are endowed with certain inalienable rights — life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness , Ms. Pelosi says the health care legislation “ will lead to healthier lives , more liberty to pursue hopes and dreams of the American people . ”
She ’s now trying to get members to repeat the refrain : Pass Health Care Reform .
But they ’re mainly clapping .
Mr. Boehner , who knows all too well what it ’s like for the majority to lose control of the House , recalls that moment in 2007 when he turned the gavel over to Speaker Pelosi after Republicans were defeated .
He said he then told Ms. Pelosi that this is the people ’s house .
“ The moment a majority forgets it , it starts writing itself a ticket to being the minority , ” Mr. Boehner says .
Mr. Boehner , his voice rising , asks if members can say the bill was derived through transparency and openness ?
“ Hell , no , you can ’t ! ” Mr. Boehner answers .
“ Have you read the bill ? ..
Have you read the reconciliation bill ?
Have you read the manager ’s amendment ? ” Mr. Boehner asks .
“ Hell , no , you have n’t . ”
As members taunt each other a bit aloud , Representative David Obey , in the chair , says : “ Both sides would do well to remember the dignity of the House . ”
Representative John Boehner , the minority leader from Ohio , says he rises with a sad and heavy heart .
He contends that House members are failing to reflect the will of their constituents .
The chamber erupts as Mr. Boehner continues to assert — as he has before — that you wo n’t be able to keep your health care plan .
He and Mr. Obama debated this point at the health care summit last month .
While the health care drama unfolded in Washington , and President Obama was busy winning over last - minute votes , the rest of the Obamas hit the road .
Destination : Broadway .
First Lady Michelle Obama , along with daughters Malia and Sasha , arrived in New York City for an afternoon performance of “ Memphis ” at the Shubert Theatre .
The Obama girls are on spring break and by now , they had planned to be touring Indonesia on the president ’s first international trip of the year .
But the White House called off the trip , given the precarious health care debate in Congress .
A White House aide confirmed the trip , but declined to offer additional details about how the First Family intended to spend the rest of their spring break , the Plan B version .
Jeff Zeleny
The vote ’s getting closer , as you can see now that Representative Eric Cantor , the Republican whip from Virginia , is speaking .
He ’s winding up , calling health care a very personal issue : “ But many of us from both sides of the aisle do n’t care for this trillion dollar overhaul , and the fact is , the majority of Americans do n’t care for it either . ”
For weeks , a multi-million dollar advertising war in the health care debate has been under way .
Whether the ads were for or against the bill , lawmakers being targeted had one thing in common : they were Democrats .
But this week , at least some Republicans will be the focus of ads , beginning with Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota , one of the most outspoken members of the party ’s caucus .
One ad to begin running in her district is sponsored by Americans United for Change , a liberal group that has been pushing the legislation .
Ms. Bachmann is not seen as vulnerable in her re-election effort .
A Democratic strategist familiar with the ad says they believe the message against Ms. Bachmann will amplify and she may “ take the bait and respond . ”
So why run this ad against her ?
Finally , Congress passed the health reform bill to rein in the power of the big insurance companies and guarantee that all Minnesotans can get the same health insurance as members of Congress .
But our Congresswoman Michele Bachmann voted against that ?
She may be an “ important ” politician in Washington , but when it comes to health insurance , if it ’s good enough for her should n’t it be good enough for the rest of us ? ”
Stay tuned to find out if she responds .
Jeff Zeleny
Representative Mike Pence of Indiana , the chairman of the Republican conference offered a blistering criticism of the Democrats ’ health care legislation .
“ Some say we are making history , ” he said in a speech on the floor .
“ I believe we are breaking history . ”
Mr. Pence said that House Democrats were betraying some of America ’s core political traditions , including “ limited government ” and the “ consent of the governed . ”
In his speech , Mr. Pence said : “ The arrogance we have witnessed in this institution is breath - taking . ”
And he added , “ Only in Washington D.C. could you say you are going to spend a trillion dollars and save the taxpayers ’ money . ”
Mr. Pence continued , “ The America people do n’t want a government takeover of health care . ”
And he urged Democrats to vote down the bill , an unlikely prospect .
“ I say to my Democratic colleagues stand with those who have gone before and made the hard choices to defend freedom in their time , ” he said .
“ Stand with us .
Stand for freedom and the American people will stand with you . ”
In a speech to House Democrats on Saturday , President Obama mocked comments like that by Republicans suggesting that it was unlikely that Republicans were suddenly so concerned about the Democrats ’ political fate that they would offer advice to make sure that Democrats hold on to their majorities in Congress .
The president ’s comments drew a laugh from House Democrats and he even chuckled at himself .
David M. Herszenhorn
After all the developments today in which anti-abortion Democrats came out in favor of the health - care bill , groups on both sides have staked out their positions — some very clearly eyeing the 2010 midterm elections .
The National Right - to - Life Committee , with chapters in all 50 states had this to say :
The National Right to Life Committee ( NRLC ) remains strongly opposed to the Senate - passed health bill ( H.R. 3590 ) .
A lawmaker who votes for this bill is voting to require federal agencies to subsidize and administer health plans that will pay for elective abortion , and voting to undermine longstanding pro-life policies in other ways as well .
Pro-life citizens nationwide know that this is a pro-abortion bill .
Pro-life citizens know , and they will be reminded again and again , which lawmakers deserve their gratitude for voting against this pro-abortion legislation .
The executive order promised by President Obama was issued for political effect .
It changes nothing .
It does not correct any of the serious pro-abortion provisions in the bill .
The president cannot amend a bill by issuing an order , and the federal courts will enforce what the law says .
To elaborate :
The order does not truly correct any of the seven objectionable pro-abortion provisions described in NRLC ’s March 19 letter to the House of Representatives , which is posted here :
Speaker Nancy Pelosi has released the list of her guests in the House gallery for tonight ’s big health care vote .
They include her husband , Paul Pelosi , and two of her daughters , Nancy Corinne Prowda and Alexandra Pelosi , as well as a son - in - law , Michael Vos , and Zeke Emanuel , the brother of White House chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel .
Zeke Emanuel is a senior adviser for health policy at the Office of Management and Budget .
She also invited four other Obama administration officials : three economic advisers , Christina Romer , Mark Duggan and Jason Furman , and Nancy Ann DeParle , the head of the White House Office of Health Care Reform .
Ms. Pelosi ’s other guests are : Gordon Witman , of PICO , a network of faith - based community organizations , Richard Kirsch of Health Care for America Now ; Robert Hall of the American Academy of Pediatrics ; Richard Trumka , the president of the AFL - CIO ; Willarda Edwards of the National Medical Association .
David M. Herszenhorn
This just in : The Susan B . Anthony group announced tonight that it has decided to strip Representative Stupak of its “ Defender of Life ” award that was to be given out next week .
A spokesman for the group told us that it had been in talks with the Michigan Democrat last week , and believed he was leaning its way in opposition to the bill .
The Susan B. Candidate List Fund president , Marjorie Dannenfelser , issued this statement , headlined “ Pro-Life Betrayers ” :
“ This Wednesday night is our third annual Campaign for Life Gala , where we were planning to honor Congressman Stupak for his efforts to keep abortion - funding out of health care reform — we will no longer be doing so .
By accepting this deal from the most pro-abortion president in American history , Stupak has not only failed to stand strong for unborn children , but also for his constituents and pro-life voters across the country .
“ Let me be clear : any representative , including Rep. Stupak , who votes for this healthcare bill can no longer call themselves ‘ pro-life . ’
The Susan B. Anthony List Candidate
Fund will not endorse , or support in any capacity , any Member of Congress who votes for this bill in any future election .
Now through Election Day 2010 , these representatives will learn that votes have consequences .
The SBA List Candidate Fund will work tirelessly to help defeat Members who support this legislation and make sure their constituents know exactly how they voted .
We will actively seek out true pro-life candidates to oppose Members who vote ‘ yes ’ on this bill , whether it be in general or primary elections .
For these Members , it will be a quick downhill slide to defeat in November . ”
“ The executive order on abortion funding does absolutely nothing to fix the problems presented by the health care reform bill that the House will vote on this evening .
The very idea should offend all pro-life Members of Congress .
An executive order can be rescinded at any time at the President ’s whim , and the courts could and have a history of trumping executive orders .
Most importantly , pro-abortion Representatives have admitted the executive order is meaningless . ”
Readers and tweeters keep asking , how much longer ?
When will there be votes ?
Our congressional experts up here suspect a final round around 10:30 p.m .
And do n’t forget , rounds of news conferences , statements and remarks by President Obama after that .
Earlier , a reader asked me directly , what happens after the House votes ?
If the Democrats succeed , then the Senate has to take up the reconciliation bill passed by the House .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , Democrat of Nevada , assured House Democrats on Saturday that he could muster a majority vote on reconciliation .
Representative Tom Price , a doctor and Republican from Georgia , says this health care legislation would violate patients ’ trust .
“ This is a sad day , ” Mr. Price says .
Those opposed to the bill ?
“ We trust patients and families . ”
Those opposed ?
“ They trust government . ”
In arguing that a no vote would be bipartisan and the right thing to do , Mr. Price says if the bill becomes law : “ We lose our morality .
We lose our freedom . ”
An Illinois Republican , Peter Roskam , highlights new estimates by a company in his home state , Caterpillar , that the health care legislation would cost it $ 100 million in part because it would lose subsidies received for retirees ’ drugs .
Caterpillar wrote a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week about the costs it estimates would be imposed if passage occurs .
Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz , Democrat of Florida , says she ’s speaking , in part , as one of 2 - 1 / 2 million breast cancer survivors , some of whom would be denied treatments for pre-existing conditions , and urges passage of the bill .
“ The nightmare ends tonight , ” she says .
The Center for Reproductive Rights has chimed in , too , expressing its disappointment with the deal reached between President Obama and anti-abortion Democrats .
Nancy Northup , president of the organization , issued this statement :
The president ’s decision to issue an executive order designed to assuage Representative Stupak and his cohorts is a betrayal of millions of women across this country and of his campaign promises .
The order lends credibility to an already impossibly flawed policy that punishes and discriminates against poor women by denying them the full range of reproductive health services and their constitutional right .
Current policy known as the Hyde Amendment was denounced by President Obama himself as a presidential candidate .
“ Current law withholds funding for abortion under Medicaid and other federal programs even though the service is one of the most common procedures for American women .
For millions of women , these federal programs are their sole means of getting health services , including reproductive healthcare .
Abortion is the only medically necessary health service excluded from this coverage .
Failure to provide insurance coverage for a medical procedure that only women need is discrimination .
“ It is unacceptable that a pro-choice President has put his imprimatur on a highly restrictive and unjust anti-choice measure .
Early on in this debate a good faith compromise supported by pro-choice groups was tossed out to appease Representative Stupak and his cohorts .
It is tragic that , under a pro-choice administration and a Democratic majority in Congress , harmful anti-choice policy will be the price American women will pay for health care reform . ”
To offer a little context about the latest on health care and veterans , earlier today , the head of the Veterans for Foreign Wars issued a statement urging lawmakers to vote against the bill .
Mr. Thomas J. Tradewell , a Vietnam veteran , said :
“ The president and the Democratic leadership are betraying America ’s veterans .
“ And what makes matters worse is the leadership and the president knows the bill is flawed , yet they are pushing for passage today like it ’s a do - or - die situation .
This nation deserves the best from their elected officials , and the rush to pass legislation of this magnitude is not it . ”
In response , General Eric Shinseki , the head of the Veterans Affairs Administration , said : “ Fears that Veterans health care and TriCare will be undermined by the health reform legislation are unfounded .
I am confident that the legislation being voted on today will provide the protections afforded our nation ’s Veterans and the health care they have earned through their service .
The president and I stand firm in our commitment to those who serve and have served in our armed forces .
We pledge to continue to provide the men and women in uniform and our Veterans the high quality health care they have earned .
President Obama has strongly supported Veterans and their needs , specifically health care needs , on every major issue for these past 14 months – advance appropriations , new GI Bill implementation , new Agent Orange presumptions for three additional diseases , new Gulf War Illness presumptions for nine additional diseases , and a 16 % budget increase in 2010 for the Department of Veterans Affairs , that is the largest in over 30 years , and which has been followed by a 2011 VA budget request that increases that record budget by an additional 7.6 % .
To give our Veterans further assurance that health reform legislation will not affect their health care systems , the Chairmen of five House committees , including Veterans Affairs Chairman Bob Filner and Armed Services Chairman Ike Skelton , have just issued a joint letter reaffirming that the health reform legislation as written would protect those receiving care through all Tricare and Department of Veterans Affairs programs .
Representative Lloyd Doggett , Democrat of Texas , just reduced passage of health care to four words for Americans : “ You ’ve got health care . ”
Technically , given there ’s a contraction in there , we guess it ’s still four .
He castigates Republicans for not finding anything likable .
“ For Republicans , it ’s too short or it ’s too long .
It ’s too thick or it ’s too thin …
It ’s never just right ”
Representative Charles Rangel , whose ethics inquiries have contributed to some problems for Democrats this election cycle , remarks from the floor that one of the lowest points in life for him recently was when he had to step down from his position as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee .
Travel notes from Senator Charles Grassley , the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee who ultimately balked at the Finance bill put forward in his chamber .
Tonight , Senator Grassley tweets : “ Flying bk DC Sun aftrnoon instead of Mon morn to get ahead of curve on Health / Stupak move “ shocked ” me I thought his stance wld hv kild bill . ”
In case you ’re not accustomed to Mr. Grassley ’s tweets or abbreviations ( as well as some of ours in that 140 - character limit ) , the Iowa senator is indicating that he ’s shocked that Mr. Stupak would decide to vote for the health - care bill .
Mr. Grassley anticipated that Mr. Stupak ’s stance against abortion would ’ve killed the bill .
Of course , maybe you figured out the shorter version .
Representative Joe Barton , a Republican , asks that the House start over again on health care .
“ This bill will not last , ” Mr. Barton says .
“ It reignites the abortion debate . ”
And he added , he believes that if it ’s still in force in 2014 when employer provisions take effect , millions could lose their insurance .
Cecile Richards , president of Planned Parenthood , has also issued a statement on the president ’s decision to sign an executive order ( designed to explicitly prohibit using federal funds for abortions ) .
We regret that a pro-choice president of a pro-choice nation was forced to sign an Executive Order that further codifies the proposed anti-choice language in the health care reform bill , originally proposed by Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska .
What the president ’s executive order did not do is include the complete and total ban on private health insurance coverage for abortion that Congressman Bart Stupak ( D–MI ) had insisted upon .
So while we regret that this proposed Executive Order has given the imprimatur of the president to Senator Nelson ’s language , we are grateful that it does not include the Stupak abortion ban . “
Representative John Shadegg , Republican of Arizona , and a longtime champion of allowing health insurance to be sold across state lines , said Democrats were making a grave mistake .
“ This bill will destroy freedom and do damage to the very fabric of our society , ” he said in a floor speech .
David M. Herszenhorn
Representative Edward J. Markey , Democrat of Massachusetts , said : “ On health care , the Democratic party is the party of hope , and the Republican party is the party of Nope . ”
He added , “ The G.O.P. used to stand for the Grand Old Party .
Now it stands for grandstand , oppose and postpone . ”

Representative John Dingell , Democrat of Michigan , is now speaking .
His father introduced universal health care legislation dating back decades .
And Mr. Dingell , who is in his 80s now , lent a huge gavel used when he presided over the House and it passed Medicare , to Speaker Nancy Pelosi for today ’s events .
Ms. Pelosi was carrying it around here earlier .
Representative Nathan Deal , Republican of Georgia , first announced he was resigning from Congress to run fulltime for governor in his state .
But then he postponed his retirement / resignation for this very day — so that he could vote no against the health care bill .
Tonight , as he just indicated , he ’ll get his chance .
Mr. Hoyer begins recognizing “ little punk staffers , ” a reference to a derisive character made by Representative John Boehner , the minority last week , when he urged bankers not to be pushed around by staff members on the Hill dealing with financial legislation .
Tonight , Mr. Hoyer says , these are staff members who also represent those who worked for the Republicans ’ Medicare drug benefit .
And then lists a number of Capitol staff .
Mr. Hoyer continues speaking , recalling how one Republican said health care would become President Obama ’s Waterloo .
( It was Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina , but Mr. Hoyer did not name him . )
Rather , Mr. Hoyer says , if the bill is defeated , the Waterloo would be for the people who need health care .
It “ would be a defeat for them and for our country for a healthier America is a stronger America , ” he says .
Representative Steny Hoyer , the Democratic majority leader of the House , opens up the full debate on health care legislation by drawing comparisons between the march across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma , Ala. decades ago , led by the Rev. Martin Luther Kr. Jr. , and today ’s daylong debate .
“ Today , March 21 , 2010 , we will cross another bridge , ” Mr. Hoyer said .
“ It is not a physical bridge but it is a bridge that too many Americans find they cannot cross . ”
Mr. Hoyer then quotes the words of many past presidents , including George Bush , Gerald Ford , Richard M. Nixon , who all talked about the need for affordable health care .
The House is now moving toward full debate for final passage — still hours to go here , people .
But they ’ve passed the rules for debate , 224-206 .
The president of the National Organization for Women posted this statement after Mr. Obama negotiated an executive order to help appease anti-abortion Democrats so that they would vote for health care .
Terry O’Neill , the N.O.W. president , said :
The National Organization for Women is incensed that President Barack Obama agreed today to issue an executive order designed to appease a handful of anti-choice Democrats who have held up health care reform in an effort to restrict women ’s access to abortion .
Through this order , the president has announced he will lend the weight of his office and the entire executive branch to the anti-abortion measures included in the Senate bill , which the House is now prepared to pass .
President Obama campaigned as a pro-choice president , but his actions today suggest that his commitment to reproductive health care is shaky at best .
Contrary to language in the draft of the executive order and repeated assertions in the news , the Hyde Amendment is not settled law — it is an illegitimate tack - on to an annual must - pass appropriations bill .
NOW has a longstanding objection to Hyde and , in fact , was looking forward to working with this president and Congress to bring an end to these restrictions .
We see now that we have our work cut out for us far beyond what we ever anticipated .
The message we have received today is that it is acceptable to negotiate health care on the backs of women , and we could n’t disagree more .
Representative Nita Lowey , Democrat of New York , issued this statement a little while ago , reflecting the rather torn views some abortion - rights lawmakers had toward their opponents on this issue .
Ms. Lowey ’s statement :
“ As a lifelong advocate for freedom of choice and affordable health care for all Americans , I find it outrageous that health insurance reform was held hostage in an effort to restrict women ’s reproductive rights .
“ The underlying health insurance reform bill contains objectionable language requiring insured women to write a check for general health insurance and a separate check for “ abortion rider , ” going far beyond current and continued policy preventing federal funding for abortion services .
“ Although the final bill language is disappointing , the bottom line is millions more American women will receive basic care to stay healthy and prevent unintended pregnancies . ”
The House is moving forward with procedural votes toward debate .
We ’re expecting these hurdles will be cleared , and lengthy debate will follow .
With Mr. Kanjorski in the yes column , ( see below ) , we ’re estimating that the Democrats will have two more votes than the 216 required for passage of the health care bill later tonight .
Our graphic shows just four remaining undecided Democrats .
Representative Paul E. Kanjorski , Democrat from northeastern Pennsylvania has announced that he will vote for the health care bill .
Mr. Kanjorski had remained one of the last undecided .
Here ’s his statement :
Today I will vote for legislation designed to improve the affordability and accessibility of health care .
Americans already spend more on health care than the people of any other nation .
If we take no action , health care costs are expected to double over the next ten years , just as they have over the last ten years .
It is not the bill I would have written if it were up to me alone , but it is the best we can do at this time .
“ This was one of the most difficult votes I have ever cast , primarily because there is a great deal of confusion about what this bill will do .
Senior citizens do not have to worry about losing any benefits because of this bill .
In fact , their coverage for prescription drug costs and preventative care will improve .
No federal funding will be used to fund abortion .
The bill does not empower the federal government to take over health care .
If people are happy with the insurance they have , nothing needs to change .
“ However , this bill allows the American people to choose the health insurance plan that best fits individual and family needs by creating a marketplace of insurance plans .
For too long , private insurance companies have monopolized how health insurance operates .
This bill attempts to rein in those private insurers by prohibiting their most egregious abuses : denying coverage for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions , imposing a lifetime cap on medical care , and limiting the ability of individuals to change jobs without the fear of losing insurance coverage .
It will also enable young adults to stay on their parents ’ insurance until age 26 .
“ I thank the many Northeastern Pennsylvanians who have shared their thoughts with me on this important legislation over the past few months .
When you are sick , the last thing you should have to worry about is how to pay the bills .
Insurance is supposed to relieve this worry , but instead the current system has made that worry worse .
Today , we are working to reverse this course . ”
F.Y.I. , The Times is soliciting your views via Twitter at #nythcr .
Of course , the general hashtag for health care today is #hcr .
( There are many others that include differing sides of this debate , too . )
I ’ve also been putting out some of the more newsy blog updates via @katephillips .
Readers have been wondering — what to expect tonight as we head into the evening hours up here on Capitol Hill .
Our best guess , according to my colleagues who are veterans of late - night legislating , is that the final vote may come about 9 p.m. or later .
Now , that ’s tentative .
Right now , the House still has procedural votes , and debate still on the Senate bill and the reconciliation proposal .
Representative Marion Berry , one of the last remaining members of Congress whose vote had not been announced , issued a statement saying he would vote against the health care legislation .
Mr. Berry , who is anti-abortion , said he was not persuaded by the executive order proposed by the White House to help lock in more votes .
Here ’s his statement :
I appreciate and am humbled by the thousands of Arkansans who have called , written , e-mailed , and met with me over the last year to express their concerns about health care in this country .
While there seems to me a broad agreement that our current health care system is unsustainable in cost and coverage , I cannot endorse this bill as it is currently written . ”
“ Throughout this debate , I have stood by my conviction that the Senate health care reform bill does not adequately address the issue of federal funds being used to pay for abortions .
Despite the recently announced Executive Order addressing this issue , I remain concerned that this legislation does not go far enough to satisfy my concerns .
As a pro-life member of Congress , I believe that abortion is fundamentally wrong , and taxpayer money should not be allowed to support it . ”
“ Beyond the issue of abortion , there were several concerns in the bill that I fought for and feel were not addressed properly .
There are common sense ideas that would lower costs throughout the system , such as having the government use its bargaining power to negotiate prescription drug prices .
Some of my other ideas would increase quality and fairness in our health care provider network by increasing Medicare reimbursement rates for rural providers , who currently are compensated far less than their counterparts in urban areas .
This unfair system is forcing our doctors to stop caring for Medicare patients or to leave rural areas completely . ”
“ I believe in health care reform , I just want it done right .
I believe true reform would reduce the deficit and pay for itself from savings from our current system , not from putting more pressure on our hospitals and other providers .
As I have said before , if you are willing to say what you are against , you need to be able to say what you are for too .
That ’s why I introduced my own health care reform bill , H.R. 4813 . ”
“ Although I will vote against this bill , I do hope this is the start of a new path in reforming what many agree is a broken system .
It is our duty in Congress to try to work together and keep citizens informed on this issue and other legislation , so that our actions in Washington may successfully reflect the will of the people .
My decision is dictated by my conscience and my solemn obligation to follow the voices of my constituents in the First Congressional District of Arkansas , who have honored me with the opportunity to serve them for 14 years . ”
A lot of Republicans today have argued that this health - care bill smacks of European socialism , or a European “ nanny - state ” government .
Representative Jeff Fortenberry , Republican of Nebraska , discloses that a little boy the other day asked him , “ if the government gets so bad , which country should we move to ? ”
Now , Mr. Fortenberry did n’t reveal whether he offered a particular country to escape to .
Rather , he says he told the boy “ America is still a good country , we just have to make it better . ”
On the other side , Representative G.K. Butterfield , Democrat of North Carolina , argues that his district is in dire need of the health care bill , with 100,000 uninsured .
Historians , he says , will some day write that the passage of this bill took America to a higher level , to a higher place … ”
The White House says President Obama will speak from the East Room once the health care action tonight is over .
Will that be midnight or later ?
Mr. Stupak rejected Mr. Boehner ’s contention that the executive order would not prohibit federal financing of abortions .
The Michigan Democrat , a Catholic , also noted that the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops still wanted statutory language barring the use of federal money for abortions .
“ I know it ’s Lent , ” he said , but added that even so the bishops could not supply the 60 votes needed in the Senate to approve such a law .
“ This has the full force of law , ” he said of the executive order .
David M. Herszenhorn
Minority Leader John Boehner , of Ohio , issued this statement about the executive order President Obama has said he will sign once health care legislation is passed :
The law of the land trumps any Executive Order , which can be reversed or altered at the stroke of a pen by this or any subsequent President without any congressional approval or notice .
Moreover , while an Executive Order can direct members of the executive branch , it cannot direct the private sector .
Because of Roe v.
Wade , courts have interpreted the decision as a statutory mandate that the government must provide federal funding for elective abortion in through federal programs .
In other words , no Executive Order or regulation can override a statutory mandate unless Congress passes a law that prohibits federal funding from being used in this manner .
Legal experts at the US Catholic Conference of Bishops , National Right to Life Committee , Americans United for Life , and Family Research Council have confirmed this view that if the Senate bill is signed into law , it is a statutory mandate for the new health plans to include federal funding of elective abortion .
The need for an Executive Order is evidence that this is true , and Congressional Democrats know it .
Make no mistake , a ‘ yes ’ vote on the Democrats ’ health care bill is a vote for taxpayer - funded abortions .
Other legal experts have contended that the language is the Senate bill was sufficient to prohibit the use of federal funds for abortions , but anti-abortion Democrats wanted even more explicit language — thus the new executive order .
Representative Nick Rahall , Democrat of West Virginia , said , “ It ’s great day for America .
It ’s a great day for the unborn and it ’s a great day for the uninsured . ”
Representative Alan B. Mollohan of West Virginia also joined the bloc of anti-abortion Democrats .

We ’re not going to say it ’s over until it ’s over , but Mr. Stupak is suggesting that with his band of satisfied anti-abortion Democrats declaring they ’ll vote in favor of the legislation , the Democrats are well past the 216 they need .
From colleague David M. Herszenhorn , Mr. Stupak : “ We ’re well past 216 , yes . ”
But David adds :
A number of groups that oppose abortion rights said that an executive order was insufficient in part because of a lack of trust in the Obama administration .
Here ’s the text of the planned order released by the White House today that appeared to mollify anti-abortion Democrats who had held out on the overall health - care bill .
Representatives Steve Driehaus , Kathy Dahlkemper , Marcy Kaptur and others join Mr. Stupak at the news conference to announce that the president ’s proposed executive order will allow them to vote for the health care legislation .
Ms. Dahlkemper notes that she considers the bill now a “ full life ” or “ whole life ” piece of legislation .
The Michigan Democrat , in citing the president ’s executive order further outlining prohibitions against the use of federal funds for abortion , announces that he will vote for the legislation .
“ The real victory here or the real winners here are the American people , ” Mr. Stupak concludes , noting that 31 million people would receive health care coverage .
On the president ’s executive order , colleague Sheryl Stolberg notes : “ The White House , sounding a note of confidence about the passage of the health care bill , has just announced that after its passage , Mr. Obama will sign an executive order that will reaffirm the measure ’s ‘ consistency with longstanding restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion . ' ”
In an effort to shore up votes among anti-abortion Democrats , the White House and Democrats have been negotiating the language of an executive order that President Obama would sign to assure those representatives and others that federal funds would not be used for abortion .
Dan Pfeiffer , communications director for the president , wrote this in releasing the order :
While the legislation as written maintains current law , the executive order provides additional safeguards to ensure that the status quo is upheld and enforced , and that the health care legislation ’s restrictions against the public funding of abortions cannot be circumvented .
The President has said from the start that this health insurance reform should not be the forum to upset longstanding precedent .
The health care legislation and this executive order are consistent with this principle .
The President is grateful for the tireless efforts of leaders on both sides of this issue to craft a consensus approach that allows the bill to move forward .
We ’ll have a link to the lengthy text momentarily .
And we ’re still waiting for Representative Bart Stupak to appear publicly to talk about his decision on the vote .
Now we ’re waiting for Representative Bart Stupak , who reportedly will be talking about 4 p.m .
He ’s been weighing to vote yes or no , mainly based on language related to abortion and federal funds .
The House will now vote for 15 minutes on a point of order .
The mood inside the House chamber was tense as lawmakers headed toward climactic health care votes on Sunday , but the atmosphere outside the Capitol was downright venomous .
As the House engaged in initial parliamentary maneuvering , hundreds of anti-reform protesters gathered on the south side of the Capitol between the building and the House office buildings across Independence Avenue , chanting and jeering Democrats and applauding House Republicans who egged them on .
“ Nancy Pelosi , you will burn in hell for this , ” one woman intoned repeatedly through a bullhorn as members of the crowd rang bells , blew a bugle , waved a varied assortment of flags and chanted “ Kill the bill . ”
Several Republicans appeared on a second - floor balcony of the Capitol above the crowd to give the protesters the thumbs up and display their own “ Kill the Bill ” signs .
The Republicans even borrowed a “ Do n’t Tread on Me ” flag from the group to wave above the crowd before returning it .
One protester was ejected from the House chamber for shouting against the health legislation , but he was also reportedly applauded by Republicans , a gesture that was condemned by Democrats who said Republicans were encouraging banned disruptions .
After racial slurs and other derogatory terms were hurled at Democrats by protesters on Saturday , numerous Democrats walked en masse from the House office buildings to the Capitol , running a gantlet of jeering and booing demonstrators .
One was heard calling Representative Barney Frank , the openly gay Democrat from Massachusetts , a slur generally uttered against gays .
“ It is almost like the Salem witch trials , ” Mr. Frank said .
“ The health bill has become their witch .
It is a supernatural force and you get hysteria .
There is an anger obviously that goes beyond anything connected to the bill . ”
Mr. Frank said he thinks the name - calling will backfire .
“ I do n’t think this is the way you win over the American people , ” he said .
“ I think the average American says ‘ No , I do n’t like this anger , this bigotry . ”
Carl Hulse
Representative Earl Pomeroy , Democrat of North Dakota , and one of the final holdouts , announced his support for the health care legislation in a joint statement with his state ’s two senators , Kent Conrad and Byron L. Dorgan .
“ We have concluded that doing nothing is not an option , ” the North Dakotans said .
“ We do n’t think this bill is the silver bullet to solve every problem facing health care in the United States .
But we have worked hard to make sure it is good for North Dakota . ”
David M. Herszenhorn
Representative Dale Kildee , who broke ranks with other anti-abortion Democrats by announcing earlier that he believed the language in the Senate bill would indeed prohibit federal financing of abortions , says from the House floor that he has always been “ pro-life , ” and spent six years in a Catholic seminary .
Noting that he will turn 81 this September , he said he had consulted his priest while deciding how to vote .
“ I am not going to jeopardize my eternal salvation , ” said Mr. Kildee , of Michigan .
But added that he believed the bills conformed to federal law outlawing funds for the procedure .
Representative Darrell Issa , Republican of California , has raised what ’s known as a point of order over the number of earmarks in the bill .
These are items roundly criticized in the Senate bill , like what ’s been called the “ Louisiana Purchase , ” which was added to help with Medicaid costs in the wake of post - Katrina rebuilding or the “ Cornhusker kickback ” to help with Medicaid costs in Nebraska , the state of Senator Ben Nelson , a conservative Democrat .
Representative Louise Slaughter , Democratic chairwoman of the House Rules Committee , tells Mr. Issa : “ The final bill will not have state - specific provisions . ”
But Mr. Issa counters that even if some of the provisions are not designed for single states , but for many states , “ a bribe for one becomes a bribe for many . ”
Representative Paul Ryan , Republican of Wisconsin , has been denouncing the bill as a fiscal nightmare .
“ This is not democracy , ” he said .
“ This is not democracy . ” Mr. Ryan , like many other House members today , also detailed his mother - in - law ’s battle with ovarian cancer , asserting that were she a British citizen , she would n’t be able to receive the drug that she ’s taking to fight her illness .
( F.Y.I. , the House is now voting on a procedural point of order that had been raised by Mr. Ryan . )
Representative Patrick Kennedy just took the floor , reminding House members that his father , the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy , fought for overhauling health care his entire life .
In quoting from something the elder said about his brother John F. Kennedy during the debates over the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , this younger Mr. Kennedy said the parallels between the inequalities over civil rights and health care disparities were clear .
Mr. Kennedy called health care “ a civil right ” as well as a moral issue .
Despite swirling rumors to the contrary , Representative Bart Stupak , Democrat of Michigan and a leader of anti-abortion Democrats in the House , is still a “ no ” vote on the health care legislation , according to his spokeswoman , Michelle Begnoche .
Mr. Stupak told reporters on Sunday that he believes a deal on the abortion issue is imminent , which would mean he would potentially vote in favor of the bill .
But senior House Democratic aides and White House officials confirmed that a deal has not yet been clinched with the abortion opponents .
“ There is not yet a deal , and Congressman Stupak is still a NO vote right now , ” Ms. Begnoche said in an e-mail at 1:48 p.m. — David M. Herszenhorn
In announcing that he would oppose the health care legislation , Representative John Tanner , Democrat of Tennessee , offered a signal that Democrats were close to securing the votes needed to pass the bill .
Come again ?
Yup .
Sometimes up is down in Congress , and sometimes down is up .
Mr. Tanner is retiring at the end of this year after completing his 11th term in Congress .
Politically , he cannot be punished for voting in favor of the bill .
And he is a close friend of the Democratic majority leader , Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland .
If House Democratic leaders are comfortable letting Mr. Tanner publicly announce his opposition , it is the clearest sign yet of their mounting confidence that they will have the 216 votes needed to pass the bill .
Still , they are not there yet .
Senior Democrats and White House officials continued to negotiate with a handful of Democrats who oppose abortion rights over an executive order that would clarify abortion policy .
An announcement of that deal would likely push Democrats over the top .
— David M. Herszenhorn
Using the official White House blog , Macon Phillips denied an assertion made by Karl Rove , the former Bush adviser , on television that the administration was sending out unsolicited e-mail messages to federal employees urging support for health care reform .
Mr. Phillips , the administration ’s new media guru , wrote :
Let ’s be clear — and done — with this incorrect claim : the White House only sends mass messages to email addresses submitted through email signup forms on WhiteHouse.gov .
And every message we send has a clear unsubscribe link at the footer to stop receiving messages at any time .
While some people unsubscribe from the White House ’s email program , many more have signed up .
Since inauguration , the number of people who have opted - in for email updates has steadily grown , making this an increasingly popular way for anyone to stay current and informed about what ’s happening with President Obama and the White House .
Anyone can sign up for them here .
Just today a fierce critic of health reform , Karl Rove , went a step further on ABC ’s “ This Week ” by making the absurd and unfounded claim that the White House “ sent out unsolicited e-mails to federal employees asking them to contact their legislators about this bill . ”
This is simply not true and unless Mr. Rove can point to a White House email making this request of anyone , federal employee or otherwise , he should correct this dangerous and inaccurate assertion .
Representative John Tanner , one of the Blue Dog Democrats , has just announced that he cannot support the health - care legislation as it stands .
Here ’s his statement :
Aside from national defense , no matter is more important to the future of our country than her financial integrity .
Those who have followed my voting record throughout my Congressional service know how seriously I take such responsibility .
The unwillingness among those on the other side of the aisle to work in good faith to acknowledge and address the damage done by dangerous economic policy of the early years of this century is regrettable .
There is no question our health care system needs reform .
Since the outset of this national dialogue , I have talked with many West and Middle Tennesseans about how we can identify and fix what is broken within our system .
Chief among these goals is the long - term reduction in health care costs for families , employers and the government .
The reconciliation bill the House is being asked to consider is a tribute to the legislative process , because it has improved the Senate bill and the House bill .
For these improvements , I commend the White House and House leaders for bringing this bill toward the center , where the vast majority of Americans find themselves aligned ideologically .
After thorough and careful review of the legislation , I am unconvinced that the long - term trend of rising health care costs is adequately addressed and am therefore unable to support the legislation . ”
Throughout this debate , we ’ll be hearing a lot of tough language and perhaps a little hyperbole as some talk about the death of liberty .
At the beginning of the House session this afternoon , Representative Marsha Blackburn , a Republican , warned that if the health bill passes , lawmakers will burden their children and their grandchildren with their greed .
“ Freedom dies a little bit today , ” she said .
“ Unfortunately , some are celebrating . ”
Representative Bart Stupak , the Democrat from Michigan who has been leading a bloc of anti-abortion holdouts on the Democrats ’ bill , is still saying he ’s a “ no ” vote , according to CNN .
Some of the abortion opponents have been negotiating for an executive order to be issued by the president that would explicitly ban any federal funds for abortion .
But at this stage in the voting , the upshot of those talks has yet to be revealed .
In an interview on CBS ’s “ Face the Nation , ” Representative James Clyburn , the Democratic whip , said of the abortion holdouts and the executive order : “ I do n’t think it ’s quite settled yet , but I think it will be by late afternoon .
Bart Stupak and I spent a lot of time together last evening .
I ’ve seen him on one of the networks this morning saying that we are very , very close .
And I think that we ’ll be there by the time that we vote .
And I fully expect that we ’ll get the votes that are necessary . ”
Representative Brian Baird , Democrat of Washington , has announced he will support the legislation , bringing the Democrats ever closer to the 216 votes they need to pass the bill .
Mr. Baird , who is retiring after this year , had said the legislation did not go far enough in revamping the existing health care system .
But in a long statement Sunday , he said he would back the bill .
Here ’s a portion of it :
There is no question in my mind that our current health care system cannot be sustained and must be improved .
Because of my background as a health care professional , working for more than twenty years before entering Congress , having focused extensively on health care during my time in Congress , as a parent of two young children , and as someone who has listened to countless constituents and groups from across the professional , patient and political spectrum , there is no other issue before Congress that has received as much of my personal attention and effort .
Providing health care is not a political issue for me , it was my chosen profession , it is something I feel deeply about , and it is a service to which I have dedicated much of my life .
Recognizing the urgent need for reform , I have tried as hard as I possibly can to evaluate the merits of the proposals before us .
I have read the entire House and Senate bills , plus the reconciliation legislation .
I have studied the Congressional Budget Office analyses of both bills plus the reconciliation package .
I have read reports by the Kaiser Family Foundation , the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , and numerous others .
At my specific request , the Democratic caucus has held an unprecedented number of meetings with policy and legislative experts to go over in detail the text of the legislation and alternatives .
Beyond studying the legislation put forward by the Democrats in Congress , I have also made a sincere and earnest effort to read and evaluate criticism of that legislation and consider alternative proposals , including proposals from members of both major political parties and independent groups .
I also put forward my own proposal for comprehensive health care reform .
The legislation before Congress today represents the results of more than a year of intense public debate .
After months of discussion and the passage of a bill in the House last November , the Senate then engaged in extensive deliberations and debate , including consideration of numerous amendments .
Since passage of the Senate bill , further modifications have been presented and the final draft plus all but nine pages of amendments was available to Congress and to the public online for 72 hours before the vote .
This deliberation time is something I have long championed and insisted upon and I am heartened that the leadership followed this responsible and reasonable approach .
The challenge before us now is this : the status quo can not be sustained .
It will continue to allow health care costs to rise more rapidly than people can afford , it will leave insured Americans facing the loss of insurance if they get sick or lose their jobs , it will leave countless small businesses unable to afford insurance for their workers , it will leave fifty million Americans without health insurance , and it will lead to the bankruptcy of the nation as health care entitlement costs continue to grow .
— David M. Herszenhorn
Representative Allyson Y. Schwartz , Democrat of Pennsylvania , is up first to speak for Democrats on the day of a historic vote on health care legislation .
“ Today we will act on a uniquely American solution to American health care reform , ” she said .
The House is in order and both sides are girding for a galactic floor fight as Democrats continue to work to lock in the final votes .
The White House is still negotiating the terms of an executive order that would clarify abortion policy in an effort to win over a handful of Democrats who worry that the legislation does not contain sufficient restrictions on the use of federal funds for insurance coverage of abortions .
The language in the bill , negotiated in the Senate , seeks to do just that .
And many abortion opponents say they are satisfied with the Senate language .
But some House Democrats have held out , noting that the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops is refusing to support the legislation .
Up at the Capitol Building this afternoon , the scene outside is a bit noisy with protesters on both sides of the health care issue shouting their views .
“ Kill the Bill ! ” by opponents and “ Health Care Now ! ” by proponents can be heard even from inside the building .
The House of Representatives is preparing to begin a series of actions that will lead to a final vote sometime this evening on the health care legislation .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi just gaveled the chamber into session .
We ’ll be live blogging along the way , and following developments on Twitter using the #hcr hashtag .
Former Gov. Brendan
Byrne has often been sucker - punched in politics , but today it happened on the streets of London .
The 85 - year - old elder statesman of New Jersey , on vacation in Britain with his wife , Ruthi , had just emerged from Waterloo Station when an assailant rushed up and took a swing at the governor .
" Some nut came out of the blue and punched me in the jaw , and was immediately arrested , " Byrne said by phone from his hotel room .
An ambulance arrived and treated the former governor , but he refused to go to a hospital .
" I think I ’m alright .
I have some cuts on my face , " Byrne said .
" I never fell down , like when I fought Muhammad Ali . "
His recollection fighting the world heavyweight boxing champion was not a sign of confusion after the sudden blow to his face .
Byrne did in fact face Muhammad Ali in an exhibition bout at the Jersey City armory in June 1979 .
The charity event , with then - Jersey City Mayor Thomas Smith , had been organized to raise money for the Jersey City Medical Center .
According to accounts at the time , Byrne insisted on the first match , fearing Smith might antagonize Ali with a real punch and come after him with vengeance .
In actuality , it was all staged .
" He told me to throw a right .
Then he went down , " Byrne recounted today .
This time , though , the violence was real .
Byrne and his wife were headed to an afternoon performance of The Power of Yes at the National Theater on South Bank in London , a short walk from Waterloo Station , when the governor was hit without warning .
Ruthi Byrne said it was raining and they were trying to get oriented as they emerged from the Underground .
" It all happened so quickly you had no time to think , " she said .
" It was just startling .
Scary . "
In seconds , a transit worker knocked the man down and police were called .
Byrne and his wife spent the next two hours at the police station , missing the play , but the governor felt well enough to go out to dinner at the landmark Simpsons - in - the - Strand restaurant .
Byrne brushed off the episode .
" I ’m surviving , " he said .
" Have a headache and a sore face .
Sore lips . "
He and his wife expect to return to New Jersey on Saturday as planned .

If you do n’t know who Michael Jackson is .. you must be living under a rock .

Danny Gatton ( September 4 , 1945 – 4 October 1994 ) was a talented and enigmatic American guitarist who committed suicide at his Maryland home in 1994 while still relatively unknown to the public .
Gatton was born in Washington , DC on September 4 , 1945 .
His father , Daniel W. Gatton Sr. , was a former rhythm guitarist known for his unique percussive style , who left his musical career to raise his family in a more stable profession .
The younger Gatton grew up to share his father 's passion for the instrument .

Has one of music 's biggest mysteries finally been solved ?
The identity of the man who walked into the party like he was walking on to a yacht in Carly Simon 's 1972 hit You 're So Vain has long been speculated to be Warren Beatty , Mick Jagger , Kris Kristofferson or Cat Stevens .
But we 've never known for sure .
Now , after guarding the secret for 38 years , the singer is whispering the first name of the man - " David " - about two and a half minutes into a new version of the song , if you listen to it backwards .
Simon , 64 , confirmed in an interview with Uncut magazine that the whisper alluded to her former lover .
" I 'm just going to tell you this , " she said .
" The answer is on the new version of You 're So Vain .
There 's a little whisper — and it's the answer to the puzzle . "
The New York Post notes that David Cassidy and David Bowie have already been guessed - and dismissed .
Britain 's
The Sun today says it 's David Geffen , who was the head of Carly 's record label back in the day .
UPDATE : No matter what you may hear , Showbiz 411's Roger Friedman is still convinced it is Warren Beatty .
You can listen to the whisper here .

This Saturday , February 20th at 11 PM EST , I am honored to be the special guest on a new e-radio show called ParaTrinity Radio .
ParaTrinity Radio is a podcast / live broadcast with hosts Mike and LE that focuses on the religious aspects of paranormal .
It ’s a show that really appeals to the ghosthead / paranormal research crowd as it greatly focuses on information and guests that have experience with haunting , “ demonology ” , and ghosts .
My goal will be to bring a logical , reasonable , and scientifically sound view to the debate regarding god and the paranormal .
I intend to spend a portion of my air time talking about my past , as a young minister and exorcist ( something you will rarely hear or see me discuss ) .
I will also be giving my testimony ( or extimony ) of my transition from fervent Christian to atheist , something I think that can help those that are struggling with the reality of their own faith .
I really really hope that the skeptical crowd would be willing to show up for the live airing which has a chat room where you can interact with the hosts and I , ask questions , and interact with other listeners .
Not only do I know that the show hosts are respectful of our point of view , I know that they are genuinely interested in hearing what I have to say and in seeing the listeners interact as well .
I would love to see a large crowd show up , in fact I ’d like to make this their biggest show yet – this show has only been airing since the beginning of the year and is still gaining it ’s audience , I ’d also like for that crowd to have intelligent and kind discussions with those in the live chat .
The Show will air live at ASPRN Studio B beginning at 11 PM EST on Saturday , February 20th , 2010 !
I hope that some of the Reddit atheists and other readers of my blog will show up !

WASHINGTON —
The aftermath of President Obama ’s televised question - and - answer session with House Republicans last Friday suggested it was n’t much of a success for the GOP .
And the party has no intention of taking him up on a rematch , signaled Sen. John Cornyn ( R - TX ) .
“ We ’re always happy to hear from the president but I do n’t really feel any compelling need to do it [ on camera ] , ” Cornyn told Politico on Friday , when asked about the president ’s invitation to face off with Senate Republicans .
ADVERTISEMENT
Pressed on how he reached his conclusion , Cornyn said : “ For what purpose ?
Was it for photo op or is it serious ?
The president can invite Mitch McConnell , John Boehner or anybody he wants for a serious talk about issues . ”
Cornyn ’s stance contradicts the apparent willingness of some Republican lawmakers to face the president in a similar televised setting again .
“ I would hope that he would repeat such a thing on a periodic basis , ” said Rep. Jeb Hensarling ( R - TX ) .
“ I think it ’d be great , ” added Rep. Paul Ryan ( R - WI ) .
“ I ’ve always thought ‘ wow this is really a good tradition , ' ” remarked John Campbell .
“ [ If ] our presidents had to do that , that would really be a good thing . ”
The White House has repeatedly expressed interest in making it a regular feature .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I can see why he and his handlers would want to replicate that , ” Cornyn said .
“ I think we ’re more interested in serious public policy issues rather than providing another photo - opportunity for the president . ”
As the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , Cornyn is a leading election strategist , so his opposition sheds light on how the GOP views the implications of a rematch on future electoral battles .
The first sign of Republicans acknowledging defeat last week came just after the event , when MSNBC ’s Luke Russert reported that GOP aides privately said “ it was a mistake that we allowed the cameras to roll like that ” and “ we should not have done that . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
In another sign of GOP defeat , Fox News cut coverage of the event halfway through — considerably sooner than any other cable network , some of which broadcast the session in its entirety .
Democrats , by contrast , were very pleased with the results .
The Atlantic ‘s Marc Ambinder quoted “ a very influential Democrat ” as saying over e-mail , “ I do n’t know whether to laugh or cry that it took a [ email protected ] &$* year for Obama to step into the ring and start throwing some verbal blows . ”

“ Accepting the invitation to speak at the House GOP retreat may turn out to be the smartest decision the White House has made in months , ” Ambinder remarked of the session .

I like the books sitting upright just as well as I like them stacked .
Unless you 're implementing this idea because you really need more storage space for books , it 's a nice way to display a favorite item or two - even to use for no other purpose than to create " artwork " for an empty wall .
Probably does need a book or two no matter what its purpose , to maintain the " theme " inspired by the " book " shelf . ;-)
I have to comment again on Polymathism 's staggered zipper design , too ; it 's also a very attractive example of mixing it up a bit , by adding a single rather dramatic piece on the uppermost shelf .
I love where both of you went with the idea almost as much as I love the instructable !
As recently as the 1990s , China ’s and India ’s trade with four South Asian nations  Sri Lanka , Bangladesh , Nepal and Pakistan  was roughly equal .
But over the last decade , China has outpaced India in deepening ties .
For China , these countries provide both new markets and alternative routes to the Indian Ocean , which its ships now reach through a narrow channel between Indonesia and Malaysia known as the Strait of Malacca .
India , for its part , needs to improve economic ties with its neighbors to broaden its growth and to help foster peace in the region .
Some of the shift in trade toward China comes from heightened tensions between India and Pakistan , which has hampered trade between the two countries .
But China has also made inroads in nations that have been more friendly with India , including Sri Lanka , Bangladesh and Nepal .
Moreover , protectionist sentiments have marred India ’s relationships with its neighbors .
South Asia has a free - trade agreement , but countries that are part of the pact get few benefits , economists say , because India and its neighbors refuse to lower tariffs on many goods and services to protect their own businesses .
By contrast , the countries of Southeast Asia have minimal or no duties on most goods and services that they import from one another .
India has had some success in establishing closer ties with Sri Lanka , with which it has a strong bilateral trade agreement .
But China has become a partner of choice for big projects here like the Hambantota port .
China ’s Export - Import Bank is financing 85 percent of the cost of the $ 1 billion project , and China Harbour Engineering , which is part of a state - owned company , is building it .
Similar arrangements have been struck for an international airport being built nearby .
Sri Lankan officials want to turn Hambantota , which was devastated by the 2004 tsunami and is the home constituency for President Mahinda Rajapaksa , into the second - largest urban area in the country after the capital , Colombo .
( It is the ninth - biggest today . )
The government is also building a convention center , a government complex and a cricket stadium .
Sri Lanka needs foreign assistance to make those dreams a reality , because the government ’s finances are stretched by a large debt it accumulated in paying for a 25 - year civil war that ended in May .
In 2009 , the country borrowed $ 2.6 billion from the International Monetary Fund .

The Michigan Court of Appeals has ruled that homeless sex criminals do n’t have to comply with Michigan ’s Sex Offender Registry Act .
Many law enforcement officials — who often have to deal with sex offenders who claim they have no permanent residence — are n’t happy with the ruling .
In a published opinion released Tuesday that sets a statewide precedent , a three - judge panel unanimously upheld a trial court 's dismissal of charges against a homeless Ingham County man for failing to register , failing to comply with reporting duties and failing to pay registration fees .
The appeals judges ruled that it ’s impossible for a homeless person to comply with the law , which requires convicted sex criminals to report their “ domicile or residence ” to police .
The judges concluded that a homeless sex offender , by definition , has neither .
The judges ’ opinion bluntly urges state lawmakers to fix the law .
“ The Legislature is free , indeed , empowered , to ... include a provision addressing reporting requirements for the homeless , ” said the opinion signed by judges Jane M. Beckering , Jane E. Markey and Stephen L. Borrello .
“ The purpose of ( the Sex Offender Registry Act ) is wise , and the Legislature is urged to consider changes so that a homeless person who does not have a domicile or residence may readily comply with its requirements , ” the judges wrote .
The sooner that happens the better , in the opinion of Muskegon County Sheriff Dean Roesler .
“ I certainly hope the Legislature takes a good hard look at this ruling and revisits the Sex Offender Registry Act , ” Roesler said .
“ It ’s going to be an obstacle to properly investigating the cases of who has failed to register and who has failed to comply with the act .
“ The intent ( of the law ) was to keep track of persons who have committed the sex offenses that keep them on the sex offender list , ” Roesler said .
“ It kind of defeats the purpose . ”
Muskegon - area lawmakers , informed of the ruling Thursday by The Muskegon Chronicle , said they intend to take action .
“ They ’ve asked us to move forward on this , and we need to do it quickly , ” said state Rep. Mary Valentine , D - Norton Shores .
“ It sounds like a huge loophole that needs to be fixed , ” said state Sen. Gerald Van Woerkom , R - Norton Shores .
“ I would think that we would have to find a way to register these offenders . ”
The court case involves a Lansing defendant named Randall Lee Dowdy .
Dowdy , now 61 , was convicted in 1984 of five counts of first - degree criminal sexual conduct and one count of kidnapping , according to registry records .
Dowdy was rendered homeless in 2006 after operators of an Ingham County homeless shelter kicked him out after learning of his sex offender status .
He then failed to register his address because he had none while he bunked in abandoned buildings and public places .
The Ingham County prosecutor charged Dowdy with a felony and multiple misdemeanors .
A circuit - court trial judge dismissed the case .
The prosecutor appealed .
The case went all the way to the state Supreme Court , which failed to reach a consensus last year and remanded it to the appeals court for a decision .
A similar case is going on in Bay City .
Of the 750 registered sex offenders in the city of Grand Rapids , less than two dozen are legitimately homeless , officer John Wetzel said .
Prior to the appellate court decision , the registry reflected a homeless person ’s nearest address .
If an offender was living under a bridge and came to register , authorities put down the general area as a place of residence .
That at least gives them a starting point investigators need to locate an offender .
The decision , Wetzel said , is huge concern for law enforcement agencies .
“ The point of the registry is for tracking and this basically strips the law of its purpose , ” Wetzel said .
“ The Sex Offender Registry is an honor system because they have to come to us , but now the court has told them to go out and do whatever they want and claim they are homeless . ”
The court directed the problem back at the legislature to address the loophole .
Authorities hope the lawmakers will move quickly to fix the law , but in a budget year it is n’t clear how quickly that will be done .
Wetzel said police officers will write a warrant and force a sex offender to prove their lack of residency .
“ There ’s people out there that are trying to be honest , trying to do the right thing , ” he said .
“ They ’ve served their time and are trying to move forward .
“ But there ’s also people out there that are dishonest and some people will absolutely want to disappear , and they ’ll be able to fall off our radar . ”

Socialist books in the White House library ?
A blog provides photo evidence but only part of the story
By Stephen Lowman
In this era of blog wildfires , one fast - moving flame can be quenched before it scorches the facts : First Lady Michelle Obama did not stock the White House library with socialist books .
The controversy erupted after a conservative radio host and blogger from North Dakota took the White House tour on Wednesday and spotted two suspicious volumes on the shelves .
Rob Port , 29 , who hosts a political call - in show in his home state , was surprised to come across " The American Socialist Movement , 1897 - 1912 " and " The Socialist Party of America . "
He snapped a photo and posted it on sayanythingblog.com .
Under the headline : " Photo Evidence : Michelle Obama Keeps Socialist Books in the White House Library , " Port wrote that the White House tour guide said the library was stocked with books picked out by Michelle Obama .
" Being a bit of a bibliophile , " he wrote on the blog , " I started to peruse some of the books on the shelves ... and lookie , lookie what I found . "
Thus flame was ignited .
The blog post quickly attracted over a hundred comments and was linked on many other sites .
" Surely this means that every time President Obama is in the midst of important policy deliberations , he goes into the library , dusts off The American Socialist Movement , 1897 - 1912 , and uses it to help him figure out what the most socialist policy would be , " mocked New York 's Daily Intel blog .
Port , who was in Washington to cover the annual Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) , said in an interview it is " never fair to judge a book by its cover " and that you can't conclude Obama is a socialist just by the books in his library .
" But obviously there have been question about the Obama administration 's politics .
You see a few socialist books sitting in the library and , well , that fits in the narrative . "
The only problem is the books Port photographed have been sitting in the library since 1963 .
The library came into being during the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt .
In 1961 , First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy asked Yale University librarian James T. Babb to oversee a committee that would select books for the library .
In 1963 , 1,780 were placed on the shelves .
" The White House library is a reference and recreational library for the use of the President , his family , and official staff , " wrote Babb in the forward to " The White House Library : A Short Title List , " a document from the White House Historical Association .
" It is intended to contain books which best represent the history and culture of the United States , works most essential for an understanding of our national experience .
The collection has to be strictly limited because the attractive library on the ground floor of the White House has shelf space for only twenty - five hundred volumes .
Authors , with few exceptions , are citizens of the United States ; fiction and poetry by deceased writers only have been included . "
" The American Socialist Movement , 1897 - 1912 " by Ira Kinnis and " The Socialist Party of America " by David Shannon are included on that original list of books , along with books about the two national parties , communism and still others about socialism .
Babb told The New York Times in 1963 that there was " bound to be criticism " of the choices .
" There will still be people telling us what should be in this library , but we 'll just have to be adamant , " he said .
It is impossible to know if the White House guide misspoke , or Port misheard .
" I guess if they have been in there since the 1960s then they have been there through several presidents , " Port said when asked about the discovery .
" All I said was that our tour guide told us they were chosen by the First Lady .
I thought the books were interesting in the larger context , but now I guess it is what it is . "

GE now joins the Reagan History Rewrite project as a new contributor , blanketing the airwaves with this nonsense , celebrating Ronald Reagan 's " Centennial " while pandering to the right wing with tales of his majesty and legend .
Angelo ( aka StopBeck on Twitter ) was kind enough to list some facts as an antidote for GE 's spin :
Ronald Reagan destroyed unions ... cut the budgets for education , EPA , poverty programs , etc...engaged in a public policy initiative aimed specifically at screwing over the poor ... advanced the prison - industrial complex ... hollowed out the Federal government to the best of his ability ... ironically espoused the belief that government was the enemy ( hello !
he was the president * facepalm * ) ... was reckless and neglectful in responding to HIV / AIDS ... tried to cut disabled people from social security rolls ( that ’s right ... disabled people ) ... HUD grant fraud … Sewergate …
And let 's not forget the greatest achievement of his Presidency : the Iran - Contra arms for hostages deal .
GE takes billions of dollars for defense contracts and other goodies from our government , and sees nothing wrong with singing Reagan 's praises on Rush hate talk radio ?
I 'm waiting for their celebration of JFK to balance things .
And a unicorn .
And maybe a pony , too .
Ed. :
Be sure to read the definitive discussion of the Reagan mythmaking machine -- and how it is a significant cog in the mighty conservative - movement Wurlitzer -- in Will Bunch 's Tear Down This Myth : How The Reagan Legacy Has Distorted Our Politics and Haunts Our Future , an important read for every progressive .
There were two points in President Obama 's State of the Union address that provoked resounding and universal applause in the chamber from the assembled senators and representatives of both parties .
One point was when the president said he wanted to start his job - creation program " in small businesses , companies that begin when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream , or a worker decides its time she became her own boss . "
The other point was when he said , " While we 're at it , let 's also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small business investment ; and provide a tax incentive for all businesses , large and small , to invest in new plants and equipment . "
The lusty cheering and applause were not based upon some belief on the part of the assembled legislators that this was about alleviating the pain and suffering of the one - in - five Americans who is out of work , or who is struggling to support a family on the income from some pathetic part - time job paying minimum wage .
It was apparent that this was a cheer for the idea of giving more money to the capitalist class .
Period .
In today 's America , those in power have completely disavowed one of the key goals -- if not the key goal - - of democratic government , which is , as the Constitution put it so admirably in its opening sentence , to " promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty . "
There is nothing in that Preamble about promoting the welfare of the business classes .
The only justifiable reason for doing so then would have to be in order to promote the general welfare .
And yet decades of policies aimed at promoting the welfare of the corporate elite and to a lesser extent promoting the welfare of the business classes in general ( what used to be called the " trickle - down theory " ) , have demonstrably not only not promoted the general welfare ; they have worsened the general welfare .
By every measure , the tax policies , welfare policies , trade policies , labor law policies , and Wall Street deregulation policies of the government , whether in Democratic or Republican hands , have led to a declining standard of living , a transfer of wealth from the poor and middle class to the rich , and a gradual increase in the underlying level of unemployment ( the " acceptable " base level of unemployment which establishment economists consider to be " full " employment ) , not to mention to the extraordinary current level of unemployment .
" Trickle - down , " it turns out , really means " piss on . "
President Obama 's talk about jobs is bogus .
Jobs are leaching away from the US at a prodigious rate , like water pouring through the holes of a sieve , thanks to trade policies that encourage companies to shut down US operations , move production abroad , and then sell the once locally - made goods back to increasingly impoverished Americans .
Any new jobs created are lower wage , and prone to interruption , given that they are in services , and are n't linked to any major capital investment .
Proposed programs like a $ 5000 tax credit for hiring a worker or revoking tax breaks for companies that shift production overseas are a joke , simply a rhetorical sop to the listening audience not meant to be taken seriously .
( No employer will make a new hire just to snag a $ 5000 cut in taxes , and in any event , a credit is only useful to a company that is making profits and paying taxes , and such firms have no need of assistance to get them hiring .
It 's the companies that are in trouble that would need encouragement to hire , and they are n't paying any taxes . )
What is clear from the wild applause to these two lines in the State of the Union address is that government at this point is not about improving the general welfare at all ( if it ever was ) .
It is self - evidently about enriching the rich .
And at that point such a government has lost its reason for being .
This explains why the health " reform " bill has been such a farce .
It was never about improving the health care of average Americans ( something that could have been easily , quickly and efficiently accomplished by simply expanding Medicare to cover everyone ) .
It was always about ensuring the enrichment of the various players in the health care industry , who already own 17.5 percent of the entire US economy .
It explains why we are n't getting any kind of re-regulation of the predatory financial industry .
The goal of de-regulation was never to make life better for average Americans .
It was to enrich the financiers , and it did that very well .
And no de-regulation is going to happen , because the goal of Washington politicians is to continue to enrich those financiers .
It explains why we 're at war in Afghanistan .
There is no conceivable threat posed by this poorest of nations located , landlocked , in a part of the globe that is maximally remote from the US .
Yet we are being committed to an endless war there , costing a nominal $ 100 billion a year ( times two or three when you add in the financing of the debt , and the costs of care for the injured troops over their lifetimes ) , because that war enriches the munitions industry , and also provides justification for an annual $ 800 billion military budget -- a staggering sum that sucks the very life out of any program aimed at " improving the general welfare . "
The whole government enterprise at this point is an ugly affront to the Preamble of the Constitution .
We will all be better served if and when the whole thing is brought down .
The way I see it , we 've pretty much lost our government , and just voting in new politicians is n't going to fix anything ( we just demonstrated that ! ) .
Our best hope then is a popular groundswell for a new Constitutional Convention .
Let 's roll the dice and try over , now that we 've seen how our government can be stolen .
I agree it's a scary idea .
Who knows what we Americans are really like ?
Maybe we are a nation of selfish imperialists and racists and sduch a convention would lead to a restoration of slavery or apartheid , a mass deportation of minorities , incarceration of gays and lesbians , and open endorsement of empire and a police state .
But I like to think that we Americans are actually as good as our mythology tells us we are , and that a constitutional convention could lead to a new government that would really be of the people , by the people and for the people .

Thanks to legislation that will eventually ban the use of cell phones while driving , we ’re all gonna end up with ridiculous headsets .
Most people now would n’t be caught dead wearing a Bluetooth headset , but trust me , once everyone else is doing it , so will you .
It ’ll be a toss up for some people .. there ’s a couple factors that need to be weighed in .
How bad do I need to make this call
What will happen if someone I know drives by me and sees me
What are the risks of simply using my cell phone as opposed to my Bluetooth headset
Do I even care what others think
Chances are the business people will fully adopt the headset first , with the general population trickling in behind .
Hey , does n’t this sound like the initial plan for Bluetooth headsets ?
Maybe once the legislation kicks in headset manufacturers will finally have their day .

It seems progress is inchin ’ its way forward , even in the Catholic Church .
Yesterday , 60 leaders of religious orders representing 59,000 nuns joined with the Catholic Health Association to support the Senate health care reform bill .
The Nuns ’ support for the bill is in direct defiance of Catholic Bishops , who came out against the bill on Monday claiming it funds abortion ( it does n’t , much to my dismay ) .
The Bishops assumed they were speaking for the entire Catholic Church .
You know , the way a man tells a woman whom to vote for in Real America .
Oh , dear .
Advertisements
You ca n’t blame the boys for assuming they were the voice of authority .
That ’s how this whole religion thing works .
It ’s based on patriarchy and serves to enable and support the patriarchal system .
Nuns do the dirty work in the trenches whilst Bishops wave to crowds , eyeing up fresh …. bait .
So , what goes on here ?
I went to a Catholic school for a brief time , and I ’m fully aware of the many prejudices and resentments one can carry with them after a few hours balancing their bare kneecaps on Sister Theresa ’s wooden bench .
However , this is some true sisterhood in action and an awesome display of courage .
The Nuns have came together to say they care MORE about pragmatic reality , MORE about helping people , MORE about correcting the unjust practices in the current healthcare system than they do obeying the patriarchs of the Catholic Church , who are cynically catering to political powers .
This is a gift to humanity , the women ’s movement , social justice , Democrats , and certainly Jesus if one believes .
The Nuns are raising holy hell by defying the Bishops .
They are taking a stand for real pro-life legislation .
That is what goes on here .
And in doing so , they have not only defied but also actually shamed the Bishops .
The nuns support the healthcare reform bill because it is pro-humanity , pro-life , pro-social justice – everything Jesus stands for in the bible .
However , the Bishops have no reason for their position , based as it is upon a lie .
The driving force of their position is prideful indulgence of their own assumed power .
I ’m sure those boys do n’t have the sense God gave them , so God ’s only grace for them is that they do n’t realize what preening fools they are .
But back to our nuns and their stupendous courage ….
It seems these nuns studied the bill , and having been in the trenches as first responders ( as women are in general when it comes to healthcare ) , and they found it to be pro-life , pro-family , a good thing for the poor , and in general a pro-social justice piece of legislation .
Which is what Jesus stood for and indeed , the very foundation of every religion I can think of .
While they do n’t find it perfect , they know we need this .
I ca n’t help but wonder what real America thinks about nuns reading .
Is n’t reading elitist ?
And how on earth did these ladies get through this bill , which the Republicans have had on their desks for almost a year and still have n’t managed to read , due to its “ length ” ?
Perhaps it was divine intervention .
Regardless of your beliefs , it ’s hard not to be moved by the tireless work of the sisters of the Catholic Church .
They minister to the poor , aid pregnant women , and run free clinics and hospitals across this country .
They know first hand the inhumane damage the health care crisis is causing .
I do n’t agree with their stance on abortion , but I do agree with their pro-life stance .
Pro-life should mean that one is FOR LIFE for all people ; poor , pregnant , not - pregnant — regardless of color , race , sex , religion , or crime committed .
And anyone who has the courage to stand up for and behind the convictions of their faith , without cynically falling prey to hypocrisy in order to serve their political ends , deserves respect .
In their own words ,
“ We write to urge you to cast a life - affirming “ yes ” vote when the Senate health care bill ( H.R. 3590 ) comes to the floor of the House for a vote as early as this week .
…..
We have witnessed firsthand the impact of our national health care crisis , particularly its impact on women , children and people who are poor .
We see the toll on families who have delayed seeking care due to a lack of health insurance coverage or lack of funds with which to pay high deductibles and co-pays .
We have counseled and prayed with men , women and children who have been denied health care coverage by insurance companies .
We have witnessed early and avoidable deaths because of delayed medical treatment .
….. It will make crucial investments in community health centers that largely serve poor women and children .
And despite false claims to the contrary , the Senate bill will not provide taxpayer funding for elective abortions .
It will uphold longstanding conscience protections and it will make historic new investments – $ 250 million – in support of pregnant women .
This is the REAL pro-life stance , and we as Catholics are all for it .
…. In this Lenten time , we have launched nationwide prayer vigils for health care reform .
We are praying for those who currently lack health care .
We are praying for the nearly 45,000 who will lose their lives this year if Congress fails to act .
We are also praying for you and your fellow Members of Congress as you complete your work in the coming days .
For us , this health care reform is a faith mandate for life and dignity of all of our people . ”
Sing it , Sisters .
Score a big one for humanity .
news Vintage Toronto Ads : Perogies Galore !
Source : The Toronto Sun , September 13 , 1977 .
Over the past few days , Torontoist readers have shared their thoughts about prorogation and construction on Roncesvalles Avenue .
The timing could n’t be more perfect for today ’s ad to fall into our lap , as it ’s relevant to both hot topics : the tasty perogies served up at prorogation protests across the country and an eatery that once graced the torn - up street .
The Sir Nicholas Tavern began serving Polish specialties in the late 1960s .
When asked about the name , owner Nicholas Sacharewicz noted , “ I deserve to be a sir .
It ’s about time . ”
Among the notable figures that paid homage were Pierre Trudeau , singer Bobby Vinton , and Pope John Paul II .
Most reviews , such as the following from a 1977 edition of the Globe and Mail , felt the honourific was deserved :
Deluxe Polish cooking is alive and well at Sir Nicholas .
The décor is , to be polite , exuberant , fully of statuary and coats of arms and candles born aloft by cherubim .
There are wonderful spicy dishes like sauerkraut soup , pickled wild mushrooms from Poland , cabbage rolls , broiled sausages and , of course , melt - in - the - mouth pierogi .
The site of Sir Nicholas is currently occupied by Tinto Coffee House .

Over the last few months I have had the pleasure of discussing science and science journalism with Faye Flam , who covers science for The Philadelphia Inquirer .
Faye reports on all kinds of science , and a number of other topics , as you can read about on her web site .
But most recently she has put a great deal of work into covering climate change ; even interviewing Michael Mann , who will be visiting us at Penn for a physics colloquium in just a couple of weeks .
And she has found it enough of a challenge that she has chosen to write about it as a ( first of several , I hope ) guest post .
This is a hot topic , as we all know , and I 'm hoping we get a thoughtful and respectful discussion in the comments .
Nevertheless , this might be a good place to remind people that we 'll generally delete comments that are off topic or offensive .
Now , here 's Faye .
There must be some redeeming lesson to come from covering the so - called climate gate scandal that ’s dragged on over the last two months .
Member of the public actually care about science .
They ’re even passionate about it .
But when that happens it ’s not always pretty .
Never in my 14 years as a newspaper science writer have I found myself on the receiving end of such a powerful stream of hate mail - searing bombs of name - calling that get fired into my personal and work inboxes , as well as screaming , profanity - laced screeds landing in my voice mail .
There ’s much gloating about the downfall of newspapers and speculation that soon I ’ll perish on the streets , begging for pennies .
I even got my first death threat following this story .
It was the first of three stories I wrote on this topic for the Philadelphia Inquirer after a cache of e-mail messages were stolen from some prominent climate scientists and picked over by their worst enemies for signs of malfeasance .
Many member of the public are raging at me for failing to point out what they see as an inexcusable case of scientific fraud .
For them , there ’s no distinction between committing fraud and being wrong .
That might worry some members of the scientific community .
I was n’t ordered to write anything on this issue .
During the same period I also wrote a nice story about the Hubble Telescope , and one about heroic cancer researchers .
I could easily have skipped this whole mess and written other nice stories – on Kepler , or maybe LHC .
People always like stories about planets and particles .
But instead , I returned from Thanksgiving vacation to write this quick overview , followed by the more offbeat Q and A story linked above .
Then , in a fit of masochism , I decided to profile one of the scientists involved – Michael Mann – because he works nearby at Penn State University .
That gave the whole thing a local angle .
Mann ’s work has been scrutinized for years , after a researcher in Canada pointed out a possible statistical flaw in some climate reconstructions done in the 1990s .
That eventually led to an investigation by a National Academy panel .
They concluded that Mann ’s initial papers were n’t perfect but the general conclusions held up , and there was no evidence of fraud .
In other areas of science , the public can be more tolerant .
Back in the 1990s , people were in some disagreement about the age of the universe .
When new information came in , some were shown to be off be a few billions years , give or take , but they did n’t get carted off to Siberia .
Others had wrong ideas about the shape and fate of the universe , since nobody back then thought it was accelerating .
That ’s the beauty of science .
It ’s self - correcting – though sometimes the corrections can take a while .
The other lesson here is that many people do n’t understand the role of uncertainty in science .
There is uncertainty over the way water vapor changes the situation , for example , with most experts saying it will create a positive feedback but a few arguing for a negative one .
And still , some people write to inform me that the science is “ settled . ”
These critics are not sure what ’s settled but they ’ve heard this and seem to think it ’s important to repeat .
Others recognize the uncertainty in climate science and find it appalling .
That ’s particularly true of engineers , who seem pretty well - represented among self - proclaimed global warming skeptics .
It ’s a level of uncertainty that would never fly in modeling systems for chemical refineries , or so they tell me .
One MIT - trained engineer said his own calculations prove that the climate models can’t work because , in short : “ junk in equals junk out ” .
It would make for a great story if a local guy who worked for a chemical refinery took down the whole climate science establishment on the back of an envelope .
Unfortunately , I have to consider the possibility that he has n’t .
The global warming skeptics also love to use the term “ AGW theory ” .
This proved a great strategy for debating because the scientists do n’t really refer to anthropogenic global warming as a theory , and many are n’t sure what AGW theory means .
That gives the critics the freedom to say it means that only humans can influence the climate – and that the climate never changed at all before humans hit the scene .
Then they can point to this untenable position and say , “ ha ha - are n’t these scientists dumb ! ”
Coming from the more liberal side of things , a reader suggested that even if some fatal flaw crops up in both the climate models and the climate reconstructions , and the world does plunge into a protracted global cold spell , the scientists who had done the original work should n’t necessarily be thrown in prison or burned at the stake .
It might seem strange , even insane , for the public to base views of the carbon cycle and water vapor feedbacks on politics .
Is it a problem of science illiteracy ?
I do n’t think so .
We could all be better educated about basic physics and chemistry and this debate would still play out the same way .
It all makes more sense , though , in light of the way differing political philosophies tolerate uncertainty – whether they ’re considering government - funded scientists delivering uncertainty or the prospect of policy changes based on uncertain science .
How much should we know before we start conserving energy ?
Classify CO2 as a pollutant ?
Submitting to international regulations ?
The best we can do as scientists and science writers is respect those political differences , state what ’s known as clearly as possible , and be honest about what ’s not known .
People will still hate us , of course .
There ’s no way to escape that .
A " REMORSELESS " Wembley preacher who raped a woman on seven consecutive days was jailed on Friday .
Note : Defendant later acquitted : see here
Paul Robin Denton , 46 , of Barnhill Road , was jailed for 12 years after repeatedly abusing his 32 - year - old victim in October 2007 .
He was found guilty after a trial at Inner London Crown Court when jurors heard how the religious fanatic put the woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , through “ hell on earth ” .
She told the court Denton believed women should be submissive “ because the scripture says so ” .
When she challenged his views , Denton , who changed his name to Lord Denton , repeatedly punched her in the face , head - butted her , pulled out her hair , and raped her “ day after day ” as a punishment .
Detective Constable Jon Wedger said : “ The level of abuse and the time period it has been spread over has had an overwhelming impact on the victim .
Denton has shown no remorse for his actions , even making her go through the ordeal of the trial .
“ I hope knowing he has been held accountable for his actions will go someway to helping his victim come to terms with what has happened and allow her to move forward with her life .
“ She has shown incredible bravery throughout the criminal proceedings and I hope that strength continues as she rebuilds her life . ”
He was arrested in February 2008 but while on bail he sneaked into his victim 's house and stole her hat .
He then sent it back to her in an effort to intimidate her .
Denton , who committed the crimes in Daventry , but later moved to Wembley , was born in Croydon and moved to South Africa with his parents when aged eight months old .
He claims he was kidnapped by his father after his parents split up and told the court he was forced to leave the country after being part of an anti-apartheid group .
He was found guilty of seven counts of rape , four of assault and one of witness intimidation .
' I am not in the office ' :
How an automated email reply ended up on a Welsh road sign
It seemed like a simple request .
Swansea Council sent an email to its in - house translations service to have a road sign - ' No entry for heavy goods vehicles .
Residential site only ' - translated into Welsh .
The only problem was that the Welsh translator was n't in at the time .
An automated email response was sent to council officials who believed it was exactly what they needed .
Lost in translation : Lorry drivers will make sense of the English but the Welsh reads : ' I am not in the office at the moment .
Send any work to be translated '
But in fact it stated : ' I am not in the office at the moment .
Send any work to be translated .'
Unaware of the real meaning of the message , authorities had it printed on the road sign under the English .
The council has since taken down the sign , which barred lorries from a road near a n Asda supermarket , after Welsh speakers spotted the mistake .
A council spokesman said the sign was removed as soon as it was notified of the blunder .

Former pro athletes are n’t the only ones getting in on the MMA fun .
Now former stars of children ’s TV shows are making the move .
Jason Frank , better known as The Green Power Ranger made his MMA debut at the Lonestar Beatdown in Houston , Texas on Saturday night .
While he may have been upstaged by Herschel Walker and his pro MMA debut , Frank certainly did well for himself .
Have a look :
He pulled off a pretty complex Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu submission known as the “ Omoplata ” .
It ’s basically a shoulder lock in which the opponent must tap out or suffer a shredded shoulder joint and / or dislocation .
The opponent here wisely tapped out and the Power Ranger records his first win .

At first glance , it looks as if we ’re in the middle of a patent lawsuit Super Bowl party .
Nearly every large mobile phone player — with the exception of Microsoft , Palm and , so far , Google — has recently been involved in some sort of patent litigation regarding mobile technologies .
The graphic above , showing a sampling of these lawsuits , can be almost dizzying to look at and decipher .
Within the last year , for example , Apple was sued by the Taiwanese company Elan Microelectronics over alleged infringement of touch - screen patents .
Kodak sued several companies over patents related to its digital - imaging technology .
And on Wednesday , Apple sued HTC , the Taiwanese handset maker .
Although patent litigation is not new in the technology world , these suits , specifically around mobile , point to the drastically changing mobile landscape .
Lawyers
I spoke with explained that mobile technology was still in its infancy and these large computing companies were trying to stake their claim to the future of computing .
On Tuesday when I spoke with Eric Von Hippel , a professor of technological innovation at M.I.T. ’s Sloan School of Management .
He pointed out that patent lawsuits had turned particularly unpleasant lately as a result of companies that only buy and sell patents .
In the past , Mr. Von Hippel said , if companies entered a litigious dispute “ they would usually come to an agreement to simply share each other ’s patents . ”
But he said a new genre of patent lawsuits , brought on by what he calls “ patent trolls , ” had changed the nature of the disputes .
These companies have no interest in using the patents , Mr. Von Hippel said , but instead hope to reap large sums of money from the lawsuits themselves .

" Financial crisis / Stalled too many customers / CEO no more , " Jonathan Schwartz told the world , haiku - style .
The resignation came in the wake of Oracle 's purchase of Sun. According to The New York Times , " Oracle 's chief executive , Larry Ellison , is not especially fond of Mr. Schwartz .
In an interview last week , Mr. Ellison said he fully expected Mr. Schwartz to resign rather than play a role in the combined company . "
Schwartz served as the head of Sun since 2006 .

The US House of Representatives has narrowly voted to pass a landmark healthcare reform bill at the heart of President Barack Obama 's agenda .
The bill was passed by 219 votes to 212 , with no Republican backing , after hours of fierce argument and debate .
It extends coverage to 32 million more Americans , and marks the biggest change to the US healthcare system in decades .
" We proved that we are still a people capable of doing big things , " Mr Obama said in remarks after the vote .
" This legislation will not fix everything that ails our healthcare system , but it moves us decisively in the right direction , " he said .
Mr Obama is expected to sign the legislation into law shortly .
But a new challenge is expected in the Senate , where Democrats hope amendments to the bill will be enacted by a simple majority .
Republicans say the move is unconstitutional and plan to stop it .
Historic vote
This is the most significant victory for the president since he took office 14 months ago , says BBC North America editor Mark Mardell .
We will be joining those who established Social Security , Medicare and now , tonight , healthcare for all Americans
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
Full text : Obama hails result High - stakes gamble follows
Your views on healthcare vote Mr Obama has been tough and tenacious - some might say stubborn - in pushing this legislation after so much opposition and so many setbacks , our editor says .
When the vote count hit the magic number of 216 - the minimum needed to pass the bill - Democrats hugged and cheered in celebration and chanted : " Yes , we can ! "
Under the legislation , health insurance will be extended to nearly all Americans , new taxes will be imposed on the wealthy , and restrictive insurance practices such as refusing to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions will be outlawed .
However , our editor says healthcare reform has become a rallying point for Republicans , who are convinced the American people do not want the changes and that it will be a vote winner for them come the mid-term elections in November .
They say the measures are unaffordable and represent a government takeover of the health industry .
ANALYSIS Mark Mardell , BBC News , Washington
While many Americans seem to genuinely yearn for the cross-party accord they call bipartisanship , and politicians at least play it pious lip service , this lengthy debate has revealed a gaping ideological chasm .
President Obama identified overhauling the healthcare system as his priority and he's got what he wanted , a victory that eluded Teddy Roosevelt , Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton .
But when he threw down the gauntlet the conservatives eagerly picked it up .
Healthcare did n't create the tea party movement but it gave it a focus and a cause .
There are dangers to his left as well as his right .
He 's harmed his reputation with his own power base , for many liberals feel there have been so many compromises the bill is hardly worth it .
Read Mark 's thoughts in full " We have failed to listen to America , " said Republican party leader John Boehner .
Speaking moments before the vote , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the healthcare reform honoured the nation 's traditions .
" We will be joining those who established Social Security , Medicare and now , tonight , healthcare for all Americans , " she said , referring to the government 's pension programme and health insurance for the elderly , established nearly 50 years ago .
Although Democrats pushed the measure through with three votes to spare , 34 members joined Republicans in voting against the bill , worried about paying a political price in November 's elections .
In a last - minute move designed to win the support of a bloc of anti-abortion lawmakers , Mr Obama earlier on Sunday announced plans to issue an executive order assuring that healthcare reform will not change the restrictions barring federal money for abortion .
The BBC's Mark Mardell says Sunday 's vote was a pivotal moment , but it is not clear which way the balance will swing in the mid-term vote .
The first opinion polls will make fascinating reading , he adds .

The bill 's final approval represented a stunning turnaround from January , when it was considered dead after Democrats lost their 60 - seat majority in the Senate , which is required to defeat a filibuster , a method used to delay or block the passage of legislation .
To avoid a second Senate vote , the House also approved on Sunday evening a package of reconciliation " fixes " - agreed beforehand between House and Senate Democrats and the White House - amending the bill that senators adopted in December .

The president is expected to sign the House - approved Senate bill as early as Tuesday , after which it will be officially enacted into law .
However , the bill will contain some very unpopular measures that Democratic senators have agreed to amend .
The Senate will be able to make the required changes in a separate bill using a procedure known as reconciliation , which allows budget provisions to be approved with 51 votes - rather than the 60 needed to overcome blocking tactics .
The Republicans say they will seek to repeal the measure , challenge its constitutionality and co-ordinate efforts in state legislatures to block its implementation .
KEY HEALTHCARE REFORMS
Cost : $ 940 bn over 10 years ; would reduce deficit by $ 143bn Coverage : Expanded to 32 m currently uninsured Americans Medicare : Prescription drug coverage gap closed ; affected over - 65s receive rebate and discount on brand name drugs Medicaid : Expanded to include families under 65 with gross income of up to 133 % of federal poverty level and childless adults Insurance reforms :
Insurers can no longer deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions Insurance exchanges : Uninsured and self - employed able to purchase insurance through state - based exchanges Subsidies : Low - income individuals and families wanting to purchase own health insurance eligible for subsidies Individual Mandate :
Those not covered by Medicaid or Medicare must be insured or face fine High - cost insurance : Employers offering workers pricier plans subject to tax on excess premium
But the president has signalled he will fight back .
The White House plans to launch a campaign this week to persuade sceptical Americans that the reforms offer immediate benefits to them and represent the most significant effort to reduce the federal deficit since the 1990s .
" This only worked well for the Republican Party if it failed to pass , " David Axelrod , one of Mr Obama 's closest political advisers , told the New York Times after Sunday 's vote .
" They wanted to run against a caricature of it rather than the real bill .
Now let them tell a child with a pre-existing condition : ' We do n't think you should be covered . ' "
According to the Congressional Budget Office , the healthcare bill will cut the federal deficit by $ 138bn ( £ 92 bn ) over 10 years .
The non-partisan body said last week that the legislation would cost about $ 940bn ( £ 626 bn ) over the same period .
The reforms will increase insurance coverage through tax credits for the middle class and an expansion of Medicaid for the poor .
They represent the biggest change in the US healthcare system since the creation in the 1960s of Medicare , the government - run scheme for those aged 65 or over .
US HEALTHCARE AND WORLD COMPARISONS
Healthcare reform is a priority for Barack Obama .
The US spends about $ 2.2tn a year on its system - which includes private , federal or employer schemes .
US expenditure on healthcare is the equivalent of about 16.2 % of GDP - nearly twice that of some other OECD countries .
The US falls behind some OECD countries for life expectancy and has a higher rate of infant mortality .
Almost 46 m US citizens do not have health insurance .

WASHINGTON -- Significant and widespread cognitive problems appear to exist in schizophrenia in its earliest phase , making it very hard for people with the disorder to work , study or be social , according to a new study published by the American Psychological Association .
Understanding the early and central role of cognitive problems may help clinicians to more accurately diagnose incipient schizophrenia by telling it apart from other neuropsychiatric disorders that also have cognitive problems , such as attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
It could also allow them to provide more appropriate treatment .
Combining schizophrenia 's cognitive warning signs with family history and signs of worsening daily functioning may also aid early diagnosis .
Should improved early treatments become available , early diagnosis could make it possible to ease or even prevent these problems .
These were among the conclusions of a meta- analysis conducted by researchers at Harvard Medical School and SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse , N.Y .
The researchers examined 47 previously published , peer - reviewed studies of first - episode schizophrenia that involved 43 separate samples comprising 2,204 patients and 2,775 largely age - and gender - matched control participants .
Results of this new analysis appear in the May issue of Neuropsychology , which is published by the American Psychological Association .
The psychologists sorted the studies ' collective findings into10 areas of neurocognition , including general cognitive ability , attention , memory , and various verbal , motor and visuospatial skills .
Among their main findings :
 In the very first episode of schizophrenia , cognitive problems were already broad and serious .
Early impairment approached or matched the severity of problems seen in patients who had been sick for a while .
 People experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia had significantly worse performance on all cognitive measures than healthy controls who were largely matched for gender and age .
 Patients struggled the most with processing speed and with verbal learning and memory , especially when encoding information .
Although many psychiatric and neurological illnesses , such as bipolar disorder , affect processing speed , schizophrenia seems to disrupt it more profoundly .
 Measured IQ and other cognitive abilities dropped the most between the high - risk period just before symptoms appear and the first acute phases .
After that , these cognitive abilities were stable .
This cognitive pattern , when combined with other signs such as clinical symptoms and family history , could suggest a diagnosis of schizophrenia .
The first episode of schizophrenia , which is typically in the late teens or early 20s , brings " a sense of tremendous terror , trauma and shock , along with prominent cognitive disorganization , increasingly compelling unusual and / or paranoid thoughts , altered perceptions , and loss of insight , " according to lead co-authors Raquelle Mesholam - Gately , PhD , and Anthony Giuliano , PhD. Popular images of schizophrenia focus on its auditory and visual hallucinations , and strange or distressing behaviors .
However , as the authors noted , people with schizophrenia have experienced a high - risk period for a few months to two years before illness sets in , showing increased problems with daily living that foreshadow full - blown illness .
Early intervention for cognitive problems might lessen their intensity and duration , allowing for a better prognosis , lower relapse rates , and better preservation of cognitive and social skills , and of family and social supports , according to the authors .
The high - risk , or " prodromal , " period is now a focal point for prevention , diagnosis and treatment .
Cognitive testing could also be useful for older children who have a family history of schizophrenia and emerging clinical symptoms .
Doctors viewing cognitive impairments in a vacuum might think of something like ADHD , but the researchers said the new findings play up the importance of family history ( schizophrenia has a genetic component ) and better characterization of clinical or behavioral symptoms , especially around the age of peak risk .
At this time , there are no effective treatments for cognitive problems in schizophrenia .
In the United States , the National Institute of Mental Health recently sponsored two nationwide initiatives to develop assessment standards for cognition in schizophrenia and to evaluate medicines that may potentially treat its cognitive problems .
They are called Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia , or MATRICS , and Treatment Units for Research on Neurocognition and Schizophrenia , or TURNS .

The Swiss were overmatched but competitive .
The second period began with the shot clock reading 17 - 8 Canada and the scoreboard 2 - 0 .
And then it happened .
Drew Doughty got caught pinching , the Swiss were in 2 - on - 1 and the score soon followed suit .
The Canadians were reeling , the Swiss filled with gumption and belief .
As the end of the period drew near the Swiss dumped the puck in and forechecked hard as they had all game .
Chris Pronger got hit in the corner and did n't like it .
He decided that it was personal " pay - back time " and was about to be called for roughing when the Swiss scored on the delayed call .
It was in off a skate , but it was in and the score was tied .
It was going to be all Canada .
Everybody in the building knew it .
The Swiss are hanging on to Jonas Hiller 's coattails for dear life as the end of the period draws near .
And then a penalty .
Less than three minutes to go and some poor sap is in the box for hooking , hoping and praying that the Canadian power play - one goal in ten minutes to that point - can be held off .
Hiller and the PK do the job on Crosby , Getzlaf and Perry .
Then it 's Thornton , Heatley and Marleau who are shut - out .
The shot clock reads 18 - 3 but the scoreboard is unmoved .
If only they 'd shot more .
The battle was lost but the game puttered on .
The dejected Canadians were outshot 3 - 1 in overtime and only looked dangerous in the literal sense .
Rick Nash should have been but was n't penalized for his participation in the long jump using Jonas Hiller 's head as the sand .
But the Canadians did nothing with their good fortune .
Nine of thirteen forwards saw the ice in a five - minute overtime .
None of them scored .
The go - to guy for this team ?
Everybody .
In the end , the game went to the shoot - out and after Martin Brodeur and Jonas Hiller stopped the first three skaters Sidney Crosby stepped up to shoot for the second time .
I guess there is a go - to guy after all .
He scored the goal and sent the crowd into ecstasy , the exclamation point coming with a fourth and final Martin Brodeur save .
It was a win .
" Payback time " for the loss in Turino .
But it sure did n't feel like it .
After the jump we 'll talk tactics , bench management and how this " win " effects Canada in the overall standings .
I understand that Gabriel Desjardins has hacked us into some advanced data , which is pretty great news .
Nonetheless , I decided to continue my work providing some play - by - play of who is getting used when .
It 's listed below and afterwards I 'll talk a little bit about some specific things I noticed in the game supplemented by the data .
The players will be marked by their jersey numbers for ease of writing but I 'll provide a legend first :

End of Game
So , some items of interest .
The RW on the Nash and Crosby line changes again .
Through the first two periods they played with Iginla but they took one shift with Bergeron to close the second period and then they open the third period with Bergeron .
But Bergeron is quickly replaced by Jonathan Toews who then remains on RW with that line until overtime .
He stayed with that group for their last shift on the power play near the end of regulation so it seems
Toews really upped his stock in this one .
As for Bergeron , he started as the RW on a line with Toews ( the LW was sometimes Morrow , sometimes Richards ) until getting the bump .
After he gets replaced by Toews on the 61 - 87 combo he sits for the entire third period until the last ten seconds when there 's a defensive zone faceoff to close out regulation .
Sending him in cold like that is pretty ballsy .
Getzlaf is there as the second center in case Bergeron gets thrown out .
Getzlaf is 48 % on the draw at EV this year so he probably was n't the best choice for that but we 'll let that go .
Bergeon then gets used that way twice more in OT ( and was used that way once in the first period ) .
Lots of opportunity for that guy to be the goat but not a lot of opportunity to be the hero since he always skates off after the puck is cleared .
On to Iginla .
He sits for the first part of the third period until they settle him into a line with Morrow and Richards about seven minutes in .
Those three got three shifts in the third period together and , along with Corey Perry , were the only four forwards not to see the ice in OT .
Hilariously , Iginla 's first shift of the third came in the DZ .
That same shift was also Brent Seabrook 's first ( and only ) shift of the third period .
Seabrook got caught up ice and it would have resulted in a 2 - on - 1 for the Swiss if they had n't gone off - side .
The defensive pairs were much more stable in this game .
They played Niedermayer with Weber , Pronger with Boyle and Keith with Doughty or Seabrook depending on which one was in the dog house at the time .
Seabrook played most of the minutes in the second period after Doughty got caught pinching ( sound familiar ) but Doughty took the honour for the third .
They must trust Doughty since they used him for a DZ draw in the OT when they did n't need to .
Strange choice but that 's what they wanted I guess .
The only defender not used in the OT was Seabrook .
In terms of the overall standings this game is devastating for Canada .
It 's very likely that the Canadians will now finish no better than third in the overall standings .
If that 's the case it 's again likely that any path to the gold medal now involves games against three of Sweden , Finland , the Czech Republic , Russia and the United States .
Had they finished first or second overall , it would likely have only involved two .
A costly , costly loss .
They 're now left to hope that the Russians / Czechs and Swedes / Finns have an overtime game .
The goal differential is still very good ( +9 ) so they 're still very much alive on the tiebreakers .
Next up is the United States where a win is essential .
A regulation loss in that game means it 's four games to the gold instead of three and the quarterfinal game becomes a back - to - back .
So let 's win that one !
A blizzard of commercial real estate defaults could bury hundreds of community banks , a congressional watchdog reports Thursday .
The Congressional Oversight Panel , created to oversee the government 's bailout fund , is warning that losses on commercial real estate loans could reach $ 300 billion , potentially wiping out " hundreds more community and midsize banks " and drying up the credit needed to restore the economy to health .
RECOVERY WATCH : Tracking the economy ; see VIDEO
Over the next three years , a commercial real estate collapse " could overwhelm an already - weakened financial system , " panel Chair Elizabeth Warren says in an interview .
" The commercial real estate problems would be tough to absorb in any economic environment .
But they come at a time when the economy is fragile and the banking system is even more fragile . "
Bank failures numbered 140 last year and 16 so far in 2010 .
Now , commercial real estate is absorbing a one - two punch : • A weak economy has pushed vacancy rates higher and rents lower , forcing developers to default on loans .
Standard & Poor 's says the situation looks like the early '90s commercial real estate meltdown that killed hundreds of banks .
Citing figures from the real estate firm CB Richard Ellis , S&P says office vacancy rates reached 17.3 % in the third quarter of 2009 and are likely headed higher , vs. a peak of 18.9 % in 1991 .
Retail vacancies are already at 12.3 % , vs. 11.3 % in ' 91 .
S&P says most banks it rates can survive if losses spread over a few years .
• About $ 1.4 trillion in commercial real estate loans will mature between now and 2014 , which in many cases means developers will need to refinance or make balloon payments that exceed the value of the underlying properties .
Deutsche Bank estimates that more than 65 % of commercial real estate loans might not qualify for refinancing because banks have tightened underwriting standards and property values have collapsed .
Smaller banks will bear the brunt of commercial real estate losses : " Over the last decade , the Wall Street banks sucked up all the credit card and home mortgage lending that used to be the bread and butter of these community banks , " Warren says .
So they turned to commercial real estate .
A robust economic recovery " would be the best elixir , " says real estate analyst Jonathan Miller .
" Our forecast suggests that probably will not happen . "
Will the government rescue little banks the way it rescued big ones ?
Says Warren , " Who will bear the losses ?
Some will be borne by investors , some will be borne by community banks and some may be borne by taxpayers .
...
We 're going to have to make some tough choices . "

Gorilla games provide clues to human understanding Gorillas play competitive games just like humans , according to scientists at the University of St Andrews .
The gorillas at San Francisco Zoo were observed over a period of five years playing with a variety of equipment .
The study found that gorillas like to keep games going and even give younger apes a fair chance to play .
The psychologists said the research would help trace the evolutionary origins of how humans understand each other .
Dr Joanne Tanner and Professor Richard Byrne watched gorillas play games to learn more about how apes are able to take account of each other 's aims and abilities .
Gorilla games
The playtime involved balls , bags and bits of leather .
Professor Byrne said : " Just like we would , the gorillas used gestures and displays of the object to keep the action going , and if the game slowed down or stopped a gorilla would use varied tactics to get it going again .
" The players were also considerate of other 's abilities .
Gorillas definitely enjoy the same kind of sporting competition we do
Dr Joanne Tanner
University of St Andrews " An older and more skilled gorilla seeming to realise that if it used all of its potential , the younger one would n't be able to compete , so the older gorilla would slow down the pace . "
The scientists said this kind of shared activity and joint attention with another person begins around nine months of age in humans .
Although this process has been suggested to be unique to humans , there have been some previous signs that our closest relatives among the African great apes , might also show similar abilities .
As a result of the new study , the scientists can map the evolution of this process back to the time that humans shared ancestry with gorillas , more than six million years ago .
Dr Tanner said : " Though the age at which gorilla games begin may be later in gorillas than in humans , and may depend on the challenges and artefacts available in a particular group 's habitat , gorillas definitely enjoy the same kind of sporting competition we do . "
The research has been published by the journal Animal Cognition .

Recently , true salsas have been finding their place at the Mexican table in New York .
“ Now there is a conversation between Mexico and the United States about what is good Mexican food , ” said Iris Avelar , who grew up moving between Guadalajara and the San Francisco Bay Area , where her parents had a restaurant .
She is an owner of La Superior in Williamsburg , Brooklyn , which specializes in carefully made Mexican street food .
Image Irma Verdejo of Tulcingo del Valle presents salsa roja , spiced with cloves and canela .
Credit ... Rebecca McAlpin for The New York Times
“ When my parents opened their restaurant 20 years ago , we had to have a ‘ gringo salsa ’ with no chilies at all , ” Ms. Avelar said .
“ That would never happen now . ”
Brilliantly flavorful salsas , made in the classic way , have become much easier to find here , both at hipster magnets  like La Superior ; Cascabel Taqueria on the Upper East Side ; Mercadito in the East Village ; Barrio Chino on the Lower East Side ; and Hecho en Dumbo , which just opened on the Bowery  as well as at traditional places like Tulcingo del Valle , as well as Tortilleria Nixtamal and Tia Julia , both in Queens .
The chefs in these kitchens create salsas that go way past “ red or green ” and “ mild or hot . ”
They highlight the green , herbaceous flavors of fresh chilies and the raisiny sweetness of dried ; they use heat judiciously , to contrast the richness of meats like house - made chorizo or braised veal tongue ; they let some salsas rest overnight to soften their flavors and make others to order to emphasize the snappiness of the ingredients .
These places do not serve what chefs call “ contemporary Mexican cuisine , ” a sophisticated blending of Mexico , Spain , France and the Americas .
Instead , they are fashionably glorified taquerias that give respect to Mexico ’s most basic and widespread snack .
“ A great taco is a perfect food , ” said Danny Mena , the chef at Hecho en Dumbo , who is from Mexico City .
“ A tortilla , a protein and then the salsa is just the genius Mexican way of seasoning every bite with acidity , heat and salt . ”
Felipe Mendez , an owner at La Superior , said , “ In Mexico , we say that the meat is what makes a taco good , but the salsa is what makes it exceptional . ”

The Oklahoma Supreme Court has ruled the Statistical Reporting of Abortions Act unconstitutional , ending a three month battle to enact the controversial anti-choice legislation .
The Oklahoma Supreme Court has ruled the Statistical Reporting of Abortions Act unconstitutional , ending a three - month battle to enact the controversial anti-choice legislation .
Passed by the Oklahoma legislature in October of 2009 , the law would require women seeking an abortion to answer nearly 40 different questions regarding her reasons for doing so , including invasive and personal questions that could be used to disclose a woman ’s personal identity .
The law , which would have gone into effect on November 1 , 2009 instead was put under a temporary restraining order while lawyers debated whether or not it was constitutional .
The Oklahoma constitution does not allow laws to address multiple subjects in one law , and the law in question combined four different anti-choice pieces of legislation , including a ban on sex - selective abortions .
“ We are very pleased with today ’s ruling , ” said Jennifer Mondino , staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights .
“ The government
has no business running a grand inquisition into the private lives of
Oklahoma women and wasting a quarter of a million dollars of tax
payers ’ money in the process . ”
Anti-choice legislators have prepared for the possibility of the ruling , stating that they already have drafted single subject bills for each initiative addressed in the struck down law .
In this season given to tidings of comfort and joy , word has come that we New Yorkers are the sad sacks of the United States .
This is something of a surprise .
Sure , we complain a lot .
Grumbling could qualify as the official state sport .
But are we really the unhappiest of them all ?
It seems so , judging from a study by two economics professors , newly published in Science magazine .
The academics  Andrew J. Oswald , of the University of Warwick in Britain , and Stephen Wu , of Hamilton College in Clinton , N.Y .  examined piles of data , tossed them into a research Cuisinart and came up with a guide to American happiness , ranked by state .
On the smiley scale , New York landed on the bottom .
Dead last ?
“ I ’m sorry about that , ” Professor Oswald said by phone from Warwick .
It ’s rather dismal .
If there were a National Happy League , we ’d be the New Jersey Nets .
We ’re No. 51 out of 51 .
The District of Columbia was included in the list as if it were a state .
It made it all the way to No. 37 despite the handicap of having Congress in its midst .
At least New Yorkers can take comfort in knowing that their immediate neighbors in Connecticut ( No. 50 ) and New Jersey ( No. 49 ) are not appreciably happier .
Colic is a frustrating and exhausting condition for both infants and parents .
The time spent raising a colicky child is fraught with sleepless nights and nearly endless screaming .
You may think it will never end , but here are some colic remedies that may help .
The exact causes of colic in infants is controversial , and the condition is thought to be aggravated by a variety of things , including :
Food allergies ( especially to dairy and soy formulas )
Underdeveloped gastrointestinal tract
Emotional stress
General fussiness
Vaccinations
The best way to figure out if your child 's discomfort is caused by a food allergy is to use an elimination diet .
If the baby is switching to solid food for the first time , this can be rather simple , if you are breastfeeding it may take some more effort .
To use the elimination diet , you have to remove all dairy and wheat products , some vegetables ( legumes ) and fruits , and all sugars .
Once you have removed all of these foods for 30 days , you can slowly start adding foods back in to see if the symptoms come back .
Of course , if you believe that the colic is being caused by an inability to digest lactose or another particular group , then the obvious solution is to reduce your infant 's intake of foods in that group ( or yours , if you are breastfeeding ) .
The elimination diet is inconvenient and can be expensive if you end up throwing out 90 % of your pantry , but it is the most effective way of eliminating discomfort that comes from a food allergy .
Luckily , this is only one of many colic remedies you can try for your infant or toddler .
Infants that display symptoms of colic often have difficulties feeding , including painful reflux and lack of " zest " for feeding [ 1 ] .
While the exact cause of colic , in any case , is likely specific to the child in question , the tried and true ways to calm the symptoms are the same .
Comforting your child by bouncing , holding , cuddling and reducing your stress levels can reduce the symptoms of colic because the baby can sense your tension and will respond to it .
Relieving Colic With Massage and Aromatherapy
If your child 's discomfort is followed by a bowel movement , then help your child process the stool when he starts to get uncomfortable .
Lay your baby flat on their back on a firm but soft surface and begin to slowly and gently massage the belly in a clockwise circular motion .
Before you do this make sure that your hands are warm and soft by rubbing some organic olive oil quickly between your palms .
For extra comfort use aromatherapy with essential oils , such as chamomile and lavender ( 5 drops of chamomile combined with ten drops of lavender ) .
You can also try acupressure , which targets particular parts of the body to receive pressure .
Gently pulling or tugging the earlobes is said to help relieve infant colic , or you can look for professional acupressure therapists in your area and find out if they treat infants .
Note that this is different from acupuncture , which uses needles to treat conditions .
Another great solution is to find a pediatric chiropractor who can gently adjust your baby 's bones .
There are also other natural ways of controlling colic .
Calm and comfort your child by adding one drop of lavender and chamomile oil to a humidifier in the child 's room .
Relieving Colic With Gripe Water
ColicCalm gripe water is a homeopathic remedy containing herbs that help re-balance baby 's digestive system .
ColicCalm is the first homeopathic treatment for infant colic , which is important because it does not introduce chemicals or parasites into your baby 's body like some non-homeopathic gripe water can .
This is what I use when my children complain of stomach cramps .
The herbs in ColicCalm gripe water are
Chamomile – calms the baby down and helps ease nervous tension
Fennel – relieves cramping and intestinal spasms
Caraway – reduces symptoms like heartburn , reflux , and indigestion
Peppermint – aids digestion
Ginger – reduces nausea and muscle spasms and encourages smooth digestion
Aloe – relieves gas and bloating
Lemon Balm – soothes , relaxes , encourages sleep , and helps relieve gas
Blackthorn – encourages regularity and eases cramps
Vegetable charcoal – helps eliminate body toxins and reduces gas
Addressing Colic With Probiotics
Probiotics may also be an option for relieving colic in infants .
The composition of gut flora in babies that exhibit colicky symptoms is different than in non-colicky babies .
Probiotics are the opposite of antibiotics , which kill bacteria .
Probiotics add beneficial bacteria back into the digestive system and can help return the digestive system to a normal state .
I use a probiotic supplement called Latero - Flora™ .
As a colic remedy , just empty a small amount into a bowl , mix it with breastmilk and use a dropper to administer it .
The famous American born psychic and holistic health guru Edgar Cayce gave " readings " for people with varying ailments , including 23 for infants with colic .
Cayce 's answer was basically that the internal systems were out of sync , which is why probiotics are an effective way of treating colic .

EU Commission Investigates How Anti-Competitive Is Google ?
On Wednesday , the European Commission announced it was looking into complaints that Google disadvantages competitors by lowering their search rankings .
The accusations are just the most recent in an ever - growing list of grievances with Google .
TV funnyman Jay Leno is “ furious ” with how NBC has treated him and Conan O’Brien and is reportedly considering walking away from the network .
A day after O’Brien threatened to walk away from NBC , Leno is considering doing the same .
“ They have put Jay in a terrible position .
It looks like he is the reason that Conan is now without a job .
Jay is a great guy and it ’s not fair that due to NBC ’s stupidity he looks like the bad guy , ” a TV insider told the celebrity blog PopEater today .
CONAN CRIES AS ANNOUNCES DECISION TO LEAVE
$ 20B PEACOCK DEAL NOW A TURKEY
“ Plus , what happens when Jay does return to the 11:35 slot if his audience does n’t immediately follow ?
How can he possibly trust the same network that canceled Conan after only seven months ? ”
A Leno spokesman denied the report .
The report comes a day after O’Brien broke down in tears while reading to his writing staff his 553 - word statement that he no longer wants to host the “ The Tonight Show ” if it ’s moved to midnight , an insider told The Post .
With Conan out of the picture , Leno would take back “ The Tonight Show ” by March 1 , if not sooner , after NBC decided to scrap his 10 p.m. show .
The statement effectively ends Conan ’s 16 - year affiliation with NBC , several insiders said .
“ There are people at NBC who are pissed off and will say , ‘ Fine , if you want to be a s – – - head , just go away already , ’ ” one agent said .
Meanwhile , NBC local TV newscasts airing after “ The Jay Leno Show ” have seen ratings declined by 25 percent among key viewers , which is costing NBC stations $ 22 million every three months .
Media agency Harmelin Media said local TV newscasts across 210 markets lost one - quarter of their respective adult 25 to 54 viewership , the main viewer group for TV news advertisers because of Leno .
The World Building of the Year jury was chaired by Rafael Viñoly and included Kengo Kuma , Farshid Moussavi , Suha Ozkan and structural engineer Tim Macfarlane .
Jurors were impressed with a number of schemes , such as the redevelopment of Father Duffy Square in New York and Bras Basah Mass Rapid Transit Station in Singapore .
Both schemes , they felt , responded to complex urban problems in highly sophisticated ways .
They also admired the winner of the Landscape category , by Chinese architects Turenscape for its imaginative qualities and strength of execution .

But after a lively debate , the jury conceded that the Mapungubwe Interpretation Centre , South Africa , by Peter Rich was clearly the most architecturally and psychologically powerful project .
‘ It carries both weight and a message of complexity to the outside world , ’ commented Suha Ozkan .
The jury agreed that the way in which it related to the land and made graceful virtues of the challenging issues of sustainability , politics and social improvement made it a ‘ highly deserving winner ’ .
Peter Rich , said : ‘ I am just completely overwhelmed .
I am going to continue my quest to be of service to the less privileged .
I am going to continue the good fight and take it to the world ’
He added : ‘ Architects need to be of service to a broader audience and to make changes so that it is not just one per cent of people who can afford to use an architect , and that is what excites me . ’

In case you were n’t among the members of the fourth - estate lucky enough to get an invitation to Apple ’s highly - anticipated unveiling of the iPad on Wednesday , here are some of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs ’ key comments about the new device and its importance to the company :
“ Apple is a mobile devices company .
That ’s what we do . ”
“ When you feel all this power , and this much fun , and the internet in your hands , you ’ll never want to go back . ”
“ When we set out to develop the iPad , we not only had very ambitious technical goals , and user interface goals , but we had a very aggressive price goal .
Because we want to put this in the hands of lots of people . ”
“ At $ 499 , a lot of people can afford an iPad . ”
“ Another thing we ’re so excited about is that because we shipped over 75 million iPhones and iPod Touches , there ’s over 75 million people that already know how to use iPad .
We ca n’t wait for them to get their hands on it . ”
On creating an entirely new class of computing product :
“ If there ’s going to be a third category of device . , it ’s going to have to be better at these kinds of tasks than a laptop or a smartphone .
Otherwise it has no reason for being .
“ Now some people have thought that ’s a netbook .
The problem is netbooks are n’t better at anything .
They ’re slow , they have low quality displays and they run clunky old PC software .
“ So they ’re not better than a laptop at anything .
They ’re just cheaper .
They ’re just cheap laptops .
“ We think we got the goods . ”
On the iPad ’s hardware :
“ We have a chip called A4 which is the most advanced chip we ’ve ever run that powers the iPad .
It ’s got processor , graphics , I/O , memory controller , everything in this one chip , and it screams . ”
On getting into the e-book market :
“ Now , Amazon ’s done a great job of pioneering this functionality with their Kindle .
“ And we ’re going to stand on their shoulders and go a bit further . ”
On Apple ’s trio of online stores , iTunes , App store and new ibookstore :
“ Between these stores , we have over 125 million accounts with credit cards all enabled for one - click shopping on all these stores .
“ We are at scale and we are ready for the iPad . ”
On that special Apple je-ne - sais - quoi :
“ The reason Apple is able to create products like the iPad is because we always try to be at the intersection of technology and liberal arts ; to be able to get the best of both .
“ To make extremely advanced products from the technology point of view , that also happen to be intuitive , easy to use , fun to use , so that they really fit the users .
The users do n’t have to come to them .
They come to the user . ”
So I ’ve been assigned the issue of Health in this latest project I ’m involved in .
And I ’ve been wanting to say something about the RH Bill for a long time .
For almost a week , I researched about the bill , read numerous articles , essays , blogs , forums , statements released about the bill by both PRO and ANTI - RH Bill .
I even came close to having an emotional fight with my sister who is against the bill .
The Catholic stand is ( correct me if I ’m wrong ) the RH Bill promotes promiscuity and oversimplifies the problem of overpopulation and poverty .
More importantly , the use of contraceptives is immoral and may even be “ tantamount to taking a life ” .
I guess , this comes from the belief that sex is a manifestation of love between a married couple and is intended only for pro-creation , and no one must interfere with this gift of God .
This I know from growing up with very religious parents , and recently , from talking to my sister .
I respect this belief .
There is nothing wrong with promoting abstinence if you are going to come from a Catholic background .
Nothing wrong with saying that sex is a gift intended for pro-creation .
But what if you do n’t believe in those things ?
What if you do n’t believe that using a condom is “ tantamount to taking a life ” because for you , there is no life to take , no life has been created yet , not even a fetus .
What if you believe that preventing an unwanted pregnancy actually promotes and aids in providing a better quality of life for many families – particuarly women and children ?
The thing is , although the Philippines is predominantly Catholic , many do not even understand what it means to be Catholic .
And if they did , would they still consider themselves Catholic ?
Some actually do , but still find themselves agreeing ( with a clear conscience ) with the RH Bill .
I call these the progressive Catholics .
And then of course , there are some who do not belong to any religion – whether Catholic , Christian , or whatsoever .
What of them now ?
Are you going to deprive them of the kind of reproductive health they need and obviously want ?
Take the case of Islam .
They are not allowed to eat pork .
But they do n’t go about insisting that the government deprive everyone of pork .
Muslims do not live in fear that the availability of pork will make more Muslims want to eat pork .
So I really do n’t get why the Catholic Church thinks the RH Bill promotes promiscuity .
If contraceptives are made accessible to everyone , and many Catholics do end up living promiscous lifestyles , then is n’t that the fault of the Church for not teaching their flock well enough to withstand temptation ?
Why is the Church so afraid of making information available to people ?
Because of this , many non-believers of this Catholic teaching on contraceptives are denied their right to choose based on a moral standard of one religion .
I say many , because most Catholics actually want the RH Bill passed .
Yes , it will not solve overpopulation ( which they call a myth ) or poverty .
But it will definitely help .
But hey , that ’s not even my point .
My point is , we should have the right to choose .
The RH Bill does not impose that you use contraceptives .
It only provides access to information , access to contraceptives ( if you choose to use them ) , not to mention all the reproductive health care many women and children in this sinking country needs .
I WANT THAT RIGHT .
LET THE WOMEN CHOOSE .
LET THE POOR FAMILIES CHOOSE .
Yun lang .
Ang panget ng pagkasulat ko potah .
Patalon - talon .
May sense ba ?
Pasensya na .
I ’m tired and sleepy , but still ca n’t sleep .
Pakshet , my first 2010 post and I ’m already ranting .
I was thinking of writing a really long , articulate essay on this , but what the hell .
Post ko na rin .
Hehe .

Configuring Oracle as a Data Source for SQL Server
By Steve Callan
Discover what happens within SQL Server during and after configuring Oracle as a data source .
Quite a few objects are created , including a system - level database , numerous jobs running under the SQL Server agent , and flat files created on the file system .
Read on to learn more .
In this final article on using Oracle as a data source , well take a look at what happens within SQL Server during and after the configuration process .
Quite a few objects are created , including a system - level database , numerous jobs running under the SQL Server agent , and flat files created on the file system .
Setting up Oracle as a Data Source for SQL Server discusses the obstacles you 'll run into when setting up Oracle as a data source for SQL Server and offers a work - around that will allow you to continue the setup .
The normal set of system - level databases within MSSQL includes master , model , msdb and tempdb .
Upon completion of the steps provided by Microsoft , a new database  named distribution  is created .
The distribution database contains numerous tables related to replication activity .
Without a detailed map of what the various tables contain , you re pretty much left on your own to dig through these tables for information that may be relevant for or to you .
As a simple example , issue an update against the EMP table and commit ( set sal = 900 where sal = 800 affects only one row and is easy to undo later ) .
Within the MSrepl_transactions table , you can see information about the transaction .
In the example below , the only relevant piece of information is the entry_time .
The IHpublishers table shows information about publishers .
In this scenario , we know we used Oracle and a database name ORCL .
We dont see the db_name here , but at least we can confirm ORACLE and the version ( which fits since I used 10gR2 via the 10.2.0.4.0 download for 64 - bit Server 2008 at Oracle Technology Network ) .
You can go through more distribution database tables on your own , and what should become fairly obvious is that the contents of the database are more for MSSQL than for you .
Overall , this is in line with the purpose of other MSSQL - oriented databases ( as opposed to user databases ) .
The publisher_guid shown above is useless information for you , and it looks a whole lot like the ID value shown in a ReportServer database for the ID of a published report .
But nonetheless , you can glean information from here if need be .
Moving down the Object Explorer tree to jobs under SQL Server Agent in SQL Server Management Studio , we see that quite a few jobs are created ( ten in all , with one not enabled ) .
The main job of interest with respect to scheduling is the one with  MyOraclePub in the name ( MyOraclePub was the name chosen for new publication as one of the last steps in the New Publication Wizard dialog windows ) .
Go into the properties of this job and drill down to Schedule .
The default scheduling is to have the agent run replication once per hour on the hour .
Other scheduled jobs are related to maintenance activities .
The first one in the list runs every ten minutes , with its mission being to remove replication agent history from the distribution database .
The last one in the list runs once a day ( at 2 am ) , and is different from all the rest in that the steps to create this job do not include a description or category .
On the file system , based on the article ( i.e. , table ) chosen , MSSQL scripts out what is essentially a create table script and a data file ( the table data is in the file ) .
For one table ( EMP ) , three files are created : a data file , an index file , and a create table ( with other steps ) file .
There may be more than one location , based on when the setup is run , so look for a date time group folder .
One set of files in my setup is in :
C: \Program Files \Microsoft SQL Server \MSSQL10.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\repldata\unc
\ORCL_DISTRIBUTION_MYORACLEPUB\20100201190007
Ignore the last digit and read off the date / time as YYYYMMDDHHMI ( with HH in 24 - hour format ) .
The SCH  file is the schema file , and contains the T - SQL version of Oracles CREATE TABLE statement .
drop Table [ dbo ] . [ EMP ] go CREATE TABLE [ dbo ] . [ EMP ] ( [ EMPNO ] [ numeric ] ( 4 , 0 ) NOT NULL , [ ENAME ] [ varchar ] ( 10 ) NULL , [ JOB ] [ varchar ] ( 9 ) NULL , [ MGR ] [ numeric ] ( 4 , 0 ) NULL , [ SAL ] [ numeric ] ( 7 , 2 ) NULL , [ COMM ] [ numeric ] ( 7 , 2 ) NULL , [ DEPTNO ] [ numeric ] ( 2 , 0 ) NULL , CONSTRAINT [ MSHREPL_1_PK ]
PRIMARY KEY ( [ EMPNO ] ) ) go
Note that all of the numeric columns have precision and scale , whereas the description for EMP in SQL * Plus shows EMPNO , MGR and DEPTNO as NUMBER 4 , 4 and 2 .
The primary key constraint is picked up as well , and the naming suggests Microsoft Heterogeneous Replication via MSHREPL .
The data file , usable via the bcp utility in MSSQL , looks XML - ish , but is not .
Records are separated by < , @g > , columns or changes in field by < x$ 3 > , and null values by a blank line ( somewhat of a departure where whitespace is typically ignored , but in these files , it matters ) .
There are several other objects worth examining , and the curious reader is left to do that upon his or her own accord .
With everything all said and done , how do you see what takes place ?
One interface into that is the Replication Monitor .
The entry and setup of this monitor is quite similar to how the setup for Database Mirroring Monitor is performed .
Right - click Replication and select Launch Replication Monitor .
Select Add Publisher after right - clicking My Publishers to add the Oracle publisher ( or use the Action menu if so desired ) .
The ensuing steps are fairly self - explanatory , and the end result is that the MyOraclePub distribution is added to the list of publishers .
Once enabled , select it and view the activity ( there may be none ) under the various tabs .
Of interest to us is the Agents tab .
Right - click > View Details the first line ( completion of the Snapshot Agent ) and view the history of how your selected article was replicated via a snapshot .
For a 14 row table , with both RDBMSs running on the same server , the time to snapshot was about ten seconds .
Obviously , a very small example in terms of data quantity , but you may want to consider testing the amount of time it takes to snapshot a significantly sized table .
All of this may seem like a lot of work to replicate data between Oracle and SQL Server , and quite frankly , it is .
There is lots of room for error , and even with all steps being faithfully followed via wizards and the like , you can still wind up with errors related to data access ( MSSQL forums have an abundance of questions related to where a publisher or distributor test errors out because of a data access issue , not to mention what it takes to clean up an aborted or failed replication installation ) .
Within Oracle , we have other options , and perhaps the simplest is to go back to what was mentioned as the framework concept in Oracle as a Data Source , that is , use a materialized view .
An even simpler approach would be the use of an auditing table and a job .
We dont care about the change history in the replicated set of data , but rather , we care about the current state of data being present .
If EMPNO 7369 exists in the audit table , then we are either inserting into the replication table or updating the existing record .
Once all records are processed in the audit table , it is flushed and initialized for the next set of transactions to be replicated .
What s even better about this simpler approach is that the target data store 
SQL Server in this example  does not need to be Enterprise Edition level .
Standard Edition will suffice quite nicely , along with its much lower cost .
We can dodge the big bucks for bells and whistles paid for otherwise that can be emulated by much simpler means .
In Closing
A more formal comparison between replication methods within Oracle and within SQL Server can be found in an October 2008 Oracle white paper ( Technical Comparison of Oracle Database 11g versus SQL Server 2008  ) .
Oracle Corporation , never bashful in its claims , states right up front than in all areas ,  Oracle continues to provide a more robust and flexible solution . 
The paper compares Oracles features against those of SQL Servers , and does not go into the pros and cons of using one RDBMS as the data source for the other .
Overall , there is more than one way to publish Oracle data into SQL Server .
It may be best for Oracle to take care of the transactional updates and snapshots , and then use already updated materialized views as the Oracle data source for SQL Server .
I ’m quite busy right these days .
I do n’t have much time to blog about some nice stuff I have done in Krita in my “ spare - thesis time ” .
I ’m writing the thesis about brush engines I implemented for Krita and I wanted to have a brush that is very common among digital painters .
I noticed that they heavily uses the basic Pixel brush .
I decided I want to have some special pixel brush .
I stared to change the function that produce the brush mask and affects it ’s softness .
I selected Gaussian as it is nice function and I experiment with this function , but I found it complicated to control it ( you setup sigma , uh what is sigma , you artist ask ? ) .
So let ’s add some different function to the brush mask code .
Oh , let ’s put this decision to the artists hands , let ’s give him some curve he can model as he want .
We already has nice widget for that in Krita , so use it .
So you can setup the brush mask by curve !
Setup brush softness with the curve
On the picture you can see Curve and Gaussian .
The top red point represents the value of the brush mask in the center of the brush mask and the red point down in the right bottom corner represents the value of the edge of the brush mask .
So far the brush mask supports only elliptical shape but I have also plans for rectangular shape of the brush mask but I need to find a way how to extend the 24 - hours limit of the day so that I can code it You can add as many control points as you wish and tweak the softness between the center and edges .
You noticed the Gaussian also there , the mode and it ’s code works but it will need some more love in the future .
It gives some nice results also sometimes .
I will see how it will end up .
So let ’s make crazy setting of the curve and you can end up with the brush mask like this one with interesting edges :
Stroke with custom curve to change brush mask
As you can see , the brush supports pressure with no problems .
Thanks to the Cyrille ’s sensors you can change size by various attributes of your tablet or you can use some silk ones like a time or a distance .
The brush supports also a rotation so you can setup some ellipse shape of the brush with a diameter and an aspect ratio and do some funny stuff like this one :
Dynamics of the soft brush in action
You setup an angle for your shape and you can allow Krita to manage the rotation for you .
As you noticed , the opacity has been changing also , yes , you can control opacity with pressure .
Those attributes are present in Pixel brush in Krita also .
Let ’s go for some new one .
I added parameter density to brush so that you can simulate in some non-photorealistic way brushes like charcoal , chalk and crayon .
Basically you setup how many pixels from the brush mask will be used in a single dab .
Very nice attribute , I managed to simulate a little charcoal drawing , here is my “ developer ” painting :
Softbrush density demo : Lukáš Tvrdý – House with charcoal
When you paint , your hand can shake .
Maybe your hand is very stiff , and you do n’t shake with your hand when you paint :D. So I added a parameter for you .
It is called Jitter movement .
You can setup how much the brush will be jittered when you paint .
Maybe want to draw straight lines with shaky feeling .
This is example of some mild jittering :
Softbrush mild jittering
If you exaggerate the parameter , you can end up with the result that spray brush , my other brush , do for you
Softbrush crazy jittering
Last feature , that is a little experimental , is called a HSV dynamics .
I suppose you know what is HSV , it is physical color model , which model the color in terms of tint – hue , saturation and intensity – value .
It was invented for artists so that they can more powerfully control the color they want to choose .
I decided to change the parameters of the color dynamically in a stroke .
This is still WIP ( work - in - process ) but so far you are able to grow the parameter , shrink and control it by pressure .
Here is some demo , the feature with pressure can produce images with more gradients easily and you can avoid pick - that - color - and - put - it - here problem a little bit :
Softbrush : Hue growing , saturation shrinking and value growing
You can control the progression by a curve again and more control over the HSV can be done by using pressure option and using the tablet .
These features are for 2.2 .
For 2.3
I already have some new feature and it is called mirroring and it was inspired by David Revoy video tutorial .
He is using something very similar in video ( link to 4:40 ) .
You define the vertical axis with the softbrush with CTRL +LEFT click and then you paint in mirror mode .
If you setup the axis outside the canvas , it is turned off .
As you paint , your brush mask is mirrored and then painted in the mirror mode .
It is WIP also , we plan to make it more general so that every brush engine can use it .
I get the idea as I was working on canvas mirroring .
I produced video , watch it here in action .
I plan to blog about other new achievements but again time is issue .
Beside I work on Krita full - time , I write thesis so I do n’t have time these days .
If you want to help me , you can produce some art with my brush engines and then I can include your work in my thesis !
I ’m interested in pictures created with spray , softbrush , sumi-e ( will be renamed to hairy brush ) , deform brush and particle brush and its combination .
Some of the pictures you see here are already part of my thesis .
You need to compile trunk for it but it is easy !
So far enkithan and n- pigeon provided a lot of nice paintings for me .
I pick up the picture that n-pigeon did lately with just soft brush and spray brush .

Even if the brothers could n’t prove anything about the digits of pi , they felt that by looking at them through the window of their machine they might at least see something that could lead to an important conjecture about pi or about transcendental numbers as a class .
You can learn a lot about all cats by looking closely at one of them .
So if you wanted to look closely at pi how much of it could you see with a very large supercomputer ?
What if you turned the universe into a supercomputer ?
What then ?
How much pi could you see ?
Naturally , the brothers had considered this project .
They had imagined a computer built from the universe .
Here ’s how they estimated the machine ’s size .
It has been calculated that there are about 1079 electrons and protons in the observable universe ; this is the so - called Eddington number of the universe .
( Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington , the astrophysicist , first came up with the number . )
The Eddington number is the digit 1 followed by seventy - nine zeros : 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 , 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 , 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 .
Ten vigintsextillion .
The Eddington number .
It declares the power of the Eddington machine .
The Eddington machine would be the universal supercomputer .
It would be made of all the atoms in the universe .
The Eddington machine would contain ten vigintsextillion parts , and if the Chudnovsky brothers could figure out how to program it with fortran they might make it churn toward pi .
“ In order to study the sequence of pi , you have to store it in the Eddington machine ’s memory , ” Gregory said .
To be realistic , the brothers thought that a practical Eddington machine would n’t be able to store pi much beyond 1077 digits — a number that is only a hundredth of the Eddington number .
Now , what if the digits of pi only begin to show regularity beyond 1077 digits ?
Suppose , for example , that pi manifests a regularity starting at 10100 decimal places ?
That number is known as a googol .
If the design in pi appears only after a googol of digits , then not even the Eddington machine will see any system in pi ; pi will look totally disordered to the universe , even if pi contains a slow , vast , delicate structure .
A mere googol of pi might be only the first knot at the corner of a kind of limitless Persian rug , which is woven into increasingly elaborate diamonds , cross-stars , gardens , and cosmogonies .
It may never be possible , in principle , to see the order in the digits of pi .
Not even nature itself may know the nature of pi .
“ If pi does n’t show systematic behavior until more than ten to the seventy - seven decimal places , it would really be a disaster , ” Gregory said .
“ It would be actually horrifying . ”
“ I would n’t give up , ” David said .
“ There might be some other way of leaping over the barrier — ”
“ And of attacking the son of a bitch , ” Gregory said .
The brothers first came in contact with the membrane that divides the dreamlike earth from mathematical reality when they were boys , growing up in Kiev , and their father gave David a book entitled “ What Is Mathematics ? , ” by two mathematicians named Richard Courant and Herbert Robbins .
The book is a classic — millions of copies of it have been printed in unauthorized Russian and Chinese editions alone — and after the brothers finished reading “ Robbins , ” as the book is called in Russia , David decided to become a mathematician , and Gregory soon followed his brother ’s footsteps into the nature beyond nature .
Gregory ’s first publication , in the journal Soviet Mathematics — Doklady , came when he was sixteen years old : “ Some Results in the Theory of Infinitely Long Expressions . ”
Already you can see where he was headed .
David , sensing his younger brother ’s power , encouraged him to grapple with central problems in mathematics .
Gregory made his first major discovery at the age of seventeen , when he solved Hilbert ’s Tenth Problem .
( It was one of twenty - three great problems posed by David Hilbert in 1900 . )
To solve a Hilbert problem would be an achievement for a lifetime ; Gregory was a high - school student who had read a few books on mathematics .
Strangely , a young Russian mathematician named Yuri Matyasevich had just solved Hilbert ’s Tenth Problem , and the brothers had n’t heard the news .
Matyasevich has recently said that the Chudnovsky method is the preferred way to solve Hilbert ’s Tenth Problem .
The brothers enrolled at Kiev State University , and both graduated summa cum laude .
They took their Ph.D.s at the Institute of Mathematics at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences .
At first , they published their papers separately , but by the mid-nineteen - seventies they were collaborating on much of their work .
They lived with their parents in Kiev until the family decided to try to take Gregory abroad for treatment , and in 1976 Volf and Malka Chudnovsky applied to the government to emigrate .
Volf was immediately fired from his job .
The K.G.B. began tailing the brothers .
“ Gregory would not believe me until it became totally obvious , ” David said .
“ I had twelve K.G.B. agents on my tail .
No , look , I ’m not kidding !
They shadowed me around the clock in two cars , six agents in each car .
Three in the front seat and three in the back seat .
That was how the K.G.B. operated . ”
One day , in 1976 , David was walking down the street when K.G.B. officers attacked him , breaking his skull .
He went home and nearly died , but did n’t go to the hospital .
“ If I had gone to the hospital , I would have died for sure , ” he told me .
“ The hospital is run by the state .
I would forget to breathe . ”
On July 22 , 1977 , plainclothesmen from the K.G.B. accosted Volf and Malka on a street in Kiev and beat them up .
They broke Malka ’s arm and fractured her skull .
David took his mother to the hospital .
“ The doctor in the emergency room said there was no fracture , ” David said .
Gregory , at home in bed , was not so vulnerable .
Also , he was conspicuous in the West .
Edwin Hewitt , a mathematician at the University of Washington , in Seattle , had visited Kiev in 1976 and collaborated with Gregory on a paper , and later , when Hewitt learned that the Chudnovsky family was in trouble , he persuaded Senator Henry M. Jackson , the powerful member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , to take up the Chudnovskys ’ case .
Jackson put pressure on the Soviets to let the family leave the country .
Just before the K.G.B. attacked the parents , two members of a French parliamentary delegation that was in Kiev made an unofficial visit to the Chudnovskys to see what was going on .
One of the visitors , a staff member of the delegation , was Nicole Lannegrace , who married David in 1983 .
Andrei Sakharov also helped to draw attention to the Chudnovskys ’ increasingly desperate situation .
Two months after the parents were attacked , the Soviet government unexpectedly let the family go .
“ That summer when I was getting killed by the K.G.B. , I could never have imagined that the next year I would be in Paris or that I would wind up in New York , married to a beautiful Frenchwoman , ” David said .__
The Chudnovsky family settled in New York , near Columbia University .
If pi is truly random ?
then at times pi will appear to be ordered .
Therefore , if pi is random it contains accidental order .
For example , somewhere in pi a sequence may run 07070707070707 for as many decimal places as there are , say , hydrogen atoms in the sun .
It ’s just an accident .
Somewhere else the same sequence of zeros and sevens may appear , only this time interrupted by a single occurrence of the digit 3 .
Another accident .
Those and all other “ accidental ” arrangements of digits almost certainly erupt in pi , but their presence has never been proved .
“ Even if pi is not truly random , you can still assume that you get every string of digits in pi , ” Gregory said .
If you were to assign letters of the alphabet to combinations of digits , and were to do this for all human alphabets , syllabaries , and ideograms , then you could fit any written character in any language to a combination of digits in pi .
According to this system , pi could be turned into literature .
Then , if you could look far enough into pi , you would probably find the expression “ See the U.S.A. in a Chevrolet ! ” a billion times in a row .
Elsewhere , you would find Christ ’s Sermon on the Mount in His native Aramaic tongue , and you would find versions of the Sermon on the Mount that are pure blasphemy .
Also , you would find a dictionary of Yanomamo curses .
A guide to the pawnshops of Lubbock .
The book about the sea which James Joyce supposedly declared he would write after he finished “ Finnegans Wake . ”
The collected transcripts of “ The Tonight Show ” rendered into Etruscan .
“ Knowledge of All Existing Things , ” by Ahmes the Egyptian scribe .
Each occurrence of an apparently ordered string in pi , such as the words “ Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate / That Time will come and take my love away , ” is followed by unimaginable deserts of babble .
No book and none but the shortest poems will ever be seen in pi , since it is infinitesimally unlikely that even as brief a text as an English sonnet will appear in the first 1077 digits of pi , which is the longest piece of pi that can be calculated in this universe .
Anything that can be produced by a simple method is by definition orderly .
Pi can be produced by various simple methods of rational approximation , and those methods yield the same digits in a fixed order forever .
Therefore , pi is orderly in the extreme .
Pi may also be a powerful random - number generator , spinning out any and all possible combinations of digits .
We see that the distinction between chance and fixity dissolves in pi .
The deep connection between disorder and order , between cacophony and harmony , in the most famous ratio in mathematics fascinated Gregory and David Chudnovsky .
They wondered if the digits of pi had a personality .
“ We are looking for the appearance of some rules that will distinguish the digits of pi from other numbers , ” Gregory explained .
“ It ’s like studying writers by studying their use of words , their grammar .
If you see a Russian sentence that extends for a whole page , with hardly a comma , it is definitely Tolstoy .
If someone were to give you a million digits from somewhere in pi , could you tell it was from pi ?
We do n’t really look for patterns ; we look for rules .
Think of games for children .
If I give you the sequence one , two , three , four , five , can you tell me what the next digit is ?
Even a child can do it ; the next digit is six .
How about this game ?
Three , one , four , one , five , nine .
Just by looking at that sequence , can you tell me the next digit ?
What if I gave you a sequence of a million digits from pi ?
Could you tell me the next digit just by looking at the sequence ?
Why does pi look like a totally unpredictable sequence with the highest complexity ?
We need to find out the rules that govern this game .
For all we know , we may never find a rule in pi . ”
Herbert Robbins , the co-author of “ What Is Mathematics ? , ” is an emeritus professor of mathematical statistics at Columbia University .
For the past six years , he has been teaching at Rutgers .
The Chudnovskys call him once in a while to get his advice on how to use statistical tools to search for signs of order in pi .
Robbins lives in a rectilinear house that has a lot of glass in it , in the woods on the outskirts of Princeton .
Some of the twentieth century ’s most creative and powerful discoveries in statistics and probability theory happened inside his head .
Robbins is a tall , restless man in his seventies , with a loud voice furrowed cheeks , and penetrating eyes
One recent day , he stretched himself out on a daybed in a garden room in his house and played with a rubber band , making a harp across his fingertips .
“ It is a very difficult philosophical question , the question of what ‘ random ’ is , ” he said .
He plucked the rubber band with his thumb , boink , boink .
“ Everyone knows the famous remark of Albert Einstein , that God does not throw dice .
Einstein just would not believe that there is an element of randomness in the construction of the world .
The question of whether the universe is a random process or is determined in some way is a basic philosophical question that has nothing to do with mathematics .
The question is important .
People consider it when they decide what to do with their lives .
It concerns religion .
It is the question of whether our fate will be revealed or whether we live by blind chance .
My God , how many people have been murdered over an answer to that question !
Mathematics is a lesser activity than religion in the sense that we ’ve agreed not to kill each other but to discuss things . ”
Robbins got up from the daybed and sat in an armchair .
Then he stood up and paced the room , and sat at a table in the room , and sat on a couch , and went back to the table , and finally returned to the daybed .
The man was in constant motion .
It looked random to me , but it may have been systematic .
It was the random walk of Herbert Robbins .
“ Mathematics is broken into tiny specialties today , but Gregory Chudnovsky is a generalist who knows the whole of mathematics as well as anyone , ” he said as he moved around .
“ You have to go back a hundred years , to David Hilbert , to find a mathematician as broadly knowledgeable as Gregory Chudnovsky .
He ’s like Mozart : he ’s the last of his breed .
I happen to think the brothers ’ pi project is a will - o’- the - wisp , and is one of the least interesting things they ’ve ever done .
But what do I know ?
Gregory seems to be asking questions that ca n’t be answered .
To ask for the system in pi is like asking ‘ Is there life after death ? ’
When you die , you ’ll find out .
Most mathematicians are not interested in the digits of pi , because the question is of no practical importance .
In order for a mathematician to become interested in a problem , there has to be a possibility of solving it .
If you are an athlete , you ask yourself if you can jump thirty feet .
Gregory likes to ask if he can jump around the world .
He likes to do things that are impossible . ”
At some point after the brothers settled in New York , it became obvious that Columbia University was not going to be able to invite them to become full - fledged members of the faculty .
Since then , the brothers have always enjoyed cordial personal relationships with various members of the faculty , but as an institution the Mathematics Department has been unable to create permanent faculty positions for them .
Robbins and a couple of fellow - mathematicians — Lipman Bers and the late Mark Kac — once tried to raise money from private sources for an endowed chair at Columbia to be shared by the brothers , but the effort failed .
Then the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation awarded Gregory Chudnovsky a “ genius ” fellowship ; that happened in 1981 , the first year the awards were given , as if to suggest that Gregory is a person for whom the MacArthur prize was invented .
The brothers can exhibit other fashionable paper — a Prix Peccot - Vimont , a couple of Guggenheims , a Doctor of Science honoris causa from Bard College , the Moscow Mathematical Society Prize — but there is one defect in their résumé , which is the fact that Gregory has to lie in bed most of the day .
The ugly truth is that Gregory Chudnovsky can’t get a permanent job at any American institution of higher learning because he is physically disabled .
But there are other , more perplexing reasons that have led the Chudnovsky brothers to pursue their work in solitude , outside the normal academic hierarchy , since the day they arrived in the United States .
Columbia University has awarded each brother the title of senior research scientist in the Department of Mathematics .
Their position at Columbia is ambiguous .
The university officially considers them to be members of the faculty , but they do n’t have tenure , and Columbia does n’t spend its own funds to pay their salaries or to support their research .
However , Columbia does give them health - insurance benefits and a housing subsidy .
A major hurdle in the ambitious quest to design and construct a radically new kind of quantum computer has been finding a way to manipulate the single electrons that very likely will constitute the new machines ' processing components or " qubits . "
Princeton University 's Jason Petta has discovered how to do just that -- demonstrating a method that alters the properties of a lone electron without disturbing the trillions of electrons in its immediate surroundings .
The feat is essential to the development of future varieties of superfast computers with near - limitless capacities for data .
Petta , an assistant professor of physics , has fashioned a new method of trapping one or two electrons in microscopic corrals created by applying voltages to minuscule electrodes .
Writing in the Feb. 5 edition of Science , he describes how electrons trapped in these corrals form " spin qubits , " quantum versions of classic computer information units known as bits .
Other authors on the paper include Art Gossard and Hong Lu at the University of California - Santa Barbara .
Previous experiments used a technique in which electrons in a sample were exposed to microwave radiation .
However , because it affected all the electrons uniformly , the technique could not be used to manipulate single electrons in spin qubits .
It also was slow .
Petta 's method not only achieves control of single electrons , but it does so extremely rapidly -- in one - billionth of a second .
" If you can take a small enough object like a single electron and isolate it well enough from external perturbations , then it will behave quantum mechanically for a long period of time , " said Petta .
" All we want is for the electron to just sit there and do what we tell it to do .
But the outside world is sort of poking at it , and that process of the outside world poking at it causes it to lose its quantum mechanical nature . "
When the electrons in Petta 's experiment are in what he calls their quantum state , they are " coherent , " following rules that are radically different from the world seen by the naked eye .
Living for fractions of a second in the realm of quantum physics before they are rattled by external forces , the electrons obey a unique set of physical laws that govern the behavior of ultra-small objects .

Scientists like Petta are working in a field known as quantum control where they are learning how to manipulate materials under the influence of quantum mechanics so they can exploit those properties to power advanced technologies like quantum computing .
Quantum computers will be designed to take advantage of these characteristics to enrich their capacities in many ways .
In addition to electrical charge , electrons possess rotational properties .
In the quantum world , objects can turn in ways that are at odds with common experience .
The Austrian theoretical physicist Wolfgang Pauli , who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1945 , proposed that an electron in a quantum state can assume one of two states -- " spin-up " or " spin-down . "
It can be imagined as behaving like a tiny bar magnet with spin - up corresponding to the north pole pointing up and spin - down corresponding to the north pole pointing down .
An electron in a quantum state can simultaneously be partially in the spin - up state and partially in the spin - down state or anywhere in between , a quantum mechanical property called " superposition of states . "
A qubit based on the spin of an electron could have nearly limitless potential because it can be neither strictly on nor strictly off .
New designs could take advantage of a rich set of possibilities offered by harnessing this property to enhance computing power .
In the past decade , theorists and mathematicians have designed algorithms that exploit this mysterious superposition to perform intricate calculations at speeds unmatched by supercomputers today .
Petta 's work is using electron spin to advantage .

" In the quest to build a quantum computer with electron spin qubits , nuclear spins are typically a nuisance , " said Guido Burkard , a theoretical physicist at the University of Konstanz in Germany .
" Petta and coworkers demonstrate a new method that utilizes the nuclear spins for performing fast quantum operations .
For solid - state quantum computing , their result is a big step forward . "
Petta 's spin qubits , which he envisions as the core of future quantum logic elements , are cooled to temperatures near absolute zero and trapped in two tiny corrals known as quantum wells on the surface of a high - purity , gallium arsenide chip .
The depth of each well is controlled by varying the voltage on tiny electrodes or gates .
Like a juggler tossing two balls between his hands , Petta can move the electrons from one well to the other by selectively toggling the gate voltages .
Prior to this experiment , it was not clear how experimenters could manipulate the spin of one electron without disturbing the spin of another in a closely packed space , according to Phuan Ong , the Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at Princeton and director of the Princeton Center for Complex Materials .
Other experts agree .
" They have managed to create a very exotic transient condition , in which the spin state of a pair of electrons is in that moment entangled with an almost macroscopic degree of freedom , " said David DiVencenzo , a research staff member at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights , N.Y .
Petta 's research also is part of the fledgling field of " spintronics " in which scientists are studying how to use an electron 's spin to create new types of electronic devices .
Most electrical devices today operate on the basis of another key property of the electron -- its charge .
There are many more challenges to face , Petta said .
" Our approach is really to look at the building blocks of the system , to think deeply about what the limitations are and what we can do to overcome them , " Petta said .
" But we are still at the level of just manipulating one or two quantum bits , and you really need hundreds to do something useful . "
As excited as he is about present progress , long - term applications are still years away .
" It 's a one - day - at - a - time approach , " Petta said .
After Her Brain Broke : Helping My Daughter Recover Her Sanity
Susan Inman
Bridgeross Communications / Ingram Books ( 2010 )
I suffer from depression and have been treated for it for more than 20 years .
My problem is anxiety -- not anxiousness , but overwhelming unchangeable anxiety , mind - numbing anxiety that has its physical side which I 'll tell you about in a moment .
Time for Hollywood to Ground Freud read more
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners Hurrah !
Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
About 15 years ago I had a very good lesson , one which I 'll never forget .
I had been doing very well on a single medication but I insisted I change .
It happened this way .
I was interviewing a famous American psychiatrist ( not so famous that I remember his name ) who , during a station break , asked me what medicine I was on .
I told him Elavil Plus which he snorted at derisively , saying , " That 's the old tin lizzy of medicines , you should be taking Serzone . "
So off to my doctor , Melvin Bruchet whom I credit with saving my life by diagnosing me correctly and early , demanding a prescription for Serzone .
" You dumb bugger , " he replied ( he 's nothing if not candid ) , " if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it ! "
Indeed I had been doing well with one very minor side effect , but I was not to be dissuaded .
He gave me the prescription , then said , " You must stay off Elavil Plus for three weeks before you start Serzone ; I hope you 're prepared for what might happen . "
" Not to worry , Mel , " I said , " Wendy and I are off for two weeks in London and Paris so there 's no pressure . "
Mel did not seem convinced .
The first day in London , in late October , was unseasonably hot , but I 'd not gone two blocks before I started to shiver and I went into a Tie Rack and bought a scarf .
We got near our destination and I was so cold I went into an Irish wool shop and bought a heavy wool sweater .
By the time we got back to our hotel I was shaking all over , yet my body was drenched in perspiration .
Then I started to cry .
And Wendy had two weeks nursing ahead of her .
It was not a pretty sight and when I got home , needless to say , I immediately and sheepishly got hold of Mel , and went back to my Elavil Plus .
I had learned a couple of lessons .
Mental illness is not to be toyed with .
And perhaps more importantly , its hallmark is irrationality .
Another time , when I had a bad bout of anxiety , deep down I knew that I was n't dying of liver cancer but that rational voice was completely and effectively shut down by the voice of gloom , the voice that eradicates rationality .
And once again a doctor had to calmly make me see that I did not have cancer , and was not dying .
' A ridiculous hell '
I 'm fortunate that I am able , thanks to medicine , to function effectively .
Most mentally ill people can get help and thus be able to function .
Susan Inman 's daughter Molly has not been so lucky .
She is schizophrenic and Susan tells of the family journey that took place through Molly 's teens and early twenties in a highly readable though disturbing book called After Her Brain Broke : Helping My Daughter Recover Her Sanity .
A lovely line sums up the journey : " Life is a ridiculous hell and I 'll just navigate narrow pathways of duty before chaos claims us all . "
Schizophrenia is not well understood even by doctors , be they family physicians or psychiatrists .
Molly bounces around between lay health workers and numerous doctors ; good advice and bad advice and lots in between .
She develops Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) .
The sufferer experiences repeated obsessions that interfere with her ability to function .
This meant the entire family had to deal with a volcanic nightmare always just around the corner .
I have a grandson who suffers from Prader - Willi disease , which is caused by an abnormality of genes , thus incurable , and he has OCD big time .
He focuses so severely on , for instance , the place we ’re going to eat , that if the place is closed an all but unstoppable tantrum results .
I constantly am overcome with admiration how my daughter and son - in - law deal with this ever - ticking time bomb .
They have also had to deal with the boy 's younger sister who had to , somehow , understand that she could n't behave as her older brother did .
She is , God bless her , now 14 and an integral part of the family support system .
BC healthcare 's troubling symptoms
After Her Brain Broke , I must tell you , is a Vancouver chronicle , and the inadequacies of the healthcare system are eloquently bared in a book that is free from whingeing complaints but which will leave you wondering how we can know so little about dealing with what , sadly , is not that rare an illness .
We see health professionals contradicting themselves , which is hardly helpful with any disorder but calamitous in Molly 's case .
We see the impact on a family that deals with Molly hating them , suspicious of everything , and almost totally unable to function .
Then Dad is hit by a rare cancer in the eye .
And through this Susan soldiers on .
The ending is , comparatively at any rate , a happy one ; Molly picks up much of her lost education and falls in love with a highly understanding and loving young man .
This tale is by no means critical of all help in the field .
Indeed there is much good .
What it does point out is the inconsistencies and the enormous difficulties they entail .
And what it particularly underscores is the complaint I often make .
If physically ill people were treated by the system as the mentally ill are they would be storming the legislature with bricks and pikes .
Second class patients
This is Rafe , not Susan speaking .
The physically ill are subsidized by the mentally ill .
How ?
The majority of mentally ill people are afraid to seek help because of the horrible stigma still attached to it .
This means any system that wants to help the mentally ill must seek out them out rather than rely on them to come to the system .
Governments wo n't seek out the mentally ill -- especially this one -- because that would raise health costs and that 'll never do .
Those who suffer in silence , then , subsidize those who do n’t .
Let me close with this not about After Her Brain Broke .
Sad and often tragic though the story is , one always gets a feeling of optimism ; not irrational optimism that all will be great , but a feeling that it will be better .
It 's a story of great courage by each member of the family , very much including Molly .
It 's a book I urge you to read .

Brad Friedman Byon 2/4/2010 , 5:46 pm PT
[ See bottom of article for explanation of asterisk in headline ]
If you 're not on Twitter ( you can follow The BRAD BLOG antics here ) , you probably did n't get to enjoy last night 's extraordinary Twitter Tantrum by wingnut propagandist Andrew Breitbart ( follow him here ) in the wake of terrific coverage by Max Blumenthal yesterday at Salon pulling together the indisputable dots of Breitbart employee / accused felon / fellow wingnut operative James O'Keefe 's years - long racist obsessions .
O'Keefe , of course , is the guy who was recently arrested with three other GOP operatives ( one , the son of the acting U.S. Attorney ) in Louisiana for attempting to commit felonies in Democratic U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu 's office , and who did not dress up as a pimp in his secretly taped , heavily - edited and over - dubbed ACORN hit videos , despite continuing false claims to the contrary by Breitbart ( and the mainstream media that felt for it --- but more on that part soon . )
A few lowlights from Breitbart 's hilarious rant last night were reposted at Sadly No under " Breitbart Twitter Meltdown Enters Fifth Frantic Hour . "
Yes ,
Andy actually went on that long , longer in fact , desperate sad tweet after desperate sad tweet , essentially shouting out any racist - like comment he could find by any Democrat as a way to say , I guess , that some Democrats have made racist comments , so he 's happy to employ someone whose a real racist .
Or something .
Who knows ?
The entire meltdown was colorfully characterized by @ KevinKross : " lonely man , hotel room , curtains drawn , on floor , stained underwear , empty bottles , frantically twittering away on his phone . "
But it 's Andy 's employment and support of O'Keefe which he needs to answer for at this point , as today Blumenthal followed up his article from yesterday with more on O'Keefe 's disturbing pattern of racism and race - baiting .
At the end he asks Breitbart directly : " Why are you paying and defending a racist ? "
Good question .
I 'm sure he 'll answer that one , right after he answers these .
Which is to say , um , never .
While he has time to attack me incoherently on Twitter , he apparently does n't have time to answer to those questions which I emailed him directly many days ago ...
Amusingly , as Breitbart and his acolytes ( at least the ones who have n't opened their eyes yet to the continuing Breitbart / O' Keefe scam ) have been desperately pounding out their Breitbart - suggested / paid " outrage , " demanding that O'Keefe is " innocent until proven guilty " --- a standard never applied to their ACORN scams or anybody else they do n't care for , naturally .
The latest laffer came with a straight face , much self - righteous indignation , and apparently no sense of irony at all from Breitbart 's BigJournalism.com paid ( ed note : see correction note below ) staffer Larry O'Connor ( who Twitters as Stage_Right ) .
He concludes his piece today , challenging whatever pieces he can find to quibble with in Blumenthal 's reportage , with : " I am questioning this use of McCarthyite tactics using guilt by association , intimidation and outright lies . "
Wondering where Larry 's condemnation is of Glenn Beck and Andy et al for their brilliant years - long use of such tactics against any Democrat , Barack Obama , everyone in his administration , and those who were ( pathetically ) fired from his administration , such as Van Jones who was forced to leave after the entire crew " used McCarthyite tactics , guilt by association , intimidation and outright lies " to assault him in their journalistic blatantly partisan , rightwing , lie - filled , hit - scheme against him .
I 'm now scheduled to appear on Larry 's Internet radio show next Tuesday night @ 9:15 pm PT , so perhaps he 'll be able to share links to his past articles of outrage condemning the alleged tactics he now suddenly decries , when they were so effectively used by Breitbart and fellow members of the lockstep rightwing rat pack media .
And yes , while it all seems rather childish , it actually all matters .
Breitbart 's very powerful operation is at the very heart of the Republican attempt to game elections any way they possibly can .
These are the GOP dirty tricksters who are still gunning for ACORN for little more than having the temerity to register millions of low and middle - income voters who tend to vote Democratic , to legally participate in their own democracy .
So , naturally , they must be destroyed .
That 's what Breitbart 's after , for a start --- though it 's questionable how many in his goon squad actually understand that , or have just been conned into believing they are fighting the great fight for freedom , or democracy , or the Constitution , or against big government , or whatever it is they 've been fooled into going on about , even as they 've spent years doing precisely the opposite whether it 's registered in their little tea - bagging brains or not ...

Speaking of media , I 've been appearing on quite a few shows of late to discuss all of this .
A few of the appearances I was able to capture or procure are posted below for you and posterity :
* * *
CORRECTION 2/5/10 , 12:46 pm PT : Larry " Stage_Right " O'Connor tells me via email that , unlike O'Keefe , he is not currently paid for the contributions he makes as a contributor to the various Breitbart websites .
Taking him at his word , I 've corrected the article above to reflect that and regret the original error .
* CLARIFICATION 2/16/10 , 11:29 pm PT : After Larry O'Connor read this article two weeks ago , as noted in the correction above , he waited until tonight , while I was a guest on his radio show , to criticize me at length for a headline that he feels was unfair to O'Keefe and not supported by the information in the article .
The headline was originally " The Disturbing Racism of James O'Keefe & the Hilarious Twitter Tantrum of Andrew Breitbart " , which he believes is unfair .
Though I believe the article fully explains the use of the word " Racism " in that original headline to describe O'Keefe 's documented history of racial obsessions , as noted in the article itself , O'Connor believes that the headline characterization is unfair .
As clearly he read it to mean something different from what was explained in the actual article , I 'm happy to modify it to " The Disturbing Racial Obsessions of James O'Keefe ... " so others will not read a similar mischaracterization into it --- particularly if they do n't bother to read the actual article , or misunderstand what I was hoping to get across to readers .
Apologies for any confusion and , as ever , our comments section --- and email address --- is always open to share any such concerns at the time they come up .
P.S. I hope O'Connor will show the same courtesy to Blumenthal , about whom O'Connor wrote in criticism of his Salon article : " This is what he offers as proof and justification for smearing a man .
For calling a man a racist and a white supremacist . "
To my knowledge , Blumenthal did not call O'Keefe either " a racist " or " a white supremacist " .
And while O'Connor , on his show tonight , indicated that 's not what he meant , but rather something more like ' Blumenthal might as well have called him a racist , white supremacist , etc. ' , obviously , his words can be misread as easily as mine .
I he 'll make the appropriate change , and offer a transparent correction / clarification in his article , as I have here to mine .
CORRECTION 2/21/10 : Thanks to O'Connor for pointing out that Blumenthal asked Breitbart , as I quoted in the original article above : " Why are you paying and defending a racist ? " I stand corrected on my P.S. above where I wrote " To my knowledge , Blumenthal did not call O'Keefe either ' a racist ' " .
Since O'Connor waited two weeks to mention any of it , I had forgotten Blumenthal 's words quoted in his three week old piece .
In the meantime , O'Connor has still failed to correct his assertion that Blumenthal called O'Keefe a " white supremacist " as he did erroneously here , and as I pointed out almost a week ago .
Apparently these guys are interested in corrections for everyone else except themselves and other wingnut media when they report erroneously --- or , of course , when non-wingnut media report erroneously , but the error works to benefit their political agenda .
That is , of course , all this is about for these guys .
Journalism and truth and stuff has absolutely nothing to do with it , as you 've likely figured out by now .

Polenta is such a natural base for so many savory foods  more flavorful than either pasta or mashed potatoes , but somehow just as forgiving  that it ’s hard to pick a favorite topping .
Having said that , I know what mine is : sausage .
The fatty succulence of a banger combined with the lean graininess of the cornmeal is somehow perfect .
Many of the polenta toppings I love are essentially sauces , like a beefy stew , a ragù or a mushroom fricassee .
The truly wonderful thing about sausage is that , simply pan-grilled , it makes its own sauce .
So the combination of sausage and polenta practically boils down to only one challenge : making the polenta .
Polenta , as we know , suffers from the misguided belief that it ’s a hassle to make .
Experts say you have to “ rain in the grain ”  adding the cornmeal to a large pot of water while constantly stirring to avoid lumps .
And purists can be fussy about what type of cornmeal to use .
These notions serve to intimidate the novice or average cook .
Let ’s set the record straight : it takes a while to make polenta , and you do have to pay attention .
But its high - maintenance reputation is highly overstated .
The key is starting out with a slurry , a slush - like mixture of cornmeal and water that you whisk together before cooking .
You then put the slurry over not - too - high heat , bring it to a boil , reduce it to a simmer and gradually add more water as needed to keep the mixture smooth and loose .
Meanwhile , you cook the sausage .
A faster , more satisfying combination I can’t imagine .
Cocaine is a central commodity of the neoliberal age ; so , too , its re-processed form ( “ crack ” ) for the desperately poor in de-industrialized cities of the North and South Atlantic .
First announced by Richard Nixon in 1971 , the “ War on Drugs ” predates the rise of cocaine and crack by nearly a decade , but in the 1980s and 90s the “ War on Drugs ” was redoubled in response to the explosion of the cocaine business .
It now ranks as the U.S. ’s longest - running military - police campaign .
Thus if we look at cocaine as a social hieroglyph — not as a thing , but as a complex relation between networks and organizations of people , as well as between states and bureaucracies — we may glimpse some of the distinguishing features of the contemporary world .
There is a strong argument to be made for the impact of the cocaine business on architecture , urban design and construction , fashion , media - entertainment , sports , and aesthetics , not to mention banking and credit institutions .
Fighting cocaine producers , sellers , and users has radically changed the shape of states in relation to those who are , at least nominally , rights - bearing citizens , as states have become more militarized , policed , punitive , and carceral , and citizens more powerless and less protected by the rule of law .
As Bourdieu observed in his late work , states do not disappear under neoliberalism : rather , their repressive right wings are strengthened while their progressive , redistributive rights - based wings are weakened or eliminated .
This is most notable in cities , where urban space has been re-made in line with the requirements of policing and surveillance to protect capital investment and affluent consumers .
Tom Feiling 's The Candy Machine .
Though it does not advance these arguments , except tangentially , Tom Feiling ’s well - researched The Candy Machine : How Cocaine took over the World ( Penguin , 2009 ) makes a similar claim for the importance of its subject ( one suspects the sub - title and perhaps even the title were foisted upon the author by the publisher ) .
Yet could not the same be said of any essential commodity : oil , for instance , or cars or clothes ?
What makes cocaine different ?
The answer , of course , would depend on whom one asks , but what makes cocaine extraordinarily profitable for its import - export merchants is the fact that it is illegal .
The fact that one country — Colombia — supplies 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the U.S. also makes the commodity different .
With the strength of the Euro relative to the dollar , routes out of Colombia through the Amazonian and Orinoco basins to Europe have taken on increasing significance in the current decade , and Peru ’s production has risen correspondingly .
Yet the breadth of the U.S. domestic market is still , as Lenin noted more than a century ago , nonpareil .
90 percent of Colombian cocaine enters the U.S. through Mexico ( and Guatemala ) , smuggling having been made considerably easier by NAFTA , which de-regulated trucking and shipping .
Plans Colombia and Mérida ( Mexico ) — based on counter - narcotics and counter - terrorism — are the two most important U.S. foreign policy initiatives in the Western Hemisphere , with Plan Colombia and its successors costing U.S. taxpayers $ 8 billion between 2000 and 2008 , and Plan Mérida , approved in 2008 , costing $ 500 million in 2009 .
So cocaine is not only big business , it is also high politics : Plan Colombia has been held up as a model of counter - narcotics and counter - insurgency success for Mexico , Afghanistan , and Pakistan .
The title of an April 2009 op - ed piece in the Washington Post read , “ Which Way in Afghanistan ?
Ask Colombia for Directions . ”
As U.S. - trained Colombian Special Forces headed to Afghanistan to help the U.S. train the Afghan army in July 2009 , one senior U.S. official told CBS News , “ The more Afghanistan can look like Colombia , the better . ”

Public debate in the U.S. concerning the suppression of cocaine production and consumption — and the U.S. has determined international drug policy since the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 — is moralistic , due to the weight of conservative strains of Protestantism , even among non-evangelicals , not to mention neo-conservative Catholicism : decent , responsible people should not consume drugs , and should not be allowed to consume them , because if they do they will become oversexed , unproductive degenerates .
Worse than the hypocrisy to which they inevitably lead , rigid moral postures actively refuse to deal with the fact that illicit drugs exist and people consume them no matter how much blood and money are expended to stop them from doing so .
There are economistic assumptions at play as well , borrowed from neo-classical theories about the relationship between supply and demand .
If supply is reduced , the official argument goes , prices will rise for consumers in the U.S. , and demand will drop correspondingly .
Cocaine in its many forms .
Nevertheless , Plan Colombia and related anti-drug initiatives in the Andes and Mexico have not reduced the supply of cocaine to the U.S. , where prices have tended toward secular decline since the early 1980s , and domestic demand has fluctuated from generation to generation .
The volume of illicit drugs that U.S. citizens consume has not changed significantly over time , but the type of drugs they consume has — detailed in Ryan Grim ’s This is Your Country on Drugs : The Secret History of Getting High in America ( 2009 ) — with cocaine coming back into fashion , together with pharmaceuticals , among young , affluent people during the Bush II period .
In terms of costs and benefits , fighting cocaine production and consumption is a disaster even by the standards of the Pentagon : according to a 1994 RAND Corporation study , to reduce cocaine consumption by 1 percent in the U.S. it would be twenty - three times cheaper ( $ 34 million ) to spend on treatment and education for consumers than on coca eradication for producers ( $ 783 million ) .
The drug war has evidently failed on its own terms , as announced in an op - ed piece in the Wall Street Journal written in February 2009 by former presidents Ernesto Zedillo ( Mexico ) , César Gaviria ( Colombia ) , and Fernando Henrique Cardoso ( Brazil ) , darlings of the neoliberal “ Washington Consensus ” during the 1990s .
Cocaine in its many forms .
But the failure to achieve stated objectives has yet to affect policy - making , which is driven mainly by ideology .
Empirical data has little bearing on the policy - making process , so it is worth asking if perhaps some measure other than the benchmarks put forward by the drug warriors should be used to evaluate it .
The logic driving the War on Drugs has been chiefly ideological and political , not economic : domestic politics in the U.S. have determined policy abroad .
One of the defining policies of Cold War liberalism , President Johnson ’s “ War on Poverty ” — which had less than one - tenth of the lifespan of the “ War on Drugs ” — took for granted that federal and state governments should take responsibility for improving the plight of the poor in northern cities , and represented a semi-coherent response to African American riots and insurgencies .
But what if poor black people in cities could be held responsible for their poverty ?
What if , as industrial jobs disappeared by the millions , they became addicted to selling or consuming illegal drugs produced and / or distributed by U.S. government allies in Cold War counterinsurgent campaigns ?
Then , of course , African Americans could be locked up for non-violent drug offenses and warehoused in prisons at an accelerated rate .
Cocaine in its many forms .
It is to Feiling ’s credit to have discovered this larger truth , albeit in bits and pieces , by taking the requisite critical distance from the moralizing and economistic assumptions that prevail in the U.S. : “ blame is at the heart of the War on Drugs .
In retrospect , one ca n’t help but conclude from the politicians ’ reactions to economic restructuring and the closure of many of America ’s biggest factories in the 1970s and 80s , that the crack scare obviated the need to develop effective policies to tackle unemployment .
As long as the focus stayed on drug sales and drug abuse , inner-city residents could be blamed for the poverty they had been driven into …what the politicians had to do was convince the American public that the inner cities deserved to be abandoned . ”
Here Feiling re-invents the wheel Christian Parenti turned to excellent effect in Lockdown America : Policing and Prisons in an Age of Crisis ( 1999 ) .
In the 1970s , President Richard Nixon and Governor Nelson Rockefeller in New York campaigned for office by whipping up hysteria about “ crime ” and “ drugs , ” and then criminalized African American communities , militarized policing , and increased incarceration .
After a brief respite under Carter , fighting crime and drugs in urban African American neighborhoods became the rhetorical coin of the political realm under Ronald Reagan .
The idea was to put African Americans back in their place without Jim Crow segregation , and to get elected or re-elected by doing it .
Fear was to be one of the most enduring weapons in the U.S. politician ’s arsenal .
In his diary in 1969 , Nixon ’s top aide , H.R. Haldeman , provided a succinct summary of the overall strategy : “ Nixon emphasized that the whole problem is really the blacks .
The key is to devise a system that recognizes that , while not appearing to do so . ”
In a letter to Dwight Eisenhower , Nixon wrote , “ Ike , it ’s just amazing how much you can get done through fear .
All I talk about in New Hampshire is crime and drugs , and everyone wants to vote for me — and they do n’t even have any black people up here . ”
Nixon ’s “ War on Drugs , ” Feiling notes , was “ politically expedient , since it turned attention away from …Vietnam , while preserving the military culture that had inspired the war in the first place . ”
Nearly all of those imprisoned in New York State for drug offenses have been African American or Latino males , most of them from eight neighborhoods in New York City .
Whereas the U.S. had 200,000 prisoners in the 1970s , it currently has 1.8 million in jail and 5 million on probation or parole , making it the largest carceral state - society in world history .
The U.S. accounts for 5 percent of the world ’s population and 25 percent of its prison population .
500,000 people are serving time for non-violent drug offenses .
Needless to say , the profile of the U.S. prison population does not reflect consumption patterns : whites consume an estimated 80 percent of cocaine in the U.S. , while African Americans consume 13 percent ; whites consume cocaine in disproportionate numbers , while blacks do not .
Yet 38 percent of those arrested and 59 percent of those convicted for drug offenses have been African Americans .
And stereotypes notwithstanding , whites account for 46 percent of all crack use , while African Americans consume 36 percent and Latinos 11 percent .
That is to say that although African Americans use crack out of proportion to their numbers , probably because it is the least expensive of illicit drugs , they consume considerably less of it than whites do .
Were it not for the media , the law , policing , and prisons , the main feature of crack users would be their poverty and the misery of their de-industrialized urban surroundings , not their race .
Just as Jim Crow succeeded slavery at the end of the 19th century after Reconstruction was reversed , militarized policing and prisons replaced Jim Crow after the civil rights movement was rolled back .
Black freedom struggles determined the limits of U.S. democracy from the early 19th century through the 1960s , and the criminalization and incarceration of young African American males through the War on Drugs at the end of the 20th century represented another dramatic constriction of democratic politics in the U.S. , first under President Nixon and accelerating under Presidents Reagan , Bush , and Clinton .
As Feiling and others have stressed , it was through sentencing laws on crack vs. powder cocaine passed in 1986 under Ronald Reagan — and a revolution in police tactics and organization — that this was achieved .
This is the domestic context without which it is impossible to make sense of U.S. foreign policy in producer countries in the Andes ( Colombia , Peru , and Bolivia ) and transport countries in Mexico , Central America , and the Caribbean ( leaving aside Brazil , whose government does not respond to U.S. pressures ) .
After Ronald Reagan was elected , aerial fumigation was undertaken against marijuana growers in Mexico , Jamaica , and Colombia in the early 1980s , even as the Pacific Northwest became the leading supplier of the U.S. market thanks to its competitive advantage in transport costs ; the region was soon to find itself subject to similar , if less toxic campaigns .
In 1982 , President Reagan became the first to appoint a high - level official , then Vice - President George H.W. Bush , to run the South Florida Drug Task Force — composed of agents from the DEA , Customs , FBI , ATF , IRS , Army , and Navy — to deal with cocaine trafficking in Miami , by which time the city ’s homicide rate had made headlines thanks to the violence that Colombians had unleashed in their bid to take over and maintain distribution networks .
Before launching the invasion of Panama and the Gulf War , in 1989 President George H.W. Bush created the Office of National Drug Control Policy , led by “ drug czar ” William Bennett , militarized anti-narcotics policing in Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , and Bolivia , and doubled the anti-drug budget to $ 12 billion .
Mexico had already become the major transshipment point for Colombian cocaine , but its dominance would only increase with the end of U.S. counterinsurgency wars in Central America , the passage of NAFTA , and the fall of the two so - called “ cartels ” in Colombia — Medellín and Cali—under President Clinton .
The Candy Machine ’s greatest strength may be its presentation of perspectives from former gang members and drug users , drug traffickers and retired narcotics enforcement officials in the U.S. ( despite the author ’s desire to “ hear from those who work day to day on the cocaine trade routes that run from London and New York via Miami , Kingston and Tijuana to Colombia , ” the reader mainly hears from people in the North Atlantic ) .
Thus Rusty , a former narcotics officer for the Department of Corrections in Arizona : “ When I talk about legalizing drugs , people say , “ you ca n’t mean heroin and crack , right ? ”
But after 30 years of the drug war , spending a trillion dollars … the bad guys still control the price , purity , and quantity of every drug .
Knowing that they control the drug trade , which drug are you going to leave under their control ?
Regulation and legalization is not a vote for or against any drug .
It ’s not about solving our drug use problem .
It ’s solely about getting some control back . ”
“ They ” refers to drug barons , many of them large landowners as well as warlords , in Colombia , Mexico , Afghanistan , and Pakistan , but the problem with Rusty ’s analysis is that U.S. government allies in such countries — the intelligence services , the judicial systems , the military and police , business and political elites — are either complicit with or directly involved in supplying U.S. and European markets with cocaine and / or heroin , generally in order to finance counter - insurgency wars .
As Alfred McCoy ’s The Politics of Heroin : CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade ( 2003 ) illustrates , this pattern was set in the 1950s with opium and heroin in places like Burma , Marseilles , and Cuba , repeated in the 1960s and 70s in Vietnam and Laos , and updated with Colombian cocaine in Central America and Central Asian heroin in the 1980s .
The common thread is that the anti-communist end justified the means — active or passive collaboration with rightwing drug trafficking organizations in brutal counter - insurgency wars — in all places at all times .
The career path of “ Freeway ” Rick Ross , who used the U.S. inter -state highway system built when Richard Nixon was vice - president to construct his business empire in the 1980s , is illustrative .
Unlike everyone else selling cocaine or crack , Rick Ross was supplied with cocaine at cut-rate prices by Danilo Blandon , a Nicaraguan employee of the CIA in the U.S. government ’s war against the revolutionary Sandinista government , as documented in the late Gary Webb ’s Pulitzer - prize winning Dark Alliance :
The CIA , the Contras , and the Crack Explosion ( 2003 ) .
From prison , Ross explained to Feiling , “ Me and Danilo Blandon were really tight .
I knew from earlier that he was backing some war , and I knew that he was from Nicaragua , but I had no idea about the Contras .
I was illiterate at that time , you know ?
I never read a newspaper or listened to the news .
They say that Danilo was protected , and you can assume from the Feds that I was protected too , but I never knew that .
I was just in it for the money , trying to get out of the ghetto . ”
Blandon sold cocaine to Ross at a price , of a quality , and in quantities that none of Ross ’s competitors could match .
As former DEA agent Celerino Castillo III , who served in El Salvador , told Feiling , “ They gave all the coke to Danilo Blandon , who was a CIA asset .
He in turn fronted all that stuff to Ricky Ross .
Ross became the Walmart of crack , distributing to the Bloods and Crips and everybody else all over the country … .
Hangars 4 and 5 at Ilopango airport in El Salvador were used as a trampoline for drugs coming in from Colombia and Costa Rica .
Oliver North and a Cuban exile named Felix Rodríguez [ a former CIA agent who executed Che Guevara in Bolivia ] were running one of them , and the other one was owned by the CIA .
Rodriguez and North used a plane called the Fat Lady , which was also owned by the CIA , to load up with arms at Ilopango and then airdrop to the Contras in the jungle .
Then the fat lady got shot down by the Sandinistas .
The only survivor was the pilot Gene Hasenfus , who was also working for the CIA .
He was captured and said it was a covert operation being run out of the White House , and that ’s when the story broke that the U.S. government was supporting the Contras . ”
All evidence pointed to Vice - President George H.W. Bush ’s office , but of course nothing came of it besides the Kerry Committee Report of 1989 , which charged the State Department with making payments to Nicaraguan Contras involved in the cocaine business .
In the neoliberal economy of the 1980s , anchored in financial services , insurance , real estate , and speculative asset bubbles , many African American males and immigrant males of color saw the cocaine - crack business as the way to achieve material security .
Cocaine gave a shot in the arm to street gangs , who handled lower levels of wholesale and retail distribution in the U.S. Rick Ross describes his trajectory : “ I was a youngster .
Uneducated , uniformed , unemployed .
I was looking for opportunities .
I wanted to be important in the world , somebody who was respected .
Basically , I wanted the American dream , so I guess I was ripe for the picking .
The opportunity came in the form of drugs and I latched onto it .
I just kept saving my money and buying more drugs .
My childhood friends would be walking , but I ’d be driving a nice car , and they ’d want to know how I got the car .
“ Oh , I ’m selling cocaine now , ” I ’d say .
“ Teach me how to sell cocaine , ” they ’d say .
So my friends started to get involved , and before long we ’re making a lot of money , and I ’m eating at McDonald ’s whenever I want to .
At our height , some days a million dollars would come through our hands in a single day .
Next thing I know , the whole neighborhood is selling , people were already gang - banging , but now we were able to afford more expensive weapons , more expensive cars , and better houses and the police started noticing it more . ”
The comment about eating at McDonalds speaks volumes about the depths of poverty from which Rick Ross escaped , only to wind up living most of his life in a prison cell .
Indeed , for most of those serving hard time for non-violent drug offenses , the crack business offered much less distance from poverty than it had for Ross .
Marc , from South Jamaica , Queens — currently the epicenter of the foreclosure crisis in New York City ’s black and brown neighborhoods — described his work as follows :
“ It was the hardest job I ever had .
It ’s pure capitalism , you know ?
Say you ’re selling drugs in the South Bronx , say at 138th and 3rd Avenue , and another crew of guys is selling the same drugs as you two blocks away .
The block they ’re on is making $ 2,000 per day , and the block you ’re on is making about $ 2,000 per day .
They decide , ‘ You know what ?
You ’re a punk .
You ’re a pussy .
So they move you . ”
Dog Eat Dog , to quote the title of a remarkable 2008 film about the cocaine business in Cali , Colombia : a Hobbesian capitalist world of all against all and murder for hire .
This pattern — with gangs as cell forms of organized crime — was repeated among a host of new immigrant groups in the U.S. involved in cocaine distribution and - or smuggling and money - laundering : Colombians , Mexicans , Salvadorans , and Guatemalans in L.A. ; Colombians , Mexicans , and Puerto Ricans in Chicago ; Colombians , Jamaicans , Dominicans , Puerto Ricans , Mexicans , Albanians , and Russians in New York .
These gangs , of course , are bi- and transnational , just like the cocaine commodity circuit in which they are embedded : in L.A. , there are roughly 2,000 gangs ; in Medellín , Colombia , there were reportedly 6,300 gangs in 2003 ; Chicago is said to have 70,000 gang members .
Gangs involved in distribution aim to reproduce the corporate organization of capitalism from which their members have been excluded .
Hip - hop music testifies to this , particularly the Brooklyn variety pioneered by Biggie Smalls and Jay - Z. Lance , a cocaine wholesaler from South Jamaica , Queens , described his outfit as follows : “ The structure of the business is like a Fortune 500 .
We ’d have different titles , but it all basically remains the same as in corporate America .
You have your CEO , your supervisor , your treasurer .
You might be the captain ; you have your lieutenants , your soldiers . ”
Most Fortune 500 companies have different titles for their executives , though ; only the Sicilian mafia uses such terms for its employees .
This would seem to be an indication of the extent to which poor African Americans — not to speak of Jamaicans , Dominicans , Mexicans , Colombians , Salvadorans , and so forth — have seized upon mafia organization and ideology to justify the pursuit of employment , upward mobility , material abundance , and most importantly , “ respect ” .
If so , it provides evidence of delusion , desperation , or some combination thereof , for as anthropologist Phillipe Bourgeois ’s In Search of Respect : Selling Crack in El Barrio ( 1995 ) shows , the cocaine - crack business is much like any other low - wage service industry offering no benefits .
Feiling found that “ street - level sellers earn roughly the federal minimum wage , which at the time of writing stood at $ 6.55 per hour . ”
Most top dealers have day jobs and take no more than 25 percent of total revenues .
Only one in six brings home more than $ 5,000 per month , as 60 percent of revenues go to wholesalers and retailers on the lower rungs of the distribution chain .
Yet in spite of the new mafia ideology encapsulated in Jay - Z’s ( typically self - glorifying ) verse , “ even righteous minds go through this ” ( when contemplating whether to participate in the crack game ) , the cocaine business offers only marginally more room for upward mobility than the service industries to which African American and Latino youth are confined in the licit economy — with the added risk , or near - certainty , of prison or violent death at an early age .
For direct producers of tropical agricultural commodities like coffee , neoliberal policies in the countryside — nowhere applied with greater blood and zealotry than in Colombia — have accelerated a long - term secular price decline : there are no options other than coca for people in isolated rural frontier areas where there is no state presence or source of employment .
A coca grower from the department of Sucre ( Monterrey municipality ) does the arithmetic : “ Getting a sack of potatoes to market will cost a farmer between 3,000 and 5,000 pesos , and it will sell for between 10,000 and 12,000 pesos , depending on demand .
Meanwhile , coca is a lot easier to sow and process , and does n’t need transporting because the traffickers come to the village to buy it .
They pay 1,500,000 pesos for a kilo of coca paste . ”
Making coca paste is , and will remain , the only option for survival for millions of impoverished peasant families on the Colombian agricultural frontier ; the same is true for Peru and Bolivia .
As the experience of the Bolivians Yungas with northern Argentina demonstrates , a legal market for coca dramatically reduces the amount of coca leaf produced for the cocaine business .
Bolivian President Evo Morales , whose political base remains the coca growers ’ trade union federation in the Chapare that produced him , would like nothing better than to tour the world touting the medicinal benefits of the coca leaf and coca tea , and it is easy to imagine a successful “ coca diplomacy ” with leaders and consumers in the EU , the U.S. , Australia , and Japan .
But first the U.N. Single Convention of 1961 would have to be revised so that companies and firms other than Coca Cola could use the leaf for industrial purposes .
Until U.S. domestic politics changes , it will stand .
Perhaps in recognition of this fact , a number of Latin American countries have de-criminalized personal consumption of cocaine and marijuana .
Colombia was the pioneer : in 1994 , as head of the Constitutional Court , created in the Constitution of 1991 , Judge Carlos Gaviria legalized the personal consumption of up to 20 grams of marijuana , and / or a gram of cocaine , because , he argued , drinkers were much more likely to commit violent crimes , and no one had suggested prohibition of alcohol consumption since the 1920s .
Gaviria , who has since moved on to a political career in Colombia ’s turbulent electoral Left , said , “ Legislators can proscribe certain forms of behavior towards others , but not how a person is behaving toward him or herself , as long as this does n’t interfere with the rights of others . ”
Ecuador , Argentina , and Mexico have since followed suit , which represents the extent to which Latin American countries have sought and attained greater autonomy from U.S. imperial control , as many of the anti-drug laws in Latin America were drafted under U.S. diplomatic pressure .
Latin American countries have now joined the Netherlands in treating drug consumption as a public health problem rather than a police problem .
In the U.S. , however , as Feiling points out , “ legalization ” is a “ third - rail issue ” for politicians , meaning that most will not mention it for fear of destroying their political careers .
As President Obama ’s drug czar , Gil Kerlikowske , put it in July 2009 , “ Legalization is not in my vocabulary nor is it in the president ’s . ”
To understand why , it is helpful to ask who wins and who loses from legalization .
The losers , not necessarily in order of importance , would include U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement , the DEA , U.S. Border Patrol , the FBI , the ATF , the IRS , state and local police forces , the U.S. Coast Guard , the U.S. Armed Forces , to name only some of the agencies whose budgets depend on the drug war for funding , as well as their counterparts in U.S. client states throughout the Americas ; arms manufacturers like Sikorsky Helicopters ; large pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer ; suppliers of chemicals for fumigation like Monsanto ; the banking sector as well as off - shore tax havens ; the Republican Party ; along with warlords , gangs , and gangsters .
The clearest winners would be consumers , direct producers , and societies that would be less militarized , less carceral , less moralizing , and would have stronger public health and education systems .
But as Jack Cole , who spent 26 years in policing narcotics in New Jersey , and is now Executive Director of Law Enforcement against Drug Prohibition , stressed to Feiling : “ When you train your police to go to war , they ’ve got to have an enemy . ”
Cole considers the War on Drugs a “ terrible metaphor ” for “ policing in a democratic society . ”
Terrible , alas , but substitute “ neoliberal ” for “ democratic ” and it is nothing if not apt .
Predictably , Obama and Kerlikowske have dropped the nomenclature , but the policies remain intact .
Miscellaneous crap that I find interesting ... or funny ... or something .

The Bush administration used two federal agencies to instruct a major corporation on how to harass , fire and deport hundreds of Indian “ guest workers ” working on post - Hurricane - Katrina reconstruction , newly released documents show .
The papers , released at a Washington press conference Feb. 3 by lawyers for the workers , show that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Border Patrol directed the Signal Corporation in March 2007 on how to repress 500 Indian workers who were organizing to protest their working conditions .
The workers were brought from India on H - 2B visas to work in the company ’s Mississippi and Texas facilities , presumably because they would provide the cheaper but skilled labor needed to rebuild after the hurricane .
The company claimed , at the time , that it needed to bring 500 skilled welders and pipefitters from India because it could not find that many skilled U.S. workers .
Eddie Acosta , an AFL - CIO spokesperson , noted that , contrary to Signal ’s claim , there were hundreds of such skilled American workers available throughout the Gulf region , many of whom were out of work and available in the aftermath of Katrina .
The sworn court depositions , taken by lawyers for the workers , show that representatives of the Bush - controlled agencies mapped out for Signal executives a schedule of arbitrary firings and rapid private deportations of individuals who were seen as organizers of the protest against inhumane conditions at the shipyards .
Among the conditions workers protested were imprisonment in cramped company housing surrounded by barbed wire , inhumane workloads , and forced labor for many hours without pay .
One of the documents released shows that several Signal officials actually resisted when ICE told them to fire workers who then , under the H - 2B visa program , could be immediately deported .
The resistance was not due to company concern for human rights , however , but to the suggestion by ICE that the company could speed up the deportation if it paid for the plane tickets back to India .
It has been known for over a year that Signal had employed human traffickers in India who “ recruited ” the workers with promises of permanent visas and residency , all of which were broken .
For this and other violations the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , another federal agency , has already assessed $ 22 million in fines against the company .
But the revelation of the Bush administration role in the scandal is new .
The New Orleans Workers ’ Center for Racial Justice , which has filed a federal class action suit against Signal on human trafficking charges , organized the taking of the sworn depositions that reveal the collaboration between Signal and the Bush administration .
In May 2008 , the workers staged a 29 - day hunger strike at the White House .
They were given a congressional hearing and House and Senate committees are now looking into overhauling the H - 2B visa system .
The AFL - CIO has been pressing lawmakers to dump the H - 2B visa altogether and has been providing legal assistance to the Indian workers .
“ This is n’t an isolated incident , Signal is n’t an isolated company and ICE is n’t an isolated agency , ” Acosta said .
“ The agency tramples workers ’ rights all the time and the H - 2B system of temporary visas is so rife with problems that we oppose its continuation . ”
Many companies , however , anxious for cheap labor , support expanding the program even further .
Aby Raju , one of the Indian workers who had been employed by Signal , said that once he and his co-workers arrived from India , “ we were held in a labor camp in the shipyard , penned in behind barbed wire and guarded by security so no one knew our whereabouts .
We were 24 men to a small room with no privacy and two toilets .
They charged so much for the food and bunks that we could n’t send any money home or repay our families for the money they spent helping us get to the United States . ”
He explained that he was one of a few who managed to escape the “ horrible conditions ” at the camps in Pascagoula , Miss . , and Orange , Texas .
Those who escaped sought legal help in New Orleans and later staged the sit-in in Washington .
Raju claimed that even when the abuses were actually occurring workers knew that the Bush administration was actively supporting company efforts to thwart any union organizing efforts .
“ We asked our manager about the conditions and the retaliation and he said , ‘ This is according to the U.S. government .
This is what we do ’. ”
One of the papers released at the press conference documents a phone call to ICE from a Signal official asking for “ advice on how to deport workers who are causing unrest . ”
Another quotes an internal company e-mail that summarized one meeting between Customs and Signal officials : “ Customs is willing to support Signal International however it can to send the message that Customs has no intention of allowing these employees free reign . ”
Another Signal official testified in his deposition : “ The impression I was left with after the talks with the federal agencies was to immediately deport the worker activists . ”
The Signal official said he was told , “ Do n’t give them any advance notice , take them all out of the line on the way to work , get their personal belongings , get them in a van , get their tickets , get them to the airport and send them back to India , even if their H - 2 B visas have n’t expired . ”
Lawyers for the New Orleans Workers ’ Center for Racial Justice say the group is not satisfied with FBI investigations of conditions at Signal that began in 2008 .
They say that those were compromised by ICE .
The group is calling for a wide - ranging investigation by Congress .

Diamond Oceans on the Outer Planets ?
What goes on under the clouds of Neptune and Uranus ?
A new paper reinforces the possibility that there are oceans of liquid diamond in such places , diamond seas with solid diamond icebergs .
It ’s a notion with a pedigree .
I ’m looking , for example , at a paper by David Stevenson ( Caltech ) from the Journal de Physique from November of 1984 , where I find this :
There is clear evidence that many hydrocarbons decompose ( or collapse ) upon shock compression , probably into graphite and hydrogen .
It is very important to establish the range of temperature and C:H ratios for which this decomposition can occur .
It is equally important to establish whether an actual phase separation occurs ( implying possible formation of a diamond or liquid metallic (? ) carbon layer in Uranus and Neptune ) or whether a collapsed but intimately mixed C - H structure results .
Stevenson ’s work built on that of Marvin Ross , who suggested the possibility of diamonds in this environment in 1981 .
Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley demonstrated about ten years ago that the high temperatures and pressures found inside planets like these can turn methane into diamond , and in fact that the diamonds settling into Neptune ’s core could account for the excess heat radiated by the planet .
Now a team led by Jon Eggert ( Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ) has explored the conditions under which diamonds melt , and has shown that , like water , liquid diamond when freezing and melting produces solid forms atop liquid ones .
To melt diamond requires high pressures , which has made measuring its melting point extremely difficult .
But the pressures found inside gas giants , and the high temperatures that go with them , should be enough to do the job .
This Discovery News story notes that Eggert ’s team subjected a small diamond ( about a tenth of a carat ) to a laser beam , liquifying the diamond at pressures some 40 million times greater than at sea level on Earth .
As they then reduced the temperature and pressure , solid chunks of diamond began to appear at about 11 million times sea level pressure with a temperature of some 50,000 Kelvin .

Does an ocean of diamond lurk beneath these clouds ?

The diamond chunks , like tiny icebergs , did not sink but floated .
Eggert believes an ocean of liquid diamond could explain the fact that , unlike the relatively close match we find on Earth , the magnetic and geographical poles on Uranus and Neptune do not align , and can be offset by as much as 60 degrees from the north - south axis .

CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Venezuela ’s President Hugo Chavez has threatened to expel Japanese carmaker Toyota unless it produces an all - terrain model of 4x4 vehicles used for public transport in poor and rural areas .

The fiery socialist , in a speech late on Wednesday , also said he would not hesitate to expel and expropriate plants from other Asian and U.S. automobile companies operating in Venezuela if they failed to share technology with locals .
“ What ’s this that Toyota does n’t want to make the ‘ rustic ’ model here ? ” Chavez said , during a ceremony in Caracas to hand owners the keys to economically produced cars that Venezuela ’s government has imported from Argentina .
“ We must force them .
And if they do n’t , then they should leave and we ’ll bring another company in ...
The Chinese want to come and they make ‘ rustic ’ models . ”
During a decade in power , Chavez has nationalized large swathes of the Venezuela economy -- including the oil and power sectors -- as part of his “ 21st century revolution ” but has so far left car manufacturing relatively untouched .
He turned on Toyota , the world ’s biggest automaker , when a transporter said there was a scarcity of all - terrain models to serve people in under - privileged areas .
Caracas ’ poor mainly live in hillside slums , while many rural areas lack decent roads , meaning tough 4x4s are the main means of transport .
Chavez ordered his Trade Minister Eduardo Saman to carry out a “ severe inspection ” of Toyota , and warned other companies they must start sharing technology with Venezuelans .
“ You tell the people at Toyota that they have to produce this model and we are going to impose a quota , and if they do n’t meet it , we will punish them , ” he told Saman , adding that the state would not hesitate to expropriate Toyota ’s facilities and pay appropriate compensation .
CAR INDUSTRY IN TROUBLE
Following Chavez ’s speech , Toyota has asked the Japanese government to verify the true intentions of his remarks as he has not contacted the company on the issue , Toyota ’s Tokyo - based spokesman Yuta Kaga said on Friday .
Spokesmen for Toyota ’s Venezuelan unit , which operates an assembly plant in the eastern state of Sucre , were not available to comment on Thursday .
But a source at the company said Toyota had stopped assembling the model in question -- which he identified as Land Cruiser 70 -- in 2007 , with the government ’s full knowledge .
It planned to import instead , but had not received the necessary license , he added .
“ The government was informed , it ca n’t be a surprise , ” the source said , adding that most Toyota managers were on holiday but were communicating with each other about Chavez ’s speech .
In addition to Toyota , Japan ’s Mitsubishi as well as Hyundai and General Motors have assembly plants in South America ’s top oil - exporting nation , whose people are known for their love of cars .
“ Companies who come here to set up must be ready to transfer technology to us , ” Chavez said .
“ If they do n’t want to , they should go away .
I invite them to pick up their things and go , ” he added , saying companies from allies like China , Russia , Belorussia and Iran were ready to take their place .
Lack of access to dollars at the official exchange rate , and labor disputes , have combined with a recession to hit the automobile industry hard in Venezuela this year .
According to latest figures from the Venezuela Automobile Chamber , car sales in November were down 40 percent at 10,075 units , compared with the same month last year .

Over a thousand people took to the streets of Ciudad Juarez on Sunday to protest the city ’s record - setting crime wave , which civil rights groups say is made worse by the presence of some 6,000 Mexican soldiers .
“ The army ’s presence is anti-constitutional and violates citizens ’ rights .
That ’s why we ’re asking them to withdraw , ” National Front Against Repression leader Javier Contreras bellowed at some 1,300 people taking part in the “ March of Anger ” in the center of the city .

Across the border from the US city of El Paso , Texas , Ciudad Juarez is a battleground for rival drug cartels seeking control of lucrative drug smuggling routes into the United States .
Among the cartels many sources of profit , illegal sales of cannabis account for the majority of their funds at roughly 60 percent , according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration .
While debate over how best to fight the increasingly powerful criminal groups continues to wage within the U.S. , many Mexican officials have arrived to the conclusion that legalizing cannabis — essentially taking control of the cartel ’s most lucrative income source — would be an effective opening volley .
However , former Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda argued during a February interview with CNN host Christiane Amanpour , it would do the nation little good to legalize cannabis without similar action in the U.S .

“ We ca n’t do everything overnight , and we ca n’t do it in Mexico if the U.S. does n’t do it at the same time , ” he said .
Former Mexican Presidents Vicente Fox and Ernesto Zedillo , along with Mexico ’s U.S. ambassador Arturo Sarukhan and the former presidents of Colombia and Brazil , have all called for at least a debate of legalization or decriminalization of marijuana as a way to curb escalating drug war violence .
ADVERTISEMENT
Despite 6,000 troops sent in to reinforce local police in fighting crime , last year 2,660 people were murdered in the city , making it the murder capital of Mexico .
When 15 innocent youths were gunned down at a party on January 31 , civil rights groups staged a demonstration to vent the local population ’s anger at the seemingly endless bloodshed .
ADVERTISEMENT
The National Front and other civil right groups maintain innocent civilians are sometimes harassed or tortured by law enforcement officials in their zealous crackdown on organized crime .
“ You ca n’t fight violence with more violence and breaking the laws , ” Contreras said , speaking to the protesters .
President Felipe Calderon visited Ciudad Juarez last week and apologized to the bereaving families of the young party goers for initially blaming last month ’s massacre on gang warfare .
ADVERTISEMENT
The president admitted that his three - year crackdown on crime with more than 50,000 troops spread across the country “ is not enough , ” and vowed to redesign a new strategy against crime and violence with community cooperation .
Drug -related crime has left more than 15,000 dead in the past three years in Mexico .

American Dental Association Reaffirms Infant Fluoride Warning
New York February 3 , 2010 The American Dental Association ( ADA ) confirms that infant formula should not be mixed with " optimally " fluoridated water so as to prevent fluoride discolored teeth ( fluorosis ) , according to a November 2009 ADA News Release posted on the internet .
( 1 ) This reaffirms a 2006 ADA e-gram ( 1a ) and a similar Centers for Disease Control Advisory ( 1 b ) .
Fluoride chemicals are added to about 70 % of US public water supplies and some bottled waters ostensibly to reduce tooth decay .
" Infants who are only fed powdered and liquid concentrate formulas mixed with optimally fluoridated water ( 0.7 to 1.2 ppm ) are likely to exceed a fluoride intake level established by the Institute of Medicine designed to reduce the risk of moderate to severe enamel fluorosis [ brown stained and / or pitted teeth ] , " reports the ADA .
The ADA defines moderate fluorosis as " All tooth surfaces affected ; marked wear on biting surfaces ; brown stain may be present " and severe fluorosis as " All tooth surfaces affected ; discrete or confluent pitting ; brown stain present . "
( 2 ) Mild fluorosis is white spotted teeth affecting about 25 % to 50 % of tooth surfaces .
" Enamel fluorosis can occur when developing teeth are exposed to too much fluoride " from any source , " says the ADA .
" Parents should call their water companies to learn their water fluoride levels , " says attorney Paul Beeber , President , New York State Coalition Opposed to Fluoridation , Inc. ( NYSCOF )
" If fluoride is added , they should demand it be stopped , " Beeber advises .
Up to 48 % of US school children have dental fluorosis , according to the Centers for Disease Control 4 % of it moderate to severe . ( 3 )
" Fluoride is neither a nutrient nor essential for healthy teeth and is a hidden ingredient in virtually all foods , " says Beeber .
An October study in the Journal of the American Dental Association reveals that all infant formula contains some fluoride already .
( 4 ) The ADA admits , " the study did not factor an infant 's consumption of baby foods and other beverages , such as juice , that may also contain fluoride . " ( 1 )
For example , one small jar of baby food made with mechanically separated chicken delivers more fluoride than a 6 - month - old child should receive in an entire day , according to a Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry Study . ( 5 )
New York State Department of Health dentist J. V. Kumar published national statistics in the July 2009 JADA which show similar cavity rates regardless of water fluoride content , However , dental fluorosis rates increased along with water fluoride levels .
See analysis " Fluoridation No Benefit ; Definite Harm , " by Kathleen M. Thiessen , Ph.D. , SENES Oak Ridge , Inc. , Center for Risk Analysis here :
http://www.newmediaexplorer.org/chris/Clinch_2009_No_Benefit_Definite_Harm.pdf
NYSCOF news releases in 2000 , 2004 and 2009 ( 6,7,8 ) cited many studies linking fluorosis to infant foods mixed with fluoridated water .
( Also see : http://www.fluoridealert.org/health/infant ) .
" However , government agencies and organized dentistry are doing a poor job of disseminating this emerging science to the tax - paying public who mostly paid for the research , " says Beeber .
" People must restore the safety of their public water supplies and protect their children by joining together locally to demand that their town or city councils stop adding unnecessary fluoride chemicals into the public water supplies , " says Beeber .
" Parents who want fluoride for their children can easily obtain it at the drugstore , " says Beeber .
" But we do n't recommend fluoride at all . "

The drive to ram through the secret Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement is ramping up , with the next meeting set for the end of this month in Mexico .
ACTA is an unprecedented copyright treaty ( unprecedented in that it reaches farther than previous copyright treaties , and that it is being negotiated behind closed doors , without any public input or oversight ) that will force copyright policing duties on Internet companies ( vastly increasing the cost of hosting " user - generated content " ) ; create new penalties for infringement ( including Draconian penalties such as disconnection from the Internet on accusations of infringement ) ; and require countries to search hard - drives , personal media players , and other personal data at their borders .
Last month , Google 's DC office hosted a public debate on ACTA , with Steven J. Metalitz , a lawyer and lobbyist representing the International Intellectual Property Alliance ; Jamie Love , an activist with Knowledge Ecology International ; Jonathan Band , a lawyer representing a coalition of library groups and a variety of tech and Internet companies and Ryan Clough from Silicon Valley Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren 's office ; moderated by Washington Post consumer technology columnist Rob Pegoraro .
The video runs to 90 minutes .
I do n't get a lot of 90 - minute chunks of time in my life , but I made time for this .
It was one of the most spirited — even heated — debates I 've heard on the subject , and it got into substantive questions of law , jurisdiction , economics and ethics .
It was especially interesting to hear Metalitz , the main mouthpiece for the private corporate interests behind this proposal , attempt to defend both the proposal and the secrecy behind it .
Two recurring points that Metalitz raised were that the secrecy in the treaty was a requirement of foreign negotiating partners , and the US 's hands were tied ; and that the treaty would n't require any of the " advanced " nations to change their law ( he repeated the oft - heard unfounded slur that Canada is a rogue nation when it comes to copyright law ) .
Both of these points are simply wrong .
The country demanding that ACTA be kept secret is the good old US of A , whose strategy for this is being driven by former entertainment industry lawyers who have found new homes as senior officials in the Obama government ( the Democrats are terrible on copyright , sadly — we can thank Bill Clinton for the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ) .
These lawyers are Metalitz 's old pals , his colleagues in the decades he 's spent winning special privileges and public subsidy for his rich clients .
Even more ridiculous is the claim that ACTA wo n't require any changes to law ( if that was true , why bother with it ? ) .
As the EU's Commissioner - designate for the Internal Market stated , ACTA will trump the democratic law made by elected governments , requiring changes that are created in smoke - filled rooms that only corporate bigwigs get access to .
ACTA is a profoundly undemocratic undertaking , as is amply demonstrated in the debate in this video .
K - street lobbyists , corporate execs , and other movers and shakers know everything that 's going on in the ACTA negotiations , but the public is frozen out of the debate .
And as Jamie Love points out , public access to other copyright negotiations — such as those at WIPO — have fundamentally changed their directions , because the public does n't want expensive gags and handcuffs put on the Internet in order to bolster the entertainment industry 's profits .
Watch this video .
It may be the most productive 90 minutes you spend today .

James Cameron ’s blockbuster Avatar is a thrill to see , and various commentators have judged the film for whatever ideological message they have found in it , but what struck me most is that the Na’vi people , in defending their land on Pandora from the imperialist exploitation by the humans , are engaging in one of the few just wars you ’ll ever see , in fiction or real life .
It reminded me of the clearly just defense of Narnia in the first Chronicles of Narnia film , so stark was the issue of right and wrong .
The movie has been lambasted by some conservatives who want to conceive of the movie into a message about environmentalism .
Of course , actual pollution , strip - mining and the destruction of indigenous people ’s lands by uninvited foreign corporations empowered through militaristic might should not be defended in any event — and such devastation of habitats is a very real , tangible act of aggression , unlike the far more tenuous environmental concerns like global warming that have distracted the entire conservation movement from genuine environmental degradation .
And the key point here is that the Na’vi are in fact people , sentient beings , much like the seemingly primitive alien races brutalized by the human - dominated empire in the Star Wars saga , or many other such epic stories .
The Na’vi also command their own environment , taming and domesticating lower lifeforms , willing to put their own lives above those of the flora and fauna on Pandora , when need be .
It is true that they have a different set of values than modern industrialized man , but this is no reason to dispense with their property and community rights over their own territory .
Whether one comes away admiring their cultural values or not — personally , unlike many who saw it , I was glad to be back inside with modern technology when the flick ended — the Na’vi rites and rituals work for their own circumstances .
The Na’vi respect nature , but understand this respect as important in the context of utilizing nature for their own health and happiness .
Their rituals of nature worship could be twisted into some message about the green movement , but so could the fact that the invaders in Independence Day sought to steal Earth ’s natural resources .
It is a real theme in history and an established one in myth that criminal gangs , bands of aggressors , states and quasi - governmental corporations will conquer indigenous peoples and rob them of their land and resources .
Besides , even considering the peculiar relationship the Na’vi have to their land , one could see it as a form of technological transformation , a command of nature that the Na’vi have learned to wield .
They treat nature with respect , but in a human way — taking control of animals and plants — and thus are very unlike the modern anti-human environmentalist ideal that sometimes puts sentient beings below other life forms .
If James Cameron indeed intended a typical environmentalist trope , he failed .
The Na’vi have a mystical connection to their land that might bug some people , seeing all lifeforms as interwoven in a somewhat holy relationship , but this should be no more objectionable than the way the Jedi approach the Force .
It is also plausible to say that the Na’vi simply have a respect for natural law , objective truth and morality that is completely lost on the materialistic , utilitarian and militarized humans who come in to steal their land .
This movie is about one people defending their property rights as well as cultural values against an unambiguously rapacious and aggressive modernist invader .
In any event , primitives have a right to defend whatever seemingly bizarre yet peaceful cultural practices are part of their identity .
And the way they defend it is unquestionably just .
The war is winnable , unlike most that modern governments find themselves engaged in .
It is declared by the proper authority , insofar as all the tribes voluntarily congregate to fight the invader .
It is a last resort , since the human aggressors seem intent to exterminate all who try to stay on their land .
The violence is proportional and no innocents are attacked .
The only people who are harmed are belligerents .
What ’s more , the Na’vi take prisoners , who seem to be humanely treated , in massive numbers and let them return to where they came from in peace .
Although defending their turf and having lost many of their people to the humans ’ aggression , the Na’vi are much more humane in their response than the aggressors .
It excites me that people see this movie and cheer for the good guys , because rarely in a movie are the good guys so emphatically in the right and the bad guys so inescapably in the wrong .
I love cheering for the white hats in an action or fantasy movie , but few protagonists offer as much with which to sympathize without reservation as do the Na’vi people .
Even in Star Wars , there is more moral ambiguity , as the rebels and Jedi commit acts of fraud and violence against non-aggressors .
But the real lesson here is that a truly just war is much more difficult to find in the real world , where usually both sides are at least somewhat substantially in the wrong .
However , generally one side is more wrong than the other , and when we look at this movie in the context of America ’s ongoing foreign policy that has persisted for decades , it could not be clearer than the Na’vi , whatever they symbolize , do not represent the U.S. government .
Encore un doigt d'honneur de la fondation aux contributeurs qui à aucun moment n'ont été informés de cette demande qui est sur certain point abusive et qui avalise l'idée que Wikisource serait pour les français , ce qui est bien sûr totalement faux .

Bonjour , Je vais demander à Mike des éclaircissements et des précisions , en partiulier à propos des auteurs morts en 1914 et 1915 .
Yann 11 mars 2010 à 20:04 ( UTC )
J'ai reçu une première réponse de Mike Godwin qui ne répond pas aux demandes de précisions de la communauté .
Je restaurerais les textes qui sont dans le domaine public en France d'ici quelques jours , à moins d'avoir d'autres informations .
Je publierais aussi les échanges de mails avec Mike et Cary .
Cordialement , Yann 13 mars 2010 à 16:40 ( UTC )
J'ai restauré les textes dans le domaine public en France .
Yann 15 mars 2010 à 17:52 ( UTC )
Original de la demande [ modifier ]
A - t - on la possibilité de voir le texte original de la demande faite par Gallimard , pour connaître l'argumentaire de la demande de suppression , ou doit - on se fier seulement à ce qu'on veut bien nous en dire .
Merci -- Le ciel est par dessus le toit 14 mars 2010 à 18:05 ( UTC )

Les morts de 1918 sont eux aussi dans le domaine public [ modifier ]
Péguy , Mirmont , Pergaud ont été rétablis .
Il serait piquant de voir Gallimard , qui a laissé Alain - Fournier tomber dans le domaine public sans réagir , réclamer qu'on les supprime de nouveau .
La doctrine 50 ans ( avant la loi de 1997 ) plus 30 ans ( mort pour la France ) plus 14 ans ( périodes de guerre ) est ainsi appliquée .
Mais la cour de cassation , qui est plus compétente en droit que Mike Godwin et le chef du service juridique de Gallimard réunis , a dit en 2007 que la loi de 1997 sur la protection des oeuvres de l'esprit ( il s'agissait de tableaux dans les arrêts de cour d'appel , mais c'est la même chose pour les textes ) avait " absorbé " les 14 ans de périodes de guerre dans l'allongement de 20 ans du droit commun .
Les morts pour la France ont droit à 50 ans + 30 ans.
Victor Ségalen , mort en 1919 , est donc dans le domaine public , virtuellement depuis l'an 2000 .
On pourrait au moins rétablir Apollinaire , Calloc'h et Segalen , et attendre la réaction de Gallimard , qui a déja abusé de la sincérité de nos amis américains .
-- Wuyouyuan - D - C 16 mars 2010 à 12:15 ( UTC )
Bonjour ,
Je ne suis pas tout à fait sûr là-dessus .
Soit on compte 50 ans + 30 ans + années de guerre , soit on compte 70 ans + 30 ans ( mort pour la France ) .
À moins que l'allongement de la durée du droit d'auteur absorbe aussi la prolongation de 30 ans ( mort pour la France ) , ce qui est possible , mais c'est justement ce que la cour de cassation n'a pas précisé .
J'attends d'avoir une précision de la part de Mike Godwin sur ce que Wikisource peut publier .
Celui - ci refuse pour l'instant de répondre , « tant que le différent avec Gallimard n'est pas réglé .
» Yann 17 mars 2010 à 04:01 ( UTC )
Et comment faire pour régler ce différent avec Gallimard ?-- Le ciel est par dessus le toit 17 mars 2010 à 09:06 ( UTC ) Différend ;-)
Slasher - fun 18 mars 2010 à 11:00 ( UTC ) Merci pour la petite remarque :-)

Ces auteurs sont clairement dans une zone grise .
Pour information , on trouve des œuvres d’Apollinaire , Péguy , Pergaud , Ségalen sur Gallica mais par de Mirmont ou Calloc'h .
Je ne pense pas que Gallimard les ai contacté .
Pour information , je viens d’appeler la bibliothèque de Lisieux qui publie des œuvres de Pergaud ou Mirmont ( [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ) et qui n’a pas été contacté .
Ceci dit , il ne faut pas se leurrer , je pense que Gallimard a surtout visé le DP - EU ( et là , je peux pas vraiment leur donné tort ! ) .

Resuppression des contenus [ modifier ]
Bonjour , serait - il possible de resupprimer les contenus restaurés ?
WMF les a fait supprimer comme mesure conservatoire et pour éviter que Gallimard en passe par un référé .
J'ai demandé à
Mike de faire un mail explicatif de la situation et du pourquoi cette décision a été prise , en attendant il serait bon de resupprimer ses contenus .
Des discussions entre avocats de WMF et de Gallimard ont lieu , cette suppression peut mettre nos avocats dans une situation délicate .
Schiste 17 mars 2010 à 14:30 ( UTC )
Supprimer Péguy sur un site gratuit pour faire plaisir à Gallimard , alors qu'Alain - Fournier est maintenant vendu par la concurrence sans que Gallimard ait réagi , ce serait franchement rigolo .
Il y a quelque chose qui me chiffonne un peu : rien dans la presse ( au moins ce que je peux atteindre , les News de Google ) .
Wikisource est confidentiel , mais quand même .
-- Wuyouyuan - D - C 17 mars 2010 à 14:47 ( UTC )
Je soutiens la remarque de Wuyouyuan .
Supprimer sans justification un contenu dans le domaine public en France pour faire plaisir à un gros éditeur ne me semble pas la solution .
Yann 17 mars 2010 à 15:06 ( UTC )
C'est dans le cadre d'une démarche juridique officielle .
Pas pour faire plaisir .
w:en : Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation
Act pour plus d'infos à ce sujet .
Je vous copie ci-dessous un mail de Mike à ce sujet : Christophe , Please communicate to the sysop that we have removed the content in question on the specific advice of our French counsel , Hugot Avocats , as we discuss the copyright complaint with Gallimard , and that actions taken unilaterally by sysops in the absence of that advice may result in legal problems both for the Wikimedia Foundation and for the Wikisource project .
Further questions should be directed to Hugot Avocats .
This message may be forwarded as necessary .
Schiste 17 mars 2010 à 15:56 ( UTC )
Le problème principal est le manque de discussion de la part de Wikimedia Foundation .
Les explications de Schiste ci-dessus et ci-dessous sont déjà beaucoup plus que ce que Mike Godwin a bien voulu me répondre par mail .
C'est encourageant de savoir que ces suppressions ne sont envisagées qu'à titre temporaire .
Néanmoins , vu qu'une partie des suppressions ne semblent pas justifiées au regard ni du droit français ni du droit américain , un minimum d'explications me semble nécessaire .
Cordialement , Yann 18 mars 2010 à 07:53 ( UTC )
Je pense que les sysops de Wikisource ne devraient pas prendre d’initiatives de nature à mettre en difficulté la Fondation et ses avocats .
ThomasV 17 mars 2010 à 16:14 ( UTC )
Ne parlant pas Anglais quelqu'un pourrait - il traduire le courriel de Mike ci-dessus cité ?
Est-ce que les droits des auteurs français ont la même durée pour les autres pays francophone ?
Quand est-il de la législation canadienne , belge , suisse etc .
Si la législation est différente , connait - on des éditeurs de ces pays qui les éditent sans reverser de droits à l'éditeur d'origine ?
Puisque les serveurs de wikisource sont aux états - unis , pourquoi n'est - ce pas la loi américaine qui s'appliquent .
Je sais beaucoup de question mais j'essaie simplement de comprendre .
Merci pour vos réponses -- Le ciel est par dessus le toit 17 mars 2010 à 17:32 ( UTC ) Christophe ( c'est moi ça ) , Merci d'informer l'administrateur qui restauré ces contenus que nous les avions supprimé sur conseil de nos avocats français , HugotAvocats , alors que nous discutions la plainte de Gallimard , informe le également que les actions entreprises unilatérallement par des administrateurs sans conseils peuvent mener à des problèmes légaux à la fois pour Wikimedia Foundation et pour Wikisource .
Les questions complémentaires peuvent être adressées à nos avocats français , HugotAvocats .
Ce message peut - être transmis si besoin est .
Oui et non , le problème , ici , est la notion de mort pour la France qui n'existe qu'en France .
Tu dois pouvoir en trouver
Le problème , ici , n'est pas de quelle législation s'applique mais d'éviter d'aller en justice .
Parce que la première étape serait un référé et , généralement , les juges prennent le moins de risque et demanderaient de retirer le contenus le temps de la procédure .
Je ne suis pas juriste , je ne peux donc te donner que ces réponses là .
Mais ici , le problème n'est pas de savoir qui a tort ou raison mais bien qu'une action légale a été entreprise , que WMF s'en occupe .
Que dans le cadre de sa réponse , il a été décidé de retiré temporairement , à titre conservatoire , les contenus litigieux .
A partir de là les admins n'ont , normalement et à mon avis , pas aller à l'encontre de l'hébergeur .
C'est faire courir des risques inutiles à Wikimedia Foundation Schiste 17 mars 2010 à 17:48 ( UTC )
Merci pour les éclaircissements , toutefois je reste dans le doute sur la décision à prendre , de plus qu'on ne nous as toujours pas fourni ici le texte de la demande de Gallimard .

Si Wikimédia avait consenti à nous parler de l'affaire , nous aurions su qu'elle n'était pas terminée mais toujours en cours ; nous aurions pu suggérer des lignes de défense , au moins concernant les auteurs morts en 1914 - 1915 , à ces Hugot Avocats , dont on ne sait s'ils connaissent bien la question .
La communication de Wikimédia avec ses contributeurs , qui construisent et font vivre les projets , n'a pas été très bonne sur ce coup ...
Enmerkar 18 mars 2010 à 08:33 ( UTC )
On est sur des échanges juridiques , c'est bordés et ça ne peut pas être public comme discussion .
Quant à la compétence d'HugotAvocats , ce sont des avocats en droit de la propriété intellectuelle et ils ont évité de nombreux procès aux projets Wikimedia depuis 2005 et gagnez les rares qui ont dû être plaidé .
Leurs compétences n'est pas à remettre en question .
Le seul problème ici , du côté WMF , c'est qu'ils auraient dû , au moment de la suppression , donner plus d'informations .
Comme l'a dit Pyb plus bas Wikimédia France a soulevé le problème en interne afin que la situation ne se reproduise plus .
Schiste 18 mars 2010 à 09:43 ( UTC )
En effet , l'enjeu nous dépasse .
Les éditeurs français sont en train de se décider ( dans la douleur ) à faire ce que leurs confrères américains ont fait avec Amazon - Kindle pour les nouveautés et feront bientôt avec Google Books pour le fonds : vendre au grand public des exemplaires numériques de leurs livres .
Ils voient avec épouvante la forteresse canadienne des 50 ans ; les juges canadiens refuseraient tout simplement d'entendre leur plainte contre un distributeur installé dans ce pays francophone ; celui-ci leur accorderait généreusement de refuser le produit à une IP française ( une plaisanterie ) .
Gallimard ( a - t - il été délégué par la profession ? ) lance un nuage d'encre contre Wikisource , qui fait partie de la galaxie Wikipédia , autant dire le diable en ligne pour les instruits français ( lisez Assouline dans Le Monde ) , pour essayer de créer l'insécurité .
Si la Fondation défend bien nos droits , je fais un don supplémentaire pour payer les avocats .

Je suis d'accord avec vous , la communication de Wikimedia Foundation avec ses contributeurs n'a pas été très bonne .
Wikimédia France l'a signalé et va suivre de près ce dossier .
Ne vous inquiétez pas , le cabinet d'avocats connait très bien nos projets et est à même de les défendre .
Je vous tiens au courant des avancées .
Pyb 18 mars 2010 à 09:11 ( UTC )
Histoire d’enfoncer le clou : je pense comme Schiste et Pyb qu’il faudrait re-supprimer tout les textes .
Il n’est pas question pour le moment de ce qui se trouve ou non dans le domaine public ( lequel et d’où d’ailleurs ? ) mais d’une possible action en justice que pourrait nous intenter Gallimard pour non respect de sa demande .
Si procès il y avait , l’issue serait incertaine et pas forcément à notre avantage ( y compris en terme d’image ) .
Alors que si nous re-supprimons , nous pourrons discuter plus sereinement avec la WMF , Gallimard , les avocats , etc .
Il y a eu plusieurs ratés dans cette histoire , notamment en terme de communication ( pour info WMfr n’a pas non plus été mis au courant par la WMF ) .
Maintenant que WMfr suit cette affaire , nous pourrons vous communiquer les éléments utiles et « défendre » cette affaire .

J'ai lu w:en : Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act .
En effet , si j'ai compris il vaut mieux que tout ce qui a été demandé soit supprimé , pour respecter la loi américaine qui protège les hébergeurs moyennant qu'ils suivent la procédure .
Tant pis pour le bon sens en France que je rappelais plus haut .
Et dans 14 jours , on les rétablir , histoire d'obliger Gallimard à aller plaider aux USA s'il veut vraiment faire quelque chose .

Ce n'est pas la Wikimedia Foundation qui communique sur son blog , mais l'association Wikimedia France .

Le texte est peut - être « constipé » comme tu dis , mais il vise simplement à donner de l'information sur cette affaire .

Deuxième suppression massive de textes , et maintenant on fait quoi ? on attend ?
On aimerait surtout avoir des nouvelles de ce qui se passe -- Le ciel est par dessus le toit 18 mars 2010 à 23:16 ( UTC )
C’est bien tristement que j’ai procédé à ces effacements dont il me semble qu’ils font du tort à un éditeur que j’apprécie beaucoup .
Mais peut - être que c’est une opération publicitaire qui pourrait être habile ; s’ils ménageaient un « coup de théâtre » où ils offriraient tout à coup généreusement aux enfants pauvres du monde entier ce qu’ils ont actuellement l’air de leur avoir retiré , qu’est - ce qu’on parlerait d’eux !
qu’est -ce qu’ils seraient populaires !
Il me semble qu’ils augmenteraient significativement leurs ventes en agissant ainsi .
Je peux toujours me bercer de l’illusion que c’est précisément ce qu’ils préparent …
-- Zyephyrus 19 mars 2010 à 00:17 ( UTC ) FYI , c’est moi qui ai redemandé à Zyephyrus la re-suppression ( mais je ne suis pas le seul ) .
Vu qu’aucun de nous ne possède de connaissances juridiques suffisamment solides pour pouvoir trancher de façon certaine la question ou aller gagner un procès , on doit attendre les conseils des avocats .
Or si on veut trouver une solution avec Gallimard , inutile de les braquer en commençant par ne pas respecter leur takedown notice .
Donc paradoxalement , les supprimer maintenant augmente les chances de pouvoir les restaurer plus tard .
Cdlt , V IGNERON * discut . 19 mars 2010 à 08:17 ( UTC )
Je ne me braque pas , j'essaie de comprendre c'est pourquoi je ne me prononce pas sur le fait que les textes doivent être supprimés ou pas .
Je fais confiance à ceux qui ont en charge la gestion de ce problème , Moi ce que je souhaiterai ce sont des infos précises ( Le soucis c'est que je ne parle pas anglais alors les liens vers la politique de la wikimedia fondation en ce qui concernent ce genre de demande ne me sont pas accessibles ) .

Euh , je ne pense pas avoir dis que tu te braquais ( si c’est le cas , désolé ) .
Je parlais en tout cas , de ne pas braquer Gallimard .
Honnêtement , ce n’est pas clair .
C’est pour cela que la Foundation a ( apparemment ) demandé plus d’explications à Gallimard .
La politique de la WMF est la même que celles des autres , quand on reçoit une mise en demeure on la respecte ( ou alors - ce n’est pas notre cas - on a des arguments bétons , et encore ) .
Cdlt , V IGNERON * discut . 19 mars 2010 à 12:33 ( UTC )
Ne sois pas désolé pour si peu , attendons les explications de Gallimard comme ta sagesse nous le préconise -- Le ciel est par dessus le toit 19 mars 2010 à 12:46 ( UTC ) Justement si , nous avons un « argument béton » : le passage d'Alain - Fournier dans le domaine public en septembre 2009 .
Pourquoi les autres , tués avant ou un peu après , ne le seraient - ils pas aussi ?
Enmerkar 19 mars 2010 à 13:14 ( UTC )
Comme je le disais : même avec un argument béton , on ne brise pas une mise en demeure .
Pour Alain - Fournier , on a une jurisprudence solide ?
( pas que je saches mais je peux me tromper ) .
Cdlt , V IGNERON * discut . 19 mars 2010 à 16:10 ( UTC )
Le fait que des éditeurs se soient emparés d'Alain - Fournier dès la fin de l'année dernière est un acte très fort , une jurisprudence de fait qu'il faudrait parvenir à transformer en jurisprudence complète .
Enmerkar 19 mars 2010 à 16:55 ( UTC )
Je crois que c'est être naïf de croire que Gallimard cédera quoique ce soit si on est gentil avec eux , et que l'on retire les textes pendant les pourparlers juridiques préalables .
Son but est précisément de ne céder rien du tout , et d'affirmer applicable à la terre entière la législation française .
Gallimard a déjà agit ainsi avec
Les classiques des sciences sociales , il y a 5 ou 6 ans , notamment sur Gaston Bachelard .
Les classiques avaient cédé : ils ne disposent pas des moyens de la Wikipédia fondation .
Il n'y a strictement aucune raison de céder à Gallimard .
La fondation est de droit américain ; les lecteurs de Wikisource n'habitent pas exclusivement la France ( loin s'en faut ) .
Tout ce qu'on peut leur accorder est de bloquer l'accès depuis le territoire français à ces textes , comme le fait , par exemple , le site Ebook libres et gratuits .
Pour le reste , je compte au contraire sur la Fondation pour s'opposer à ces demandes abusives et permettre aux francophones du monde entier de ne pas subir les desiderata de Gallimard , en établissant un précédent : à la différence de beaucoup , la Fondation en a les moyens et , sur d'autres affaires ( les photos du British Museum , e.g. ) , elle a montré qu'elle en avait le désir , et que ce désir conduisait à transformer , pour le mieux , les lignes légales .
Gede 21 mars 2010 à 21:09 ( UTC )
Ou bien c'est parce que je ne suis pas en France ( je passe sous la Grande Muraille par un VPN qui me met aux USA ) , mais Gaston Bachelard est annoncé pour 2012 , 50 ans après sa mort en 1962 , sur w: Les classiques des sciences sociales .
Aussi bien , sauf erreur , Bachelard est principalement un auteur PUF ( Presses universitaires de France , dont la tentative d'intimidation en 2003 avait échoué en son temps ) .
Alain , auteur PUF mort en 1951 , est en ligne sur CSS , avec une notice sur les 50 ans / 70 ans .
La psychanalyse du feu de Bachelard , qui n'est pas annoncé par CSS , est édité par Gallimard ( Folio 1985 ) .
Pas pu vérifier sur le site Gallimard , il est hors service la nuit ( fuseau horaire de Paris ) .
-- Wuyouyuan - D - C 22 mars 2010 à 01:14 ( UTC )
Tu as raison : c'était bien les PUF , et non Gallimard .
L'épisode date de 2003 , et ma mémoire ( j'écrivais de mémoire ) a confondu .
La mise en demeure concernait tous les auteurs PUF soumis au droit de 70 ans valable en France .
Et , au final , contrairement à mon souvenir , Les classiques n'ont pas cédé ( sauf sur Bachelard , où ils étaient dans leur tort : du moins j'ai souvenir qu'il était accessible jusqu'à cette épisode , mais cela remonte à 7 ans ! ) : tous les auteurs PUF rentrés dans le domaine public au Canada , mais non en France ( comme Alain ou Mauss ) sont accessibles .
Je ne vois donc pas pourquoi la Fondation céderait , là où Les Classiques , pourtant bien plus fragiles , ne l'ont pas fait .
Il me semble que la situation est fondamentalement similaire .
Gede 22 mars 2010 à 06:08 ( UTC )
Il y a une différence : Jean - Marie Tremblay est un prophète irascible , et les fondateurs de la Fondation ( à qui je suis très reconnaisant ) , comme tous les révolutionnaires qui ont réussi , sont tentés par l'Institution .
-- Wuyouyuan - D - C 22 mars 2010 à 06:31 ( UTC )
Bonjour , Si Mike avait dit que c'était une mesure préventive pour 15 jours , je n'aurais pas restauré les textes .
Maintenant il n'y a plus qu'à attendre pour voir si Gallimard confirme ses prétentions ou pas .
Yann 23 mars 2010 à 11:16 ( UTC )
B [ modifier ]
Bonjour à tous ( et merci , Wuyouyuan , de m'avoir signalé la question ) ,
Un peu d'humeur , d'abord : il est grave que l'argument des utilisateurs français serve à faire appliquer le droit français , ou européen , aux États - Unis .
Cela mène tout droit à l'acceptation du droit américain en France ( qui est beaucoup plus protecteur que le nôtre , dans le domaine phonique ... ) .
Heureusement que le Canada cherche encore à être indépendant !
( Et pourvu que cela dure . )
Mais , bien sûr , les citoyens français ici pourraient trouver cela légitime , si la loi française était tout à fait respectée .
Je ne prétends pas être juriste , mais vu les lois et la jurisprudence de la Cour de Cassation , il paraît clair que les œuvres des auteurs morts pour la France :
morts en 1914 sont tombées dans le DP en Octobre 2009 ( Alain - Fournier , Péguy , Mirmont )
morts en 1915 tomberont dans le DP en Oct. 2010 ( Pergaud )
morts en 1916 tomberont dans le DP en Oct. 2011
morts en 1917 tomberont dans le DP en Oct. 2012
morts en 1918 tomberont dans le DP en Oct. 2013 ( Apollinaire , quoique de la grippe )
morts en 1919 tomberont dans le DP en Oct. 2014 ( Segalen , quoique ce soit probablement fallacieux , mais un jugement est un jugement !)
Calcul : 50 + 14 & 272 j + 30 = 94 ans & 272 jours .
Attention , certains enterrent un peu vite les prorogations de guerre !
Ceci ne vaut que pour les œuvres de ces auteurs publiées avant le 01/01/1920 .
Celles publiées après sont déjà dans le DP ( 50 + 8 & 120 j + 30 = 88a & 120 j pour les œuvres ( posthumes ! ) publiées de 1921 à 1947 , 50 + 30 = 80 ans pour celles publiées après ) .
Mais si l'on veut vraiment savoir , et rendre clair pour tous , si la loi française dit bien cela , ou alors si le calcul 70 + 30 = 100 est légitime ( et en ce cas , Péguy comme Alain - Fournier seraient protégés jusqu'au 01/01/2015 ) , alors il faut aller au procès !
Ce serait un service à rendre à l'intérêt général et à la Culture , ce dont notre ministère éponyme ne se préoccupe guère ...
( À quand un poste de Défenseur du Domaine public ! ) ---
Chéplou 19 mars 2010 à 11:50 ( UTC )
Justement non , ce n’est pas clair .
C’est pourquoi on doit laisser faire les avocats !
et donc en attendant , on ne touche à rien ( cela pourrait nous ê tre reprocher à titre collectif ou individuel ) .
Simple exemple : à ma connaissance , aucun textes ou auteurs ne s’élève ( ou tombe ) dans le DP durant l’année mais uniquement au premier janvier ( donc pas octobre 2010 mais janvier 2011 ) .
Cdlt , V IGNERON * discut . 19 mars 2010 à 12:28 ( UTC ) Pourquoi à chaque fois en octobre ?
Cela dépend de la date de décès de l'auteur .
Pergaud a dû tomber dans le domaine public en janvier ou février .
Puisqu'il a été établi qu'Alain - Fournier est passé dans le domaine public en septembre ou octobre , c'est que dans ce cas il n'est pas nécessaire d'attendre le début de l'année suivante .
Sinon , ce n'aurait pas été la peine de dire " 94 ans et 272 jours " .
Enmerkar 19 mars 2010 à 13:17 ( UTC )
Cela prouve bien que ce n’est pas clair !
En fait , si je me souviens bien , le compte commence au premier janvier suivant la mort d’un auteur ( mea culpa donc ) .
Vu que la plupart du temps , le compte se fait en année , ça tombe souvent au premier janvier .
Du coup , ça peut aussi expliquer le fait qu’avec les prolongations ( dont l’interprétation du calcul diffèrent selon les spécialistes ) tombe tout en octobre .
Cdlt , V IGNERON * discut . 19 mars 2010 à 16:13 ( UTC )
Effectivement , la durée se calcule à partir du 1er janvier suivant le décès de l'auteur .
Voir le CPI , art .
L123 - 1 .
Pour les œuvres soumises aux prorogations des 2 guerres , cela donne très exactement 1er janvier + 272 jours = 30 septembre ( ou 29 sept. les années bissextiles ) .
Pour les œuvres publiées entre 1921 et 1948 , cela donne 1er janvier + 120 jours = 1er mai ( ou 30 avril ) .
Il faut lire tout l'article L123 !
C'est peut - être long à saisir ( du moins , ça l'a été pour moi ... ) , mais très clair , je persiste .
J'aimerais bien connaître les différences de calcul desdits spécialistes .
--- Chéplou 19 mars 2010 à 23:18 ( UTC )
En effet , je n'avais pas fait attention , vous avez raison ; sinon , Alain - Fournier serait passé dans le domaine public en juillet 2009 .
Enmerkar 20 mars 2010 à 08:23 ( UTC )
Il me semble que la thèse 70+30 est fondée sur une lecture littérale du code français de la propriété intellectuelle sans tenir compte de la directive européenne que les députés - qui font fort mal leur travail - sont pourtant censés avoir transcrite dans ledit code .
La thèse 50+30+14+272 j se baserait quant à elle sur une interprétation de l'article 10 de la directive de la communauté européenne n° 93/98 du 29 octobre 1993 qui traite du maintien des droits acquis : Lorsque une durée de protection plus longue [ 50+30 +14+272 j en France pour certains auteurs ] que la durée de protection correspondante prévue à la présente directive [ 70 ans ( article 1er de la directive ) ] a commencé déjà à courir dans un État membre à la date visée à l'article 13 paragraphe 1 [ 1er juillet 1995 ] , la présente directive n'a pas pour effet de la raccourcir dans cet État membre .

14 jours après [ modifier ]
Le délai prévu par la loi des Etats - Unis Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act dont relèvent les serveurs de la fondation Wikimedia est écoulé , deux semaines après le 19 mars , date de retrait des derniers textes visés par la sommation de Gallimard a french société anonyme .
Gallimard a -t - il engagé une procédure devant la juridiction compétente ( un tribunal fédéral si j'ai compris la loi ) ?
Si non , il faut rétablir les textes sans autre délai ; si oui , c'est une bonne occasion pour la Fondation de faire rejeter pour mauvaise foi ( Péguy , Pergaud , sans parler des autres ) ou ignorance de la loi les prétentions d'un petit commerçant français abusif .
Je crois savoir que dans une autre affaire , où le simple bon sens n'était pas vraiment du côté de la Fondation ( London National Portrait Gallery , voir ) , la Fondation n'a pas hésité à faire valoir son droit , qu'elle avait énoncé auparavant .

J'ai l'impression peu agréable que la Fondation considère Wikisource et sa communauté de contributeurs comme quelque chose de marginal à côté de la masse des contributeurs d'images de Common , et que la littérature ne pèse pas lourd à côté du gros trafic de Wikipedia .
J'espère me tromper .
Pourtant le précédent de la National Portrait Gallery ( des images ) m'avait fait espérer une position plus tranchée .
Les prétentions des étrangers à faire la loi aux Etats - Unis sont rejetées avec la plus grande brutalité aussi bien par les juges fédéraux que par les jurys populaires .
Et , pour le plaisir , je rappelle que les prétentions abusives auprès d'un hébergeur ( concernant Péguy , Pergaud , et très probablement Segalen qui est en ligne sur Gallica ) sont punies par la loi en France .
-- Wuyouyuan - D - C 8 avril 2010 à 01:26 ( UTC )
Non , tu ne te trompes pas .
Les contributeurs de Wikisource n'existent pas ( à part comme travailleurs gratuits ) aux yeux de la Fondation qui prend ses décisions seule dans son coin .
C'est comme ça d'une manière générale , la Fondation est un truc obscur et arbitraire géré par on ne sait qui et honnêtement c'est plutôt inquiétant .
90.25.150.98 9 avril 2010 à 11:44 ( UTC )
Pour contre - balancer l'avis de l'IP parano , voici mon commentaire : ce genre de plainte ne se règle pas en quelques jours .
Cela peut durer des mois ou des années .
Il faut donc patienter , d'autant que les avocats et les responsables juridiques ne communiquent pas .
Certains sites ou blogueurs s'amusent à révéler le contenu des lettres qu'on leur adresse .
Cela peut fonctionner sur un dossier , mais ça ne fait pas fonctionner un site sur le long terme , ce qui est le but des sites Wikimedia .

Personnellement mis en cause [ modifier ]
Pour info , je viens de recevoir un mail des avocats de Gallimard me mettant personnellement en cause .
Voici la liste des textes dont Gallimard revendique les droits : Fichier : Liste des auteurs Gallimard - Wikisource -08042010.doc.pdf
Yann 8 avril 2010 à 16:04 ( UTC )
Ce qui est intéressant , c'est que l'on apprend d'où vient la prétention de Gallimard sur les textes de Louis Pergaud : ils se sont trompés sur sa date de décès .
Ils ont apparemment abandonné leurs prétentions sur les œuvres de Jean de La Ville de Mirmont , Charles Péguy , Jean - Pierre Calloc'h .
Yann 8 avril 2010 à 17:46 ( UTC )
Leur calcul est bien " 94 ans et 272 jours " ; la bonne nouvelle est donc que La Ville de Mirmont et Charles Péguy sont dans le domaine public , Pergaud le sera en octobre 2010 .
La mauvaise nouvelle , en revanche , c'est qu'ils ne reculent même pas devant les mises en cause personnelles ...
Enmerkar 8 avril 2010 à 17:52 ( UTC )
Cette liste révèle quelque chose : une partie des auteurs ne sont pas édités chez Gallimard , sauf à considérer que Claude Lévi-Strauss ( refusé par Gallimard à ses débuts , édité par Plon ) est devenu un auteur Gallimard depuis qu'il est dans la Pléiade .
Donc suspicion d'une démarche collective de l'édition française .
Et les avocats de Gallimard vont-ils assigner La Bibliothèque nationale pour les oeuvres de la liste qui sont en ligne sur Gallica ?
A part ça , envoyer un mail à quelqu'un au lieu d'une lettre recommandée , ça s'appelle de la tentative d'intimidation , pas de la procédure .

Si , si , on peut faire quelque chose : en parler à chaque occasion , en commentaire des articles de journaux en ligne qui parlent de littérature , chaque fois que le sujet s'y prête .

Proposition naive [ modifier ]
Bonsoir ,
Le site ebooksgratuit ( http://www.ebooksgratuits.com/) est confronté à la même situation au niveau des différentes législations .
Ils ont opté pour un " bridage " au niveau des adresses IP .
Ainsi , on ne peut pas accéder aux oeuvres de Colette depuis la France alors qu'elles sont consultables depuis le Canada .
Est-ce qu'une solution technique semblable est applicable ici et ne pourrait - elle pas satisfaire toutes les parties ?
Depuis l'invention des sites relais et des VPN , c'est devenu futile .
Selon mon humeur , je me transporte en Grande - Bretagne , aux USA , au Canada , ou à Hong - Kong , rien qu'en le demandant .
-- Wuyouyuan - D - C 10 avril 2010 à 07:11 ( UTC )
En faisant court : si un utilisateur modifie son adresse IP , il est en cause , pas Wikisource ( et accessoirement la modification de l’IP est quasiment indétectable ) .
Donc cela restreint très fortement les actions légales possibles ( et les problèmes qui vont avec ) .
Je pense que ce genre de solution serait une excellente chose .

Expérience ebooksgratuits.com [ modifier ]
Bonsoir ,
Vous devez vous douter que je suis avec attention cette affaire , et si je me suis abstenu d'en parler publiquement , c'est uniquement parce que la fondation a fait le choix des négociations secrètes , choix qui n'est pas fait pour m'étonner et que je ne commenterai pas ici .
Nous avons en effet une certaine expérience de la question , puisque la première mise en demeure reçue date de 2005 ...
Mais je pense que la situation économique de l'ebook est différente en 2010 et qu'il est clair que l'édition française , obsédée par le piratage et toutes les atteintes possibles au droit d'auteur vu par Gallimard and co , veut faire " place nette " , en se disant bêtement que tout livre électronique qui ne sera pas téléchargé sur les sites gratuits , sera acheté ...
C'est parce que nous en avions marre d'être harcelés , mis en cause personnellement , etc c'est parce que nous étions seuls , isolés , sans avocats , et que nous savions ne pas pouvoir compter sur l'aide de Projet Gutenberg ou Wikimedia ( les seuls à pouvoir se payer des avocats ... ) que nous avons mis en place le filtrage , même si je continue à penser que nous étions dans notre droit avant et que le filtrage est un abus .
Nous attendons donc de voir comment tout cela va évoluer ...
Enfin , pour Wuyouyuan , je te prie de croire que la grande majorité des gens ne connait pas les sites relais ( qui fonctionnent par ailleurs assez mal quand ils sont gratuits ) et les VPN , et que les filtres géographiques sont d'une redoutable efficacité , nous avons pu le vérifier avec nos statistiques de téléchargement par livre , avant et après filtre .
Je ne pense pas que cette solution soit possible techniquement pour Wikisource ( ou du moins , je ne vois pas comment ) .

Autant pour moi .
Je vis au milieu d'internautes pour qui le tunnel sous la Grande Muraille fait partie de la vie quotidienne ( 翻墙 fanqiang renverser le mur ) et je finis par oublier que la plupart des gens n'en ont pas besoin .
Les wikisourciens connaissent , quand il faut aller chercher sur Google Books quelque chose qui est réservé aux Américains .
Avec celui-ci on se retrouve dans la banlieue de Washington D.C .
Quant aux éditeurs français , si au moins ils vendaient leurs livres en téléchargement sur Amazon et équivalents , mais même pas ; essayez donc de trouver où le Prix Goncourt de cette année est en vente ( il l'est , mais il faut trouver , et il est plus cher qu'en papier ! ) -- Wuyouyuan - D - C 11 avril 2010 à 11:58 ( UTC )
Chez les confrères de la diffusion gratuite :
Ce site , commercial et qui ne s'en cache pas , a Guillaume Apollinaire en e-book .
Wikisource qui se contente d'afficher les textes serait donc plus dangereux .

Lettre à Gallimard [ modifier ]
Voici une copie de ma lettre à Gallimard .
Yann 3 mai 2010 à 14:22 ( UTC )
Je réponds tardivement , n'ayant pas un accès Internet permanent actuellement .
Vous avez sans doute vérifié que les textes mentionnés ont été supprimés .
Je me permets de vous donner quelques conseils qui , en toute franchise , seraient utiles pour vous - même et pour votre client , l'éditeur Gallimard .
1. Certains des textes mentionnés sont dans le domaine public en France .
Il s'agit notamment des oeuvres de Charles Péguy et Jean de La Ville de Mirmon .
La date de décès de Louis Pergaud est fausse dans votre lettre .
Il est décédé en 1915 .
2. Certains de ces textes sont disponibles sur le site de la Bibliothèque Nationale de France .
Gallimard va-t - il assigner la BNF en procès ?
3 . Le texte de Jean Giono " L’Homme qui plantait des arbres " a été explicitement mis dans le domaine public par l'auteur .
Cette information est amplement disponible sur Internet .
4 . Les lecteurs des textes supprimés ne se limitent heureusement pas à la France .
Les textes sont publiés dans un serveur situé aux États - Unis , et destinés à un public mondial .
Il n'y a aucune raison que le droit français s'applique , sinon de satisfaire les vues mercantiles de Gallimard .
Il serait souhaitable que Gallimard ait une vue moins étriquée des amateurs de littérature française .
Le rôle d'un éditeur est de vendre de la littérature ou de l’information et non simplement du papier .
Je prédis un déclin de tout éditeur qui n'aurait pas compris cela à l'heure de l'Internet et de la mondialisation .
5 . Je ne pense pas que Gallimard perde des clients si des textes sont publiés sur Internet .
Par contre , la réputation de Gallimard ne s'en est pas trouvée grandie .
Votre client fait une très mauvaise opération de relations publiques dans cette affaire .
6 . Gallimard n'est même pas capable d'offrir une alternative commerciale aux internautes qui souhaitent lire ces textes en ligne .
Il serait plus utile que Gallimard recherche des partenariats avec des sites publiant des textes .
Je permettrais de publier à nouveau ces textes .
J'attends une réponse de votre part .
7 . La plupart des textes dans le domaine public publiés par Gallimard , le sont au moins avec mauvaise foi , car Gallimard ne mentionne jamais que le texte est dans le domaine public .
Ce serait la moindre honnêteté que de le faire .
8 . Je me permets de vous signaler que la prétention abusive de droits d'auteur est un délit : Article 6.I alinéa 4 de la loi du 21 juin 2004 ( LCEN ) : " 4 .
Le fait , pour toute personne , de présenter aux personnes mentionnées au 2 un contenu ou une activité comme étant illicite dans le but d'en obtenir le retrait ou d'en faire cesser la diffusion , alors qu'elle sait cette information inexacte , est puni d'une peine d'un an d'emprisonnement et de 15 000 € d'amende .
" Cela concerne notamment les textes de Charles Péguy , Jean de La Ville de Mirmon , et de Jean Giono mentionnés ci-dessus .
Gallimard propose , au même prix que le papier ou même plus cher , quelques unes de ses nouveautés en numérique .
La revue NRF est en cours de numérisation et les années 1930 sont proposées à 14,50 euros le numéro (! ) .
Quant au domaine public , tous les éditeurs , pas seulement Gallimard , défient le bon sens en vendant le numérique au prix du livre de poche papier .
On comprend qu'ils se battent contre le domaine public .
Et la presse est avec eux .
Récemment , un article du Monde sur les liseuses relatait l'expérience du rédacteur sur Kindle , Sony Reader etc ... avec un exemplaire de Jules Verne acheté pour quelques euros sur un site commercial .
L'article ne disait rien de Ebooks - gratuits qui fournit exactement le même produit .
Comme il est difficile d'imaginer que le rédacteur était ignorant , c'est qu'il avait des consignes .
Pour rire un peu , évoquons la cartouche de jeu Nintendo 100 classiques , vendue 30 euros .
Gallimard a contribué , avec des textes repris sur Project Gutemberg ( non crédité ) , identifiables sans discussion par quelques coquilles .
Je trouve que la Fondation ( puisque nous - mêmes , simples usagers de son service d'hébergement , ne sommes pas partie à l'affaire ) est bien timide .
C'est pourtant une cause d'intérêt public .
Sinon , je crains qu'on verra très vite un projet de législation qui protégera les contenus du domaine public repris et vendus par un éditeur , contre la diffusion gratuite des mêmes contenus -- Wuyouyuan - discuter 4 mai 2010 à 02:24 ( UTC )
Merci
Yann de nous tenir informé de ton affaire avec Gallimard , sois assuré de mon soutien ( je sais , ce n'est pas grand chose ! ) .
Et du côté de l'affaire Wikisource vs Gallimard , quelqu'un a - t - il des nouvelles ?
les contacts sont - ils constructifs , y'a - t - il des avancés ou pas ?
des pronostics sur la date éventuelle de fin de conflit ?
Nous n'avons pas d'informations supplémentaires de la Foundation sur cette affaire .

Ouch , that hurt !
Now give me lots of money ( a sample of inane lawsuits )
I live in Orange County and there has been a relatively big story lately about an accident that occurred in one of the local harbors .
The harbors here have several byways in the form of channels lined with docks and homes .
They are all “ no - wake ” zones and littered with low bridges .
A few months ago , a few morons left a bar , hopped into a speedboat , and proceeded to boat down one of these channels at high speed .
As they went under one of the bridges , the boat made it and the men did n’t .
I believe the accident killed two of them and seriously injured a third .
Now remember , all three men were very intoxicated and committed a felony just by driving the boat .
I usually do n’t wish to speak ill of the recently deceased , but this case is Darwinesque .
Well , the families of the two men are suing the city for millions of dollars for failure to post a “ low bridge ” sign .
Unbelievable .
These idiots got drunk , got in a boat , went down a channel well above the posted speed limit , ran into a bridge , and it ’s the city ’s fault ?
The sad thing is , they ’ll probably just settle out of court and the families will have a bunch of money to help forget about the deaths of their loved ones .
Pitiful .
It seems to be the American way these days .
We have become such a litigious society that everyone is suing anyone for the most inane reasons .
Here are some of the most ridiculous examples .
So much for truth in advertising
In 1991 , a Michigan man sued the large brewer for false advertising and mental anguish .
Citing a commercial in which two women come to life for a couple of Budweiser drinkers , he was angry that he was n’t experiencing the same fantasy .
Because he ’s an idiot and tried to make this happen so often , he also sued for financial loss .
The case was dismissed by the judge .
Maybe he really wanted to be rear - ended
This one , also in Michigan , involves a 27 year old man who was the victim of a minor car accident .
Several years later , the man sued the person who hit him claiming that the accident changed his sexuality .
You read that right .
He said that since the accident he was no longer sexually attracted to his wife , moved in with his parents , and started frequenting gay bars .
You see !
All Ted Haggard had to do was get into a small accident to cure his gayness .
That would have been much faster .
Since you ’re suing everyone , sue yourself too
When you ’re in prison serving a 23 year sentence , I guess there ’s nothing left to lose .
In 1995 , a prisoner sued himself for $ 5 million .
He said that because he allowed himself to get drunk and commit grand larceny , he violated his civil rights and religious beliefs .
His idea was that since he was a ward of the state , the state would have to pay any damages awarded to him .
The judge had himself a little chuckle and threw out the case .
Did you ever think of looking out the window ?
A woman was watching the local news waiting for the weather report .
After some mindless banter and lame jokes , the prediction was for sunny weather .
She went out without a coat and got caught in a downpour .
She subsequently caught a flu bug , missed four days of work , and had to buy some NyQuil .
She sued for $ 1000 for that and mental duress .
That ’s a frisky pool !
This one happened overseas , but it just means that there are crazy people elsewhere as well .
A woman sued an Egyptian hotel because she claimed the swimming pool at the hotel got her 13 - year - old daughter pregnant .
She said that there must have been sperm floating in the pool because her daughter “ did not meet any boys on the trip ” .
Sure .
Maybe ignorance is bliss , maybe apathy or bad parenting is to blame .
Either way , this woman must have failed every biology class she ever took .
If it ’s triple - ply , it could be dangerous
A man in Alabama sued a Wendy ’s because “ unreasonably dangerous toilet paper dispensers . ”
Hold on while I try to contain my laughter .
OK , better .
Anyways , he said that a roll of toilet paper dislodged from the dispenser and seriously injured him .
Now , I toilet papered my fair share of houses when I was a kid .
I guess that time when the roll hit me in the face ( that I barely noticed ) I should have feigned injury and sued my friend .
An act of God ?
Not is this guy has anything to say
Ernie Chambers is a senator from Nebraska .
Pay close attention to that , because that means he is a man of the people and a smart one at that , right ?
Well , maybe not .
You see , Senator Chambers decided that his state was being targeted by natural disasters .
They must have been small ones , because I did n’t hear about any .
Well , he took it to court and sued God .
The senator claims that the defendant , who at the risk of sounding redundant is God , directly and proximately has caused , inter alia , fearsome floods , egregious earthquakes , horrendous hurricanes , terrifying tornados , and pestilential plagues . ”
While that may or may not be true , the judge would n’t hear the case because the defendant would n’t show up for a hearing .
Chambers attempted to base his ability to sue God as , “ the defendant , being omnipresent , is personally present in Douglas County . ”
“ No dice ” said the judge .
Last week , the Lincoln Near - Earth Asteroid Research ( LINEAR ) sky survey program , designed to sweep the heavens looking for near - Earth asteroids , spotted something really weird ; an elongated streak that looked as if two asteroids had collided .
Just days later , Hubble was pointed at the object , and what it saw was really really weird :
[ Click to armageddonate . ]
This is a false - color image showing the object , called P/2010 A2 , in visible light .
The long tail of debris is obvious ; this is probably dust being blown back by the solar wind , similar to the way a comet 's tail is blown back .
What apparently has happened is that two small , previously - undiscovered asteroids collided , impacting with a speed of at least 5 km / sec ( and possibly faster ) .
The energy in such a collision is like setting off a nuclear bomb , or actually many nuclear bombs !
The asteroids shattered , and much of the debris expanded outward as pulverized dust .
Now , let me just take a moment and say HOLY HALEAKALA WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS THE COLLISION BETWEEN TWO PREVIOUSLY UNDISCOVERED ASTEROIDS THAT EXPLODED LIKE THERMONUCLEAR WEAPONS WHEN THEY IMPACTED !!!
Phew .
OK , I feel better .
I needed to get that off my chest .
First off , to be clear we 're in no danger from this event .
It was really far away ( in human terms ; 140 million km or 90 million miles -- the object 's orbit keeps it farther from the Sun than Mars -- so we 're not about to get pummeled with debris .
And while the explosion energy was quite large -- certainly much larger than any weapon ever detonated on Earth -- it was n't radioactive , in case you 're worried about that sort of thing .
This was a kinetic explosion , caused by a high - speed collision , and not an actual detonation of any kind .
Looking at the image , the bright spot to the left is most likely what 's left of one of the two asteroids , a chunk of rock estimated to be a mere 140 meters ( 450 feet ) across .
In the press release they 're not clear about the curved line emanating to the right of the nucleus .
It may be -- and I 'm spitballing here -- dust blown back from a stream of chunks , since the tail is broad and appears to originate from that swept curve , and not from the nucleus itself .
The other filament perpendicular to the curve is from yet another piece of debris .
Despite how much this looks like a comet , ground - based observations indicate no gas is present , meaning this was from asteroids colliding , not comets , which have significant amounts of ice which turn to gas near the Sun .
The collision energy was high enough to produce a lot of gas if any were present .
That clinches this being an asteroid impact .
Also , the orbit of the object indicates it's an asteroid , and it appears to be part of a well - known group of asteroids called the Flora family , which share similar orbital characteristics , and are probably remnants themselves of an ancient breakup of a much larger parent asteroid .
Nothing like this has ever been seen before .
Sure , Hubble and about a hundred other telescopes observed the comet Shoemaker - Levy 9 slam in to Jupiter in 1994 , but that was different than seeing two asteroids hit .
Asteroids are small , and very very far apart on average ( do n't believe scenes like that in " Empire Strikes Back " ) , so a collision like this is extremely rare , and catching it from such a great vantage point rarer still .
But we have a lot of eyes on the sky , and the more we watch the more we 'll see .
And we 'd better .
An object 140 meters across hitting the Earth would , to be technical , suck .
Hard .
Whatever caused Meteor Crater in Arizona , an impact scar over a kilometer across , was itself probably about 40 meters across .
An object like 2010 A2 , which is three times the diameter , would have 20 - 30 times the mass , and do considerably more damage .
I 'm glad groups like LINEAR are out there patrolling the skies for such things .
We need to learn as much as we can about these asteroids , so that we can prevent the next Meteor Crater from occurring .
Two and a half years after the official start of the worst economic downturn and fiscal crisis in nearly 80 years , America 's economy is supposedly growing again , the stock market is halfway recovered from the lows of 2008 and early 2009 , and the unemployment plunge seems to have been halted .
Yet , built - in time lags in how revenues are raised and budgets calculated mean that many states and cities around the country are only now starting to feel the worst of the pain .
This year has been , quite simply , abysmal for local and state governments , and next year promises to be even worse .
With easy cuts long - ago made , these days basic services are increasingly seen as luxuries , and public sector employees are increasingly vulnerable to wage cuts , benefits rollbacks , and unemployment .
While the federal government has considerable wiggle room to borrow or simply increase the supply of money to help fight its way out of financial collapse , smaller government units in America do n't have those options ; increasingly cities , counties and states are facing the sorts of austerity measures we 've come to associate with third world countries in crisis , or , in recent years , with vulnerable European nations such as Greece or Latvia .
In Arizona , a cash - pinched legislature put the Capitol building up for sale , proposing to lease it back for state use .
In the small Colorado town of Colorado Springs , officials shut off half the street lamps and one - third of the traffic lights , told residents who wanted short grass in public parks to bring their own lawnmowers , and auctioned off a police helicopter on eBay .
Around the country , libraries have been shuttered , after - school programmes have been curtailed , mental health services have been decimated .
In Los Angeles , the nation 's second largest metropolis , the Democratic mayor , Antonio Villaraigosa , addressed a full session of the city council on 9 February to detail just how grim the city 's finances had become .
Miguel Santana , the city administrative officer ( the CAO is the mayor and council 's chief financial adviser ) had recently informed the mayor 's office that LA was facing a $ 200 m shortfall through the end of this financial year and another half billion dollar - plus shortfall in the years to come if it did n't radically , and rapidly , restructure its budget .
Santana did n't mince words .
His nearly 300 - page report ( pdf ) opened with this stark warning :
" The city is facing a budget crisis unlike any it has ever experienced …
The enormity of our current fiscal crisis forces the City to take swift action now and lay out a financial plan for the future . "
Wall Street was growing increasingly worried by the city 's financial fragility , and the city 's ability to raise revenues through bond sales was at risk .
Why the crunch ?
According to city council president Eric Garcetti's office , for the past four quarters , the city has seen double - digit revenue declines , a scenario not experienced since the darkest days of the Great Depression .
Quite simply , the downturn was so steep it had made government - as - normal impossible to maintain in the City of Angels .
As a result , says Garcetti , the city will face a crisis of funding for the next several years as well as an increasingly bitter battle of ideas as to the role of government in modern - day America ; for conservatives , he warns it will likely be seen as an opportunity to starve the public sector , to " downsize government so much it can never come back . "
Los Angeles ' budget , currently around $ 7bn per year , will , all parties agree , shrink for years to come .
And , since much of that $ 7bn is committed to untouchable items – making sure pensions are paid , keeping the LAPD afloat – the hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts will fall overwhelmingly on employees and on discretionary services .
And these are services that disproportionately are used by lower income residents – the very people who have already been hit the hardest by the broader economic meltdown .
The city has already negotiated with public sector unions to ease 2,400 employees ( out of a city workforce of about 40,000 ) into early retirement , is working to immediately reduce the city 's payrolls by another one thousand , and is exploring how to make more cuts down the road that could lead to a couple of thousand additional job losses – or , if the mayor and Garcetti's vision of " shared sacrifice " is implemented , to fewer job cuts but across - the - board pay reductions instead .
" For me , government matters , " says Garcetti .
" Workers matter .
Services matter . "
Inevitably , however , the crisis will in some ways shrink the role of city government .
At the same time as the city is negotiating concessions from unions , it is also exploring " private - public partnerships " that would hand the city 's zoo , convention centre , parking garages and even parking meters to private operators .
And it has already eliminated two city departments – environmental affairs and human services – with more likely to follow , hoping to seamlessly amalgamate their functions into other departments .
Yet in reality , there is very little that is seamless about these budget readjustments .
The job losses are adding to LA 's already great economic pain – the city has a more than 11 % unemployment rate ; even with progressives occupying key positions in the city 's political leadership , the evisceration of core public services will , over the years to come , impact the quality of life of most Angelenos ; and the privatisation of venues such as the zoo and the convention centre will harm the city 's long - term ability to raise sufficient revenue to meet its growing needs .
The broader economy may be starting to show some signs of healing , but for those at the bottom of the economy , for those most reliant on government services in Los Angeles and the countless other cities teetering over financial abysses , 2010 looks more like a bona fide Depression year than one made beautiful by the myriad green shoots of recovery .
Leaders of the nation ’s largest unions came out in unanimous opposition to the recent Supreme Court ruling that allows corporations to spend as much as they like to influence the outcome of elections in the United States .
Steelworkers President Leo Gerard said on national television this weekend that the High Court ’s ruling means the four biggest banks alone could outspend all unions combined on political ads .
He said that this was particularly dangerous at a time when those same banks are “ lobbying fiercely against enactment of laws that would prohibit the behaviors that led to the current Great Recession . ”
The court ruling would allow banks to purchase and air ads against any lawmaker who votes for new regulations on financial institutions .
“ The four biggest banks , if they spent one - tenth of 1 percent of their resources in a political campaign , would eclipse every single penny of union revenue for every union in the country , ” Gerard said .
“ We need to move to public financing of elections , otherwise people will get cynical about their votes and will believe participation does n’t matter . ”
Change to Win Chair Anna Burger was even sharper saying “ corporations would drown out everybody else with their money .
“ The court lifted the floodgates on corporate electoral activity in the name of free speech rights of corporations , ” she declared , “ meaning if you are a CEO or corporate official , you are now free to hit the corporate ATM and spend whatever of your shareholders ’ money it takes to elect the candidates of your choice . ”
Burger said that unlimited corporate spending in federal elections “ threatens to drown out voices of the people who should really be at the center of the political process : Voters and candidates . ”
She noted that corporations “ have already been shilling out a lot of cash for political activities via attack ads , direct mail and other forms of communication through political action committees . ”
Also joining the outcry against the Supreme Court ’s 5 - 4 ruling was AFL - CIO President Richard Trumka .
Trumka ’s action came despite the fact that the AFL - CIO was among the groups that had earlier asked the Court to lift a ban on corporate or union - funded independent issue ads within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election .
Ads included in this category involve the recipient of an automated telephone call , for example , being asked to “ call senator so - and - so and tell him to vote against such - and - such . ”
A wide variety of organizations had joined together to ask the Court to lift that ban including right wing groups , the American Civil Liberties Union and the AFL - CIO .
In his attack on the Supreme Court ruling , Trumka said , however , that corporate speech , controlled by company officers , is not the same as speech by unions , which , he said , are democratically controlled by their members .
“ The Supreme Court further tilted the playing field in favor of business corporations in public elections , ” Trumka declared .
“ By allowing unlimited corporate treasury expenditures that explicitly support or oppose particular candidates , the court increased the excessive influence corporations already have in our electoral system . ”
He said the court “ wrongly treated corporate expenditures the same as union expenditures , ” contrary to the arguments the labor federation had made in its brief .
“ Unions , unlike businesses , are democratically - controlled , nonprofit membership organizations representing working men and women across the country , and their independent speech should accordingly be given greater protection . ”
Trumka summarized the elements of what , he said , should be included in campaign finance reform .
They include “ campaign finance regulation that promotes democratic participation in elections , possible public financing of election campaigns , tight regulation of campaign contributions , protection of ‘ legitimate independent free speech rights , ’ and ‘ effective disclosure of who is paying for what . ' ”
Legal experts are saying that the High Court ruling may , in effect , ban all those elements of campaign finance reform .
The Obama administration is exploring what it can do on a legislative level to correct the problem with the Court ruling .
The president made a dramatic display of his opposition to the decision when , looking directly at the members of the Supreme Court who were seated in front of him , he condemned their ruling .

Arsenal had Thomas Vermaelen sent off but Alessandro Diamanti missed a penalty as the home side won comfortably in the end
Preamble : Evenin ' all .
Hopefully this will be a ripsnorter of a late kick - off not the worst game ever , well worth forsaking a night down the pub for ( which you 're presumably doing , if you 're reading this ) .
In the event that it is n't , you can at least console yourself with the fact that you are not a ) a Premier League footballer or b ) a low - rent MBM hack and do n't have to work on Saturday evenings .
Anyway , to the football .
West Ham have a decent record at Arsenal in recent seasons , winning one ( thanks to this little Bobby Zamora number ) , drawing one and losing one from three visits to the Emirates ; and they were also the last team to win at Highbury , on the night Sol Campbell had his infamous ' mare .
Against that , Arsenal have won five in a row in the league , dragging their fragile title challenge along in the wake of Manchester United and Chelsea .
They have also won six of their seven Saturday 5.30 pm kick - offs , scoring 20 goals in the process ( the one loss ?
2 - 1 at Old Trafford in August ) .
So where 's your money ?
It 's going to be a home win , is n't it ...?
Teams , anyone ?
Arsenal : Almunia , Eboue , Campbell , Vermaelen , Clichy , Fabregas , Song , Denilson , Nasri , Bendtner , Arshavin .
Subs : Fabianski , Diaby , Sagna , Rosicky , Eduardo , Walcott , Silvestre .
West Ham : Green , Spector , Tomkins , Upson , Daprela , Diamanti , Kovac , Behrami , Stanislas , Mido , Franco .
Subs : Stech , Ilan , Cole , Noble , McCarthy , Ilunga , Spence .
Referee : Martin Atkinson ( W Yorkshire )
Website of the day : Today 's MBM is brought to you in association with the online home of Andrey Arshavin .
The sections where Andrey answers questions from readers are well worth several minutes of your time .
Here 's an example :
Q : What do you think of ideological anarchism ?
Arshavin :
In order to give you an exhaustive explanation , I should thoroughly study this subject .
So far I can't say anything .
Deadpan .
Andrey gives it to you straight , yessir .
5.10 pm : So , West Ham are without injured captain Scott Parker and have Carlton Cole , who is presumably being nursed through with an eye on the Hammers ' next home game , against Wolves , on the bench .
Arsenal rest Bacary Sagna , starting with Emmanuel Eboue at right - back , and have Cesc Fabregas back after two games out with a hamstring injury .
Sol Campbell , partnering Thomas Vermaelen in defence , will be hoping that Mido and Guillermo Franco do n't give him the sort of Harewood - Zamora working over that saw him hauled off at half - time ( for Sebastian Larsson , no less ) the last time he played in this fixture .
Good afternoon , USA : " It 's actually a bright 1:30 kick - off here in the US , and I 'm watching it in the comfort of my home , " says Aidan Gibson .
" Any ideas why Denilson gets the start ahead of Diaby ?
The only reason I can think of is his 30 - yard strikes , including the one that assisted Bendtner 's winner last weekend . "
I think it 's probably an example of squad rotation – Denilson is fairly fresh and Nasri and Fabregas will be given a bit more freedom with the Brazilian sitting deep .
5.22 pm : Shaka Hislop is predicting an Arsenal win ; Kevin Keegan , touchingly , fears for West Ham .
The Gunners will go top if they win , of course , if only for the best part of 24 hours .
Here 's some more Arshavin wisdom :
Q : Hi , what do you think about piercing ?
Arshavin : I disapprove of it .
The Wonder of You is playing over the tannoy at the Emirates and there 's a picture of Aaron Ramsey emblazoned on a giant flag fluttering in the breeze .
They certainly seem to have coped better with the Ramsey incident better than they did with Eduardo two years ago .
Props to Kevin Mackenzie for digging this out :
Q : Hi Andrey !
Please tell me , in your opinion , what is the most important thing for a footballer these days ?
Arshavin : I think the most important thing is a head , not only for a footballer but for any person
The teams are out .
My West Ham supporting colleague Jacob Steinberg says : " No Parker , no hope . "
Peep !
We 're off and Junior Stanislas goes sprinting off down the left wing , slicing deep into Arsenal territory .
He 's hustled out by Alex Song and Cesc Fabregas and Arsenal win the throw - in .
1 min : Ask Andrey Arshavin and Gael Clichy combine down the left , and the French left - back 's cross finds Samir Nasri on the far side of the box .
He 's quickly crowded out , though .
3 min : Franco is unable to control the ball on the edge of the Arsenal box after Kovac 's centre .
Almunia clears up .
" Why would you assume that those reading your commentary would have forsaken a night at the pub ?
I 'm at my local , reading your ramblings , and the cute waitress just brought a lit candle to my table saying that ' she thought I might like a nice romantic evening with my laptop ' .
The game , and your commentary , better be worth all this ridicule , Alan . "
Sounds like you 're in there , Aleksi Pursiainen .
GOAL !
Arsenal 1 - 0 West Ham ( Denilson 5 ) That 's why the Brazilian is starting !
West Ham failed to clear properly , allowing Denilson to exchange passes with Nicklas Bendtner before striking a sweet shot with his laces into the bottom right - hand corner , past Robert Green 's despairing dive .
6 min : Looks like this could be a very open one .
Bendtner comes in from the left and is n't closed down , the Dane spanking a low effort which swerves past Green 's right stick .
8 min : Alessandro Diamanti lines up his first free - kick of the evening , and hits it well , the ball rising and falling over the wall but not quite coming down enough .
Almunia had to go for it though .
9 min : Song breaks up play and launches Arsenal on to the attack with Emmanuel Eboue .
His ball into the middle is chested down by Bendtner to Fabregas , who finds Nasri and the Frenchman dinks a delightful pass over the West Ham backline for Denilson .
The Brazilian does n't connect properly this time , however , his volley bouncing tamely into Green 's grasp .
11 min : Arsenal are weaving their web delicately around the edge of the Hammers ' box .
Nasri is almost played in on goal again after his flick found Fabregas and the Spaniard attempted to play it back into Nasri 's path , but the ball runs out for a goal kick .
13 min : Nasri is on his knees after attempting to tackle Mido and injuring himself in the process .
Mido and Zola then have what looks like a frank exchange of views on the touchline .
Nasri limps off for treatment .
14 min : Bad puns ?
We love 'em .
" I like the fact that Spector plays for the team that Martin Peters used to ghost in for , ten years ahead of his time .
And Mido is a bit of a zombie too . "
B'dum tish , I believe is the response .
Thank you , Gary Naylor .
15 min : Speaking of Spector and the like , Arshavin ghosts ( yep , I did ) past the West Ham right - back and his cross nearly finds Bendtner .
Diamanti then releases Franco into the Arsenal half and his ball to the back post is just too heavy for Mido .
17 min : Nasri is back on , but Fabregas is almost immediately down , clutching at his leg after Kovac 's tackle from behind .
No need to worry , he seems all right .
20 min :
It 's quietened down a little , Arsenal merely probing gently rather than trying to tear the Hammers a new one .
You fancy they 'll give West Ham at least a couple of chances at some point , though .
Song dispossesses Mido magnificently and then wins the foul himself .
21 min : Eboue , whose reputation has been remarkably rehabilitated this year , daintily picks a path towards the West Ham box before curling a low effort wide .
22 min : Arsenal then conjur another silken move , a series of one - touch passes culminating in Bendtner nutmegging James Tomkins but putting slightly too much on it for Nasri to be able to latch on to the ball .
23 min :
Oh yes , I think we may have started something here .
" Hey Alan , how many ghouls do you think Arsenal will score today ? " tee - hees Mike .
25 min : West Ham briefly put their foot on the ball and start to knock it around in midfield , only for Fabregas to pinch it back .
Arsenal hoard possession like your dad does the remote .
Bendtner is then nearly slipped through one - on - one – but he 's offside .
26 min : Valon Behrami fouls Fabregas from behind and the resultant free - kick is cleared from the vicinity of Sol Campbell 's head by Mido .
From the resultant corner West Ham break , but Nasri fouls Kovac and play is halted again .
28 min : A hairy moment for the home side .
Diamanti gets in behind Eboue and , with Campbell and Vermaelen backpedalling furiously , elects not to shoot , rather tries to find Franco , a decision which allows Clichy to nip in front and clear .
Could have a been a real chance , that .
30 min : Brian McCloskey is wondering " how many boo - kings will there be ? "
Which is certainly a better effort than Christian Wulff's " Fabreghast " .
Eboue plants a stud on Kovac 's knee , but it appeared to be accidental .
32 min :
That early goal seems to have sapped Arsenal 's sense of urgency , and West Ham have been reasonably comfortable in defence for the last 10 minutes .
Everyone is strolling a little , to be honest .
35 min : Both teams are playing pretty but largely ineffectual football in the middle of the park ( no surprises there then ) .
Bendtner then combines well with Eboue on the right , the Ivorian 's cross-cum - shot flying in front of Rob Green and with too much on it for the sliding Andrey Arshavin at the back post .
37 min : Sol Campbell absolutely steams through Spector with both feet on the edge of the Arsenal box , but he got the ball .
Diamanti then goes into the book for chopping down Bendtner from behind .
38 min : Ooh , you 're going to wince ...
" Given the Arsenal keeper 's predilection for fluffing shots , and in keeping with the ghost theme , would n't " Allmoanhere " be a better name for him ?
At least from the crowd at The Emirates anyway . "
Paul
Fox causes a few groans of his own .
39 min : Campbell is booked after launching into another sliding challenge , this time in the West Ham box after a corner to the home side .
He 's certainly getting stuck in , the old man of Arsenal .
41 min : Arsenal finally combine to good effect , Song releasing Clichy on the left whose ball into the path of Fabregas is perfectly weighted .
Fabregas mucks up his effort on goal , however , as he bore down on Green from the left .
The ball still bobbled across goal where Nasri was arriving at the back post , but Daprela shepherded it out for a corner .
PENALTY and RED CARD !
Thomas Vermaelen is dismissed for pulling back Franco as the striker burst into the Arsenal area ...
MISSED PENALTY !
But Manuel Almunia is equal to Diamanti's spot kick , diving to his left to palm away the shot .
Not the best of hits from the Italian , but Almunia guessed the right way and it was at " a comfortable height for the goalkeeper " .
He was miles off his line , of course , but no one seems to care about that rule , do they ?
45 min :
That 's the end of the half !
Sorry about the gaps in commentary there , my system crashed just as Vermaelen saw red .
So , Arsenal go in with the lead but down to 10 men .
Stay tuned .
So let 's try and clear that one up then .
Vermaelen and Franco had a slight coming together after the striker had managed to get goalside ( Vermaelen 's error ) ; Vermaelen then appeared to try and get a handful of Franco 's shirt – but failed – before Franco collapsed to the turf as the ball bounced away from him .
The linesman flagged to give it , rather than the ref .
It was soft , let 's be clear , but Vermaelen was culpable for letting Franco get past him in the first place .
Half - time emails : Someone calling themselves PA Gooner wants to make a couple of points : " 1 . It 's not a missed penalty it is saved and 2 .
That was an appalling decision .
No contact whatsoever .
Refs can kill title challenges with decisions like that . "
Indeed , it was saved .
But he still missed it .
" Not a red card ; almost no contact , and its not even a DOGSO .
Refereeing is so bad in England , is n't it ? "
Abuse from across the pond for Martin Atkinson from Aidan Gibson .
To be fair , it was effectively the linesman who gave it , not the ref .
" Anyone else notice , just after the red card , Wenger 's remonstration with the 4th official seemed to be observed by a rather awkward looking green dinosaur ? "
Jonny Mac is looking at the wider picture .
Let 's have another tidbit from Andrey Arshavin :
Q : Hi Andrey , I bet nobody has ever asked you this and nobody ever will , I 'm sure : what color is your bath sponge ?
Arshavin : Blue .
Peep !
Peep !
It 's bucketing down in north London as Atkinson blows his whistle to get the second half started .
46 min : Arsenal continue in much the same fashion as they left off , smoothly moving the ball across the pitch before Eboue fashions a cross which Arshavin nods over .
47 min : Several of you are emailing in with questions along the lines of this one from Luke : " Is that going to be a three or one game suspension for Vermaelen ?
Different sites are saying different things and nobody seems to know for sure .
Will have a huge effect on our title chances if it's a three game ban with Gallas already out . "
Consensus on the desk here is that it will be a three - game ban , for a straight red / professional foul .
Though I think Arsenal will undoubtedly appeal ...
49 min : I should point out that neither side has made any change at the halfway point , so Arsenal are continuing with Alex Song at the back , dropping in to partner Sol Campbell from midfield .
Valon Behrami fires over a cross from the right but Manuel Almunia plucks it from the air .
51 min : Been caught absconding , as Judas Priest did n't quite say .
" C'mon you went off for a ' comfort break ' did n't you , no PC has crashed in years or are you an old school Windows 2000 advocate ? "
Michael Carter is sceptical – but I can honestly say the system ( as in the one run by the Guardian 's e-hamsters ) went down .
52 min : Fabio Daprela goes scooting into the area burt Song produces an excellent tackle to clear him out .
West Ham struggling to make their man advantage count at the moment ...
54 min : The Hammers have n't had the best of times playing against 10 - men this season .
They were leading against Fulham only to draw ; ditto against Hull after being 2 - 0 up ; and the same against Sunderland .
55 min :
It looks like Carlton Cole could be about to enter the fray , though .
Possibly Ilan , as well , reckons Jon Champion .
57 min : Franco is the man to come off , so it 's not the most attacking of substitutions .
Cole , West Ham 's top scorer , comes on .
Arsenal also make a change , with Bendtner being sacrificed for Abou Diaby .
58 min : Here 's Jess Ziter with a pic to make you smile .
" Regarding the point about the inappropriately prominent green dinosaur in the footage of Wenger speaking with the fourth official .
The extinct animal in question was , of course , the Arsenal mascot Gunnersaurus .
This is n't terribly interesting or surprising , but since this is a heavily Arshavin - influence MBM already , it provides me with a tenuous enough reason to justify a link to what is perhaps the most delightful photograph of a Premiership footballer that one can find on Google Images . "
60 min : Mido finds Diamanti on the right and the Italian comes back inside to curl a low shot through a thicket of Arsenal defenders ' legs and safely into the arms of Almunia .
They 're having a smidge more joy going forward now , the Hammers .
61 min : Emmanuel Eboue skips in from the right wing and is eventually stopped in his tracks by Matthew Upson 's sliding tackle .
It was late and the England man gets a yellow card .
62 min : Fabregas then bends a free - kick round the blind side of the wall but it does n't come back enough to trouble Green .
64 min : Arsenal repeatedly try to tease their way through the West Ham defence , but end up teasing the Emirates crowd instead .
Nasri's cross is dangerous but Arshavin had n't gambled on going to the front post , to use the correct parlance .
66 min : Having one less person to pass to does n't seem to deter the Gunners from their favourite pastime , you have to say .
West Ham just can't get hold of the ball to do any damage at the moment .
" It might be lashing down in North Landon but it 's the first day of spring here in New York .
Sun is shining and it's getting up to 75 f .
I 'm off outside .
This is going to go 1 - 1 , then 2 - 1 and in stoppage time , 3 - 1 to the Arsenal . "
It 's the first day of spring here too ( or is it the 21st ? ) but rain is seasonal all year round here .
68 min : Diamanti sees a shot deflected fractionally wide of the Arsenal goal , but really not much is happening .
The stage is yours , Jonathan Wittenburg : " Man U fan cheering on West Ham here .
Diamanti sums up the Hammers as a side : glimpses of real ability and class overshadowed by being naïve and erratic .
Feels like I hoping for a small miracle even with Arsenal a man down . "
I read the final word in that penultimate sentence as ' erotic ' at first .
Still works , though .
70 min : Eboue is fouled by Daprela after a customary tricky run ( that was surely just waiting for a poor end product ) .
Fabregas 's dinked free - kick is cleared .
" The linesman 's decision to send Vermaelen off .
He needs new ' spooktacles ' .
Or have you finished doing ghost related puns ? "
Certainly not , Ed Waters .
73 min : Understandably West Ham came into this match not expecting to get much out of it but they still seem disappointingly disinterested .
It 's like they 're playing out the last 10 minutes of a game that 's already well lost over and over again .
Campbell nearly forces home a second for Arsenal , but connected with his chest rather than his head .
75 min : Benni McCarthy comes on for Mido , and soon warms Almunia 's palms with a header from a Spector cross .
76 min : Diaby sails serenly through the West Ham defence and releases Arshavin , whose shot is too close to Green .
Consensus on the desk has now changed to it being a one - match ban for Vermaelen , by the way .
77 min : Carlton
Cole is almost on the money at last for West Ham , his low , skimming drive from the edge of the area pinging off the outside of Almunia 's right post .
Very tidy effort from the big man .
79 min : James
Tomkins goes barging through the back of Clichy , conceding a free - kick down near the corner flag on the left .
Fabregas 's delivery is disappointing , going over several heads and off for a goal kick .
PENALTY to Arsenal !
Bacary Sagna , who has come on for Arsenal , found Fabregas on the edge of the box and as he flicked it past Upson , the West Ham defender stuck out an arm .
Definite penalty .
GOAL !
Arsenal 2 - 0 West Ham ( Fabregas 83 ) That should seal it for Arsenal , against a very unenterprising West Ham .
Fabregas thumped his spot kick down the middle as Green went to his left , and the Gunners look like they 're going top ...
85 min : The Emirates faithful are in full voice , lauding their captain .
Eduardo , who has replaced Arshavin , wants the game 's third penalty – but Atkinson gives the foul West Ham 's way .
87 min : This from hopeful Spurs fan , T. Mukund Gujadhur : " Arsenal 's next 3 domestic games are Birmingham ( A ) , Wolves ( H ) and Spurs ( A ) .
Please , please , please , it has to be 3 games suspension for Vermaelen , we might have a chance if we are up against Silvestre , comfortably the worst signing of Wenger , especially because he plays now and then . "
88 min :
There has been very little discernible difference between 10 - man Arsenal and 11 - man Arsenal this evening .
West Ham have given them a very easy ride .
There might even be a third in this one , as Eduardo nearly goes clean through .
90 min : Cole does well to control a through - ball from Stanislas into the gap between Song and Clichy , the striker shifting the ball out from under his feet and then hitting a rising drive that flies just over .
There 'll be three minutes more of West Ham meekness .
90+2 min : Eboue is moaning about something or other .
The ref pats him on the head and tells him to go away .
Jim Walker disagrees that West Ham have n't been up for this .
" I must say that Spector 's team have played with the right spirit here today ! "
Peep !
Peep !
Peep !
A huge roar goes up to greet the final whistle .
What could have been a testing occasion for Arsenal turned into a bit of a stroll in the end .
Postamble : Dubious red card and penalty drama aside , that was a fairly run-of - mill victory for Arsenal .
West Ham seemed resigned to defeat after falling behind so early and , Carlton Cole excepted , did n't really offer much going forward .
That 's six wins in a row for Arsenal now , and they 're certainly showing some resolve .
The only question mark hangs over Vermaelen 's suspension – whether it's one or three games and whether Arsenal attempt to overturn it .
In the spirit ( ho ho ) of today 's pun-fest , I 'll leave you with this from David Wall : " This entire game has been so predictable , as if both teams are playing to an old familiar script .
Is that what we have to expect from Arsenal for the rest of the season , while Wenger persists in turning out a tired Clichy ? "

Get updates impacting your industry from our GigaOm Research Community
Over the past several years , the web has been kind to extroverts .
Social networks have offered a new platform for people to broadcast their thoughts , connect with each other and expand their contacts in the online realm .
The social web has even ushered in a new kind of extroversion , in which people who might be shy or uneasy in traditional social settings can express themselves online .
Much less noticeable is another trend : the rise of the web introvert .
But while some web introverts might be introverted in the classic sense — that is , uncomfortable in social settings — many of them are n’t shy at all .
They are simply averse to having a public presence on the web .
And in time , they are going to present a problem for social sites like Facebook and Twitter , whose potential growth will be limited unless they can successfully court them .
Web introversion is n’t a question of technophobia or security concerns .
Anyone who has tried to build out their online networks on Facebook knows that there are a lot of people they know in real life that they ca n’t friend online .
Many people who have been involved in technology for years — or who are entirely comfortable shopping at Amazon ( s amzn ) , paying bills online , buying songs from iTunes ( s aapl ) — will have nothing to do with social networks .
Others see it as a chore necessary for their jobs .
Still others have accounts languishing on all the major social networks .
If you ask a web introvert why he or she is n’t into social networks , the response often comes down to a matter of trust – or rather , a lack of it .
It ’s frustrating enough that each social network has its own etiquette to master , but many people are loathe to make the effort because of the unpleasant reality that there is no such thing as privacy on the web .
And typically , the more that web introverts understand the nature of the web , the less willing they are to expose themselves on it .
For while you might start off thinking you own your tweets , you really do n’t .
And if you do n’t want your Facebook information open to the public , you need to follow closely that site ’s constant privacy changes .
Moreover , regardless of the site , a casual comment that , in an offline conversation would be forgotten , is preserved for years on the web — and could come back to haunt you .
For extroverts , this is all just part of navigating the social web .
But enough people are uncomfortable with social networks that it ’s going to become a barrier to growth in the coming years .
For now , Facebook ’s growth is continuing simply because there are more and more extroverts signing up .
And Twitter is still in the stage of experimenting with ways to make money .
Eventually growth rates will slow and these companies will see web introverts as an alienated part of the market that they need to court .
Each introvert , after all , is a lost opportunity for revenue .
But it may be that these characteristics are so inherent in the social web that such people simply ca n’t be courted .

Reem Asaad recommends women go to women - only lingerie shops
Campaigners in Saudi Arabia have urged women there to begin a two - week boycott of lingerie shops with male staff .
They say it is a contradiction that in such a conservative , Islamic country , women have to give their underwear sizes to men they do not know .
Reem Asaad , an economics professor from Jeddah , organised the boycott through her Facebook page , as public protests are illegal in Saudi Arabia .
Islamic scholars have given their backing to the campaign .
" I am calling for salesmen to be replaced with saleswomen " , Ms Asaad was quoted as saying by AFP news agency .
" I just hope that many respond and boycott , " she said .
Ms Asaad has been calling on officials to allow saleswomen in shops open to both male and female clients since 2008 .
Religious police in the country have said they are not against women working in shops as long as they are in women - only malls .
Saudi Arabia 's Labour Ministry has previously said it would require that women were employed in lingerie shops , but the law has not been enforced .
Ms Asaad says the law is deliberately ambiguous and allows religious clerics to effectively uphold a ban on saleswomen .
The Wahhabi strain of Islam , which dominates the country , requires absolute separation of unrelated members of the opposite sex .
Parts of Saudi society are still very traditional and do not like the idea of women working - even if they are just selling underwear to each other .
Because of the strict segregation laws barring physical contact between the sexes , women also cannot be properly measured for their underwear .
The boycott campaign comes days before a visit by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who will hold a town hall meeting at Ms Asaad 's Dar al - Hekma College .
MADRID ( MarketWatch ) --
Recent periods of heavy selling in the Spanish stock market , in the wake of fears that worries over Greece will spread to other European nations , is reportedly being investigated by the country 's intelligence service .
The unit of the National Intelligence Center that deals with economic intelligence has spent the last few weeks discussing the matter with Spanish companies and the stock exchange as well as other experts , according to a report in El Pais 's English edition on Monday .
An official could not be reached for comment .
The newspaper said the investigation is looking at whether there was any collusion in attacks by investors and the hostility shown by some sectors of the U.K. and Spanish press .
Over two weeks ago , Spain 's IBEX - 35 ( IBEX ) saw its biggest one - day loss since 2008 , in the wake of worries over Greece and fears Spain might have similar economic worries .

The government has been battling a tidal wave of bad news and sentiment from inside and out .
Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has hinted on a number of recent occasions that criticism by the U.S. and British media is part of an effort to undermine the euro .
El Pais said in private he has been taken aback by just how aggressive some parts of the foreign press have been with Spain .
Paul Krugman , the Nobel prize winning economist columnist with the New York Times , is practically persona non grata for his comments on Feb.
4 after a blog posting that said Spain was the euro zone 's biggest trouble spot .
Salgado responded by saying that analysts and media from outside the euro zone did not understand how the bloc worked .
Krugman was at it again on Monday , writing in his column for the New York Times , that Spain 's core economic problem is that prices and costs have gotten out of line with those in the rest of Europe and there is n't much that the government can do to make it better , as its economy is locked into the euro .
" This is McCarthy - style witch hunting , " said analysts at UBS in a note to investors on Monday , in response to the report in El Pais .
" Spain was a victim of joining an inappropriate monetary union and a Ponzi scheme housing market . "
VANCOUVER —
What if Johnny Weir had a press conference and nobody came ?
It seemed like a possibility yesterday while the Olympic host nation was prepping for a big men ’s hockey game with Russia at 4:15 p.m. Pacific time .
But when Johnny Weir materialized at the podium in the British Columbia Media Center in downtown Vancouver , the room was still more than three - quarters full .
He was there to speak about homophobic comments made by a pair of French - Canadian television commentators after his performance on February 18 .
Among the audience , along with reporters from USA Today and the New York Times , was a local celebrity who calls himself “ Narduwar the Human Serviette . ”
Narduwar asked about Weir ’s vacuuming habits .
“ Iggy Pop loved to vacuum , Johnny , ” said one , “ and I understand that you love to vacuum .
Is that true ? ”
Weir ’s response : “ I literally vacuumed [ agent Tara Modlin ’s ] condo before I came here .
And I cleaned her purse out for her while she was getting ready .
That ’s the reason I ’m late , because my agent was combing her hair .
And maybe I was a little bit , too .
I was cleaning out her purse and it made a mess on the couch , so I vacuumed the couch . ”
The questioner held on to the microphone for a follow - up : “ What about food , too ?
Does that help with negative comments ?
In the reality series we saw recently , you were pictured preparing food .
You were talking with your friend Paris , and you were talking with him about the proper way to cut cheese . ”
Weir : “ I like you a lot right now .
Well , just , when you buy a wedge of cheese , there ’s the paper or plastic around the outside , and it ’s very important to me that you cut it evenly , so if you cut a slice , you cut the paper off as you go .
And he just cut the middle out , so he ended up wasting very valuable cheese .
So it offended my sensibilities when Paris did n’t cut the cheese properly . ”
He was also asked about the folks who were quoted as saying : “ We should make him pass a gender test at this point . ”
Said Weir : “ I ’ve heard worse in bathrooms about me , so it ’s not a big issue for me that they said it , it ’s just that I did n’t want other kids to have that same issue , and other people in the public eye to have the same issue .
If I had a chance to sit down with them , I think we ’d all be lovely people together .
They would see who I really am . ”
Also present were two drag queens / burlesque performers who said they had driven from Seattle to “ meet Johnny . ”
Conan O'Brien is n't just leaving the Tonight Show , he 's also being excised from NBC 's corporate propaganda .
The embittered late - night ginger 's already dead to corporate headquarters , judging by the mural in the lobby .
Click through for before and after shots .
The " before " shot is from an October 2009 entry in NBC employee Dennis Degan 's Flickr stream ; the " after " comes courtesy Mediaite editor and 30 Rockefeller Plaza ghost Rachel Sklar , who first noted the mural change on her Twitter account today .
As you can see in the composite below , O'Brien 's head has been replaced by Leno's .
But Tonight Show returnee Leno did not emerge unscathed from the mural changes , either : according to Sklar , that giant picture of him in the foreground has been eliminated , though you can't see it in the " after " shot due to cropping .

Jaromir Jagr – Czech Republic
We touched briefly on Jagr ’s post - NHL career a few days ago , but it bears repeating that Jagr signed a 2 - year deal with Avangard Omsk in 2008 for a reported $ 10 million after being informed by the New York Rangers that he was no longer in their plans .
He scored 53 points in 55 games last season , while potting 9 in 9 playoff games , and currently has 42 points in 49 games this year for his fourth placed squad .
The mullet is long gone , but thankfully that weird vertical beard is gone too .
He 's also rocking a Euro - style Gretzky helmet in the KHL .
Way to go Jags , it 's not like helmet technology has improved that much since the 1980s , right ?
Peter Forsberg - Sweden
Forsberg last played in the NHL in 2007 - 2008 for the Colorado Avalanche for a measly 9 games at the end of the season .
However , he did score 14 points in those games , showing that he still has the magic touch in his hands .
Last year he briefly played for three games with MODO in the Swedish Elite League before being forced to stop due to injuries .
This year he ’s played in 17 games and has 20 points , despite being limited by injuries ( of course ) .
Best of all , he and teammate Markus Naslund are playing for free as a way of giving back to MODO , the team that launched both their careers .
Sergei Fedorov – Russia
Fedorov signed with Metallurg Magnitogorsk ( super metal name ) of the KHL after finishing the last two seasons with the Washington Capitals .
His deal was for 2 years and reportedly worth $ 3.8 million per year .
It ’s highly unlikely Fedorov could achieve the same amount of money by staying in the NHL , but he said his main reason for joining the KHL was to fulfil his father ’s dream of having his two sons play on the same hockey team .
That ’s nice .
Fedorov is the fourth leading scorer on the league ’s third place team ( second in their conference ) with 28 points in 49 games .
Not spectacular , but we ’ll give Sergei the benefit of the doubt and assume he ’s a great leader on the team .
Taking out the young players to seedy Russian strip joints ; helping the youth make their first connections with mobsters .
Ziggy Palffy - Slovakia
Ziggy signed with the Penguins for 3 years after the lockout , but abruptly retired after collecting 42 points in 42 games .
It was a bizarre retirement since Ziggy was still playing at such a high level , but it was suggested that a lingering shoulder injury was the cause .
Ziggy scored 713 points in 684 career NHL games .
He stayed retired until 2007 when he announced a comeback and signed with his hometown club of HK 36 Skalica in the Slovak Extraliga .
All he ’s done since then is absolutely terrorize the league .
In 2007 - 2008 he scored 30 goals and 75 points in only 46 games .
Then last year he scored an astounding 52 goals and 99 points in 53 games .
Ziggy is clearly the best player in the league , to the point where Andrej Cicman , a staff writer for slovakhockey .sk , described the league as Ziggy ’s playground .
Richard Zednik – Slovakia
At this point Zednik is probably best remembered for surviving a horrifying incident where his neck was viciously cut by an errant skate two years ago .
He ’s also fondly remembered around my house for taking a cheap - shot elbow to the face from Boston ’s Kyle McLaren while playing for the Montreal Canadiens in the 2002 playoffs .
( note : I just re-watched that clip and the fact that no Canadiens player fights McLaren is a microcosm of the past 15 years of Habs hockey ) .
Zednik is now playing for Lokomotiv Yaroslavl of the KHL and has tallied a mediocre 18 points in 35 games .
He does have 54 penalty minutes , which I thought was a lot until I saw Darsy Verot has 347 minutes in 33 games ( much more than double the next closest player ) .
He does n’t even look that crazy !
He must be insane .
Martin Gerber – Switzerland
The Swiss netminder was banished from the NHL last season after taking over the vacant Leafs crease for the remaining 12 games in 2009 .
He signed with Atlant Moscow of the KHL ( Ray Emery 's former team ) and has very respectable numbers ( .914 % and 2.19 GAA ) , but has been limited to 30 games this year after fracturing his fourth vertebrae in December after a forward slid into him .
So , technically I ’m cheating with this inclusion since he is n’t actually playing in Vancouver , but I just wanted to segue into letting you know that Robert Esche is killing the KHL this year with 27 wins and a 1.99 GAA .
One of the more interesting parts of the Olympic hockey tournament is seeing a bunch of old NHLers playing back on North American ice .
Really my interest in this all stemmed from seeing Ziggy Palffy back in action .
I mean anyone named Ziggy is interesting , right ?
I just had to know where some of these players ended up .
Sure , there are the big names like Jagr and Forsberg who the media talks about relentlessly , but what about some of the less heralded players ?
Where are they ?
I have n't heard Ziggy Palffy 's name in 5 years .
Maybe he 's a Slovakian movie star .
Looking up all this information also brought me to the realization that there are a ton of ex-NHLers scattered around the world still focused on living their hockey dreams and doing very well for themselves ( just not NHL well ) .
Maybe it ’s my West - centric view of the world , but after anyone leaves the NHL I just assume they ’re achieving mediocrity .
My bad .
I ’ll save that post for another day , but it will certainly involve Mikael Tellqvist , who according to Wikipedia was traded from the KHL to the Swedish Elite League .
Is that possible ?
If so , it ’s pretty cool .
Anyways , here are some former NHLers you will see during the Olympic tournament and where they are playing these days .
Madison ’s highest paid city government employee last year was n’t the mayor .
It was n’t the police chief .
It was n’t even the head of Metro Transit .
It was bus driver John E. Nelson .
Nelson earned $ 159,258 in 2009 , including $ 109,892 in overtime and other pay .
He and his colleague , driver Greg Tatman , who earned $ 125,598 , were among the city ’s top 20 earners for 2009 , city records show .
They ’re among the seven bus drivers who made more than $ 100,000 last year thanks to a union contract that lets the most senior drivers who have the highest base salaries get first crack at overtime .
And there was a lot of overtime — $ 1.94 million last year , $ 467,200 more than the bus system budgeted for and the most ever for the system — as employees exhausted sick leave and took advantage of unpaid leave through the federal Family Medical Leave Act , officials said .
“ That ’s the ( drivers ’ ) contract , ” said Transit and Parking Commission Chairman Gary Poulson .
“ ( But ) I think we want more information to the TPC and a discussion of all the facts . ”
The high salaries for Metro bus drivers come as Metro ’s ridership continues to grow and the system ranks high among peers according to a 2009 state audit .
Metro , which increased fares last year , carried 13.58 million riders in 2009 , the second highest total in 40 years .
Metro general manager Chuck Kamp , who earned $ 118,690 last year , defended the employees .
“ These are very good employees who follow the rules that have been negotiated with the Teamsters , ” Kamp said , adding that Nelson and Tatman “ are senior drivers with excellent safety and customer service records . ”
But he said Metro is looking at ways to limit overtime , including tighter follow up on workman ’s compensation claims and exploring how to control the growth of Family Medical Leave Act time off by employees .
Nelson , Tatman and Gene Gowey , business manager for the bus drivers union , Teamster Local 695 , could not be reached Friday .
In the past , drivers have defended the pay , saying they earn it by working long hours that can create hardships on families .
Also , the job requires navigating an oversized vehicle through city streets and dealing with sometimes uncivil riders and other challenges , they have said .
The bus drivers ’ contact , which calls for pay up to $ 26.02 an hour , expired at the end of December and the sides are now in negotiations .
Over all , Madison paid at least 20 employees more than $ 125,000 in 2009 , according to city records .
After Nelson , the top paid employees in 2009 were City Comptroller Dean Brasser , who earned $ 151,551 , and Police Chief Noble Wray , who made $ 143,585 .
Mayor Dave Cieslewicz was paid $ 112,880 .
He was n’t among the top 20 .
Concern about bus drivers being among the city ’s highest earners is n’t new .
The issue surfaced after Metro changed from a Downtown hub to a transfer station system in 1998 .
In 1997 , before the change , no driver made more than $ 70,000 .
But two years later , as Metro struggled to fill vacancies , two drivers topped $ 100,000 and seven more made more than $ 70,000 .
A high base salary and other benefits for drivers were largely set in the 1970s and 1980s , when the city took over the bus company .
Also , the union contract limits part - timers to 15 percent of the number full - time drivers , and part - timers can only drive morning and afternoon school routes .
Those rules create opportunities for overtime and other special pay for full - time workers .
The city negotiated more flexibility for using part timers in 2002 - 03 , but a state audit last year recommended Metro seek even more flexibility and noted that some pay premiums , such as those for evening and Sunday shifts , are uncommon in the industry .
In the past three years , Metro has been below budget for regular salaries , mainly due to vacancies , but exceeded budget for overtime , Metro data shows .
In 2009 , Metro was $ 290,000 under budget for salaries , spending $ 22.8 million , but $ 467,200 over budget for overtime , spending $ 1.94 million , the most ever .
Overtime is high for several reasons , Kamp said .
Metro employees are exhausting sick leave time , taking advantage of the federal Family Medical Leave Act and have high rate of absenteeism without pay , Kamp said .
For example , use of the medical leave act by Metro employees jumped 44 percent to 28,340 hours from 2008 to 2009 , Kamp said , calling it “ the driving factor ” for overtime last year .
A city hiring freeze last year blocked Metro from replacing drivers for a time , Kamp said .
Cieslewicz later authorized Metro to fill vacancies after learning it was cheaper than paying overtime .
Also , Metro undertook a safety program that took drivers off their jobs and increased overtime , Kamp said .
But the training helped cut preventable accidents 17 percent last year , he said .
Metro is working with the Teamsters to control vacancies and absenteeism , including a progressive discipline system for absence without pay , Kamp said .
Already , Metro has cut worker ’s compensation costs 27 percent to $ 632,600 between 2007 and 2009 , he said .
Despite challenges with overtime , Metro ’s cost per rider rose just 5 percent to $ 3.07 between 2006 and the third quarter of 2009 , Kamp said .
“ There are a number of things we ’re trying to do to create efficiencies , ” he said .
20,000 teachers to be laid off in state , group says
SPRINGFIELD - A coalition of Illinois education groups says more than 20,000 teachers could be laid off from state schools in the next school year .
The coalition is surveying 944 school districts and other educational institutions in the state and said this week it has heard from three - quarters of them so far on the layoffs they 're planning .
Already 17,228 layoffs have been reported .
" We expect job cuts could top 20,000 when all the final data is in , " said Brent Clark , executive director of the Illinois Association of School Administrators , one of the six groups in the coalition .
School districts must tell employees by April 15 whether their jobs will be cut next year .
The coalition broke down the planned layoffs into three categories :
• 9,764 were certified staff members - basically , teachers .
• 1,597 were certified retirees not being replaced .
• 5,867 were noncertified staff members .
" This data only reflects expected job losses , " Clark said in a news release .
" The situation is far worse when we factor in elimination and reduction of hundreds of programs in sports and music and school activities that are so beneficial to students . "
The coalition is using the data to urge an increase in the state income tax .
" State government leaders have a choice : Either pass new revenue or face a 17 percent cut in state funding for K - 12 schools next year , " said Ken Swanson , president of the Illinois Education Association , another one of the groups in the coalition .
Gov .
Pat Quinn 's proposed budget would cut elementary and high school funding by 17 percent without an income tax hike .
He advocates an increase in the state income tax rate by 1 percentage point in part to prevent that .
His opponent in the November election for the governor 's seat , state Sen .
Bill Brady , criticized Quinn at an Illinois Education Association banquet March 20 for threatening the education cuts , saying Quinn 's proposed budget " attacks the classroom . "
Illinois , faced with a $ 13 billion deficit , is failing to deliver aid to government agencies across the state , including schools .
Last week , state comptroller spokesman Alan Henry said it was behind $ 782 million in payments to K - 12 school districts .
Suburban school districts are laying off teachers as a result .
Elgin Area School District U - 46 announced March 15 that nearly 1,100 employees , including more than 700 teachers , would be laid off .
It cut nearly 350 positions in 2009 .
On Monday , Indian Prairie Unit District 204 , based in Naperville , said it will lay off 145 teachers , nearly 7 percent of its teaching staff .
Carpentersville - based Community Unit District 300 is looking at cutting about 300 teachers .
Smaller school districts are piling on with their own layoff notices .
The layoffs , like in better years past , could be canceled if schools get additional money .
But cuts in state funding have greatly increased the number of layoff notices and decrease the likelihood of callbacks .
The coalition 's figures include 3,800 jobs cut in the Chicago Public Schools system .
Also in the coalition are the Illinois Federation of Teachers , the Illinois Association of School Boards , the Illinois Principals Association and the Illinois Association of School Business Officials .

LAST MAY , we said that GTX480 , then called GT300 , was going to be hot , slow , big , underperforming , hard to manufacture , and most of all late .
Almost a year later , Nvidia ca n’t even launch PR quantities at the promised spec of 512 shaders .
To call the launch a debacle is giving Nvidia more credit than it is due .
The sheer dishonesty surrounding the launch is astounding .
As early as last September , Nvidia was telling partners March at the earliest , realistically later , while still promising investors and analysts that the chip would launch in Q4/2009 .
Other than quibbles about SEC rules , six months after its ‘ triumphant launch ’
Nvidia has finally thrown in the towel and can’t launch a single card with the promised 512 shaders .
While it is a sad farce , there is a good technical reason for Nvidia having launched its Fermi GTX480 GPU with 480 shaders instead of 512 .
With 480 shaders , it can get a higher performing chip with fewer shaders .
How ?
Through the magic of semiconductor chip binning .
If you recall , Nvidia was aiming for 750MHz / 1500MHz with 512 shaders during planning , and publicly stated that it would beat ATI ’s 5870 GPU by 60 percent .
On paper , that seemed quite possible , but then came the problem of actually making it .
We said Nvidia could n’t .
It said it could .
Then it called SemiAccurate names .
Then it finally launched its GTX480 chip , and the count of 512 shader parts is zero .
Back to the whole 480 versus 512 shader count issue , it all comes down to binning , a close cousin of semiconductor chip yields .
In the common parlance , yield is how many chips you get that work , that are good rather than defective .
Yield says nothing about the qualities of the chips , just yes or no .
There is a lot more to it than that , since you could also include aspects of binning under the heading of yield , but for now we will stick with the good versus bad definition .
Binning on the other hand is more about what you get from those working parts .
If you take a given semiconductor wafer , the chips you get from that wafer are not all equal .
Some run faster , some run slower , some run hotter , and some run cooler .
There is a lot of science behind what happens and why , but once again , let ’s just look at the simplified version and say that for almost any property you look at , the chips coming out of a fab will be on a bell curve for that property .
Designers can skew how narrow or broad the curve is to varying degrees as well , but there is always a curve .
When designing a chip , you have design targets for making the chip .
For example , let ’s say that you want it to run at 2GHz and consume 50W .
The designs are set so that a large percentage of the chips will at least meet those minimum specs , that is , clock to at least 2GHz and pull no more than 50 W when doing so .
The idea is to have as little of the tail of the curve as possible be on the wrong sides of those two numbers .
Any chips that fall below those design points are scrap , so the trade - off in design is to figure out how much area you can add to the die in order to move that curve up before the scrap chips cost more than the net added area of the working chips .
Ideally , you would want 100 percent of the parts above the line , but that never happens .
For some chips , for example game console chips , there is only one speed that it needs to run at .
An XBox360 CPU runs at 3.2GHz .
If the chips coming out of the fab run at 6GHz , it does n’t matter , they will spend their lives running at 3.2GHz no matter what their potential is .
There is n’t a market for faster XBox360 chips .
On the other hand , if the chips ca n’t run faster than 3.1GHz , they are scrap .
There is a hard line , so you want the bell curve to be as high as you can get it .
For computer CPUs , they sell at a range of speeds , for example 2.0 , 2.2 , 2.4 , 2.6 , 2.8 and 3.0GHz .
If you aim for everything above 3GHz , that is great , but it is usually a waste of money .
When you get CPUs out of the fab , they are tested for speed .
If they make 3GHz , they are sold as 3GHz parts .
If not , they are checked at 2.8GHz , then 2.6GHz and all the way down to 2.0GHz .
Missing a single cutoff in the CPU world does not mean a chip is scrap .
You can bin on multiple metrics , like how many are working at 2.8GHz while consuming less than 75W .
The graphs on binning are multidimensional and get astoundingly complex very quickly .
Since a chip is not uniform across even it ’s own die , especially with larger chips , you can selectively disable parts of a chip if they do n’t meet the bins that you require .
A good example of this would be AMD ’s X3 line of 3 - core chips .
You can also add redundant components , like an extra core , or an extra shader per cluster , but that adds area .
More area costs more money per chip , adds power use , and can actually lower yield in some cases .
Once again , it is a tradeoff .
GPUs have been doing this forever , and end up with very good overall yields on large and complex chips because of it .
If you have a GPU with 10 shader groups , and it has defects , that is , it does not yield if you are aiming for all 10 groups working , it is very likely to yield as the next smaller part in the lineup , a hypothetical 8 group GPU .
If you couple that with binning , and set things loosely enough , you will end up with a good number of formerly ‘ scrap ’ chips that lead a productive life .
An extra shader per group ups the yield by a lot as well .
You can see this in almost every graphics chip on the market .
The GTX280 has a little brother , GTX260 , and the HD5870 has its HD5850 .
Later on in the life of a GPU family , you often see parts popping up , usually in odd markets or OEM only , with specs that are a portion of the smaller parts in the family .
This generally happens when there is a pile of parts that do n’t make the lowest bin , and that pile is big enough to sell .
Ideally , you set targets to make sure there is almost no need for the proverbial ‘ pile in the back room ’ , but there are always outliers .
If you ca n’t get the majority of the bell curve above the cut off points for your lowest bins , you have a problem , a big and expensive problem .
At that point , you either need to respin the chip to make it faster , cooler , or whatever , or lower your expectations and set the bins down a notch or five .
Nvidia is in the unenviable position of having to set the bins down , way way down .
The company is trapped , however .
The chip is 60 percent larger , over 530 mm ^2 , barely outperforms it ’s rival , ATI ’s 5870 , and is over six months late .
This means Nvidia ca n’t take the time to respin it .
ATI will have another generation out before Nvidia can make the required full silicon ( B1 ) respin , so there is no point in trying a respin .
The die size ca n’t be reduced much , if at all , without losing performance , so it will cost at least 2.5 times what ATI ’s parts cost for equivalent performance .
Nvidia has to launch with what it has .
What it has is n’t pretty .
A1 silicon was painfully low yielding , sub - two - percent for the hot lots , and not much better for later silicon .
A1 was running at around 500MHz , far far short of the planned 750 Mhz .
A2 came back and was a bit faster , but not much .
When Nvidia got back A3 just before Christmas 2009 , it was described to SemiAccurate by insiders at Nvidia as , “ A mess ” .
Shader clocks for the high tip of the curve were 1400MHz , and the highest bin they felt was real ended up being about 1200MHz .
This is all binning though .
Yields were still far below 20 percent for both the full 512 shader version and the 448 shader part combined .
For comparison , Nvidia ’s G200 chip , which became the GTX280 family of GPU parts , had a yield of 62.5 percent , give or take a little , and that yield was considered so low that it was almost not worth launching .
Given a sub - 20 percent yield , to call the Fermi or GF100 or GTX4x0 line of GPU chips unmanufacturable is being overly kind .
So , what do you do if you are Nvidia , are half a year late and slipping , and the best chip you can make can barely get out of its own way while costing more than five times as much as your rival ’s chip to manufacture ?
You change bins to play with numbers .
Nvidia made the rather idiotic mistake of announcing the GTX470 and GTX480 names in January , and now it had to fill them with real silicon .
The company bought 9,000 risk wafers last year , and could n’t get enough to make the promised 5,000 to 8,000 512 shader GTX480s from that , a required yield of less than 1 percent .
See what we mean by unmanufacturable ?
To make the minimal number of cards that you need for even a PR stunt level launch , you need to have at least a few thousand cards , and there simply were not that many 512 shader chips .
What is plan B ? According to Dear Leader , there is no plan B , but that is okay .
At this point , the GTX480 is on plan R or so .
You have to suck down your ego and lower the bins .
If you ca n’t make 512 shaders , the next step down is 480 shaders .
This moved the cutoff line down far enough to make the meager few thousand 480 shader parts necessary to launch .
GTX480 is slow , barely faster than an ATI HD5870 .
If Nvidia loses 32 shaders , it also loses 1/16th of the performance , or 6.25 percent .
That would leave it a bit slower than the 5870 if the clocks were set in the low 600 M Hz range though .
Still not good for a triumphant launch , but at this point , a launch is better than the alternative , no launch .
Out the door is the first step .
Remember when we said that one problem was ‘ weak ’ clusters that would not work at the required voltage ?
Well , if you want to up the curve on yields , you can effectively lower the curve on power to compensate , and Nvidia did just that by upping the TDP to 250W .
This the classic overclocking trick of bumping the voltage to get transistors to switch faster .
While we do n’t for a second believe that the 250W TDP number is real , initial tests show about a 130W difference in system power between a 188W TDP HD5870 and a ‘ 250 W ’ GTX480 , that is the official spec .
Nvidia lost a 32 shader cluster and still could n’t make 10,000 units .
It had to bump the voltage and disable the clusters to get there .
Unmanufacturable .
If you are still with us , we did mention that the 480 shader part was faster .
How ?
With the slowest cluster gone , that bumps the speed curve up by a fair bit , and the worst part of the tail is now gone .
Bumping the voltage moves the speed curve up more , and the end result was that Nvidia got 700MHz out of a 480 shader unit .
That 700/1400 number sounds quite familiar , does n’t it ?
On CPUs with a handful of cores , multiplying the core count times MHz is not a realistic thing to do .
Most workloads that CPUs handle are not parallel in nature so the result is bogus .
GPUs on the other hand have embarrassingly parallel workloads , so number - of - cores X MHz is a fair calculation .
If you look at our initial specs , the early GTX4x0 cards SemiAccurate had access to were 512 shader units running at 600MHz and 625MHz , and a 448 shader unit running at 625M Hz or so .
With the last minute spec change , voltage bump and shader fusing off , Nvidia was able to move the bins down enough to get a 700M Hz part that has 480 shaders with a ’ 25 W ’ penalty .
The shipping specs are 448 cores at 1215MHz for the GTX470 , and 480 cores at 1401MHz for the GTX480 .
If you look at the count of cores X MHz , you will see how it is a little faster .
Shaders X Clocks , and speed versus a 600MHz 512 shader part
What did Nvidia get by losing a cluster , adding tens of watts , and upping the clock ?
It looks like nine percent over the spec tested by SemiAccurate last month , and five percent over the proposed 512 shader 625/1250 M
Hz launch part .
According to partners , Nvidia was playing with the numbers until the very last minute , and that playing seems to have paid off in a net faster card .
PR gaffes of not being able to make a single working part aside , this five to nine percent bump allowed Nvidia to dodge the bullet of ATI ’s Catalyst 10.3a drivers , and add a bit to the advantage it had over a single HD5870 .
Most importantly , it allowed Nvidia to get yields to the point where it could make enough for a PR stunt launch .
The 480 shader , 1400MHz cards are barely manufacturable .
If you do n’t already have one ordered by now , it is likely too late to get one since quantities are going to be absurdly limited .
As things stand , the 9,000 risk wafers seem to have produced less than 10,000 GTX480s and about twice that many GTX470s if the rumored release numbers are to be believed .
That would put yields of the new lower spec GTX480 at well under the two percent Nvidia saw last fall .
It is hard to say anything good about these kinds of yields , much less to call it a win .
A one - point - something percent yield , however , is a number greater than zero .

Pastor Martin Ssempa was accused of perpetuating violence
A Ugandan clergyman 's decision to show gay pornography to his congregation has been labelled as " twisted , homophobic propaganda " by a gay rights groups .
Behind the Mask told the BBC the stunt , by anti-gay Pastor Martin Ssempa , equated homosexuality to paedophilia .
The pastor showed the pornography in an attempt to gain support for a proposed law which would see some gay people facing the death penalty .
The bill , under consideration by MPs , has been condemned across the world .
US President Barack Obama has described the proposals as " odious " .
Religion misused
Noma Pakade , from the African gay rights group Behind the Mask , accused the pastor of perpetuating violence by his anti-gay campaign .
Anti-gay rallies have been held in Uganda
" Showing pornography in church in the presence of minors is twisted homophobic propaganda , where homosexuality is equated to paedophilia and pornography , " she told the BBC .
" It is not surprising , but rather disappointing , that in Africa in the 21st Century yet again discrimination and prejudice is legitimised through religion . "
Homosexuality is already against the law in Uganda and punishable by lengthy jail terms .
But supporters of the bill , including the pastor , want the punishments ramped up .
" In Africa , what you do in your bedroom affects our clan , it affects our tribe , it affects our nation , " he told the BBC's Network Africa programme .
He justified his decision to show gay pornography to about 300 people , saying : " We are in the process of legislation and we have to educate ourselves about what homosexuals do . "
The anti-gay proposal , introduced into parliament as a private member 's bill , garnered wide support among Ugandan MPs and conservative religious groups .
But President Yoweri Museveni recently hinted that he was coming under international pressure to scrap the proposals .
Reprinted from the Huffington Post
In life and work , success begins with a goal .
It could be losing weight , asking for a raise , quitting smoking or starting your own business .
Big or small , goals give us purpose and , like a compass , keep us headed in the right direction .
Of course , it then takes lots of hard work and determination to reach your destination .
Writing over 2,000 years ago , Aristotle described the process this way : “ First , have a definite , clear , practical ideal ; a goal , an objective .
Second , have the necessary means to achieve your ends : wisdom , money , materials , and methods .
Third , adjust all your means to that end . ”
Unfortunately , many of us remain stuck at the goal stage .
We start out with good intentions and perhaps a plan , but then we ca n’t seem to make it happen .
There are countless reasons that this occurs — busyness , impatience , fear and negative social pressures are some of the usual culprits — so how do we respond to these challenges and move in the direction of our goal ?
Seeing Is Believing
Before we can believe in a goal , we first must have an idea of what it looks like .
To paraphrase the old adage : we must see it before we can believe it .
This is where visualization comes in , which is simply a technique for creating a mental image of a future event .
When we visualize our desired outcome , we begin to “ see ” the possibility of achieving it .
Through visualization , we catch a glimpse of what is , in the words of one writer , our “ preferred future . ”
When this happens , we are motivated and prepared to pursue our goal .
Visualization should not be confused with the “ think it and you will be it ” advice peddled by popular self - help gurus .
It is not a gimmick , nor does it involve dreaming or hoping for a better future .
Rather , visualization is a well - developed method of performance improvement supported by substantial scientific evidence and used by successful people across a range of fields .
Take athletes , for example .
Studies show that visualization increases athletic performance by improving motivation , coordination and concentration .
It also aids in relaxation and helps reduce fear and anxiety .
In the words of one researcher , “ visualization helps the athlete just do it and do it with confidence , poise , and perfection . ”
Former NBA great Jerry
West is a great example of how this works .
Known for hitting shots at the buzzer , he acquired the nickname “ Mr. Clutch . ”
When asked what accounted for his ability to make the big shots ,
West explained that he had rehearsed making those same shots countless times in his mind .
Other sports legends like Michael Jordan , Larry Bird , Tiger Woods and pitcher Roy Halladay have also used visualization to improve their performance and achieve their personal best .
Why Visualization Works
According to research using brain imagery , visualization works because neurons in our brains , those electrically excitable cells that transmit information , interpret imagery as equivalent to a real - life action .
When we visualize an act , the brain generates an impulse that tells our neurons to “ perform ” the movement .
This creates a new neural pathway — clusters of cells in our brain that work together to create memories or learned behaviors — that primes our body to act in a way consistent to what we imagined .
All of this occurs without actually performing the physical activity , yet it achieves a similar result .
Putting It All Together
Remember , you do n’t have to be an elite athlete to benefit from visualization .
Whether you ’re a student , businessperson , parent or spouse , visualization will keep you tethered to your goal and increase your chances of achieving it .
The power of visualization is available to all people .
There are two types of visualization , each of which serves a distinct purpose , but for greatest effect , they should be used together .
The first method is outcome visualization and involves envisioning yourself achieving your goal .
To do this , create a detailed mental image of the desired outcome using all of your senses .
For example , if your goal is to run your first marathon , visualize yourself crossing the finish line in the time you desire .
Hold that mental image as long as possible .
What does it feel like to pass under the finishing banner , looking at your watch , the cool air on your overheated body ?
Who is there to greet you as you finish ?
Your family ?
Friends ?
Other runners ?
Imagine the excitement , satisfaction , and thrill you will experience as you walk off the lactic acid and fall exhausted into their arms .
Some people find it useful to write their goal down , and then , in as much detail as possible , translate it into a visual representation .
It could be a hand - drawn picture , a photograph or a diagram .
The media does n’t matter , just as long as it helps you create a vivid mental image and stay motivated .
The second type of visualization is process visualization .
It involves envisioning each of the actions necessary to achieve the outcome you want .
Focus on completing each of the steps you need to achieve your goal , but not on the overall goal itself .
Back to the marathon example :
Before the race , visualize yourself running well — legs pumping like pistons , arms relaxed , breathing controlled .
In your mind , break the course into sections and visualize how you will run each part , thinking about your pace , gait and split time .
Imagine what it will feel like when you hit “ the wall , ” that point in the race where your body wants to stop , and more importantly , what you must do to break through it .
You may never run a marathon .
However , you can use the same principles to achieve any goal — create a vivid mental picture of yourself succeeding , envision what you must do during each step of the process and , like a runner pushing through “ the wall , ” use positive mental imagery to stay focused and motivated when you experience obstacles or setbacks .
Visualization does not guarantee success .
It also does not replace hard work and practice .
But when combined with diligent effort ( and , I would add , a strong support network ) , it is a powerful way to achieve positive , behavioral change and create the life you desire .
March ?
Already ?
That ’s horrifying .
When the first leg of the book tour was concluded , I slept a full thirteen hours in a black sleep which was beyond dreaming .
That ’s how long it took for my skin to excrete our experience with Jesse Thorn , thereby returning my body to normal function .
The schedule we were given commanded us to be a part of a program entitled “ Jordan , Jesse , Go , ” and grudgingly we obeyed the document .
Already , we were put out ; the next episode of Maury promised to feature searing video of cheaters confronted literally in mid-cheat .
When we arrived at the address to discover it was someone ’s house , I began to mentally embroider grim scenarios .
The organism who answered the door had worn a bow tie - and I am not making this up - on purpose .
The next forty - five minutes were spent engaged in absolutely the most stultifying kind of nonsense while we awaited the co-host .
Recording the show was n’t much different than the previous hour , except that now there were two people to ignore us .
We were steeped in a high PSI stream of cultural detritus , which culminated in an attempt by the hosts to engage seriously the subject of “ Waterworld . ”
I made a note in my iPhone about the experience , which reads :
- Actively fellated by a dog .
This last bit was actually the high point .
There was a period during the interview where I began to read the titles of his CDs , one after the other .
I honestly did n’t know what else to do .
I had nothing to offer these people , and they did n’t give a shit anyway , and all the while a klaxon was sounding : “ get out , get out , get out . ”
They managed to bring out a side of Gabriel that I ’ve only seen three or four times in twelve years , and only once directed at me : the implacable judge who becomes ( without warning ) the unadorned aggressor .
You must work diligently to bring out this monster ; a feat they managed in record time .
I looked him up online , in an attempt to figure out what his deal was exactly , because actually being around him did nothing to illuminate his character .
I stumbled upon a manifesto entitled The New Sincerity , and if you ’re wondering what that could possibly mean , let me tell you .
The New Sincerity is simply The Old Irony , with better PR .
Outside of our harrowing encounter with this man ’s carefully manicured artifice , the trip still resounds in the mind .
Energite levels were low the second night , an unfortunate fact for which I apologize , but I ’ve never done anything like this before .
It feels strange to go to a bunch of different places and do the same thing , the polar opposite of honesty , which the night at Barnes & Noble more or less epitomized .

Ever wished there was a movie that mixed Ancient Egypt , dinosaurs and turn of the century France ?
Well , you 're in luck as Luc Besson 's latest movie will fulfil your very specific wish .
Set in pre-World War I Paris and based on a comic strip , The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele Blanc - Sec charts the adventures of Adele Blanc - Sec , a novelist turned investigative reporter on the trail of a Pterodactyl and an Egyptian mummy .
Probably .
The trailer is in French - and contains a snippet of bare breasts , hence the NSFW tag - so it 's a little hard to make out what 's going on ; Adele could be in the employ of the mummy for all I know , but despite the language barrier the film looks like it 's going to be a lot of fun .
The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele Blanc - Sec is released in France on April 14th and hopefully will get an international release not long after .

US President Barack Obama on Saturday urged senators to grant the Federal Reserve a dramatic expansion of its regulatory powers and to establish a new consumer protection committee to help safeguard Americans from Wall Street ’s excesses .
“ These reforms are essential , ” Obama said in his weekly radio address .
“ As I ’ve urged over the past year , we need common - sense rules that will allow our markets to function fairly and freely while reining in the worst practices of the financial industry . ”

On Monday , the Senate banking committee will debate a proposal by Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd that is designed to halt what he sees as abuse and excess by financial firms .
Dodd ’s bill would empower the Federal Reserve to conduct oversight across the financial sector , putting insurance companies and even smaller lenders under their sway .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has disclosed in public that with the bank ’s expanded framework , it assumes the coming elimination of “ minimum reserve requirements ” for banking institutions .
Unhinging banks from even basic deposit standards would essentially create a class above the daily requirements of capitalism , resting atop a pool of funds with infinite depth , removing the need for what ’s currently known as “ fractional reserve banking . ”
Such a system is described by Investopedia as such : “ A banking system in which only a fraction of bank deposits are backed by actual cash - on - hand and are available for withdrawal .
This is done to expand the economy by freeing up capital that can be loaned out to other parties .
Most countries operate under this type of system . ”

Only a few other nations have removed their reserve requirements , including Mexico , Canada , Australia and the United Kingdom .
The bill also proposes greater scrutiny of large financial firms ; oversight over the sales of complicated financial products such as derivatives ; and measures to prevent banks from engaging in risky dealings through their own hedge funds .
Additionally , it would give shareholders inside companies a say in determining executive salaries and bonuses .
ADVERTISEMENT
And the bill proposes to set up a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency to prevent predatory loan practices and other abuses .
The House of Representatives has already passed a similar reform proposal .
A key difference is that Dodd ’s reform bill excludes a popular House measure promoted by Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) , which would command the Government Accountability Office to audit the Federal Reserve .
A majority of Paul ’s peers backed the proposal , but it is currently idle in the Senate .

“ I urge those in the Senate who support these reforms to remain strong , to resist the pressure from those who would preserve the status quo , to stand up for their constituents and our country , ” Obama said in his address .
“ And I promise to use every tool at my disposal to see these reforms enacted : to ensure that the bill I sign into law reflects not the special interests of Wall Street , but the best interests of the American people . ”
Dodd ’s plan to expand the Fed ’s powers has been heavily criticized by financial journalists for the bank ’s failure to prevent prior crises , such as the 2008 financial collapse .

“ [ The ] Federal Reserve had regulators in place inside of Lehman Brothers following the collapse of Bear Stearns , ” Forbes writer John Carney noted , mocking Dodd ’s plan as “ incredibly stupid . ”
“ These in - house regulators did not realize that Lehman ’s management was rebuking market demands for reduced risk and covering up its rebuke with accounting sleight - of - hand .
When Lehman actually came looking for a bailout , officials were reportedly surprised at how bad things were at the firm .
A similar situation unfolded at Merrill Lynch .
The regulators proved inadequate to the task . ”

« Il terzo spacciatore , un pregiudicato romano di 31 anni è stato sorpreso dai Carabinieri della Stazione Roma Appia mentre , nei pressi del Parco Appio Claudio , attendeva i suoi clienti affezionati .
Nascoste nelle tasche del 31enne i Carabinieri hanno rinvenuto , dosi di hashish , dosi di cocaina , 2 pasticche d'ecstasy del tipo " Brown Sugar " , uno spinello già confezionato e pronto per l'uso e la somma di 90 euro provento dell ' illecita attività » .
Questo è l'ultimo comunicato stampa che i carabinieri hanno ritenuto di diramare su Stefano Cucchi , morto pochi giorni dopo l'arresto , e sta ancora lì - terrificante - sul sito Web dell ' Arma .
Poi più niente .
Per loro ha parlato però oggi il ministro della Difesa Ignazio La Russa : « Non ho strumenti per dire come sono andate le cose , ma sono certo del comportamento assolutamente corretto da parte dei carabinieri in questa occasione » .
E uno che dice una frase così rientra o nella tipologia degli idioti o in quella dei farabutti : se non hai strumenti per dire come sono andate le cose , infatti , non si vede come se ne possano trarre in buona fede le successive « certezze » .
Google 's decision Tuesday to risk walking away from the world 's largest Internet market may have come as a shock , but security experts see it as the most public admission of a top IT problem for U.S. companies : ongoing corporate espionage originating from China .
It 's a problem that the U.S. lawmakers have complained about loudly .
In the corporate world , online attacks that appear to come from China have been an ongoing problem for years , but big companies have n't said much about this , eager to remain in the good graces of the world 's powerhouse economy .
Google , by implying that Beijing had sponsored the attack , has placed itself in the center of an international controversy , exposing what appears to be a state - sponsored corporate espionage campaign that compromised more than 30 technology , financial and media companies , most of them global Fortune 500 enterprises .
The U.S. government is taking the attack seriously .
Late Tuesday , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton released a statement asking the Chinese government to explain itself , saying that Google 's allegations " raise very serious concerns and questions . "
" The ability to operate with confidence in cyberspace is critical in a modern society and economy , " she said .
The search - engine company first learned it had a security problem in mid-December , coincidentally just days after hosting a closed - door symposium on circumventing censorship .
Soon the company 's security team realized that it was dealing with more than just a few hacked workstations .
" First , this attack was not just on Google .
As part of our investigation we have discovered that at least twenty other large companies from a wide range of businesses -- including the Internet , finance , technology , media and chemical sectors -- have been similarly targeted , " wrote Google Chief Legal Officer David Drummond in a Tuesday blog posting .
" Second , we have evidence to suggest that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists . "
Drummond said that the hackers never got into Gmail accounts via the Google hack , but they did manage to get some " account information ( such as the date the account was created ) and subject line . "
That 's because they apparently were able to access a system used to help Google comply with search warrants by providing data on Google users , said a source familiar with the situation , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the press .
" Right before Christmas , it was , ' Holy s*** , this malware is accessing the internal intercept [ systems ] , ' " he said .
That , in turn led to a Christmas Eve meeting led by Google co-founder Larry Page to assess the situation .
Three weeks later , the company had decided that things were serious enough that it would risk walking away from the largest market of Internet users in the world .
Drummond , in his blog post , said that -- in part due to this incident -- Google would no longer censor search results in China , a move that could cause its
Web site to be blocked by the Chinese government .
Corporate IT workers have come to expect all sorts of Internet attacks from China in recent years , but because of the distributed nature of the Internet , it 's very hard to determine the true source of a cyber attack .
For several hundred dollars , criminals from any country can buy so - called bulletproof hosting in China .
These servers are guaranteed not to be taken down , even if they are linked to spam or other illegal online activity .
In this case , however , Google believes the attacks really were state sponsored , said Leslie Harris , president and CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology .
" They would n't be taking an action suggesting that they cannot operate in China ... if it was not related to the Chinese government , " she said .
Google 's security team eventually managed to gain access to a server that was used to control the hacked systems , and discovered that it was not the only company to be hit .
In fact , 33 other companies had also been compromised , including Adobe Systems , according to several sources familiar with the situation .
On Jan. 2
Adobe learned of " a computer security incident involving a sophisticated , coordinated attack against corporate network systems managed by Adobe and other companies , " the company said in a blog post published just minutes after Google went public with its account of the hacking incident .
An Adobe spokeswoman declined to comment on whether or not the Google and Adobe attacks were related .
Other companies that have been hit include " Internet , finance , technology , media and chemical sectors , " Drummond said .
On Tuesday Yahoo -- another likely target -- declined to say whether it had been hit , but the company did issue a brief statement in support of Google .
These " kinds of attacks are deeply disturbing , " Yahoo said .
Microsoft said even less about the incident .
" We have no indication that any of our mail properties have been compromised , " the company said via e-mail .
" We 've never seen any attacks that were on this large of a scale and were this successful against private companies , " said Eli Jellenc , head of international threat intelligence with Verisign 's iDefense security unit .
IDefense was called in to help some of the victim companies that Google had uncovered .
According to Jellenc , the hackers sent targeted e-mail messages to victims that contained a malicious attachment containing what 's known as a zero - day attack .
These attacks are typically not detected by antivirus vendors because they exploit a previously unknown software bug .
" There is an attack exploiting a zero - day vulnerability in one of the major document types , " Jellenc said .
" They infect whichever users they can , and leverage any contact information or any access information on the victim 's computer to misrepresent themselves as that victim . "
The goal is to " infect someone with administrative access to the systems that hold the intellectual property that they 're trying to obtain , " he added .
Once they have the data they move it out of the corporate network .
The attacks followed the same game plan that security experts have seen in attacks on non-governmental organizations and the defense industry , where contractors and government agencies have been hit with similar targeted spying attacks for years now .
Some of Verisign 's defense partners said that they 'd seen some of the same IP addresses used in previous , " very similar attacks , " Jellenc said .
" Whomever is doing this , this is n't their first attack , " he said .
" These contractors also confirmed the China origin of the attacks . "
This type of attack was described in detail in an October Northrop Grumman report , ( pdf ) commissioned by the US - China Economic and Security Review Commission .
Analysts concluded that " China is likely using its maturing computer network exploitation capability to support intelligence collection against the U.S. government and industry by conducting a long term , sophisticated computer network exploitation campaign . "
At least 10 to 20 terabytes of sensitive data had been taken from U.S. government networks as part of what the report 's authors called a " long term , persistent campaign to collect sensitive but unclassified information . "
For the past few years , China has been focused on moving its economy to the next level , said James Mulvenon , director of Defense Group Inc. 's Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis .
China built its economy processing products for export , but it is not known for cutting - edge research and development .
The country has been taking steps to spur innovation within its borders , pressuring multinational companies to build research labs in China and developing the talent to eventually replace these businesses with indigenous competitors .
Mulvenon does n't find it implausible that a nation such as China would spy on U.S. companies .
" If you 're having trouble [ innovating ] or if you want to prime the pump , the best way is to go out and steal cutting - edge IP , " he said .
" It 's a plausible explanation for why they would go after Silicon Valley companies on such a broad scale because they 're really trying to jump start IT innovation in China . "

Democratic leader notes GOP Whip Cantor backed use of ‘ deem and pass ’ measure in past
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - MD ) paraphrased an old definition of the Yiddish term “ chutzpah ” to offer a stinging rebuke to Republican Whip Eric Cantor ( R - VA ) on Wednesday .
In characterizing Republican objections to the Democrats ’ possible use of what is called a “ deem and pass ” procedure to enact health care reform , Hoyer noted that “ unfortunately , Republicans are a little bit like the boy who killed his two parents and then wants sympathy because they ’re an orphan . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ This is a procedure , ” Hoyer explained . , “ that was used almost a hundred times under Newt Gingrich , and over a hundred times by Speaker Hastert , which my friend Mr. Cantor supported most of the time , if not all the time .
So this is not an unusual procedure . …
It ’s simply like a conference report . ”
The Jewish Law Commentary website , which provides the “ classic ” definition of chutzpah as “ a person who kills his parents and pleads for the court ’s mercy on the ground of being an orphan , ” notes that the term has a long legal history , going back to 1973 .
Senator Charles Schumer ( D - NY ) was once sued unsuccessfully on the grounds that the word was “ defamatory , ” and Justice Antonin Scalia even drew on it in a recent Supreme Court decision .
The same phrase was used two years ago by journalist Sidney Blumenthal to describe the campaign for Scooter Libby to receive a presidential pardon for his role in the outing of CIA officer Valerie Plame .
“ Most of those who throw themselves on the mercy of the court express sorrow at what they have done , ” Blumenthal wrote .
“ Like the child who has killed his parents and demands mercy for being an orphan , Libby tried to murder the truth and then got dozens of people to plead for leniency based on his good character . ”
Cantor , who is Jewish and presumably recognized the reference , did not react to Hoyer ’s words .
“ This is a process that you can avoid a direct up or down vote on a bill , ” was his only response .
“ I do n’t think you can fool the public .
I mean , this is an attempt to hide the vote . …
The rules of the House allow for this type of ‘ deeming ’ provision .
… but , again , why do that ?
This is so big , we should have an up or down vote . ”

The success in producing proton collisions represents a remarkable comeback for CERN , but the lab is still only halfway back to where it wanted to be .
Only a year and a half ago , the first attempt to start the collider ended with an explosion that left part of its tunnel enveloped in frigid helium gas and soot when an electrical connection between two of the powerful magnets that steer the protons vaporized .
Image Scientists in the CERN control room outside Geneva reacted Tuesday to the start of the $ 10 billion Large Hadron Collider .
Credit ... Anja Niedringhaus / Associated Press
A subsequent investigation revealed that the collider was riddled with thousands of such joints , a result of what Lucio Rossi , head of magnets at CERN , said was a “ lack of adequate risk analysis , ” in a recent report in the online journal Superconductor Science and Technology .
As a result , the collider , which was designed to accelerate protons to seven trillion electron volts , then smash them together to reveal particles and forces that reigned during the first trillionth of a second of time as we know it , can only be safely run for now at half power .
CERN physicists say that operating the collider for a year and a half at this energy level should allow them to gather enough data to start catching up with its American rival , the trillion - electron - volt Tevatron at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois .
The Tevatron is smaller but has been running for years and thus has a head start in data .
After that , the CERN machine will be shut down for a year so that the connections can be rebuilt .
Particle colliders get their oomph from Einstein ’s equation of mass and energy .
The more energy — denoted in the physicists ’ currency of choice , electron volts — that these machines can pack into their little fireballs , the farther back in time they can go , closer and closer to the Big Bang , and the smaller and smaller are the things they can see .
The first modern accelerator was the cyclotron , built by Ernest Lawrence at the University of California , Berkeley , in the 1930s .
An early version was a foot in diameter and accelerated protons to energies of 1.25 million electron volts .
Over the last century , universities and then nations leapfrogged each other , building bigger machines to peer deeper into the origins of the universe .
But the race ended in 1993 , when Congress canceled the Superconducting Supercollider , a 54 - mile , 20 trillion - electron - volt machine being built underneath Waxahachie , Tex. , after its projected cost ballooned to $ 11 billion .

On December 8 , 2009 , I received one of my rare invitations to make a presentation to climate scientists – a keynote speech at the plenary session on June 16 , 2010 of World Dendro 2010 .
At the time they had received almost 500 abstracts .
It was proposed that I speak on a program chaired by Achim Bräuning , with presentations in sequence by ‘ N.N’ , Juha - Pekka Lunkka , me , Keith Briffa , Fidel Roig .
Two days ago , I was advised that due to receiving almost 500 abstracts , their biggest problem has been to find more time for presentations and ‘ many good presentations are without time and place ’ , so they canceled the plenary session in which I was presenting and thus my presentation .
( This and two other plenary sessions are still listed on the programme .
Update 11 pm – at the dendro listserv here , the cancellation of the Plenary session was announced on Feb 17 – so the cancellation of the Plenary session is real . )
They said that they were “ sorry for this bad news ” and expressed hope that time could be found for such discussion “ in some future events ” and thanked me for my “ interest in WorldDendro2010 Conference ” .
I replied ;
Reading between the lines , I assume that some other speakers protested against my making a presentation .
I appreciate the original invitation , I regret that you withdrew it but understand your situation .
They acknowledged :
You are right that quite many planned speakers for the Roundtable discussion were not very willing to participate that session .
Their effort to find more time for oral presentations in parallel scientific sessions appears real enough [ 11 pm – at the dendro listserv here , the organizers were criticized for not having enough slots for all the people who wanted to present ] , but somehow did n’t seem to apply to me .
As I said in my reply , I understand the practical reasons governing the Finnish organizers and I appreciate their initiative in the first place .
I do n’t entirely understand why any dendro would feel so threatened by discussing things like the connection of linear mixed effects models to the construction of tree ring chronologies that they would refuse to participate in such a session , but hey – it ’s climate science .
They ’d rather avoid criticism than confront it .
Update : as noted by a reader below .
Wyoming State Climatologist asked the conference organizers to “ reconsider ” one of their choices for plenary session :

Thank you for bringing this to the Forum .
I share your frustration regarding attempts to organize a session , and I am puzzled by the apparent rejection of so many abstracts .
As you say , the purpose of such meeting should be to “ maximize attendance and the exchange of information between members of the global tree - ring community ” .
What concerns me even more is the preliminary list of invited speakers .
I believe that plenary and keynote talks should challenge and inspire the community .
However , in at least one case it appears the organizers are giving the stage to someone who would just as soon destroy our work for their own petty agenda .
I sincerely hope that the organizers will reconsider their choices before making the program final .

Carbohydrates or carbs for short have become the villain of our diets .
Diet authors and diet marketers have declared the carb as bad for our diets , bad for our health and the cause for the rise in obesity , diabetes and a host of other illnesses .
You can read how someone became overweight from eating carbs .
Or a health study ’s conclusion was that participants gained weight while on a high carbohydrate diet compared to a low carbohydrate diet .
Many times , what the diet marketers do n’t tell you is what type of carbs these people were eating .
It usually turns out that yes ; they were eating a lot of carbs , the bad carbs like cookies , cakes , donuts , white bread and the rest of the bad carbs .
Of course someone eating those will gain weight , not to mention sugar is also a carbohydrate .
In too many studies , the participants did n’t even know what kind of carbs they were eating , whole grain , white flour , cracked flour or exactly what kind .
Their conclusion , all carbs are bad and cause weight gain .
Why We Need Carbohydrates
The different types of carbohydrates are simple carbs ( sugars ) and complex carbohydrates ( starch and dietary fiber ) .
Both carbohydrates turn into glucose in our body and that is what the body uses as fuel , energy and replenishing the muscles .
We need to eat three groups of foods for good health .
These are fats , protein and carbohydrates .
Some diet marketers try to make us believe that we should n’t eat any or hardly any carbohydrates , but that would n’t be healthy .
Our body needs carbohydrates for the following important functions :
· Carbs are broken down and used for energy since it is the body ’s main source of fuel .
· Every cell in our body uses carbohydrates for energy and the health of the cells .
· The organs , muscles and the central nervous system need carbs to function properly .
The heart also needs carbohydrates for healthy functioning .
Remember , the heart is also a muscle .
· The fibers in carbohydrates are important for a healthy digestive system .
It is in carbs that you will find both kinds of fiber ( soluble and insoluble ) , vitamins , minerals and many phytochemicals you cannot get from protein or fats .
The Bad Carbs
Bad carbs are usually thought of as the simple carbs , like sugar , soda pop and fruit juices .
Bad carbs also include the over processed highly refined carbohydrates like white flour , white bread , white rice , cookies , cakes , donuts and anything else made with these refined products .
There are really no bad carbs in nature ; the bad carbs are man-made .
In nature , carbohydrates have plenty of fiber and nutrients ; it is only after the processing that takes the fiber and nutrients out that causes carbohydrates to become bad carbs .
When you see labels that say enriched bread ; that means they have put some of the vitamins and nutrients back into the bread after they had already been processed out .
These added vitamins are usually man-made substitutes and not as good as the vitamins and minerals that were originally in the grain , and enriched certainly does n’t mean that all of the nutrients were added back in .
How Bad Carbs Affect Our Health
When you eat refined carbohydrates or simple carbs , they are digested rapidly into glucose , causing the pancreas to make insulin .
Insulin tries to put the glucose into the liver , muscles and cells .
If too much glucose is put into the system too quickly , the pancreas continues to put out more and more insulin .
Over time this can lead to insulin resistance , a precursor to type II diabetes and the metabolic syndrome .
With continual eating of the highly refined bad carbs , the glucose levels stay high .
Insulin cannot work fast enough , the liver in a sense runs out of storage room and the rest of the unused glucose is converted to and stored as fat .
Usually belly fat .
This rapid digestion into glucose can give a quick rise in energy but dissipates quickly , leaving you hungry and tired .
A simple carb can be good in certain athletic competitions , but in everyday life , the quick burst of energy means a quick return to hunger and worn out feeling , which just makes you eat more , sooner , without ever using up that quick energy .
So it is stored as fat .
Good Carbs
The more natural or unprocessed a carbohydrate is , the more of a good carb it is .
A list of good carbs would be vegetables , long grain and brown rice , whole grain bread , quinoa , whole grain pasta , fruit , white and sweet potatoes .
The good carbohydrates do not flood our body with high amounts of glucose all at once , and the fiber that is naturally in good carbs , slows down the digestion of carbohydrates so our body is n’t overwhelmed trying to make insulin .
Eating all kinds of vegetables is a great way to get the good carbs and their nutrients .
As a consumer , it is hard to know if we are buying and eating whole grains or some kind of refined grain with misleading words in the ingredients .
The first ingredient should say whole wheat , whole oats or some other whole grain , if it does n’t , then it most likely is not whole grain .
You ca n’t really go by the fiber count , since a product that is highly refined flour could have fiber added .
But that would n’t be the natural kind of fiber that was already there and taken out by the refining process .
Conclusion
One reason for the rise in obesity is that the average diet has become so full of the processed and refined bad carbs .
Not the good carbs .
Simple carbs like sugar , high corn fructose syrup soda pops and fruit juices along with the highly refined breads and buns , rice and pasta can add pounds of fat to your body each year .
There are far more studies that show a diet high in good carbohydrates are healthy for us than they are bad for us [ 1 ] .
By limiting the amount of good carbs in your diet , you are depriving yourself of healthy minerals , phytochemicals and fiber that you cannot get from the other food groups .
Just remember to eat the whole unprocessed and unrefined good carbohydrates .

Fallout from a loss of public confidence in climate science is affecting other fields of research , a top US academic claimed .
American opinion polls point to a general deterioration in people 's faith in science , according to Dr Ralph Cicerone , president of the National Academy of Sciences .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
It came after two major public relations setbacks for the global warming gurus .
One was the " climategate " scandal involving leaked emails from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia , which led to accusations that scientists manipulated and suppressed data .
The other was an admission by the United Nations ' influential climate change body that it issued flawed data about the rate at which Himalayan glaciers were melting .
Two years ago the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) reported that the mountain range could lose all its glaciers by 2035 .
In fact the claim had no valid scientific
backing .
Speaking about " transparency and integrity in science " today at the world 's biggest science conference in San Diego , California , Dr Cicerone said there had been a loss of public trust in climatology that appeared to be spreading .

The Bigfoot - Giganto Theory
Background " Bigfoot research " is a term loosely used to describe any efforts to probe or explain the reports and physical evidence associated with bigfoots .
Over the years several different theories have been offered .
Some of the more common theories are : 1 ) fear manifestations , 2 ) misidentifications of bears , 3 ) paranormal / UFO - related , 4 ) the Collective - Memory hypothesis , 5 ) the Bigfoot - Giganto hypothesis .
Bigfoot advocates as well as informed skeptics generally do not believe a hoax is responsible for this phenomenon , primarily because the observations extend so far back in time .
The patterns among eyewitnesses are not demographic , they are geographic -- they are not reported by certain types of people , rather by people who venture into certain areas .
This simple pattern suggests an external cause .
No matter what that cause is , it is important to understand , and not just because of the potential behind the most likely explanation .
Bigfoot researchers generally lean toward one explanation : The Bigfoot - Giganto Theory ( hypothesis ) .
The subject of Gigantopithecus has attracted an increasing amount of interest anthropologists and primatologitsts over the past few decades .
The Bigfoot - Giganto hypothesis suggests that bigfoots are surving relatives of the genus Gigantopithecus .
Gigantopithecus ( the Latin word for " Giant Ape " ) was a giant cousin of the orangutan .
It was presumed to be extinct .

Bigfoot - Giganto theorists deal with a few issues that affect the potential linkage of modern bigfoot reports to ancient Gigantos .
Probably the most crucial question concerns whether Gigantos walked upright .
There is more than one school of thought among anthrolopogists regarding this issue .
Some physical anthropologists interpret the scant fossilized remains to indicate an upright walking ape , measuring an impressive nine feet tall , and weighing more than 1000 pounds -- the general description of bigfoot type creatures reported for centuries in North America and Asia .
Even if Giganto posture is uncertain , no one can reasonably dispute the conclusion that Gigantos were the largest primates that ever walked the earth .
Bigfoot - Giganto theorists believe that Gigantos ' large brain size ( perhaps the largest in the terrestrial animal kingdom ) and upright - walking posture facilitated their dispersion across Asia and North America .
Thousands of years of adaptation to temperate and mountainous climates , it is believed , would have given these large upright walking apes the ability to tolerate cold temperatures , climb through deep snow , and cross high mountain ranges with relative ease .
The figure to the left is a photo of a life - size Giganto reconstruction based on fossilized remains ( click on the photo to see a larger version ; the same reconstruction is pictured below with the sculptor showing its size relative to humans ) .
The first photo is from the cover of a book about Gigantopithecus .
The translation of the German title is " Why Did Giganto Have to Die ? "
( The original English version of the book is titled , " Other Origins " . )
There is some physical evidence to indicate that Gigantos in Asia were hunted and eaten by Homo erectus ( ancestors to humans that lived contemporaneously with Gigantos ) .
The mainstream explanation for the apparent disappearance of Gigantos lays blame primarily on this predation by Homo erectus .
Bigfoot - Giganto theorists do not accept the idea that a highly mobile genus like Gigantopithecus could have been completely wiped out by Homo erectus .
Instead they look to consistencies in present day bigfoot reports and see the necessary behavioral adaptations which would have allowed the Giganto line to avoid extinction at the hands of man .
Bigfoots are typically sighted in or near remote wooded , mountainous , or swampy areas .
They are rarely seen far from the cover of trees .
If they encounter humans during daylight hours they tend to retreat and vanish into the forest .
They seem to be most active when humans are least active -- late at night .
Unlike mountain gorillas , bigfoots are never seen in large groups , and they do n't stay in the same place for very long .
The ellusiveness of these modern mystery animals may stem from their bad experiences with pre-humans in Asia .
The Hypothesis
Over the past 500,000 years hominids gradually emerged from the thickest forests and began to organize into more stationary settlements .
Gigantos remained semi-nomadic in the thick forests .
Small family groups of Gigantos were widely dispersed in these forests .
This dispersal provided more reliable foraging .
It also made quick , quiet evasion much easier .
Small Giganto families of 2 - 4 wandered nomadically through vast forests .
The territories were usally remote , but sometimes bordered human settled areas .
After thousands of generations they developed some amazing evasion / defense mechanisms and behaviors , including night vision abilities .
They also developed powerful vocal abilities , which allowed them to locate and interact with others of their kind .
They made powerfully loud screams and howls that could be heard for miles in the dead of night .
Late hours allowed them to avoid various undesirables : human dangers , overheating , water loss , and the worst insects .
The night time vocalizations , and occassional tracks , were usually the only things noted by humans in the area .
The most commonly heard argument against the Bigfoot - Giganto hypothesis is that " we should have found their bones in North America by now ... "
This argument is , in fact , weak when one considers that very few remains of Gigantos have ever been found in Asia , where they were much more abundant .
Tens of thousands of years of Gigantos ' accepted existence in Asia would have produced literally millions of Giganto skeletons , yet the volume of collected remains from Asia is so small that the entire collection could fit easily in one suitcase .
One flavor of the Bigfoot - Giganto hypothesis suggests that bigfoots might not be direct descendants of the genus Gigantopithecus , but rather some other offshoot of the giant Asian " wood ape " line , perhaps a line for which we have zero fossils remains at the present time .
The Giganto line is an important reference point for this alternate explanation for two reasons : 1 ) the Giganto line illustrates the potential for primates to grow to such ' gigantic ' proportions ( twice as large as the largest ' known ' living primate ) , and 2 ) the fact that so few remains of Gigantos have been unearthed and identified makes it more conceivable that there could have been other lines of giant Asian wood apes for which we have no fossil remains at the present time .
People often assume that bones of a wild animal are present and available long after the animal 's death .
Many people assume that wild animal bones always become fossilized .
The fact is bones become fossilized or otherwise preserved only in the rarest of circumstances .
Without fossilization or preservation , bones of wild animals will , in time , become completely reabsorbed into the biomass .
We would literally be climbing over piles of animal bones if they were not naturally recycled .
An animal carcass in a dense forest will be reabsorbed relatively quickly through weathering , decay and scavenging by other animals and insects .
The odds are very very poor that bones of a rare , elusive , forest dwelling species will be found in some recognizable form by a hiker cruising along a trail .
No research group has ever made an attempt to look for Giganto bones in North America , so no one should be surprised that Giganto remains have never been identified in North America .
Ironically , the most vocal skeptics and scientists who rhetorically ask why no bones have been located and identified on this continent are the last people who would ever make an effort to look for them .
Some Bigfoot - Giganto theorists speculate that fragmentary remains of Gigantos have been unearthed in North America in the past but were simply disregarded or misidentified .
The second most common argument against the Bigfoot - Giganto hypothesis asks " Why have n't hunters shot one in North America yet ? ... "
The reasons are more obvious than most people might realize , and there 's enough of them to make a separate article on that topic .
The third most common argument against the Bigfoot - Giganto hypothesis asks " Why are n't there more photos of these modern Gigantos ? ... "
This question is also addressed in a separate article .
Thousands of people across Russia took to the streets yesterday demanding the resignation of Vladimir Putin , in the largest show of discontent since he came to power more than a decade ago .
Opposition movements called the nationwide " Day of Wrath " to express growing discontent at falling living standards following years of oil - fuelled growth .
The protests followed weeks of sustained demonstrations across Russia that have riled a leadership that does not forgive displays of unrest .
Cries of " Freedom " and " Putin resign " filled the main square in Kaliningrad , where up to 5,000 people gathered in pouring rain .
The Baltic territory , which is nestled between Poland and Lithuania and separated from the Russian mainland , has been the site of some of the largest protests to date .
" We want the government to start treating us like people , not like slaves , " said Kirill , a 22 - year - old student .
Protesters called for free elections and complained about widespread corruption , high unemployment and rising prices .
Russia 's first major anti-Putin demonstration was held in Kaliningrad on 30 January , drawing 12,000 people and shocking local leaders and the Kremlin .
" It really surprised us , " said Konstantin Polyakov , deputy head of the regional parliament , or Duma , and member of the ruling United Russia party .
" We did n't think so many people would turn out , to be honest . "
The Kremlin was obviously shaken , dispatching a high - level delegation to the Baltic exclave and firing its Kaliningrad adviser , Oleg Matveichev .
Saturday 's protest had been banned , and opposition leaders withdrew calls for an organised demonstration , fearing violence .
Yet several thousand showed up anyway , organising through the internet and word of mouth .
" The general public in the regions is beginning to recognise that it is Putin who is actually to blame for various troubles they have – increased cost of living , communal tariffs , taxes and no growth in real wages , " said Vladimir Milov , a co-leader of Solidarity , an umbrella opposition movement .
Regional and local elections held on 14 March appear to support that theory .
United Russia , the party created with the sole purpose of supporting Putin 's rule – he is currently prime minister – garnered unprecedentedly low results , losing its majority in four of eight regions and giving up the mayorship of Irkutsk , Siberia 's largest city , to a Communist candidate who took 62 % of the vote .
In Kaliningrad , protesters wore badges criticising United Russia and held aloft mandarins , the fruit that has come to symbolise the region 's unpopular governor , Georgy Boos , a Muscovite appointed by Putin .
Few , even those in opposition , believe the Putin government will fall .
" It will take time , " Milov said .
" But just two years ago it would have been impossible to imagine mass demonstrations making political demands like the resignation of Putin 's government . "
A poll this month by Russia 's Public Opinion Foundation found that 29 % of Russians were ready to take part in protests , up from 21 % in February .
More than 1,000 people turned out on Saturday in the port of Vladivostok , where discontent has steadily grown since the government imposed a tax on imported cars .
About 500 people rallied in Irkutsk and St Petersburg .
Riot police broke up an unsanctioned rally in Moscow violently and arrested 50 activists .
Authorities also shut down a website set up for the " Day of Wrath " , www.20marta.ru, and in the northern city of Arkhangelsk an opposition leader was arrested and charged with theft .
In Kaliningrad , on the border with the European Union and far from the seat of power , the police presence was minimal , although agents in plain clothes roamed through the crowd .
" Our population is different from Russia , " said Polyakov , sitting in his office adorned with photos of Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev , in what is , technically , Russia .
" Our people , especially the youth , travel more to Europe than to Russia .
There 's no reason to go there . "
In an implicit criticism of Moscow politics , he added : " We 're more European – more relaxed , less eastern .
And we 're more democratic . "
Despite the protesters ' rhetoric , Polyakov argued that Putin 's popularity in the region remains high .
His wife , Lyudmila , was born here and visits regularly .
But local authorities , acting in concert with Moscow , reacted with unusual harshness to Kaliningrad 's wave of protests .
They banned a rally in the city centre , saying protesters could gather in a stadium on the outskirts instead .
In an ironic twist , the government has been forced to give in to opponents of liberal market reforms .
Following the Kaliningrad protest , it has promised to slow the post - Soviet desubsidisation of utilities like heat and water .
That will only widen a budget deficit expected to exceed 6 % of GDP this year .
" The leadership is scared , " said Solomon Ginzburg , an independent deputy in the regional Duma .
" I have been saying the Kaliningrad region is an indicator – in nine months , it will be all over Russia . "
Candles and stained glass windows cast a dim light as nuns placed a wide - eyed baby boy with dark tufts of hair on a white cloth covering an ornate altar in Florence , Italy .
The nuns had gathered to pray over the newborn .
The infant amazed his audience by not squirming or uttering a peep .
Since his first day of life on July 28 , when the Carmelite sisters of St. Teresa discovered the newborn laying on an alcove floor of their church , they have prayed that the abandoned child would not grow up alone .
The nuns named him Pietro , or Peter , after the apostle Peter , whose name came from the Greek word for rock .
They knew he would need strength to deal with the many unanswered questions about his identity .
Across an ocean , 28 - year - old Brandon Henry was on a quest for answers of his own .
He no longer believed his girlfriend 's story that their baby died at birth last summer at a Sugar Land hospital .
So Henry embarked on a quest for the truth , an odyssey that took him to that cloistered monastery in Florence and completely changed his life .
Love and a pregnancy
Henry , a 1999 Cypress - Fairbanks graduate , spent three years in the U.S. Army , where he became a private first class .
After his discharge , he tried to parlay his collection of 6,000 CDs and music knowledge into becoming a DJ at Houston dance clubs .
Then in 2007 he thought he'd met the girl of his dreams , Stephanie Chavarria .
He went so far as to give her a diamond ring and obtain a marriage license that would later expire .
“ She had a wonderful smile .
We just clicked , ” recalled Henry , flipping through photos of him with his arm around his dark - haired beauty , whose family came from Mexico .
They continued dating — but secretly against her parents ' wishes — for 2½ years .
Chavarria and her parents , both dentists , live in an affluent neighborhood in Sugar Land .
Henry said Chavarria 's family never embraced him .
“ I went to my girlfriend 's house once , but I was not welcome , ” he said .
“ I was n't good enough .
They wanted her to be with a doctor or lawyer . ”
Then one day he noticed her stomach protruding , and a test showed she was pregnant .
“ I was excited about it , ” he said .
But he said she concealed her condition with baggy clothes and kept delaying telling her parents .
A month before her Aug. 8 due date , she announced her doctor had given her permission to travel to Mexico for her grandmother 's birthday .
“ I did n't begin to worry until a three - day trip turned into 2 ½ weeks , and I could no longer reach her by phone , ” he said .
When she finally returned , she told him a doctor was having trouble detecting the baby 's heartbeat .
She later called to say she was at a Sugar Land hospital and they 'd lost their son , who had strangled on his umbilical cord .
“ After that , I took off work .
I did not want to miss my son's funeral , ” Henry said .
But before arrangements could be made , he could n't reach his girlfriend .
So he called her parents , whom he said called him “ sick and crazy ” and threatened to file harassment charges .
He then contacted the hospital , which found no record of Chavarria being there .
That was when he turned to the police .
At first , Carmen and Lazaro Chavarria told Sugar Land police their daughter was never pregnant and that Henry was trying to harass her .
But that story quickly changed after Henry produced a copy of the baby 's sonogram .
That 's when Stephanie Chavarria confessed to leaving the child in Florence while vacationing with her parents , police said .
“ She told me she gave birth in the hotel bathroom , ” Henry said .
“ Then , not knowing what else to do , she 'd gone into a church to pray .
She wanted help but nobody spoke English .
So she just left him there . ”
Chavarria and her parents declined to comment for this story .
Their attorney , Robert Fickman , said an international probe into possible charges of child abandonment prevents them from speaking .
“ We want to be very respectful of Italian authorities , ” Fickman said .
“ But I can tell you the Chavarrias are a very nice , loving , caring family .
They are not people without feeling . ”
The moment Henry learned that his baby was alive , he vowed to do anything to find him .
“ It would have been easy to walk away , ” said Henry 's mother , Sherrye Andrews , a teacher in Duncanville .
“ But he never wanted his son to think nobody looked for him . ”
Internet guides search
For two weeks ,
Henry scoured the Internet and fired off e-mails to any Florence church he could find until locating one nun who spoke English .
She recalled widespread publicity in the Italian press about the neonato abandonato , or abandoned baby .
When he Googled that phrase , the stories popped up .
He e-mailed Florence police , and they called him at 3 a.m. Aug. 20 to confirm his claim on the abandoned baby that six Italian families were already trying to adopt .
Henry had no idea how to navigate Italy 's justice system until an Italian attorney , Edgar Vincent Lualdi , offered assistance .
Henry lived for two months in the attorney 's weekend villa for free while the case was pending .
“ But in return I helped him with some chores , like picking olives , ” he said .
After a DNA analysis proved Henry was indeed the father , he was finally permitted to see his son , who was 3 months old by then .
“ Wow !
That 's my baby ! ” he said , recalling the moment .
“ It was like being at the hospital when he was first born , but he was big . ”
His son was being kept at an orphanage in a nearby seaside village called Viareggio .
Then Henry was required by Italian authorities to spend a week learning how to bathe and feed his son and honing his diaper - changing skills .
The orphanage workers were impressed by how quickly he adapted to fatherhood and connected with his son .
“ Peter would grin whenever he saw me coming , ” Henry said .
Making plans for future
Until he and his son can function on their own , they are living at his mother 's home in Cedar Hill , near Dallas , and receiving lots of support from relatives .
Henry devotes all his time to caring for his son while making plans to attend school to become an X - ray technician this summer .
His mother is glad to help .
She remembers being overwhelmed when she saw her first grandchild arrive at the Dallas airport : “ He was smiling , and I just started bawling , ” she said .
In his new nursery filled with toys , Peter plants a big , wet , pucker - less kiss on his father 's cheek .
Henry remains grateful for every kiss — and the nuns ' prayers that he credits for helping to get his son home .

News this week of free - for - some downloadable content plans for Mass Effect 2 generated confusion about who will have to pay for what .
Answers are emerging , including more free content and a $ 15 cost for used - game consumers who want it all .

The main element that has puzzled gamers is The Cerberus Network , which was announced on Tuesday as a portal that would grant Mass Effect 2 gamers access to free downloadable content and news about new offers .
The Network is free to consumers who buy a new copy of the game , but would cost those buying the game used an unspecified fee .
That fee would possibly cancel out some of the savings a used - game purchaser would gain by not buying a game new .

Kotaku has been able to confirm that the Cerberus Network is currently listed on the servers of Mass Effect 2 publisher EA as costing 1200 Microsoft Points , or $ 15 .
That is the same price that BioWare / EA 's previous game , Dragon Age : Origins , charged used - game shoppers in order to access its similar free - for - original - consumers DLC .
On Wednesday , before that $ 15 price came to light , Greg Zeschuk , co-founder of Mass Effect 2 development studio BioWare told the live audience of Kotaku Talk Radio , this website 's weekly podcast , that the plan is for the Cerberus Network to extend Mass Effect 2's appeal .
" For us , really , the Cerberus Network is a way to reward our fans and give them a long - term relationship , " he said .
" There will be some free stuff ...
There will be surprises that we spring on people , [ saying ]
' Hey there 's a new x , y , or z , go check it out . '
That 's one of the benefits of being part of the Cerberus Network . "
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
What the Cerberus Network wo n't be , Zeschuk said to ally concerns , is a requirement .
People will not need to be a part of the Network in order to make future Mass Effect 2 DLC purchases .
" You could either join it or not join it , " he said .
" You could still get ... DLC ... for purchase . "

The free day - one DLC offered via the Cerberus Network includes a set of armor , a gun and a new character who is introduced via an extra mission .
EA confirmed to Kotaku today that the previously announced Hammerhead hover tank will also be a Cerberus offering , free to those who have joined the Network .
Zeschuk said that EA will pay close attention to how these DLC offerings are adopted by Mass Effect 2 players .
That comment seems to leave the company room to be adaptable .

The BioWare chief also said that all of this will be much more clear to owners of the game , who will be able to use a virtual laptop interface to check out what they can get , when they can get it and for how much .
Mass Effect 2 will be out for the Xbox 360 and PC next week .

Not everything in science has to be an experiment , you know .
I 've been holding on to my frozen Halloween pumpkin for ages ( since Halloween ) , and I decided it was finally time to cook some of it up .
I love pumpkin soup , because I feel like the pumpkin does well with a good deal of spice .
I threw in some cauliflower , because I love to have it spicy .
I also added some red beans to give it some body .
Overall , I really like this soup .
It 's great with a salad , or as a meal topped with pumpkin seeds or avocado .
Indian Pumpkin , Cauliflower , and Red Bean Soup
1 onion , diced
1 inch ginger , grated
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 head cauliflower , diced into bite sized pieces
1 teaspoon garam masala
2 cups pumpkin puree
4 cups vegetable broth
2 cups red beans
salt to taste
Saute the onion and ginger in olive oil over medium high heat for five or six minutes , until the onion becomes translucent .
Add in the cauliflower , and saute for five or six minutes more , until the cauliflower starts to brown .
Add more oil if you need it .
Stir in the garam masala , and cook for a minute until it becomes fragrant .
Add in the pumpkin puree and vegetable broth .
Bring the soup to a boil and then simmer for 45 minutes .
Stir in the red beans and simmer for another 15 minutes .
Salt to taste and serve immediately .
Variations :
If you want a smoother texture , puree the soup partially or totally before you add in the red beans .
Any spicy spice blend like curry powder or chili powder can be substituted for garam masala .
Google 's new Nexus
One mobile phone may be the New Cool Thing , but the family of sci - fi legend Philip K . Dick is alleging that the search giant lifted the device 's name straight from an iconic
Dick novel without even bothering to pick up one of their fancy new smartphones to ask permission .
" Google takes first and then deals with the fallout later , " Isa Dick Hackett , Dick 's daughter , told Wired.com .
Google officially announced the new Android OS - based phone — the Nexus One — on Tuesday .
But the estate of the paranoid sci-fi legend Philip K. Dick says the name originates from the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep that later became the sci- fi classic Blade Runner .
In that story , a private detective is tracking down a rogue android , a Nexus 6 model .
Reports of the estate 's objection have led to accusations that the estate is just grubbing for money , though few seemed to think the same of George Lucas when Motorola paid him to use the name Droid for their Android OS - powered smartphone .
" People do n't get it , " Hackett said .
" It 's the principle of it . "
The family says the use is a trademark violation , and sent Google a letter Wednesday demanding the company cease using the Nexus name and requesting the company turn over relevant documents within 10 days .
But when the device was introduced Tuesday , Google explained the name had nothing to do with Dick 's work , and was simply using the word in its original sense – as a place where things converge .
Additionally , the Nexus
One character is n't trademarked by the family like Lucas did with Droid , nor are any robots or replicants used in its branding .
This is not the first time the Dick estate has complained that Google takes without asking .
The estate , joined by the Steinbeck family and musician Arlo Guthrie , came out early and vocally against the Google Book Search deal last spring , arguing that it was overly complicated and that copyright holders were being asked to make binding decisions .
That motion won a four - month stay from the federal judge overseeing the case .
That provided time for a substantial opposition movement to grow , eventually forcing Google to substantially modify the settlement — which is still in legal limbo .
You might think that would have made Google lawyers think twice about using the name without contacting the family first .
" It would be nice to have a dialogue .
We are open to it , " Hackett said .
" That 's a way to start . "
Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment .

Stupak 's abortion argument : Still more about class than choice
Matt Miller hits on one of the most important points in the abortion and health - care debate .
The practical effect of Bart Stupak 's position is not that the federal government will not subsidize abortion by subsidizing health - care insurance .
It is that it will not subsidize abortion by subsidizing health - care insurance for poor women .
We already spend much more subsidizing coverage that includes abortion for richer women :
This entire debate is ridiculous , because the feds already subsidize abortions massively , via the giant tax subsidy for employer - provided care .
Today the feds devote at least $ 250 billion a year to subsidizing employer - based coverage , a subsidy that skews incentives horribly ( but which big business and big labor would n’t let the politicians touch this year ) .
A Guttmacher Institute study says that 87 percent of typical employer plans cover abortion , and a Kaiser study found that 46 percent of covered workers had abortion coverage .
As I 've written before , the Stupak amendment is as much about class as it is about choice .
Imagine if Stupak attempted to expand his campaign to the coverage employed women receive .
It would , after all , be the same principle : Federal policy should not subsidize insurance that offers abortion coverage .
But it would n't have a chance .
That group is too large and too affluent and too politically powerful for Congress to dare to touch its access to reproductive services .
But the poorer women who will be using subsidies on the exchange are a much easier target .

Are you looking for Python decorators in Scala ?
I did look for them when
first studying Scala .
I tried to look up for Scala / Java annotations ,
as the syntax was too similar to ignore the clue .
But annotations are for adding runtime ( reflection accessible ) metadata .
As it turned out , Scala usually try to push as much as possible out of language specification to library implementation , and , also in this
case , there are more general , powerful language features to mimic Python
decorators .
Simple Python decorators
Let ’s consider the first naive example :
def three_times ( wrapped ) : def wrapping ( * args , ** kargs ) : for _ in xrange ( 3 ) : wrapped ( * args , ** kargs ) return wrapping @three_times def foo( ) : print " hello ! "
this yields :
>>> foo( ) hello !
hello! hello !
In scala you can leverage call by name evaluation strategy to obtain a similar result .
Instead of wrapping the entire function , you wrap the function body ( or only part of it , when necessary )
scala > def threeTimes ( code : => Unit ) = 1 to 3 foreach {_ => code} threeTimes : ( code : => Unit ) Unit scala > def foo = threeTimes { println ( " hello ! " ) } foo : Unit scala > foo hello !
hello! hello !
In the more general case , call by name is very effective in building customized and powerful control structures ( see for the scala actors library
for an example of how scala can be “ extended ” with specialized control structure ) .
Also Python ’s with statement can be implement using call - by - name .
Decorating recursive functions
There is another way to “ decorate ” a function , that is useful when
decorating a recursive function .
Let ’s take the classical Fibonacci function :
def memo( wrapped ) : cache = {} def wrapping ( * args ) : if args in cache : print " cache hit for %s " % args return cache[ args ] else : ret = wrapped ( * args ) cache[ args ] = ret return ret return wrapping @memo def fib( i ) : return ( 0 if i == 0 else 1 if i == 1 else fib ( i - 1 ) + fib ( i - 2 ) )
Note that the call - by - name approach does n’t work in this case because the memoizing function needs to access memoized function parameters .
Using Scala ’s function literals we can do :
object
Test { def memo(f : Int= > Int ) = new Function1 [ Int , Int ] { var cache = Map [ Int , Int ] ( ) def apply ( i: Int ) = if ( cache contains i ) { println ( " cache hit for " + i ) cache ( i ) } else { val ret = f ( i ) cache += ( i -> ret ) ret } } val fib : Int= >
Int = memo { case 0 => 0 case 1 => 1 case n => fib ( n - 1 ) + fib( n - 2 ) } }
Sometimes you can see something in the shape of an animal 's spots , but have you ever seen a cat shape on the back of a cat ?
Link -via The Daily What
Princeton engineers have made a breakthrough in an 80 - year - old quandary in quantum physics , paving the way for the development of new materials that could make electronic devices smaller and cars more energy efficient .
By reworking a theory first proposed by physicists in the 1920s , the researchers discovered a new way to predict important characteristics of a new material before it 's been created .
The new formula allows computers to model the properties of a material up to 100,000 times faster than previously possible and vastly expands the range of properties scientists can study .
" The equation scientists were using before was inefficient and consumed huge amounts of computing power , so we were limited to modeling only a few hundred atoms of a perfect material , " said Emily Carter , the engineering professor who led the project .
" But most materials are n't perfect , " said Carter , the Arthur W. Marks ' 19 Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and Applied and Computational Mathematics .
" Important properties are actually determined by the flaws , but to understand those you need to look at thousands or tens of thousands of atoms so the defects are included .
Using this new equation , we 've been able to model up to a million atoms , so we get closer to the real properties of a substance . "
By offering a panoramic view of how substances behave in the real world , the theory gives scientists a tool for developing materials that can be used for designing new technologies .
Car frames made from lighter , strong metal alloys , for instance , might make vehicles more energy efficient , and smaller , faster electronic devices might be produced using nanowires with diameters tens of thousands of times smaller than that of a human hair .
Paul Madden , a chemistry professor and provost of The Queen 's College at Oxford University , who originally introduced Carter to this field of research , described the work as a " significant breakthrough " that could allow researchers to substantially expand the range of materials that can be studied in this manner .
" This opens up a new class of material physics problems to realistic simulation , " he said .

The new theory traces its lineage to the Thomas - Fermi equation , a concept proposed by Llewellyn Hilleth Thomas and Nobel laureate Enrico Fermi in 1927 .
The equation was a simple means of relating two fundamental characteristics of atoms and molecules .
They theorized that the energy electrons possess as a result of their motion -- electron kinetic energy -- could be calculated based how the electrons are distributed in the material .
Electrons that are confined to a small region have higher kinetic energy , for instance , while those spread over a large volume have lower energy .
Understanding this relationship is important because the distribution of electrons is easier to measure , while the energy of electrons is more useful in designing materials .
Knowing the electron kinetic energy helps researchers determine the structure and other properties of a material , such as how it changes shape in response to physical stress .
The catch was that Thomas and Fermi's concept was based on a theoretical gas , in which the electrons are spread evenly throughout .
It could not be used to predict properties of real materials , in which electron density is less uniform .
The next major advance came in 1964 , when another pair of scientists , Pierre Hohenberg and Walter Kohn , another Nobel laureate , proved that the concepts proposed by Thomas and Fermi could be applied to real materials .
While they did n't derive a final , working equation for directly relating electron kinetic energy to the distribution of electrons , Hohenberg and Kohn laid the formal groundwork that proved such an equation exists .
Scientists have been searching for a working theory ever since .
Carter began working on the problem in 1996 and produced a significant advance with two postdoctoral researchers in 1999 , building on Hohenberg and Kohn 's work .
She has continued to whittle away at the problem since .
" It would be wonderful if a perfect equation that explains all of this would just fall from the sky , " she said .
" But that is n't going to happen , so we 've kept searching for a practical solution that helps us study materials . "
In the absence of a solution , researchers have been calculating the energy of each atom from scratch to determine the properties of a substance .
The laborious method bogs down the most powerful computers if more than a few hundred atoms are being considered , severely limiting the amount of a material and type of phenomena that can be studied .

Carter knew that using the concepts introduced by Thomas and Fermi would be far more efficient , because it would avoid having to process information on the state of each and every electron .
As they worked on the problem , Carter and Chen Huang , a doctoral student in physics , concluded that the key to the puzzle was addressing a disparity observed in Carter 's earlier work .
Carter and her group had developed an accurate working model for predicting the kinetic energy of electrons in simple metals .
But when they tried to apply the same model to semiconductors -- the conductive materials used in modern electronic devices -- their predictions were no longer accurate .
" We needed to find out what we were missing that made the results so different between the semiconductors and metals , " Huang said .
" Then we realized that metals and semiconductors respond differently to electrical fields .
Our model was missing this . "
In the end , Huang said , the solution was a compromise .
" By finding an equation that worked for these two types of materials , we found a model that works for a wide range of materials . "
Their new model , published online Jan. 26 in Physical Review B , a journal of the American Physical Society , provides a practical method for predicting the kinetic energy of electrons in semiconductors from only the electron density .
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation .
Coupled with advances published last year by Carter and Linda Hung , a graduate student in applied and computational mathematics , the new model extends the range of elements and quantities of material that can be accurately simulated .
The researchers hope that by moving beyond the concepts introduced by Thomas and Fermi more than 80 years ago , their work will speed future innovations .
" Before people could only look at small bits of materials and perfect crystals , " Carter said .
" Now we can accurately apply quantum mechanics at scales of matter never possible before . "
Editor ’s note : “ Behind the Headlines ” will return Wednesday .
Imagine the following scenario :
The chief executive of a foreign country decides to conduct terrorist operations inside U.S. territory , and signs a “ presidential finding ” to that effect .
Furthermore , that “ finding ” authorizes the foreign government ’s agents to engage in “ defensive lethal action , ” i.e. assassinations .
And what if , shortly after this information has been leaked to the public , prominent US government officials and even a nuclear scientist or two are assassinated , kidnapped , or otherwise targeted by mysterious terrorists , with no one taking “ credit ” for these actions ?
How long before the United States military turned that country into a pile of molten rock and charred debris ?
I give it about fifteen minutes , max .
However , if that chief executive happened to be an American president , and if the “ finding ” was approved by Democratic congressonal leaders , and if the targets of these assassinations and kidnappings were Iranian – well , then , it is n’t terrorism , now is it – since nothing we do is ever so characterized , no matter how accurate such a description may be .
The assassination of Massoud Ali Mohammadi , a prominent Iranian nuclear physicist , had all the earmarks of a state agency behind it : he was killed in an explosion set off by a sophisticated remote - controlled device attached to the underside of a motorbike parked outside his home .
However , a closer look shows that the killing , if it was carried out by the US or its agents , does n’t fit the expected pattern .
Looking at Mohammadi ’s list of publications , it appears he was an astrophysicist , and not the sort one would normally associate with Iran ’s nuclear program , but that may be neither here nor there .
After all , our own CIA has said , “ with high confidence , ” [.pdf ] that Iran abandoned its nuclear weapons program in 2003 , and has n’t re-started it – so the idea that this is an attempt to set back Iran ’s drive for nukes is flat out wrong , because there are no Iranian nukes and little likelihood of them any time soon .
So there must have been another reason for the targeting of Mohammadi in particular , and both the timing and the politics bear this out .
The killing comes at a time when Iranian regime is threatened by an extensive popular upsurge , the “ Green ” movement , led by former presidential candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi , made manifest in street demonstrations which the government has reacted to with vicious violence .
In spite of the regime ’s efforts to portray Mohammadi as one of their own , he was in fact a supporter of Moussavi : he was one of the signatories of a statement issued by Mossavi ’s academic supporters .
He was , in short , clearly aligned with the “ Greens , ” although not an activist type .
Of course , we do n’t know who killed Mohammadi , although Tehran has variously accused the US , the Israelis , Iranian royalists , and the neo- Marxist Mujahideen - e - Khalq ( MEK ) of being behind the bombing .
Certainly any of these are credible suspects , but the instrument of the assassination is less important than the motivation or intent behind it , and in any case the question of whodunit could be at least partially illuminated if we ask why it was done .
Before we can answer that question , however , we need to go back and look at the context , including the rationale for and motivation behind that presidential “ finding . ”
Issued in the final months of the Bush administration , the finding was an attempt to get around military and congressional opposition to the idea of a direct attack on Iran by the US .
The joint chiefs were horrified by the prospect and made their opposition plain , and the Democratic - controlled Congress was none too enthusiastic about ginning up another war when we were already knee - deep in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Hardliners in the Bush administration , however , were not content to let it go at that , naturally , and so President Bush , in this finding , authorized a covert campaign dedicated to “ regime change ” — including those “ defensive lethal actions ” that sound like assassinations to me .
The idea was to destabilize the Iranian “ prison house of nations ” by forging links with underground secessionist and dissident organizations , such as the Sunni terrorist group operating in Baluchistan on the border with Pakistan .
There was also a lot of agitation , at the time , among neoconservatives to rehabilitate the MEK , which has been classified by the US State Department as an officially - designated terrorist organization , and use them to effect “ regime change ” in Iran .
Given MEK ’s degree of support amongst the then - dominant neocons inside the administration , as well as in Congress , can there be much doubt MEK got in on the $ 400 million gravy train ?
Forced to abandon plans for striking Iran , the Bush administration took the route of subversion , and set the stage for a series of provocations aimed at “ regime change . ”
Given the complicity of the Democrats in this scheme , there is no reason to assume the program stopped with the ascension of Obama .
Indeed , there is every reason to think the program may have even been accelerated , given the reluctance with which the present administration would contemplate a frontal assault on Tehran .
War may be out of the question , for the moment , but what about a revolution ?
Indeed , Team Obama have recently been more effusive with their open support for the Iranian “ Greens , ” and US government support for the Moussavi movement is all but official .
Yet Mohammadi was himself a Green supporter , and therefore his execution may be seen as the act of some entity that aims at blocking this indirect means of dealing with the Iranians .
On the one hand , there is plenty of speculation revolving around the possibility that the Iranians took out Mohammadi themselves , as a warning to dissidents , particularly dissident scientists .
However , this seems highly improbable : at a time when Tehran is touting its technological prowess as a point of pride in its conflict with the West , this they - did - it - to - themselves scenario makes little sense .
On the other hand , there are those who have every interest in blocking any and all attempts to deal with Iran relatively peacefully , i.e. short of a full - scale frontal military assault .
Israel has made plain its desire to strike at Iran , or have the US do it for them , and Israel ’s lobby in the U.S. is busy beating the drums for war .
What points toward the Israelis in this instance is Mohammadi ’s Green affiliation : an Associated Press video report shows pro-Green mourners at Mohammadi ’s funeral procession , hailing him as a martyr and denouncing the Mossad .
Inside Iran , the political effect of the assassination is to blur the ideological distinctions between the Greens and their opponents in the government — and blunt the US administration ’s covert effort to carry out “ regime change ” short of an invasion .
The Israelis are well aware that the Greens are just as nationalist and intransigent on the subject of Iran ’s right to pursue nuclear research as the hardliners .
They therefore have every interest in destabilizing this movement , sowing fear among prominent Green supporters – such as Mohammadi ’s academic colleagues – and also spreading the rumor that domestic assassins struck him due to his support for Moussavi .
Deprived of the Holocaust - denying fire - breathing President Ahmadinejad as the public face of the Iranian government , and with the Greens in power , the Israelis would have a much harder time convincing their American sponsors Iran represents a danger to the world and must be stopped at all costs .
The Israelis have long utilized assassination as a tool in their bag of tricks , and do so semi-openly : what other intelligence agency has an entire special section devoted to taking out its enemies ?
Mohammadi is the third prominent Iranian scientist to have met with foul play in the past year or so – see here , and here – and the idea that the Israelis are behind it was not only given voice by the Iranians , but also by the Stratfor research organization , which is said to have ties with Israeli intelligence .
Who killed Mohammadi ?
We do n’t know , and may never know for sure : but all indications point to Israel , and it ’s no wonder that even Debka , the Israeli web site with links to Mossad , practically claimed “ credit ” for the act on Tel Aviv ’s behalf .
What ’s interesting is that this explanation for Mohammadi ’s unsightly end underscores the role played by Israel in the geopolitics of the Middle East , as not only Iran ’s chief adversary in the region but also as a subverter of American policy and interests .
The Iranians , with their cartoon - version worldview of the US and Israel as two heads of the same hydra - headed monster , are too simplistic by far : when it comes to the Middle East , Israel is working to undermine not only Tehran but also Washington – and anyone who gets in the way of their agenda .
7 Self Interested Reasons to keep it simple with women
Guest post by Seduce In Seconds
It ’s never been easier to find a solution to a specific dating problem .
A technique , a process or even an inner game course , they ’re all just a few clicks away .
So why restrict yourself when you ’re learning how to pickup girls ?
You can never remember them all – the techniques and tips and hints and past learning experiences , that is .
When you ’re looking at a woman who ’s undivided attention alone is turning you on because she ’s just that hot , well , you often risk having a mental blank because your nervousness short circuits your brain a little .
If it ’s not a mental blank , it ’s mental blanks ’ pesky derranged brother ‘ Nevousness ’ which quite simply often means you talk too much , too fast and are purely content reliant .
Pick Up Lines and Techniques
The lines , processes and hidden camera videos on how to pick up a girl at the gym ( for instance ) are easy training wheels to get you seeing results fast in a cool way .
Try to memorise them all and recall them when you ’re over excited or nervous and you ’ll see all those two hundred and whatever techniques you ’ve learnt are going to be reduced down to one common thought at crunch time :
“ Fuck !
What am I going to say next ? ”
My answer to that is to use a playful tease twice , compliment her once and advance your kino escalation attempts four to five times ….
That was a joke ( even though it ’s not funny enough to laugh at out loud because a part of you may have just got a chubby at the thought that I dropped my ‘ next magic bullet / miracle cure / etc ’ .
I like to keep two things in mind to make sure that any guy looking for way to pick up girls quickly and simply does it right .
I ’ve outlined them here in seven self interested reasons to keep it simple with women and not undervalue it ’s significance amongst the hype .
# 7 Simplicity = Results = Confidence Fast
Seduce
In Second ’s 18,000 infield tests over the past 6 years have consistently shown that your confidence will suffer if you learn techniques without ever formulating your own solutions .
Your confidence is impaired from how you learn , not just from what you learn .
If you train yourself to remember 300 things and then you get nervous they will inevitably go out the window even if they are a ‘ game plan for approach anxiety ’ .
Forget minor fixes , you need a game plan for ‘ The Game ’ .
That game plan does not lie in an approach anxiety fix if you ’re nervous ( for e.g. ) and want to pick up a girl in a club .
It lies in simplicity and learning how to apply only a few key things that work across all areas of seduction and human interaction .
Everything else is just an example showing you how these core things can be used .
The problem is , these core things are often so vague they can never be implemented practically .
That ’s why I ’ve spent the past 6 years forumulating my 4 core principles and testing them world wide .
They are quite simply :
counter intutitivness
playfulness
push / pull and
indifference
We film them time and time again to make sure our memories do n’t taint what really happened .
Stall outs and mental blanks were resolved when I changed the way Seduce In Seconds approached social interaction .
Learning only 4 key things that are easy to apply and keep in the forefront of your mind lets you create your solutions and gives you more confidence and faith in your abilities .
Far more importantly your confidence will skyrocket once you stop having mental blanks caused by ‘ material anxiety ’ ( how do I remember and apply what I ’ve learnt in a sincere and non-robotic way ) .
No more mental blanks means it ’s easier for you to seem cool , calm collected and indifferent ( essential goals ) .
You can think clearly and just apply these 4 core things at will , where they ’re needed and even to recover from mistakes .
I do n’t have room to explain them here but I have guide you ’ll soon be able to download showing you way to pick up girls using these four key principles .
# 6 People Do n’t Doubt You
With Simplicity Comes Sincerity .
Thinking too hard about what to do next takes your brain and your sincerity out of any conversation you will have with women .
Staying in the moment and not getting lost in a maze of ‘ solutions ’ which sound like miracle cures is the way to do it .
The days of having 6 steps to do for approach anxiety , 3 for a good conversation and 3 for getting a kiss are over .
Only 4 core principles are what I believe you need to know how to pick up a girl and be an effective pick up artist ( which means speed and efficiency in my eyes ) .
You ’ll get so distracted from thinking about what technique to use and forget that you need to also think about how you ’re going to deliver in a way that does n’t look contrived .
Take note , this also applies to ‘ inner ’ and ‘ natural ’ game confidence solutions couched in spiritual rants about ‘ deep purpose ’ and other things that rarely show consistent results .
I ’m not saying these things do n’t exist but I ’ve never seen any of them work fast and consistently and be filmed and tested .
Ultimately many people say my stuff does n’t work or is n’t real too , argument is good but test it all yourself before you make a decision .
If something works , keep it .
Or get the right person to teach you .
How about , you just sit there and talk to that hot girl and use these 4 simple things when you get the chance .
How does that sound ?
The benefits are obvious when it comes to conversations and confidence when you approach it this way .
You ’re sincerity and focus on the woman , what she ’s saying and your context promotes sincere and interesting conversation .
# 5 More Respect
You Will Get More Respect With Women .
You will not be looked at like a sleazy guy coming up to a woman for a quick shot at whether he can put himself through her .
You will be seen as sincere , confident , laid back and attractive …all of which will make you then feel more attractive once the social proof kicks in and you start to realise that external validation is important to keeping confidence in your life on a short - term day to day basis .
Ironically not trying to hard to use these four things will get you laid quicker than if you put in more effort trying to learn , recall and apply a myriad of techniques / lines .
# 4 You Get To Be Lazy
Try being more lazy , it will actually help .
More mental effort on your behalf will show either through :
Talking too fast
Mental blanks
or simply giving replies that show you were thinking about what to say next and not really listening .
My guys who ’ve learnt this know we ’re a rarity because this is not a different method , it ’s a different approach to learning and implementing in a way that means you know how to pickup a girl fast and realistically .
This is all assuming you approach women to begin with .
If you do n’t approach you will waste more time filling your head and getting information overload which , in effect , will make your approach anxiety worse .
# 3 Live Like A Celebrity
Approaching anxiety arises simply out of the fact that you doubt that you can pick that girl for sure and handle everything that comes your way .
Unlike celebrities , some pick up artists have an undying dedication to finding faster and easier ways to pick up women that often sees people think we are celebrities .
We become popular in a room of people very fast and people wonder who you are and when they find out you ’re nobody they love you even more because you ’re a real rarity .
But like celebrities , pickup artists who approach women get complacent with their results and their nerves .
Soon they begin to have a ‘ celebrity - esque ’ impression on people because they ’re cool , laid back , popular , respected and all that other stuff .
In one word , they show indifference , that what these men do to achieve all of those things …and people buy it time and time again .
What this means is , just like celebrities , simple and speedy pick up artists get so many women that we become complacent with our success .
We do n’t care if you do n’t like what we ’re saying to you right now because 95 % of the people I do this with love it , so you ’re just not for me .
It ’s easier for us to just go and approach another and number close her in under a minute or take them on an instant date and if you want to see me doing some of this stuff you can at www.youtube.com/thesocialengineer .
Indifference means you do n’t care and that is a key to having and demonstrating confidence just like the celebrities , rock stars and other famous people we ’re told to envy by Public Relations companies .
They do n’t ‘ live the rockstar lifestyle ’ by always thinking about how to seem cool or popular .
They simply act in a way counter intutive to most .
The media tells everyone is cool so they they get power and attention and …in one word ‘ social proof ’ .
They can do what they like , say what they like and act as they like because people around approve of it and want more or that if you ’re by yourself you act in a way consistent with how a celebrity would act like .
This also can convince people you ’re the king .
We all have sterotypes in our heads and we have an idea of what a confident guy should be like .
Act in accordance with it and even if you ’re not , people will think you are .
They ’ll treat you well , you ’ll feel validated and your short term confidence will grow and you ’ll laugh at how you used to be .
Unfortunately you may get too inside your own head and never get to even approach a woman because you think there ’s ‘ so much more learning to do first ’ .
In reality , this is just an excuse to bide your time and avoid the posibility of rejection to the extent that you ’re apart of the 95 % of guys who ever have a proper go and actually learn right and do n’t take approaching too seriously so they do it .
# 2 Speed
The only test for simplicity is speed .
Look at an iPhone , I can do most things quicker on it than on my laptop and more simply .
I can take and post hidden camera videos 200x faster than I do on a PC at the touch of a button because I can replicate the same process over and over with lightning speed and little thought .
Seduction should always be the same and the real way to test is through seeing how fast you can replicate it .
To do something fast you need definite solutions to a wide range of problems and the four keys to seduction : counter intutitivness , push / pull , playfulness and indifference have proven to be the fastest 4 principles my guys are using right now as their only ways to pick up girls .
We ’ve tested them and know they work by seeing how fast a solution can be replicated and with what accuracy .
It ’s the simple way to sort the nuggets of gold from the nuggets of fake gold in the real world .
# 1 You Actually Try
You will like the fast results from simple things you realise how easy it is to do and just like a celebrity or a rockstar you just do what you like .
Unlike a celebrity or a rockstar you know WHY you are the way you are , why people are acting the way they are and can sit back and enjoy knowing this is n’t just lucky or someone ’s 15 minutes of fame .
You will do this more .
Your confidence will improve .
You will be happier .
Simplicity is the key .
Less should do more .
Too much information and too many long winded solutions are not solutions .
They ’re problems for the aspiring pick up artist .
Always remember :
“ Talent hits a target no one else can hit ; Genius hits a target no one else can see ”
I talk about all of this and more in a guide I ’m working on for guys who want the practical ways to apply these four things and to be able to do crazy things .
I ’ll talk about how to pickup women without talking , how to pick up women using your tongue from 2 meters away and about validation , confidence and approach anxiety among other things .

In a definitive defeat for film studios — and in a first case of its kind worldwide — Australia 's Federal Court has ruled that ISPs have no obligation to act on copyright infringement notices or to disconnect subscribers after receiving multiple letters .
If copyright holders want justice for illegal file - sharing , they need to start by targeting the right people : those who committed the infringement .
The ruling handed down today by Judge J. Cowdroy aims to be nothing less than magisterial : in 200 pages , it examines the issue from every possible angle because of the " obvious importance of these proceedings to the law of copyright both in this country and possibly overseas . "
It concerns iiNet , the third largest ISP in Australia , which was sued in 2008 by a group of movie studios — many of them American — for not doing enough to stop copyright infringement .
Letters sent to iiNet were treated as allegations rather than facts and were therefore not acted upon ; iiNet instead sent the letters on to the police , saying that it would not act unless a court first ruled that actual infringement had occurred .
This infuriated the movie studios , who demanded that iiNet cut off subscribers alleged to be repeat infringers .
The question before the court was whether iiNet " authorized " copyright infringement on behalf of its users , and media interest in the case was intense .
In his ruling , the judge noted that the case " attracted widespread interest both here in Australia and abroad , and both within the legal community and the general public .
So much so that I understand this is the first Australian trial to be twittered or tweeted .
I granted approval for this to occur in view of the public interest in the proceeding , and it seems rather fitting for a copyright trial involving the internet . "
The judge 's ruling amounted to a strong defense of the " mere conduit " safe harbor that many nations grant ISPs , so long as they do n't encourage infringement or have actual awareness that it is occurring .
Two hundred pages on the topic might sound soporific , but take heart before we dive into the legal logic ; this is a judge not afraid to try his hand at " being interesting . "
Here , for instance , is his description of BitTorrent :
To use the rather colourful imagery that internet piracy conjures up in a highly imperfect analogy , the file being shared in the swarm is the treasure , the BitTorrent client is the ship , the .torrent file is the treasure map , The Pirate Bay provides treasure maps free of charge and the tracker is the wise old man that needs to be consulted to understand the treasure map .
So buckle up ; it 's going to be an interesting ride .
The investigation
The Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft ( AFACT ) spearheaded the case , hiring investigators to troll BitTorrent for movies belonging to a coalition of studios .
One simple way of doing this was simply to search MiniNova ( based in the Netherlands ) for movies , but modify the uTorrent client software to filter IP addresses so that it would only connect to those belonging to iiNet .
Investigators collected the IP addresses of those sharing the movies and began forwarding them to iiNet .
The studios wanted the ISP to forward the letters to subscribers .
When a subscriber received two or three such letters , iiNet should suspend service .
If more letters arrived after the suspension was revoked , the subscribers should be booted from the ' Net .
And , in addition , the studios " suggested that iiNet should block certain websites . "
This is hardly the sort of thing an ISP is going to do to its customers voluntarily .
But did iiNet have a legal duty here ?
Australian copyright law , like the DMCA in the US , requires ISPs to have some policy in place for terminating the access of repeat copyright infringers .
Who is Jo Blow ?
iiNet CEO Michael Malone was questioned about this at the trial over " three days of gruelling and unnecessarily hostile cross- examination " by studio lawyers .
( This must have really been something to watch , because the judge goes out of his way to mention later that the questioning was " intemperate . " )
Malone said that iiNet had a policy to terminate subscribers , but that it applied only to " infringement , " not to " alleged infringement . "
As the judge summarized the testimony , " If a Court ordered a subscriber account be terminated or if a Court found that a subscriber of the respondent infringed copyright or a subscriber admitted infringement , the respondent would terminate that subscriber 's account . "
This fits with what Malone said back in 2008 , when he told ComputerWorld Australia , " We have been passing on all those complaints directly on to the state police — who are in our building .
They send us a list of IP addresses and say ' this IP address was involved in a breach on this date . '
We look at that say , ' Well , what do you want us to do with this ?
We can't release the person ’s details to you on the basis of an allegation and we can't go and kick the customer off on the basis of an allegation from someone else . '
So we say , ' You are alleging the person has broken the law ; we 're passing it to the police .
Let them deal with it . ' "
Had anyone been terminated under the policy ?
No , said Malone , they had not , because " no one had been found to infringe copyright " by this standard .
The studios ' lawyer then asked Malone if this was some kind of " joke " response .
As the judge notes , " The respondent ’s policy was not a joke , and its conduct was entirely consistent with the policy as outlined even though it may not have been the kind of policy that the applicants anticipated . "
Malone really irritated the studios with a further comment that iiNet was simply not prepared to act on infringement notices received from just any " Jo Blow . "
The studios ' response is priceless : " The applicants submit that they , being the major film studios , could not possibly be considered ‘ Jo Blow ’ when copyright infringement of their films is under consideration . "
As Malone indicated in a December 13 , 2008 forum post , the issue should be handled by the relevant authorities ; he had no wish to start acting like a private copyright cop .
" With the evidence that AFACT has , I ’m betting that a magistrate will happily issue an order for us to disclose the account holder ’s identity for under $ 50 .
AFACT can then directly contact the customer , warn them , raid them , or sue them .
Whatever the action , it will then be overseen by the independent legal system . "
The judge agreed , saying that the law " recognises no positive obligation on any person to protect the copyright of another .

MARK COLVIN : Australia 's core measure of inflation , the Consumer Price Index , is under review .
In a series of public hearings around the country the Bureau of Statistics is investigating what the community thinks of the CPI and whether it should be changed .
At issue : should price rises be measured monthly , rather than quarterly ?
And should the bureau change it to reflect the full cost of living better ?
Economics correspondent Stephen Long has this report .
( ABC News theme music plays )
STEPHEN LONG :
It 's big news .
FEMALE NEWS READER 1 : A hike in the cost of living puts more pressure on …
MALE NEWS READER :
The CPI number yesterday , the bond market , how did they read it ?
FEMALE NEWS READER 2 : The latest CPI , the Consumer Price Index figure is out .
STEPHEN LONG :
The CPI is a key set of numbers for politicians , bankers , investors and consumers .
It 's even the stuff of satire .
( Excerpt from satire skit )
JOHN CLARKE : What I 'm describing Brian is that prices are trending northward going forward .
BRIAN DAWE : What does trending northward going forward mean exactly ?
JOHN CLARKE :
It means that prices are going up and they 're likely to bloody well keep going up .
( End excerpt )
STEPHEN LONG :
But some of the facts about the consumer price index might surprise you .
For a start , it 's not meant to measure the cost of living .
Jason Russo from the Australian Bureau of Statistics .
JASON RUSSO : No , it 's not designed to be a measure of the cost of living .
STEPHEN LONG :
So it does n't include interest payments on mortgages , other loans , or credit cards .
Nor does it include the price of established houses .
And aside from New Zealand , Australia is the only country in the developed world that does n't measure changes in consumer prices each month , only every quarter .
But all that 's up for grabs .
Because the make - up of the CPI , the core measure of inflation , is under review .
JASON RUSSO :
This is a major review .
It 's comprehensive so we look across the whole of the CPI , the concepts and the way we construct the statistics .
STEPHEN LONG :
The last time a root and branch review took place 12 years ago , the whole nature of the Consumer Price Index changed .
Before 1997 , it was designed to measure the cost of living , and it took account broad household outlays , including interest payments .
That was seen as the best approach for an era when wage rates for most workers were set by arbitration , taking into account the cost of living .
Since then it's been designed as an inflation gauge to guide monetary policy .
But critics say on that score , the CPI is n't adequate .
IAN MCAULEY : It 's not a measure of inflation .
STEPHEN LONG : Ian Mcauley from the University of Canberra .
IAN MCAULEY : It 's a measure of changes in consumer prices in the average household .
We can have very big asset price inflation as we did say leading up to the global financial crisis , where prices of stocks and of housing rose and that was n't picked up .
What was happening was there was inflation in the economy , but it certainly was n't showing up in household cost of living .
STEPHEN LONG :
What do you see as the consequence of that ?
IAN MCAULEY :
The consequence of that is we did n't see the GFC coming .
STEPHEN LONG :
As low consumer price inflation suppressed interest rates , creating a flood of cheap money , and lulling some central banks into a false sense of security .
So should the CPI be changed ?
IAN MCAULEY : Well I 'd argue strongly for a separate and well understood measure of inflation .
STEPHEN LONG :
One that measures inflation in asset prices and stands alongside the CPI .
The headline rate of the Consumer Price Index also understates the price rises faced by the less well off , or those without much disposable income .
IAN MCAULEY :
The CPI has been kept low in Australia because of the huge influence of much cheaper consumer , what some would call , luxury goods , flat - screen television , new motor cars ,
STEPHEN LONG : Computer equipment and the like ?
IAN MCAULEY : Yeah , all of those things .
And of course , without being too judgemental I think you could say that these are not perhaps the necessity of life , say that fresh food , fresh vegetables , rent , which certainly is a strong component of the expenditure of low - income people .
These are the things which have been rising steeply and although they 're picked up in the CPI they are offset by what you might call luxury items .
STEPHEN LONG :
But if you have n't got a lot of disposable income , you might be scratching your head and saying well how can the CPI be 2 per cent , or 2.5 per cent ?
IAN MCAULEY : And people are indeed scratching their head .
I mean the typical response is , the CPI may have gone up by 2 per cent but that 's not my CPI .
STEPHEN LONG :
That 's a problem if the CPI is used to set wages for the lower paid , as the Howard government 's Fairpay Commission appeared to do , or to set benefits .
The ABS has created some alternative measures to gauge the cost of living for pensioners and low - income groups .
And it 's thinking of changing the way it collects data .
JASON RUSSO :
We have trained field officers that go out and actually collect the prices first hand .
I understand that we collect something like 100,000 prices per quarter .
STEPHEN LONG : Would n't it be a lot simply just to commandeer the scanner data from the retailers ?
JASON RUSSO : I guess in the longer term this is one of the issues we have to look at .
Are there new ways to capture price data to build a better CPI ?
MARK COLVIN : Jason Russo from the ABS ending Stephen Long 's report .
Convention ’s opening speaker suggested reinstating law that kept blacks from voting
WASHINGTON — Former Republican Congressman Tom Tancredo may have fired up the most zealous conservatives at the first ever National Tea Party Convention , but he has n’t pleased the renowned civil rights group NAACP .
Speaking before a crowd of 600 delegates in Nashville , Tennessee , Tancredo fired away at “ the cult of multiculturalism ” and claimed President Obama was elected because “ we do not have a civics , literacy test before people can vote in this country , ” according to ABC News .
ADVERTISEMENT
The historical context of Tancredo ’s comments is important .
As the NAACP notes on its Web site , “ literacy tests and poll taxes systematically denied African American people their constitutional rights ” for nearly a century following the abolition of slavery in 1870 .
It was n’t until 1965 that the Voting Rights Act allowed African Americans to fully participate in the political process .
Hilary Shelton , Washington Director of NAACP , blasted Tancredo ’s remarks as “ outrageous ” and “ insidious ” in an interview with Raw Story .
“ This is the politics of denigration , ” he said .
Tancredo also said the United States “ put a committed socialist ideologue in the White House … Barack Hussein Obama . ”
ABC reported that his speech “ received enthusiastic applause at times . ”
Sheldon , who is also NAACP ’s Senior Vice Preident for Advocacy and Policy , assailed Tancredo ’s use of Obama ’s middle name as a “ deliberate attempt ” to subliminally “ tie him to Saddam Hussein ” as a way of appealing to voter fears .
“ Why else would he use it ? ” he said .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It ’s a strategy of desperation , ” Sheldon said , alleging that some conservative leaders are purposefully targeting Obama ’s character because they prefer not to debate policy .
Though he stopped short of labeling him a racist , Shelton said Tancredo ’s aim — and the aim of Tea Party leaders — is to undermine the entire Democratic Party by targeting the president .
“ They ’re not debating his ideas and platform , ” he said .
“ Their approach is to denigrate his character , because his policies are policies that millions of Americans support . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Should Tancredo apologize ?
“ If he ’s thoughtful he would , ” Sheldon told Raw Story .
Founded in 1909 , NAACP — short for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People — is among the oldest and most powerful civil rights groups in the country .
ADVERTISEMENT
Tancredo did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Raw Story .
Mark Skoda , a businessman and spokesman for the Tea Party convention , mildly criticized the former Congressman ’s remarks .
“ It does n’t further the dialogue , ” he said , according to CNN .
Michael B. Keegan , president of the liberal advocacy group People For The American Way , called Tancredo ’s words “ deeply offensive ” and said they “ embodied the worst of today ’s Republican Party . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ He would be nothing more than a bad joke if he did not represent a corrosive spirit that is far too prevalent in our politics today , ” Keegan added .
The Tennessee convention ’s kickoff included a “ modified American flag to serve as a symbol for the Tea Party movement , ” according to its creator , USRevolution2.com founder Jeffrey McQueen .
Thinking back on the idea that I wanted to be in an MLM home business always brought to my mind what it was that kept me going and what still drives me to seek more success and one day achieving my goals and possibly going beyond them .
I would have to say I have been hungry for it to the point that nothing else matters as to things wasting my time away .
In starting a MLM home business many people do not have the hunger that is needed to make them work .
That is the sad part about those who began many things in their lives when they start out the drive and true desire is missing .
They let the small things trip them up .
One must be hungry to the point of madness to strive and succeed where others have failed .
I do n’t know how many days I have woken up and said what are we going to do today to my wife ?
Her answer has always been to take over the world as we do every day .
That is what a home MLM successful business truly is .
Something that has a veracious appetite to drive forward and take over the world .
It must be something that not only is the main focus of your life but is the reason you breath .
There must be a true hunger for the power of achieving everything one sets as a goal and then to move beyond that goal .
When someone calls me up and wants to chat as to what I have been doing I want them to first know that what I have been doing is steering my life away from the rocky shores on to an open sea of possibilities and achievements .
It would be easy to follow the light house beacon and pull in to shore at every moment the sea gets rough .
However my life ’s ship is meant to sail and deal with anything the ocean can throw at me .
Many of the greatest thinkers and achievers have past great knowledge down to those that truly wanted to be something more than they or their lot in life forecasted .
While others hearing the same messages in the same rooms came away with nothing nor had an idea or thought as to the next step .
Because they did not have the hunger to be great .
They were not all in .
When I was started out in the Navy and went down to enlist my mother asked me if it was truly what I wanted to do ?
My answer was yes with out question .
I had already visualized what I would achieve well in the Navy .
Before I even stepped through the door of the recruiting office .
The reason is because I was all in .
I was ready to take over the world .
Starting an MLM must be the same way you must be all in .
You must invest in the idea that it is what you want and do it .
If I would have joined the Navy and not have had the true desire to be part of it I would have never achieved the things I did .
We had many in the Navy who once was there .
Did everything they could to get out and did nothing to work at being a good sailor .
They were not all in and they never achieved any recognitions as to their service .
They were un -teachable .
not adult or mature enough to leave the nest and learn new things .
They had no will to take over the world .
Working with an MLM home business you have to be adult and mature enough to face rejection and many times criticisms to learn how to do things the right and move forward .
You must be teachable and have the will to except that no leader or Mentor made it to where they were by running .
One must learn to crawl then walk then run to take off in to flight and there must be a hunger to achieve such lofty ambitions .
If ever your MLM home business will be successful to the point of taking over the world .
You must be all in .

DailyKos has released a new poll , conducted for it by the polling outfit Research 2000 , which seems like it was commissioned solely for the purpose of depressing liberals .
Not only does it confirm that a sizable chunk of Republicans still refuses to believe that President Obama is legitimate , but also that , even in 2010 , as “ Do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” slowly inches closer to repeal , fear and intolerance of gay people is still rampant among the GOP .
If you were having a pleasant day , do n’t click ahead to read our list of the poll ’s ten most alarming revelations .
10 : Thirty - six percent do n’t believe Obama was born in the United States , and 22 percent are n’t sure .
This would be more alarming if we were n’t numb to this stat by now .
9 : Only 36 percent say that Obama does n’t hate white people .
Chris Matthews might want to rethink that thing about our post - racial society .
8 : Only 7 percent support same - sex marriage .
Not surprising , but still disappointing .
7 : Sixty - eight percent do n’t think gay couples should receive any state or federal benefits , while 21 percent are not sure .
This is more surprising — it ’s not even marriage , just benefits .
And not even every benefit , necessarily , just some .
6 : Thirty - nine percent believe Obama should be impeached .
For what , exactly ?
5 : Twenty - three percent want their state to secede from the union .
The number rises to 33 percent in the South .
Good luck on your own , Alabama !
4 : Twenty - four percent claim that Obama “ wants the terrorists to win , ” while 33 percent are not sure .
Really ?
3 : Only 24 percent say they definitely do n’t believe that ACORN stole the election .
Did ACORN fake the hundreds of polls that had Obama trouncing John McCain as well ?
2 : Thirty - one percent think contraception should be outlawed .
1 : An astounding 73 percent believe that openly gay men or women should be prohibited from teaching in public schools , and 19 percent are n’t sure .
That puts them at odds with Ronald Reagan , who openly opposed a measure trying to do just that .
Over 30 years ago .

Let 's face it , most of us do n't have much time to read .
If you get your morning headlines on Drudge or Yahoo !
News , you almost certainly do n't devour every word of every link .
You browse headlines , you skim stories , you get the gist of what 's going on in the world .
For that reason , journalism schools teach writers to format articles like a backwards version of an M. Night Shyamalan movie :
The only part worth seeing comes first .
So , you have the headline which is written to grab you , even if it 's mildly confusing ( see " US Court Rules ' Zombies Have Free Speech Rights ' " ) .
And after that comes the first sentence or lede , which summarizes all the important facts of the story that follows ( " A court has allowed a group of protesters dressed as zombies to continue with a lawsuit against police who arrested them for disorderly conduct . " )
When there is no more room in hell , the protestors will walk the Earth .

How Can This Be Used For Evil ?
Obviously if you 're a reporter and you have a certain bias one way or the other , the method is simple :

Nobody can claim you left the facts out , yet you know that most of the readers wo n't see them .
I was reminded today of a problem I noticed long ago : American Express 's policies for passwords for their customer logins require weak passwords : I quote :
Your Password should : Contain 6 to 8 characters - at least one letter and one number ( not case sensitive )
Contain no spaces or special characters ( e.g. , & , > , * , $ , @ )
Be different from your User ID and your last Password

Then I saw on twice - refried news that the author there complained to Amex about this and got a response .
It 's a real side - splitter :
Thank you for your email regarding your online password .
I would like to inform you that our website has a 128 bit encryption .
With this base , passwords that comprise only of letters and alphabets create an algorithm that is difficult to crack .
We discourage the use of special characters because hacking softwares can recognize them very easily .
The length of the password is limited to 8 characters to reduce keyboard contact .
Some softwares can decipher a password based on the information of " most common keys pressed " .
Therefore , lesser keys punched in a given frame of time lessen the possibility of the password being cracked .
Moreover , American Express is committed to protecting the privacy and security of all of our Cardmembers , both on - line and off - line .
We believe that our current security measures , which include our sophisticated monitoring systems to detect unusual or fraudulent card activity , provide strong , ongoing protections for our Cardmembers .
Rest assured , I have forwarded your comments to our webmaster for review .
During this review , we may contact you if additional information is required .
We value your membership and wish goodness and health to you and your family .

Where to begin ...
This is extremely low password " entropy , " a term used to express the size of the range of possible values , especially since the passwords are user - selected .
On the other hand , it 's still enough that , if American Express locks users out after a few failures , anyone trying to guess it will likely be caught .
But the nonsense in the e-mail response above is too much to bear .
The 128 - bit encryption is beside the point .
The idea that hackers can easily identify non-alphabetic characters is disturbingly wrong .
Yes it 's true that some software can detect passwords based on the most common keys pressed , but the solution to that is to allow special characters and long passwords , the exact opposite of Amex 's approach .
These notions are so far from reality that you actually have to hope that they are condescending lies rather than misimpressions .
If Amex really believes this then we cardholders are in deep trouble .

Bernanke is Not the Problem But the Rogue Fed Institution
Yesterday a poll was released that only 21 % of Americans support giving Helicopter Ben Bernanke a second term as chairman of the US Fed .
This compared to 41 % thinking that someone else should be given the job .
I must say this is quite an improvement .
I wonder if Rasmussen would have been able to say 2 years ago that 21 % of Americans even knew who Bernanke was ?
If nothing else , the financial crisis and economic debacle of the past two years have certainly shone some much - needed but unwanted light on the Fed and its clandestine activities .
As much as I disapprove of Bernanke ’s policies and his handling of virtually every aspect of what has gone on , I ’ll be the first to admit that Big Ben is n’t the problem .
No , it is n’t him or Greenspan , or Volcker .
It ’s the institution itself that is the problem .
Mandate # 1 – Price Stability
When the private Federal Reserve was chartered in 1913 by the unconstitutional
Act of the same name , it stated two specific mandates : maximum employment and price stability .
Those were to be the Fed ’s areas of activity .
However , with virtually no accountability to the American people ( except vis a vis the President who appoints the Chairman and the Congress who invariably rubber - stamps such appointments ) , the Fed was turned loose on the undefended US Dollar .
For years , the American public has been duped into thinking that inflation is necessary for economic growth .
This outright lie will likely compete for the title of biggest financial fraud in history .
Aided by this unawareness , we have seen a fairly standard 5 % rate of annual inflation institutionalized into our economic system .
For quite a while , this inflation went virtually undetected as it feasted mainly on the prosperity America had achieved , particularly after the Great Depression .
As a nation , we began to spend away our surpluses and attach claims on future economic activity through the great society programs of the 1960 ’s and the perpetuation of New Deal programs such as Social Security .
By the 1970s , however , we ’d run short of real money and dealt the global financial system the shock of accepting paper dollars in settlement of our out of control deficit spending .
This resulted in a period of increased instability in the 1970s and twin severe recessions .
By this time , the devalued Dollar had destroyed enough of our purchasing power that it became necessary in many cases for a second breadwinner to work to maintain the standard of living .
In the 1980s and 1990s , Americans began to rely increasingly on consumer credit to bridge the gap left by the waning dollar , and for much of the first decade of this new century , the house became the ATM as another gap filler .
It is no wonder that the recent contraction in consumer credit is n’t touched by the mainstream press ; it is that critical to economic growth .
This contraction is one of the biggest reasons the federal government has stepped in with record deficit spending .
To keep the economic charade going , it has had to .
The above bevy of charts and data should make it perfectly clear that the Fed has failed in spectacular fashion in terms of price stability .
The only thing it has been successful in is ensuring that the devaluation of the Dollar occurred gradually , over time , so as not to alarm Main Street .
Mandate # 2 - Maximum Employment
The second part of the dual mandate was maximum employment .
In this regard , the central bank has done only a slightly better job .
America in general has ranked fairly high globally in terms of low unemployment .
However , one thing that must be noted is the Fed ’s role in assisting with the exportation of American industry and the high paying manufacturing jobs that went with it .
How did the Fed do this ?
Conventional wisdom would assert that it was solely government trade policies and agreements such as GATT and NAFTA that ruined our manufacturing base .
That is certainly true , but these government policies had plenty of help .
A consistently weaker dollar means export advantages .
However , there was ( and still is , albeit a smaller one ) a significant gap between labor costs in foreign countries like much of Asia and the US .
So US - based companies could export their manufacturing activities abroad to take advantage of the cheap labor while having export advantages over their foreign competitors because of the weak dollar .
While the bottom line was certainly money and power , it is debatable whether the de-industrialization was done to flood America with cheap imported goods to mask the loss of the Dollar ’s purchasing power or if it was done merely to consolidate global power by knocking down the standard of living of the first world .
I realize this is going to be a difficult point to argue when one can walk into a store almost anywhere in the country and purchase a myriad of items at ‘ Rollback ’ prices .
However , if you take a look around you and imagine what would be there if it were n’t for the debt load , I think you ’ll get a pretty good picture of what is going on here .
What is undeniable is the transition from a goods - producing economy to a service - oriented one .
The biggest problem with a country full of employees performing services is that many of these services cannot be exported to pay for the goods we now must import .
Despite the technological developments of the past 10 years , a haircut still cannot be exported to China .
To be honest , the Fed ’s direct impact on the job market has traditionally been much less than its impact on price stability .
However , the fact that there has been a covert move to de-industrialize the first world cannot be denied .
The fact that much of the impetus for this move came from the policies of the IMF and World Bank with assistance from regional central banks is equally real .
A good take home message from this is that central planning almost always works against personal liberty and human rights .
Ramifications
Unfortunately , what has taken place over the years is that the Fed has used these two broad mandates to create for itself a battalion of illicit activities , to the point where mere disclosure of what these activities are would cause an instant depression if you listen to Ben Bernanke , Frederic Mishkin , and others .
Attempts to shine the light of day on the Fed ’s activities are painted as being ‘ dangerous ’ .
I ’m sure they are dangerous – to the status quo .
Even more disturbing is the Fed ’s ability to buy out the entire country while Congress worries about state dinner party crashers and how many subpoenas should be issued .
Few commentators have bothered to mention that when the Fed buys $ 852 Billion in mortgage bonds , it is buying the mortgages of American homes .
Maybe your mortgage is now held by an offshore banking cartel even though your mortgage contract was with Countrywide , BAC or any of a thousand originators .
Does that bother you ?
It should .
No , this is not a problem of a single rogue Fed Chairman .
It is a problem of a rogue institution , which has stretched way beyond its original charter – and an unconstitutional charter at that .
Recent moves to audit the Fed , while noble , will only go so far .
I had the opportunity to chat with G. Edward Griffin about this very topic and share his concern that the audit movement will act as a lightning rod for public outrage while allowing the institution itself to continue in a business as usual manner .
Congress has the power to yank the Federal Reserve ’s ticket ; it is about time they used it to give the Fed a 100th birthday present - a pink slip .
Addendum -
It should come as little surprise to anyone that a truly out of nowhere jobs report comes out just as Bernanke is ‘ under fire ’ on Capitol Hill .
It would be nearly impossible to count all the times this has happened over the past year or so when either the stock market or some political figure has needed a boost .
What must be noted is that goods - producing jobs continue to disappear , and that much of the ‘ good news ’ in the jobs report comes from the fact that temp agencies signed on 52,000 workers in November .
Much ballyhooed about this trend is the fact that temp agencies have been adding staff for the last 4 months now .
What should be of concern is that there appears to be almost no conversion of those temp jobs into permanent positions at this point in time .

Maybe this will help make the danger of fiat money clear .
Imagine you and me are setting across from each other .
We create enough money to represent all of the world 's wealth .
Each one of us has one SUPER Dollar in front of him .
You own half of everything and so do I .
I 'm the government though .
I get bribed into creating a Central Bank .
You 're not doing what I want you to be doing so I print up myself eight more SUPER Dollars to manipulate you with .
All of a sudden your SUPER Dollar only represents one tenth of the wealth of the world !
That is n't the only thing though .
You need to get busy and get to work because YOU'VE BEEN STIFFED with the bill for the money I PRINTED UP to get YOU TO DO what I WANTED .
That to me represents what has been happening to the economy , and us , and why so many of our occupations just can't keep up with the fake money presses .
They have been beating us with our own stick !!!!

A 29 - year - old tourist from the Philippines has spent five days in custody after Australian Customs officials mistook iced tea for drugs .
Tourist , Maria Silva bought three 800 gram bags of Nestle iced tea on her way to the airport in Manila before her flight to Melbourne .
On arrival at Melbourne Airport she was detected by sniffer dogs and arrested by Customs .
Customs ' initial tests showed the packets contained 2.44 kilograms of methamphetamines .
Customs later revised its results to amphetamines and Ms Silva was charged with importing a commercial quantity of drugs into Australia .
It was only after she spent five days in custody , unable to contact family or friends , that further tests by a Federal Police forensic team revealed the supposed drugs were in fact powdered lemon - flavoured iced tea .
The Melbourne Magistrates Court heard the powdered formula contains an ingredient that is often mistaken for drugs .
The Magistrate awarded Ms Silva $ 5,000 in costs for what he described as " an unfortunate set of circumstances . "
Ms Silva burst into tears as she was released from custody today .
Outside court , her lawyer , Michael Pena - Rees said Ms Silva had bought the iced tea , which is cheaper in the Philippines , for her friend as a treat .
Mr Pena - Rees says Customs is yet to apologise for its mistake .
When grocery shopping , you 'll discover that organic fruits and veggies can be more than twice as expensive as conventional versions .
But for some produce , I think it 's worth the splurge knowing they were n't sprayed with chemicals .
What about organic beer ?
Is it healthier to buy a six - pack of Wolaver 's Organic
Ale for $ 10 instead of a much cheaper sixer of Budweiser ?
To find out read more .
Organic beer is made with ingredients such as hops and barley that are grown without pesticides or chemical fertilizers .
Organic agriculture is better for the environment since it does n't contribute to chemical runoff that contaminates water sources and the ecosystems that they support .
Another plus is that makers of organic beer think that healthier ingredients lead to better fermentation , which means better tasting beer .
Some say organic beer tastes fresher and bolder , although I 've never really noticed a huge difference .
The decision about going organic when it comes to drinking beer is up to you .
If you 're concerned about what you put into your body and how your food choices affect the planet , then a few extra bucks on beer seems well worth it .
Remember that organic beer still contains alcohol and you 'll still suffer from a massive headache and bellyache if you drink too much , so drink your organic beer in moderation !

Tell me , do you drink organic beer ?
A custodian at the University of Oregon discovered a four - by - four foot swastika spray painted on carpet in an office belonging to the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans Queer Alliance early Monday morning .
Computers were also damaged with the paint .
University President Richard W. Lariviere sent a letter to students following the discovery , which said , in part : " We must do all that we can to come together as a community to fight such acts of intolerance and to provide support to those affected as we deal with the aftermath of this event .
This act of vandalism is not about exercising free speech or having challenging , difficult conversations ; this is about hate and vandalism .
We will vigorously pursue all avenues available to us to hold the perpetrators accountable for this cowardly act .
We will continue to work with the Department of Public Safety and student leaders to ensure that we are doing all that we can to preserve the safety and security of our students , faculty and staff . "
The custodian reportedly found the door unlocked with no signs of forced entry .
Suspicions have arisen about a connection of the incident with the Pacifica Forum , an outside group which meets on campus which has been classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center .
The group recently had a discussion about the meaning of the swastika .
Students will hold a candlelight vigil this evening , with a march and rally scheduled for tomorrow in response to the vandalism .
Much more on the incident here .
NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope has observed a mysterious X - shaped debris pattern and trailing streamers of dust that suggest a head - on collision between two asteroids .
Astronomers have long thought the asteroid belt is being ground down through collisions , but such a smashup has never been seen before .
Asteroid collisions are energetic , with an average impact speed of more than 11,000 miles per hour , or five times faster than a rifle bullet .
The comet - like object imaged by Hubble , called P/2010 A2 , was first discovered by the Lincoln Near - Earth Asteroid Research , or LINEAR , program sky survey on Jan .
6 . New Hubble images taken on Jan. 25 and 29 show a complex X - pattern of filamentary structures near the nucleus .
" This is quite different from the smooth dust envelopes of normal comets , " said principal investigator David Jewitt of the University of California at Los Angeles .
" The filaments are made of dust and gravel , presumably recently thrown out of the nucleus .
Some are swept back by radiation pressure from sunlight to create straight dust streaks .
Embedded in the filaments are co-moving blobs of dust that likely originated from tiny unseen parent bodies . "
Hubble shows the main nucleus of P/2010 A2 lies outside its own halo of dust .
This has never been seen before in a comet - like object .
The nucleus is estimated to be 460 feet in diameter .
Normal comets fall into the inner regions of the solar system from icy reservoirs in the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud .
As a comet nears the sun and warms up , ice near the surface vaporizes and ejects material from the solid comet nucleus via jets .
But P/2010 A2 may have a different origin .
It orbits in the warm , inner regions of the asteroid belt where its nearest neighbors are dry rocky bodies lacking volatile materials .
This leaves open the possibility that the complex debris tail is the result of an impact between two bodies , rather than ice simply melting from a parent body .
" If this interpretation is correct , two small and previously unknown asteroids recently collided , creating a shower of debris that is being swept back into a tail from the collision site by the pressure of sunlight , " Jewitt said .
The main nucleus of P/2010 A2 would be the surviving remnant of this so - called hypervelocity collision .
" The filamentary appearance of P/2010 A2 is different from anything seen in Hubble images of normal comets , consistent with the action of a different process , " Jewitt said .
An impact origin also would be consistent with the absence of gas in spectra recorded using ground - based telescopes .
The asteroid belt contains abundant evidence of ancient collisions that have shattered precursor bodies into fragments .
The orbit of P/2010 A2 is consistent with membership in the Flora asteroid family , produced by collisional shattering more than 100 million years ago .
One fragment of that ancient smashup may have struck Earth 65 million years ago , triggering a mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs .
But , until now , no such asteroid - asteroid collision has been caught " in the act . "
At the time of the Hubble observations , the object was approximately 180 million miles from the sun and 90 million miles from Earth .
The Hubble images were recorded with the new Wide Field Camera 3 ( WFC3 ) .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A U.S. grand jury formalized criminal charges on Wednesday against two former computer programmers at swindler Bernard Madoff ’s firm , alleging they conspired with others to falsify investor records using a special program .
The two men , Jerome O’Hara , 47 , and George Perez , 44 , were originally charged last November 13 for their purported role in the multibillion dollar , decades - long fraud against thousands of investors at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC in New York .
O’Hara ’s lawyer , Gordon Mehler , said his client “ intends to plead not guilty and even though it ’s been more than four months ( since his arrest ) , he is still presumed innocent . ”
An attorney for Perez could not immediately be reached to comment .
If convicted , they each face maximum possible prison sentences of 30 years and millions of dollars in fines .
Madoff , 71 , is serving a 150 - year term after pleading guilty a year ago of masterminding the huge fraud .
He was arrested in December 2008 after confessing to his sons and the FBI to running an epic Ponzi scheme that prosecutors said amounted to as much as $ 65 billion .
A Ponzi scheme is one in which early investors are paid with the money of new clients .
The Madoff firm made few actual trades in securities , investigators said .
O’Hara and Perez “ were indicted today by a federal grand jury in Manhattan on charges of conspiracy , falsifying records of a broker - dealer and falsifying records of an investment adviser , ” a statement by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said .
O’Hara and Perez , employed at the firm from 1990 and 1991 , respectively , were primarily responsible for developing and maintaining computer programs in the investment advisory unit at the center of the fraud .
Many of the programs were run on an IBM server known as “ House 17 , ” according to court documents .
Prosecutors said the men took hush money to help keep the fraud going and designed codes to make up fake trade blotters and phantom records .
U.S. prosecutors said the two men worked under the supervision of Madoff and his top aide , Frank DiPascali , to deceive the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a European accounting firm .
DiPascali is cooperating with prosecutors , who said his information led to the arrests of the programmers and the now defunct firm ’s outside accountant .
DiPascali pleaded guilty to 10 criminal charges last August and is awaiting sentencing .
The Madoff firm ’s outside accountant , David Friehling , is also awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty .
One other former Madoff employee , Daniel Bonventre , has been criminally charged so far in the investigation .
The case is USA v O’Hara et al , U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York , No. 09-mj-02484 .

An anonymous commenter asked this question on a philosophy blog .
To my mind , it reveals exactly why philosophy is producing so few stars these days :
How do you define “ correct ” moral theory ?
Is there something more to it than internal consistency ?
Overcoming Bias
People love to make philosophy into an inextricable muddle so they have an “ educated ” excuse to keep doing what they wanted to do anyway , which was please themselves ( a moral “ fapping ” ) .
Correct moral theory is that which corresponds to reality .
Is n’t that obvious ?
No , it ’s not : the textbook says moral theories are theories that are internally consistent , and it ’s all arbitrary , because with our heaters , TVs , cars , computers , video games and iStranger masturbation devices , reality is far , far away .

Mighty Muggs : Darth Vader Review

Mighty Muggs
Darth Vader ( Version 2 )
5 Inch Scale
By : Hasbro
2009
$ 9.99
Darth Vader was the Sith title given to Anakin Skywalker by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine after he embraced the dark side .
Shortly before the Battle of Yavin , Vader was charged with retrieving the stolen plans for the Death Star and finding the hidden base of the Rebel Alliance .
Finally challenged by his long lost son Luke Skywalker , Vader overthrew the Emperor .
In his final moments , he pleaded with Luke to remove his mask so that he could look on him with his own eyes .
Vader found redemption in the light side of the Force .
Darth Vader was no more ; Anakin Skywalker , the Chosen One , had returned and brought balance to the Force .
This is actually my first Mighty Mugg review , although I purchased my first Mugg ( Iron Man ) nearly two years ago when K*B Toys was going out of business .
For whatever reason I never took that one out of the box and despite being tempted to purchase others …
I never did .
I ’ve been wowed by the charm and allure of Muggs again so expect some reviews in the weeks and months ahead .
I decided that Vader fit in with the March of the Robots theme .
How so ?
Okay so Darth Vader really is n’t a robot .
If anything , he ’s a cyborg , but I ’ve been pretty lax about what qualifies as a robot for March of the Robots .
Plus as Obi-Wan said , “ He ’s more machine now than man ; twisted and evil ” and that ’s good enough for me .
Who are you to doubt Obi-wan ?!
As for Vader himself , I would n’t necessarily say I ’m a Star Wars purist , but generally speaking I found the prequels as failures if for nothing other than the fact they pretty much took perhaps the most awesome villain in cinema history and turned him into a pansy .
Plus the three prequels build up Darth Vader as if he ’s already the centerpiece of the Empire , but in the original Star Wars film he ’s not even second in command until Tarkin dies .
It ’s like the “ rise of middle management ” or something , but your mileage may vary .
Since Vader ’s cool persona has been castrated in my mind , so I ’m fine with having a Mugg of him .
He ’s not a bad ass , he ’s bobble head and bubble bath fodder now .
Packaging :
Mighty Muggs are packed into nice little window boxes .
Hasbro was clearly taking a page out of designer vinyl when they came up with the Muggs and so the window boxes sort of follow the trends set in that field .
However , Hasbro did n’t just phone it in , opting instead to create some nice , stylistic boxes .
This is the “ version 2 ” type of Darth Vader .
That means that this Vader is from Return of the Jedi when he ’s dying and has his mask removed to reveal Hayden Christensen ’s face .
I ’m kidding of course , Lucas has n’t “ fixed ” that part of the original trilogy yet .
Maybe for the 40th anniversary !
Since that ’s the exclusive part of this figure , his large Mugg cartoon shows off his bald head .
It wraps around the full package .
It ’s a pretty cool display piece as a result and I know a lot of people keep their Muggs in package .
The back of the package shows off the other figures in the series .
It also shows off an important feature …
This Mugg ’s head can turn around to make him NORMAL Darth Vader .
That ’s important .
I say that because I was n’t ever going to buy this guy because I do n’t need an unmasked Mugg Vader , but once I realized this version also allowed me to make a regular Vader , I bought him in a heartbeat .
Sculpt :
Mighty Muggs mostly use the same sculpt , but they do add to it when appropriate .
Vader uses the basic sculpt , but his hand is removable to give the effect of his robotic hand that Luke cuts off in the movie .
That ’s a neat feature and it gives this figure a bonus point of articulation .
The head sculpt underneath the helmet looks surprisingly like Sebastian Shaw , the actor who played unmasked Vader in Return of the Jedi .
It ’s scary how much that looks like him , considering Mugg ’s limitations .
If you ’ve ever seen Shaw in real life , he pretty much looks like that .
The best part though is that you can remove the top of the helmet , turn his head around and have a regular Darth Vader .
The helmet fits on pretty snug , but it ’s easy to pop off and on .
The paint work is really well done on all fronts .
I have no complaints whatsoever about the paint .
This is really one of the more complicated Muggs in terms of paint detail as well .
I do have a minor quibble with the fact that his lightsaber is sculpted into his hand .
There ’s no real point in that since the other lightsabers are removable .
The hand is almost impossible to swap in and out as well .
Finally , the cape is worthless .
For whatever reason ALL Mighty Muggs ’ capes are longer than the figure and thus they can’t wear them and stand .
They need to be about a half inch shorter .
Articulation :
Mighty Muggs have 3 points of articulation .
Head swivel , arms swivel .
Vader actually has 4 points of articulation making him practically the McFarlance Spider-man of Hasbro ’s Muggs .
His wrist has another swivel in it , since it ’s removable .
All this wrist swivel manages to do is make you realize that all the wrists should swivel on these guys .
And no , even though it looks like the legs should move , they do n’t .
Accessories :
Since the lightsaber is stuck in his hand , all you really get is a cape that ’s too long and the helmet .
Personally I think Mighty Muggs should all come with a couple of weapons to balance out the cost , but it is what it is .
Real designer vinyl can cost an arm and a leg , so I guess this is n’t so bad .
The lightsabe not being removable is dunderheaded though and the capes need to be redesigned .
Value :
Meh , $ 10 is pretty steep for a toy that ’s got so little going for it .
However these are very stylistic and they offer up something that caters to a specific genre .
For that reason alone they can’t really be graded in the same way I do most action figures .
At $ 10 a pop these are a “ decent ” value , but if you ’re looking for a true blue toy , you can do better .
Score Recap :
Packaging – 8
Sculpting – 7
Articulation – 3
Accessories – Removable Hand , Helmet , Cape
Value – 6
Overall – 6 out of 10
I ’ve decided to ask a few of my favorite horror bloggers and friends from the online community to share some of their zombie expertise with the site .
The first guy I thought of was Jay Clarke , of the excellent blog The Horror Section .
Over there , Jay blogs about everything from VHS box covers to the latest releases to horror games .
He ’s an excellent writer with an encyclopedic knowledge of horror .
And he loves zombies , maybe almost as much as I do .
He ’s contributed a dream - team list of half a dozen zombie - killing badasses he ’d want to team up with in case of apocalypse , and it is a fine list .
Not all the heroes in the group above made it , obviously — you ’ll have to click through to read who did , and why .
Without further ado , here ’s Jay .
A few months ago , while chatting on IM , Cory asked if I wanted to write an article for IZA .
I was immediately flattered , but also a little woeful .
Not only has the zombie sub genre been the subject of exhaustive conversation , but Cory has already posted hundreds upon hundreds of articles on said subject .
Â
So , what the hell could I possibly add to the table ?
It was getting that nugget of an idea that was the hardest thing about writing this article .
So here it is .
I am sure I am not the first one to come up with this , but it is what it is .
I ’ve alluded to the fact on my own site that I spend a lot of time nine - to - five daydreaming about strategies in the event of a zombie apocalypse .
I ’d eventually start going through the people in my life , ranking how well they ’d likely fare and how to meet up with them amongst all the chaos .
While I was thinking about this article , I finally had an epiphany .
Since I ’m already talking about ifs , why do I have to align myself with real people ?
Why can’t I make up a dream - team of characters that I ’d most want stand side - by - side with when the flesh eaters come knocking ?
Here be that list .
Peter ( as played by Ken Foree in the 1978 film Dawn Of The Dead )
Being a SWAT officer , he knows how to handle himself in a fight .
He ’s also loyal and most importantly , remains calm and steely under pressure .
Whereas the carelessness of Roger â€ “ his partner of sorts â€ “ led to his demise , Peter is always on top of things and thinking ahead .
Not only has he dispatched countless undead , but also stood tall when his adopted stronghold was invaded by a biker gang .
Rick Grimes ( from the comic series The Walking Dead )
Also an officer of the law , Grimes can defend himself and others .
He ’s been in the thick of a zombie occupation for a long time , and is in a constant state of awareness .
While it is true he has endured more than most and has at times been on the brink of madness , he has persevered .
That is because he is a natural survivor .
Todd Wainio ( from the novel World War Z )
Wainio was an infantry man at The Battle Of Yonkers and one of the only people to get out of that tactical disaster alive .
He is the one on the list with most experience killing zombies and has become an expert on the most efficient ways to dispatch them .
Having been a squad leader in the long campaign to reclaim the United States , he is the most obvious choice for leader of the group .
Leon Kennedy ( from the video game series Resident Evil )
Young , resourceful and highly trained , Leon would be a great asset to the group .
He is also encountered many different strains of zombie viruses , so he is equipped to deal with countless scenarios .
The sole reason I chose Leon over Chris Redfield is that most of the time we ’d played Leon in the games , he was alone , where as Chris often had partners ( Jill & Sheva ) to watch his back .
Based on that , I think Leon is superior .
Alice ( as played by Milla Jovovich in the film franchise Resident Evil )
So as not to make this a boy ’s club , I chose zombie ass - kicker Alice .
Now , obviously Jill Valentine , Claire Redfield , Ada Wong or Sheva Alomar would have been good choices as well , but I ’m quite partial to Milla .
Alice almost borders on being a superhero , so I ’d always feel safer knowing she was on point .
Plus , there ’s the whole angle of there being hundreds of her , if we need them .
Tallahassee ( as played by Woody Harrelson in the film Zombieland )
Since everybody on this list is so serious , it would nice to add someone to lighten things up .
Of course , Shaun ( Simon Pegg ) could serve that purpose as well , but Tallahassee has a bit more experience killing zombies and clearly shows a passion for it .
With all of us together , I ’m sure locating Twinkies would be an easy task .
I think the seven of us would make a good team , do n’t you ?
The adventures that swarm around in my head while sitting at my desk would make Michael Bay pee his pants .
Oh… and lastly .
If anyone out there reading this is wondering why I did n’t include Ash from the Evil Dead films , it ’s because I chose not to perpetuate the common misconception that they are zombie films .
I love the guy more than most and he’d be a gas to have around , but I ’m going to play the zombie purist on this particular occasion â€ “ flame bait or no .
If you like the list , go visit The Horror Section and tell him .
And while you are there , you can enjoy a very special non-zombie guest post from me , about my introduction to genre film in the early ’ 80s .
He stated that an affordable touchscreen , 3G - equipped device in the form of a tablet would be unveiled later this year , and it will be equipped with NVIDIA 's Tegra 2 .
That 's not completely stunner , since we
Asus has already confirmed that it will be entering the booming e-reader market later this year , but one device we have n't heard much about is the purported Eee Pad .
In fact , we 've only heard the Eee Pad referred to in rumor form , but all of that changes today .
Asus ' Corporate Vice President , Eric
Chen , recently confirmed to members of the press that it 's planning to release an Eee Pad in the future , and with the new revolution of tablets upon us , we could see Asus ' play getting a lot of attention in the very short future .
He stated that an affordable touchscreen , 3G - equipped device in the form of a tablet would be unveiled later this year , and it will be equipped with NVIDIA 's Tegra 2 .
That 's not completely stunner , since we heard rumblings of such a device at CES 2010 .
However , when asked about Asus ' reaction to the iPad , he stated the following :
" A slate ?
Yes , sure .
We have the Eee Pad .
Which right now is still under development .
Basically , it will have an ARM CPU and a 3G connection so you are always connected to the internet , so just like with the Eee Book you are always connected .
And you can choose to play video or something , when you like .
Now the key is how to combine the content together .
That will be the key .
We have studied how people will want to connect to their content and also how they want to interact with the user interface ( UI ) .
You look at the iPhone , for example .
The reason the iPhone is so successful – and call quality is really not that good – is the UI function , I think , is just the best .
So this is also the way that we need to improve . "
Asus ' Eee Pad Slate PC at CES 2010 - from NVIDIA CEO Jen - Hsun Huang 's presentation
Asus ' Eee Pad Slate PC at CES 2010 - from NVIDIA CEO Jen - Hsun Huang 's presentation
Asus essentially created the netbook craze that we know now .
It has proven that it can hold its own as a pioneer in an industry , and there 's nothing stopping the company from doing the same thing in the tablet sector .
Apple 's iPad looks to be just the first of many tablets to come , but it remains to be seen if the public is finally ready for these slate - type devices .
Remember , tablets / slates died out years ago , but those were n't nearly as sexy nor as powerful as these .
Are you excited ?
My cat Malibu and I were recently reading an issue of HRM while it was too cold outside to actually do something productive .
One of the editors was describing some of the unlucky automotive related events that have happened to him over the years .
Some were admittedly his fault , and others were beyond his control .
So I began to reminisce myself on some of my own “ misfortunes ” .
Let ’s take a look back , shall we ?
– I once hung a car from the shop ceiling ….. by it ’s hood .
Hood hinges are much stronger than you would think , so is the chainfall for pulling engines out .
– While still not fully awake yet , I opened the garage door and took a very complete step into a drain bucket full of waste oil .
That was a bad way to start the morning .
– After not being able to loosen a bumper bolt on one of my trucks , I got out my big 1 /2 inch drive breaker bar .
I applied all the pulling force that my body could possibly make , when the breaker bar suddenly snapped and I punched myself in the face .
It was definitely the hardest punch I have ever thrown or received .
– I learned that throwing a brake - less 1964 Thunderbird into park when it is rolling will not even begin to slow it down .
Then in a panic , if you push the Thunderbird ’s “ emergency ” brake pedal to the floor , the cables WILL snap .
This chain of events will guarantee a firm crash into a beautiful 1976 Corvette .
– Late at night , when cruising home from a friends house , I missed the end of the street , drove across a busy road , got a little bit of air - time , and landed my truck in someones beautifully groomed front lawn .
That sure was awkward .
– It turns out that a clogged catalytic converter can cause a 1988 Camaro automatic transmission to not shift properly .
So spending 11 hours replacing a working transmission with another working transmission is not going to unclog the catalytic converter and fix the real problem .
Mental Note : Only buy cars older than 1973 !
– You will never see as much traffic on your road as when you lose your driveshaft during the maiden voyage of your project car .
I guess I should have tightened those u-joint caps down .
– I think we have all forgotten to install an oil drain plug before .
The difference is , the Cadillac that I forgot it on held 8 quarts of oil ( with the drain plug in ) .
8 quarts makes one heck of an oil slick .
Luckily , I noticed before I started the engine .
– Just because the neighbor is rumored to be in jail , does n’t mean you can take his 83 Riviera through the woods .
However , it did prove that a V8 , front wheel drive car is not a good off - roading vehicle .
– I got pulled over by a police officer that was on a bicycle .
It was kind of a humorous situation , and I deserved the ticket .
– Contrary to popular belief , Olds Cutlass Ciera ’s are n’t good at hill climbing in the sand pits .
My friend rolled his onto it ’s roof , and I got to help him flip it back over .
As far as his parents knew , a tree fell on it .
I hope they do n’t read this .
– An easy way to test the strength of a wooden 4×4 is to place a 60 Pontiac body on it .
If it breaks , and dumps the body on the ground , then it is not a very strong piece wood .
– It turns out that the automatic transmissions in rear wheel drive cars are very close to the floor pans .
So if you are n’t paying attention when installing a B & M shifter , you can easily drill through the floor pan and into the top of the transmission .
I will finish it off with an explanation of the fine moment in history pictured above .
Yeap , it ’s me many years ago ….. borrowing a pair of women ’s sunglasses to protect my eyes from the burning magma 2 feet from my face .
There is so much wrong with this picture that I cannot even begin to explain .
What the heck was I thinking ?
Okay – raise your hand if you really thought the Buffalo Sabres would be 2nd in the East with more points than Pittsburgh and Washington at the halfway point of the season .
In all fairness to pretty much everyone , it ’s unlikely that any hockey pundit on the planet would have predicted such a start .
My secretive inside sources have told me that even the anonymous hockeybuzz guy got this one wrong .
But this is where we are , and for the typically cautiously optimistic Sabres fan it now becomes a simple question of whether this is a good team or a great team .
Is this club really that much better than the one that failed to even make the playoffs last season ?
Well , to be honest , not a whole lot .
Before sending in that hate mail , ask yourself a simple question :
How can a team be that much better when , out of your top five most talented forwards , every single one of them is behind their scoring pace of last season ?
Derek Roy , Jason Pominville , Thomas Vanek , Drew Stafford – all lower .
An injury free Tim Connolly will outpoint his 2008 - 09 total , but he was injured much of the season and was averaging a point per game .
As well as he ’s played he is n’t doing that now .
This brings us to the obvious reason for the seven - point increase over last years half - season point total : the franchise goaltender .
Thanks in great part to Ryan Miller , the Sabres are 13 - 1 - 4 in one - goal games .
This stat is almost incomprehensible .
He ’s made so many huge saves , game after game when it ’s been on the line , that he 's almost becoming at risk of being taken for granted .
Buffalo certainly has banked some impressive wins against good teams – especially on the road .
I seem to recall that was also the case last season .
And five - game winning streaks are certainly nice , even when four of those wins are against losing teams .
Recent history indicates that the lack of goal scoring is enough of an impediment to keep the Sabres from having an extended playoff run .
They ’re on pace to score 228 goals .
Since the lockout , the fewest goals scored by any Stanley Cup finalist was Pittsburgh with 247 in 2007 - 08 .
Last season six teams that did n’t even make the playoffs netted more than 228 .
For all the complaints about Roy and Stafford , the biggest concern has to be Vanek .
Every year we wait for him to hit that hot streak for which he is so well known .
As for this year , we ’re still waiting .
He has n’t scored goals in consecutive games this season , which by his standards is rather incredible .
If you ’re dreaming big , this team cannot get to the Stanley Cup Finals without Vanek pulling his weight .
There just is n’t enough offense elsewhere to go around .
He ’s a $ 7 million cap hit and is on pace for 44 points .
If the second half ends like the first he ’ll have the same point total as Tyler Myers .
Last season Jaroslav Spacek and Dominic Moore had better offensive production .
For now , Sabres fans can only hope that 18 regulation goals scored in the past 5 games is the start of a trend .
Otherwise it ’s going to be questionable at best to expect Miller to keep up his torrid pace , especially after what is sure to be a grueling Olympic tournament .
If that ’s the case , will Moore be available again at the trading deadline ?
Here 's hoping the bar will be set a tad bit higher .

Doomed from the first day -- Emanuel only knows how to be tough with liberals
The stage was set , the expectations high ; he entered office with a clear mandate from the people of America who also gave him control of both houses of the U.S. Congress .
Millions of Americans were in a state of euphoria , eagerly awaiting the birth of a new era in this nation ; anticipating the start of a massive cleansing process that would erase the previous eight years of deceit and lies .
America eagerly waited for that cleansing process to begin and then nothing happened , there has been no cleansing process , and the dark days that this nation had experienced during the years when Bush / Cheney ruled were not swept away by a creative , visionary agenda that would begin the transformation of America .
Senate Republican obstructionists are working overtime to block the interests of working people .
Today we hear the White House and Senate have cut a deal with Republicans that will keep President Obama 's nominees off the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) for even longer .
The NLRB 's job is to protect workers ' rights -- but for more than two years it has been functioning with only two members instead of the five it should have .
Working people need an NLRB that can enforce the National Labor Relations Act -- not one hobbled by vacancies .
President Obama 's nominees -- Craig Becker and Mark Pearce -- are highly qualified , well - respected labor lawyers who were nominated seven months ago , in July .
But Senate Republicans have ignored the working people they represent and blocked the appointments .
Yesterday , in a deal with the Republican minority , the Senate confirmed 27 non-controversial Obama appointees .
The White House apparently has agreed not to make Presidents Day recess appointments -- a process that allows the president to temporarily appoint his own nominee while Congress is out of session .
That means NLRB nominees -- and working people -- are out in the cold .
A big win for the Republicans .
A big win for corporations that want to file down the teeth of the NLRB .
A big loss for working people ...
President Obama has to end this farce ... [ and g]ive recess appointments to Craig Becker and Mark Pearce during the Presidents Day recess so the NLRB can do its job .
This morning I read a sad editorial by Michael Payne at Barack Obama has severely crippled his presidency and the Democrat Party .
I get a sense that Michael is expressing what millions of Americans -- primarily , though not exclusively , the ones that voted for Senator Obama in 2008 -- are thinking or will soon be thinking .
Instead we got notorious Wall Street shills like Rahm Emanuel and Lawrence Summers put in charge of economic and domestic policy and a continuation of the discredited Bush foreign policies wrapped in snazzier paper ... and what looks more and more like incompetence in everything the administration attempts .
Bush had no mandate whatsoever and was probably not even legally elected .
Obama had a virtual landslide with a huge mandate .
Bush ran the country as though the whole nation was behind him ; Obama seems scared of his own shadow , as though , down deep in the depths of his soul , he 's internalized the Republican talking points that he is n't a legitimate president regardless of what the voters said in 2008 .
He wants to govern by consensus , although the opposition has clearly stated their only goal is to make sure he fails at everything he tries .
When is he going to tough up and be the leader we thought we were electing .
Apparently , not soon .
When even the mainstream media started realizing GOP mass and mindless blocking of all of his nominations was looking a little over the top , Obama meekly threatened to use the recess appointment powers presidents have -- and which Bush used liberally -- to overcome the latest spate of pork - hungry filibusterers from the Old Confederacy .
The result -- Miss McConnell deigning to allow a few of the nominees he judged to be uncontroversial pass -- was celebrated by the White House as a success ... instead of like the disgrace it was .
Richard Trumka , President of the AFL - CIO , sawwhat it was -- and he explained it at Huffington Post yesterday : Trumka is being very respectful of the president and the presidency .
Most progressives are .
But that could start changing very soon .
In fact , I think it probably will .
Beyond the apparent symbolism -- perhaps the best we can hope for anymore -- Obama was the wrong man at the wrong time .
Obviously a better choice than John McCain but I do n't know a single person who is n't wondering how Hillary Clinton would have done as president .
And imagine if we had had it together to elect a proven friend of working families ... like Howard Dean :

AS FINANCE ministers from the European Union gathered in Brussels for a two - day “ informal ” summit on February 11th , there was only one topic on the agenda : how best to help Greece avoid defaulting on its debts while , at the same time , reassuring bond markets that other euro - area countries with big budget deficits , such as Ireland , Portugal and Spain , were still safe bets .
As The Economist went to press , only the basic elements of a possible backstop for Greece had emerged .
Pride is at stake , so it will be a “ European solution ” , with the IMF limited to an advisory role .
It will be a joint effort led by France and a somewhat reluctant Germany , the country with the deepest pockets .
Berlin frets that a rescue will only encourage further profligacy .
Acting in concert limits the political fallout that comes from rescuing countries .
It helps put pressure on Greece for more reforms and cuts in public spending as conditions of the bail - out .
But the need for co-ordination makes it hard to act decisively , and leaves bond markets nervous .
Funding will be limited , perhaps just enough to help Greece meet its immediate obligations ( €20 billion of its debts fall due in April and May ) .
Help may take the form of a guarantee on refinancing bonds or an outright purchase of those bonds by Greece 's rescuers .
There is talk that one reason to keep the IMF out is that its chief , Dominque Strauss - Kahn , may be a rival to President Nicolas Sarkozy in the French elections in 2012 ( see article ) .
If Europe snubs the IMF , it may eventually need to set up a clone — a European Monetary Fund — to deal with future funding crises .
That idea has little support for now , it seems .
The ad hoc response to the Greek crisis may partly reflect a fear that a formal set - up with a staff , budget and the ability to raise funds in capital markets would be too close to a fiscal union for many countries to stomach .
For some , the rescue of Greece marks a new wave of the global financial crisis .
The first was about the solvency of banks ; this one is about the solvency of sovereign countries .
Yet Greece 's public - finance problems were brewing long before the rich world 's banks started to falter .
When it joined the euro in 2001 , its public debt was already more than 100 % of GDP .
Despite a long boom spurred by low interest rates inside the euro , Greece did little to tackle its persistent deficits .
After its new government admitted , last October , that its budget shortfall would be 13 % of GDP , more than twice previous forecasts , Greece 's cost of borrowing started to pick up .
Bond investors were further unnerved by the revelation that Greece 's debt had been understated by keeping unpaid bills off the books .
With the country 's credibility shot , even the tough austerity programme announced earlier this month could not rally confidence .
Talk of a bail - out brought some calm to financial markets , though there is a risk that the lack of detail may trigger fresh paroxysms .
The yield on ten - year Greek bonds fell below 6 % the day before the EU gathering : in late January it had risen above 7 % .
The euro , which had been falling steadily against the dollar , perked up a bit .
Some euro- crats ( and more than a few people in Greece ) feel the euro zone has been picked on by speculators .
They point out that its debt burden is no worse than in other parts of the rich world .
The OECD reckons public debt in Britain and America will be higher than in the euro zone by 2011 , as a proportion of GDP .
The problem for the euro area is that it has trouble - spots , like Greece , with worse than average finances , and no means ( until now ) to tap the credit of their thriftier brethren .
Even that may be too kind a comparison .
Bond investors have worried most about countries with big borrowing needs adding to an already high stock of debt .
In future , they may fret more about the longer - term prospects for GDP growth .
Sluggish economies cannot sustain a big debt burden for ever ; and the euro - zone countries with the most bloated debt burdens also face severe obstacles to growth .
Fixing public finances is just the beginning of a much - needed programme of reforms .
Scattered throughout every galaxy are black holes , regions that gobble up matter and energy .
Although we ca n’t see black holes , scientists can infer their size , location and other properties by using sensitive telescopes to detect the heat they generate .
This heat , which we see as X - rays , is produced as material spirals around a black hole faster and faster until it reaches a point of no return — the “ event horizon ” — from which nothing , not even light , can escape .
In addition to a galaxy ’s collection of black holes , which includes black holes up to 10 times the sun ’s mass , there is a supermassive black hole embedded in the heart of each galaxy that is roughly one million to one billion times the mass of the sun .
About 10 percent of these giant black holes feature jets of plasma , or highly ionized gas , that extend in opposite directions of the black hole .
By spewing huge amounts of mostly kinetic energy , or energy created by motion , from the black holes into the universe , the jets affect how stars and other bodies form , and play a crucial role in the evolution of clusters of galaxies , the largest structures in the universe .
“ This black hole in the center of the cluster is affecting everything else in that cluster , ” said Dan Evans , a postdoctoral researcher at MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research ( MKI ) , who studies supermassive black holes and their jets .
Because a jet gently heats the gas it carries throughout a galaxy cluster , it can slow and even prevent stars , which are created by the condensation and collapse of cool molecular gas , from forming , thereby affecting the growth of galaxies , Evans explained .
“ Without these jets , clusters of galaxies would look very different . ”
How these jets form remains one of the most important unsolved mysteries in extragalactic astrophysics .
Now Evans may be one step closer to unlocking that mystery .
The importance of spin
For two years , Evans has been comparing several dozen galaxies whose black holes host powerful jets ( these galaxies are known as radio - loud active galactic nuclei , or AGN ) to those galaxies with supermassive black holes that do not eject jets .
All black holes — those with and without jets — feature accretion disks , the clumps of dust and gas rotating just outside the event horizon .
By examining the light reflected in the accretion disk of an AGN black hole , he concluded that jets may form right outside black holes that have a retrograde spin — or which spin in the opposite direction from their accretion disk .
Although Evans and a colleague recently hypothesized that the gravitational effects of black hole spin may have something to do with why some have jets , Evans now has observational results to support the theory in a paper published in the Feb. 10 issue of the Astrophysical Journal .
While researchers know that the mass of a black hole is intimately linked to the galaxy in which it is located , they have , until now , known little about the role of its second fundamental property — spin .
With this paper , Evans asserts that spin is crucial to understanding the dynamics of a black hole ’s host galaxy because it may actually create the jet that regulates the growth of that galaxy and the universe .
“ It ’s the first convincing galaxy of this type seen at this angle where the result is pretty robust , ” said Patrick Ogle , an assistant research scientist at the California Institute of Technology , who studies AGN .
Ogle believes Evans ’s theory regarding retrograde spin is among the best explanations he has heard for why some AGN contain a super - massive black hole with a jet and others do n’t .
Although Evans has suspected for nearly five years that retrograde black holes with jets are missing the innermost portion of their accretion disk , it was n’t until last year that computational advances meant that he could analyze data collected between late 2007 and early 2008 by the Suzaku observatory , a Japanese satellite launched in 2005 with collaboration from NASA , to provide an example to support the theory .
With these data , Evans and colleagues from the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , Yale University , Keele University and the University of Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom analyzed the spectra of a supermassive black hole with a jet located about 800 million light years away in an AGN named 3C 33 .
Astrophysicists can see the signatures of X - ray emission from the inner regions of the accretion disk , which is located close to the edge of a black hole , as a result of a super hot atmospheric ring called a corona that lies above the disk and emits light that an observatory like Suzaku can detect .
In addition to this direct light , a fraction of light passes down from the corona onto the black hole ’s accretion disk and is reflected from the disk ’s surface , resulting in a spectral signature pattern called the Compton reflection hump , also detected by Suzaku .
But Evans ’ team never found a Compton reflection hump in the X - ray emission given off by 3C 33 , a finding the researchers believe provides crucial evidence that the accretion disk for a black hole with a jet is truncated , meaning it does n’t extend as close to the center of the black hole with a jet as it does for a black hole that does not have a jet .
The absence of this innermost portion of the disk means that nothing can reflect the light from the corona , which explains why observers only see a direct spectrum of X - ray light .
The researchers believe the absence may result from retrograde spin , which pushes out the orbit of the innermost portion of accretion material as a result of general relativity , or the gravitational pull between masses .
This absence creates a gap between the disk and the center of the black hole that leads to the piling of magnetic fields that provide the force to fuel a jet .
While Ogle believes that the retrograde spin theory is a good explanation for Evans ’s observations , he said it is far from being confirmed , and that it will take more examples with consistent results to convince the astrophysical community .
The field of research will expand considerably in August 2011 with the planned launch of NASA ’s Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array ( NuSTAR ) satellite , which is 10 to 50 times more sensitive to spectra and the Compton reflection hump than current technology .
NuSTAR will help researchers conduct a “ giant census ” of supermassive black holes that “ will absolutely revolutionize the way we look at X - ray spectra of AGN , ” Evans explained .
He plans to spend another two years comparing black holes with and without jets , hoping to learn more about the properties of AGN .
His goal over the next decade is to determine how the spin of a supermassive black hole evolves over time .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The healthcare reform measure passed by the House of Representatives on Sunday delivers some good news for drugmakers , device companies and even health insurers .
Among the changes in the legislation was a provision delaying hefty taxes on those three industries by at least a year .
Following are some of the winners and losers in the overall healthcare industry based on a Senate version of the bill and the reconciliation bill passed by the House on Sunday .
The Senate must vote on the reconciliation bill , so changes could still emerge .
WINNERS
BRAND - NAME DRUGMAKERS
* The pharmaceutical industry keeps its $ 80 billion agreement to provide savings and rebates .
Its fees , to be divided among companies such as Pfizer and Merck & Co , would be delayed from 2010 to 2011 , increasing from the initial $ 2.3 billion a year to $ 2.7 billion .
* Overall , wider insurance coverage could help offset the costs by providing more potential customers .
* Drugmakers warded off deeper price cuts in the Medicare program for the elderly .
The House had sought to fully close the so - called “ doughnut hole ” where coverage drops temporarily after reaching a certain limit , but the bill maintains the industry ’s 50 - percent discount .
The government will pay for another 25 - percent discount .
* Lawmakers rejected Obama ’s plan to end lucrative “ pay - for - delay ” settlements with brand - name drugmakers , a win for both generic and brand - name companies .
* The bill also discards an earlier provision that would have extended a hospital drug discount program .
BRAND BIOLOGIC DRUGMAKERS
* While the bill sets up a regulatory path for generic versions of expensive biologic drugs , Amgen and Roche ’s Genentech unit and other biological drugmakers won a 12 - year period of exclusive sales for brand - name drugs before facing competition from generic rivals .
DEVICE MAKERS
* Fees for medical device makers , such as Boston Scientific and Medtronic , would be delayed to 2013 after initial bills called for 2010 .
The sector earlier won a reduced industry tax of $ 20 billion , down from $ 40 billion .
* Rather than an overall industry fee , the bill now contains a 2.9 percent sales tax .
Certain consumer products , including eyeglasses and contact lenses , are exempt .
HOSPITALS
* Hospitals , which include companies such as Universal Health Services and Tenet Healthcare , say they kept a $ 155 billion , 10 - year deal to accept lower government payments from Medicare and Medicaid in exchange for an expected boost in insured customers .
* A provision that could have helped certain rural and children ’s hospitals with an expanded drug discount program was dropped .
PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS
* Analysts say increased Medicare drug coverage could boost pharmacy benefit managers ( PBM ) that administer prescription drug benefits as companies , such as Express Scripts and Medco Health Solutions , could see increased volumes .
* PBMs still face more disclosures but not new taxes .
Companies must give the Department of Health and Human Services information about rebates from drugmakers for certain drugs .
LOSERS
HEALTH INSURERS
* While health insurers overall still face tighter regulation , companies such as Aetna Inc , Cigna Corp , UnitedHealth Group Inc and WellPoint Inc saw their $ 67 billion , 10 - year tax delayed until 2014 .
* Private Medicare plans called Medicare Advantage would see their payments frozen in 2011 , then lowered in 2012 .
The plans , which can offer more benefits than traditional Medicare coverage , would also have to spend at least 85 cents out of every dollar on medical costs -- leaving 15 cents toward overhead and salaries , among other things .
* Consumer protection rules would change the way companies do business , banning denial of coverage for preexisting medical conditions and ending lifetime coverage limits .
Some curbs would be expanded to all health insurance plans six months after the bill passes , while others take effect in 2014 .
* The bill changes penalties for individuals who do not buy health insurance as mandated .
The fine is lowered from $ 495 to $ 325 in 2015 and from $ 750 to $ 695 in 2016 , but the alternative method of fining people using a percentage of income increased slightly to 2.5 percent by 2016 .
* The bill does not include President Barack Obama ’s call for federal oversight of health insurance rates .
It also expands tax credits and other financing to help more people afford insurance .
* Lawmakers have said roughly 30 million more Americans could have insurance with the reform .
GENERIC DRUGMAKERS
* The 12 - year period of exclusive brand - name sales of biologic drugs surpasses the 5 - 7 years proponents had sought .
* Overall , companies that make generic versions of brand - name drugs see little direct help , although increasing insurance access may help more people buy medicine .
* But the bill includes a 75 - percent discount on generic drugs in Medicare , the same as on brand - name drugs .
Companies were concerned that closing the Medicare “ doughnut hole ” would turn people away from cheaper , generic medicines .
TANNING BED MAKERS
* The bill keeps a 10 - percent tax on consumers who use indoor tanning salons , seeking to raise $ 2.7 billion by 2019 while discouraging a practice that can cause skin cancer .
A musician has spoken today of his shock at being removed from a train for " behaving suspiciously " by writing a list of songs which included the band name " The Killers " .
Tom Shaw was travelling on a South West Trains when he began writing a list of song titles which his band The Magic Mushrooms would play at a forthcoming gig .
But the 25 - year - old was approached by two security staff employed by the train company and asked to leave the train at Fareham railway station .
Mr Shaw , who works with young people with learning difficulties , said that they told him he had been behaving suspiciously and asked him to explain the list he had been writing .
The set list included Take Me Out by Franz Ferdinand , Cigarettes and Alcohol by Oasis and Love Me Like You by The Magic Numbers .
Mr Shaw , of Portsmouth , Hampshire , said his band also intended to play All These Things That I 've Done by The Killers but he had simply written " killers " .
He told the Portsmouth News : " They made me get out at Fareham and when I asked what was wrong they told me to show them the piece of paper I 'd been writing on .
" They said I 'd been behaving suspiciously .
I could n't understand it .
It seemed very strange as it was only a list of songs .
" We had a gig coming up so I was writing out what we could play .
They made me explain song by song . "
Mr Shaw added that the security staff told him that he had been questioned because there had been a number of arrests in the area including a man who had murdered his wife .
A South West Trains spokeswoman said Mr Shaw was asked politely to leave the train because it was busy and the officers wished to speak to him about their concerns .
She added : " We employ a team of highly professional rail community officers who work closely with the British Transport Police in protecting the security of passengers on the rail network .
" During a routine high - visibility patrol back in early March , they talked with a passenger on the platform at Fareham station .
" The team clarified the nature of the individual 's business , were satisfied with his explanation and the man went on his way .
Less than 100 hours after Democratic Congressman John Murtha passed away , one of his hugest critics decided to replace her butter knives with sharper blades .
“ Sufficient time has passed since John Murtha ’s death to reckon with his true record .
No tears for the wreckage , poison , and damage to the public trust he left behind , ” conservative pundit Michelle Malkin wrote at her blog Friday morning , before posting a copy of her latest syndicated column .

After the longtime Pennsylvania congressman ’s death was reported on Monday , Malkin ’s initial post only contained a few subtle politically - motivated remarks .
“ I ’ll let my archives on his political career speak for itself , ” Malkin wrote .
“ For now , condolences to the Murtha family . ”
After posting a message by Murtha ’s GOP challenger , William Russell , which announced that his campaign “ was immediately initiating a moratorium on all political media activity for the next five days in respect , ” and hoped that “ the passing of Mr. Murtha be treated with the utmost respect and decency by all , ” Malkin ended her blog post Monday with the following retort : “ Yes , we can show Murtha ’s family more decency and respect than he ever showed the Haditha Marines . ”
On Friday , Malkin went back to full - on attack mode .
Malkin ’s syndicated column , “ John Murtha : Requiem for a corruptocrat ” , regularly published in over 100 newspapers nationwide , begins ,

We are not supposed to speak ill of the dead .
But those whom the deceased viciously smeared and humiliated deserve to be defended .
Entrenched Democrat Rep. John Murtha passed away on February 8 after a botched gall bladder surgery .
He has been hailed as a “ military advocate ” ( Associated Press ) and “ one of the greatest patriots ever to serve in Congress ” ( former Democratic congressman Harold Ford ) .
These obsequious obituaries leave out inconvenient truths : John “ Jack ” Murtha was an unrepentant smear merchant and corruptocrat to the bitter end . ”
Malkin maintains that because most of the Marines implicated in the November of 2005 Haditha killings had charges against them dropped , Murtha was wrong to “ open [ ] the military - bashing floodgates around the world ” by declaring in 2006 , “ Our troops overreacted because of the pressure on them , and they killed innocent civilians in cold blood . ”
“ Murtha , the so - called ‘ military advocate ’ went to his deathbed refusing to apologize or retract the attacks on the Haditha Marines ( several of whom unsuccessfully sued him for libel to restore their honor ) , ” Malkin writes .
“ Decent people would call this intransigent treachery .
Murtha ’s friends apparently consider it great patriotism . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
As in most of her anti-Murtha columns , Malkin ignores the fact that a three - month probe commissioned by the Pentagon did support some of the late congressman ’s charges that the Marines engaged in potentially “ criminal conduct . ”
“ I found no direct evidence of any orchestrated effort or any effort on the part of any individual above the squad level to cover up this incident .
I did find that individuals above the squad level were complicit , whether intentionally or unintentionally , in attempts to hide criminal conduct .
Leaders from the platoon through the 2nd Marine Division level , particularly at the Company and Battalion level , exhibited a determination to ignore indications of serious misconduct , perhaps to avoid conducting an inquiry that could prove adverse to themselves or their Marines . . . . ” Army Maj. Gen. Eldon A. Bargewell ’s report stated .

Well , there ’s a silver lining to this Cloud ( pun intended ! ) .
Square Enix has constantly said no to a FFVII remake , and while they have n’t exactly fully amended this announcement , truly literal people like me can take away a slight glimmer of hope in their latest statement .
In last week ’s Famitsu , famed director Tetsuya Nomura shot down the idea of an FFVII remake yet again .
“ Fans are looking forward to an oft rumored remake of FFVII , but I do n’t believe this will happen for the time being , ” Nomura said ( via Andriasang ) .
Still , he teased , “ It ’s possible that he will appear in other titles as a guest character . ”
Cloud ’s guest - starred in various other games before , so the prospect of him continuing to pop up in future titles is intriguing .
But what many fans really want is a goddamned remake !
But take heart !
At least Squenix has upgraded its response from “ not going to happen ” to “ not believed to be going to happen for the time being . ”
I wish I had better news .
But honestly , who knows what ’ll happen within the next 5 years or so ?
Square Enix has already remade every earlier Final Fantasy game .
And in the meantime , maybe Cloud ’ll show up in 0 Day Attack on Earth .
Hey , it could happen !

MIAMI -- Volatile but versatile Richie Incognito is joining the Miami Dolphins , who gave the free - agent offensive lineman a one - year contract and a fresh start Wednesday .
Incognito has conceded he has a reputation for being " a less than model citizen , " but the Dolphins are counting on him to provide more depth and flexibility up front .
Incognito , who has started 47 NFL games , will contend for a starting job at right guard and has also played center and tackle .
The Dolphins will be his third NFL team since December .
Last year the St. Louis Rams benched Incognito in two games , each time after he drew two personal fouls .
The Rams waived him after the second benching , and he started the final three games for Buffalo .
Incognito was a third - round draft pick by the Rams in 2005 , but eventually wore out his welcome in St. Louis .
He criticized the Rams ' dwindling fan base in 2008 , made an obscene gesture to a TV cameraman during practice and encouraged hecklers by cupping his hands to his ears while leaving the field after a loss .
Incognito left Nebraska after his sophomore season and was kicked off the team at Oregon before turning pro .
In Miami , Incognito will compete at right guard with Donald Thomas and Nate Garner , who shared the job last season .
The Dolphins were in the market to improve their depth after injuries left them thin in the offensive line the second half of the year .
Incognito is the Dolphins ' second new acquisition in free agency .
They signed former Arizona linebacker Karlos Dansby to a five - year contract , and remain in the market for upgrades at receiver , safety , outside linebacker and nose tackle .
I 'm trying to get SDLPerl working on my 64 - bit Snow Leopard machine with Perl 5.10.1 , and after solving many other problems , I got to RT # 49975 , where it 's time to make the Mac bundle .
Since I was compiling SDL myself , I also had to fetch the latest JPEG , PNG , and TIFF libraries , as well as SDL_Image .
The build file in SDL_Perl is verbose , so it does n't say what it found or what it did n't find .
I compile and install all of those before I build the Perl module .
After installing SDL_Perl , I have to build the bundle so I can get the SDLPerl program I need to run the applications .
That 's another set of problems .
First , I fixed the Darwin.pm script to use the same perl that I 'm building against .
Never , never , never use the literal name " perl " in your build systems .
Always use $ ^X so you get the perl the build is using .
In this case , I do n't want the system perl .
Next , Chris Nandor clued me into selecting the right architecture .
By default , when I try to build the bundle it looks like it is try to make a fat one .
I did n't build SDL , etc. for fat though .
I just have to tell it which architecture I want :
% env ARCHFLAGS= " - arch x86_64 " ./ Build bundle
Now it mostly compiles , but I 'm not so sure those warnings are harmless :
Building SDL_Perl gcc -I/usr/local / include /SDL -D_GNU_SOURCE=1

It 's time to try it out , though .
I create the lander .pl tutorial example :
% perl5.10.1 - MSDL :: Tutorial::LunarLander=lander.pl -e1
I 'm in the SDL_Perl directory still , so I need to give some long paths to everyone finds themselves :
% SDLPerl.app/Contents/MacOS/SDLPerl `pwd`/lander.pl
This almost works , but lander .
pl can't find any of it 's files .
The working directory is off , so I fix that up in lander.pl :
use File : : Basename ; my $ dir = dirname ( $ 0 ) ; chdir $ dir ;
Now the application window starts up and it paints it background and the first instance of the lander .
That 's as far as it gets before it SDLPerl unexpectedly quits ( the crash report is at the end of the post ) .
It does n't like the call to update in draw .
Comment out that line and everything is fine except I can't see anything happening in the application window .
I look at some other examples and note that they do n't use update .
Instead , they use sync .
I change the line in draw to use sync instead , and now it works , although it dumps core at the end ( after the Perl script exits ) :
# in draw # $ app - > update ( $background_rect ) ; $ app ->sync ;
Now I get the nice animation , although it took me a couple of tries to figure out it was n't interactive .
I kept trying to land it myself with arrow keys !
And , the crash report :

It was the idea of a Boston envelope manufacturer , the kind of figure Richard Nixon was used to approaching for political contributions : a one - day nationwide general strike against the war .
Most antiwar leaders were skeptical .
One who was n't , who knew something about quixotic successes , was Sam Brown , the organizer of the McCarthy " Children 's Crusade " in 1968 .
The usual spots where dissidents gathered , he realized -- New York , San Francisco , Washington -- were foreign territory to most Americans .
This action would be determinedly local .
Get pictures on the AP wire of antiwar butchers , bakers , and candlestick makers in Schenectady , Cincinnati , and Bakersfield , and a new antiwar narrative might emerge .
Since " strike " sounded like something bomb - throwers did , they adopted , instead , a Nixon word : moratorium .
A moratorium from everyday life , smack dab in the middle of the week .
The first press release went out : " On October 15 , 1969 , this nation will cease ' business as usual ' to protest the war in Vietnam and for the Nixon administration to bring the troops home . "
( Nixon issued a dictate to John Ehrlichman on June 24 , using a favorite football metaphor : come up with an anti-Moratorium game plan by July .
What was significant about that order was that the protest was not announced publicly for another week . )
The Vietnam Moratorium Committee organized on a scale never attempted before .
The core was the 253 student government officers and student newspaper editors who had signed an anti-draft pledge in spring .
The spring clashes on campuses actually worked to their advantage .
People wanted desperately to talk to these clean - cut kids knocking on their doors -- to grasp the baffling events just past .
That was the conversation starter , the opening to points like : " Is n't 25,000 a rather token amount of troops for Nixon to withdraw , given that there were over 500,000 American boys in Vietnam ?
Did n't that rate of withdrawal mean we would still be in Vietnam in nine years ? "
John Ehrlichman named as the anti-Moratorium game plan 's quarterback Nixon 's favorite football coach , Bud Wilkinson , late of the University of Oklahoma .
What Wilkinson proposed , since " no one likes to be used , " was that he jawbone the kids into realizing the Moratorium as " an attempt to exploit students for the organizers ' own purposes . "
" It 's easy to manipulate kids , " Haldeman agreed , " because they love to get excited .
You can foment them up for a panty raid , or in the old days , gold - fish swallowing . "
But six weeks after Bud Wilkinson started meeting with student leaders to shame them into the realization that they were cats ' paws , he apologetically reported back : kids were laughing in his face .
" The problem of dealing with the Vietnam Moratorium Committee , " Wilkinson noted , with understatement , " is difficult . "
Some Establishment leaders surveying the anti-war disruptions began concluding that the best way to end the anti-war was to end the war .
Notre Dame 's Father Hesburgh earned an Oval Office audience for his get - tough policies against student protesters and took the opportunity to beg the president to reform the draft and end the war " as soon as possible . "
The president of the most violence - wracked campus in the country , the University of Michigan , practically thundered against the war in the opening convocation .
Word came down from the President : " not to be included in any White House conferences . "
Simultaneously , the White House launched an anti-Moratorium Plan B : leaking word that they were responding to demonstrations .
The New York Times printed the testimony of an anonymous " critic " within the administration that there would soon be " a temporary suspension of the draft for an unspecified time " and that when conscription resumed men would only be eligible for a year after their 19th birthday instead of the present six , and only professional soldiers and draftees who volunteered would be sent to Vietnam .
Nixon started making mistakes .
On September 26 he held his first press conference since June .
Aides urged him not to sneer at something so obviously broad - based as the new antiwar surge .
Asked first about the proposal of Charles Goodell , the Republican senator Nelson Rockefeller had appointed to fill out the late Bobby Kennedy 's term , to cut off funding for the war after December 1 , 1970 , he responded like something out of 1984 : " that inevitably leads to perpetuating and continuing the war . "
The third question was a softball : " What is your view , sir , concerning the student moratorium and other campus demonstrations being planned for this fall against the Vietnam War ? "
He replied , with monarchical bluntness , " under no circumstances will I be affected whatever by it . "
Mistake .
The remark was the next day 's lead story .
VMC leaders put on a press conference timed for the Sunday papers .
Dozens of reporters showed up instead of the usual five or six .
They had done what Nixon had done in 1948 with Truman , and 1966 with Johnson : massively inflated their stature by making themselves debating partners of a president .
They also played skillfully into the emerging media narrative : that the stresses of the job were getting to Nixon .
They said what distressed them about his statement " is the degree of isolation which it reflects .
It is the kind of rigid stance which contributed so much to the bitterness of debate during the last days of the Johnson administration . "
They were speaking the Establishment 's language , and the Establishment suddenly started showing respect .
Newsweek reported : " Originally , October 15 was to have been a campus - oriented protest .
But it has quickly spread beyond the campus .
And , if everything goes according to the evolving plans , the combination of scheduled events could well turn into the broadest and most spectacular antiwar protest in American history . "
Everything was going better than planned .
As Weathermen tore up Chicago , the New York Times reported on a letter from six of the top Vietnam experts from the Rand Corporation , the top defense think tank .
America should withdraw , they said , unilaterally and immediately -- not " conditioned upon agreement or performance by Hanoi or Saigon . "
They went on : " Short of destroying the entire country and its people , we cannot eliminate the enemy force in Vietnam by military means . "
Even further : if every enemy soldier or sympathizer was somehow magically eliminated the other side still would not make " the kinds of concessions currently demanded " -- a divided Vietnam with the South overseen by a government that the people there thought fundamentally illegitimate .
" ' Military victory ' is no longer the U.S. objective , " despite what the American government told the American people , and that was n't even the worst of the lies :
" The importance to U.S. national interests of the future political complexion of South Vietnam has been greatly exaggerated , as has the negative impact of the unilateral U.S. withdrawal " -- whose risks " will not be less after another year or more of American involvement . "
The Times called them " men of considerable expertise who normally shun publicity " -- and that one , " Daniel Ellsberg , spent two years working for the State Department in Saigon before joining Rand . "
The New Yorker , in the issue that hit newsstands three days before the Moratorium , ran a report called " Casualties of War " about a five - man reconnaissance squad who kidnapped and gang - raped a South Vietnamese girl , then murdered her .
The anti-antiwar side fought back with a national newspaper ad headlined " Everyone who wants peace in Vietnam should : TELL IT TO HANOI . "
It listed in the left - hand column seven steps " the President of the United States has done to end the war in Vietnam . "
The right - hand column named Hanoi 's contribution : " Nothing . "
It printed a coupon to clip out and send to " Citizens for Peace with Security , " promising , " We 'll see to it that the evidence of your support for the President without dishonor for the United States is transmitted to the enemy in Hanoi .
The time has come for the ' silent Americans ' to speak out . "
Two precisely incommensurate propositions : that either patience or impatience with the war was the road to national dishonor .
On the 15th , the American people could vote on that referendum with their feet .
Richard Nixon lost .
Life called it " the largest expression of public dissent ever seen in this country . "
Two million Americans protested -- most for the first time in their lives .
Everywhere , black armbands ; everywhere , flags at half staff ; church services , film showings , teach - ins , neighbor - to - neighbor canvasses .
In North Newton , Kansas , a bell tolled every four seconds , each clang memorializing a fallen soldier ; in Columbia , Maryland , an electronic sign counted the day 's war deaths .
Milwaukee staged a downtown noontime funeral procession .
Hastings College , an 850 - student Presbyterian school in Nebraska , suspended operations .
Madison , Ann Arbor , and New Haven were only a few of the college towns to draw out a quarter of their populations or more ( New Haven 's Vietnam Moratorium Committee had called up every name in the city phone book ) .
The nation 's biggest college town brought out 100,000 souls in Boston Common .
A young Rhodes Scholar out of Arkansas , Bill Clinton , got up a demonstration of 1000 people in front of the U.S. embassy in London .
Newsday publisher and former LBJ right - hand - man Bill Moyers , Paris peace talks chief negotiator Averell Harriman , the mayor of Detroit , even the Connecticut state chairman of Citizens for Nixon - Agnew participated in protests .
The Washington Post drew a man-bites - dog conclusion : " Anti-Vietnam Views Unite Generations . "
... At Columbia , Jimmy Breslin reported what the day 's starting pitcher , Tom Seaver , had told him : " If the Mets can get to the World Series , the U.S. can get out of Vietnam . "
And then there was Washington , D.C.
On the evening of the 14th , twenty - three Congressmen began an intended all - night session Vietnam on the House floor .
Gerald Ford managed to shut them down after four hours .
It was the longest time Congress had ever talked Vietnam at a stretch .
The next day , congressmen vigiled on the Capitol steps .
At lunchtime bureaucrats at the Department of Health , Education and Welfare could chose from twelve different anti-war discussions .
Or they could simply play hooky , joining the 50,000 who gathered at the base of the Washington Monument , listening to Coretta Scott King say that this was war " destroying the very fabric and fiber of our society . "
Then , in ranks of ten , they moved out to the White House .
There was n't a single Viet Cong flag in evidence .
There were hardly any signs at all .
There were candles , shimmering in an unbroken line all the way back to the Washington Monument .
( Charleston , West Virginia 's police chief described his city 's pro-war counter - demonstration : " We wo n't creep around in the dark with candles like those traitors do ....
We 'll march at high noon on Monday and let free people fall right in line . " )
An NSC staffer took a break from working on the President 's November 3 speech on Vietnam to witness the flickering encirclement of the White House .
He looked up with a start : it included his wife and children .
The President affected to have noticed nothing : " I have n't seen a single demonstrator -- and I 've been out . "
... The conspiracy to sabotage it all had consumed the West Wing .
One black op consisted of sending a letter sent to every Congressional office on simulated Moratorium letterhead , announcing that the vigil had been moved to Union Station .
Yet more ads from the supposedly independent " Citizens for Peace with Security " -- a White House front -- enjoined Americans to blame Hanoi for the continued warfare .
( The man listed in the ads as the group 's chairman , William J. Casey , was a former intelligence officer who had lost a 1968 campaign for Congress as a Nixon Republican , then cemented his Orthogonian bona fides by having his membership application rejected by the Council on Foreign Relations ; in 1971 Nixon nominated him for Securities and Exchange Commission chairman . )
Conservative congressmen were recruited to assail antiwar colleagues for advocating a " bug out " that would bring " the slaughter of untold millions to Vietnam . "
And Americans who'd been held hostage by the Communists in Vietnam were wheeled out as political props .
Two POWs had been released by the North Vietnamese in August .
In September , the Pentagon sent them around the country to describe their " ordeal of horror . "
And surely their confinement had been no picnic .
But journalists noticed their stories became more extravagant and inconsistent as time went on .
The Secretary of Defense announced of their captivity : " There is clear evidence that North Vietnam has violated even the most fundamental standards of human decency . "
But two years later , when Seymour Hersh investigated , he discovered a letter from the Pentagon in which Laird reassured the prisoners ' families he was exaggerating : " We are certain that you will not become unduly concerned over the briefing if you keep in mind the purpose for which it was tailored . "
For the first time , the President sent out Spiro Agnew to do what Nixon used to do for Ike : call the administration 's critics traitors .
On the eve of the protest North Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Van Dong broadcast an open letter on Radio Hanoi praising the Moratorium 's efforts " to save the honor of the United States and to avoid for their boys a useless death in Vietnam . "
The Vice President demanded its leaders " repudiate the support of a totalitarian government which has on its hands the blood of 40,000 Americans , " and said pro-Moratorium congressmen were " chargeable with the knowledge of this letter . "
The legalistic insinuation -- " chargeable " -- nicely recalled the master , in 1952 , calling President Truman and Secretary Acheson " traitors to the high principles in which many of the nation 's Democrats believe . "
... On Moratorium Day , they recruited parachutists to touch down on the Mall and in Central Park , bearing American flags : perhaps the crowd would seize them , maybe burn them , and that would become the story .
Instead , the crowds just laughed .
It was less than a week ago that we first mentioned PDA organizing Brown Bag lunch vigils at the district offices of congressmembers all over the country for February 17 .
I 've been re-reading the part of Rick Perlstein 's book , Nixonland that deals with the events around the Vietnam Moratorium Committee , arguably the greatest anti-war movement in U.S. history .
When is Obama going to realize that his administration will soon be replaying hideous scenarios just like this ... as his standing sinks beneath the waves of universal revulsion for an unjust and unjustifiable war and occupation ?
Yesterday there was a lot of speculation about why Mitch " Miss " McConnell broke down and wept like a 6 year old girl when he announced Kyle , his chief of staff , was departing .
People speculated that it was a situation similar to David Dreier and his chief of " staff . "
Take a look :
But there 's another theory .
In the last 3 days PDA added these vigils to the February 17 schedule : Travis Childers ( Blue Dog - MS ) in HernandoLucille Roybal - Allard ( D - CA ) in L.A. Chellie Pingree ( D - ME ) in Portland Xavier Becerra ( D - CA ) in L.A. Pete DeFazio ( D - OR ) in EugeneBetsy Markey ( Blue Dog - CO ) in Ft CollinsLaura Richardson ( D - CA ) in Long BeachDiane Watson ( D - CA ) in L.A. Gene Taylor ( Blue Dog - MS ) in GulfportMike Michaud ( Blue Dog -ME ) in WatervilleDoris Matsui ( D - CA ) in SacramentoMiss McConnell ( R- KY ) in PaducahTake my word for it ; the tenor of the gathering at the offices of the 2 members from Maine or at Diane Watson 's district office on Wilshire Blvd. , each of whom were among the 32 Democrats who voted against Obama 's war funding supplemental budget last June , is going to be substantially different from what is likely to take place in Paducah .

暫く前から欲しい開発環境ってのがあって、「GUIアプリケーションを簡単に作る環境が欲しいよ」があります。
何で欲しいかというと、
こんな事情がある訳です。
そんな訳で 、Pythonを使って簡単にGUIアプリを作れないかな？と妄想する訳です。
紹介 …前置きが長くなってしまいましたが、最近、VisualWx ( http://visualwx.altervista.org/indexit.php)がアップデートされたらしく、0.87.0.1になっていました。
早速 入れてみます 。
01 posted from フォト蔵 何か、画面変わってますね 。
「 File 」 →「 New Project 」 とするとプロジェクト一覧が出ます 。
02 posted from フォト 蔵
何か、色々増えてます。
C++ , Python , Ruby , Lua… 。Luaかぁ。
さて、ここで は
一番簡単そうな 、 「 WX_DLG_Python」を選びます。
03 posted from フォト 蔵
この状態で、早速動かす事が出来ます。
ほらね。
04 posted from フォト 蔵
作ってみましょう では 、VisualWxを使って簡単なアプリケーションを作ってみます。
ここでは、簡単なHTMLブラウザを作ってみます。 まず、URLを入力するエディットボックスを、ぽちっとな。
05 posted from フォト蔵 次は 、URL を入力した後、移動する為のボタンを、ぽちっとな。
06 posted from フォト蔵 最後に、HTML を描画するコンポーネントを、ぽちっとな。
07 posted from フォト蔵 この時点で、以下のよ う に3つのコンポーネントがダイアログボックス上に並んでいます。
08 posted from フォト蔵 これらを適当にレイアウトしちゃいましょう 。
09 posted from フォト 蔵
レイアウトは、VBやDelphiの感覚で出来ちゃいますんで、楽です。
次は、各コンポーネントの名称をプロパティエディタで修正します。 エディットボックス Name:edtURL
Text : " http : / / "
ボタン Name : btnGO Text :移動 HTMLコンポーネント Name : htmlCtrl
プロパティの変更は、プロパティウィンドウ上でダブルクリックして修正すればOKです。
10 posted from フォト 蔵
次は、ボタ ン( btnGO ) をクリックすると、エディットボックス(edtURL)
のURLに移動・描画させるようにしましょう。
ボタ ン( btnGO ) を選択し、プロパティウィンドウの「Events」をクリックするとイベントタブが表示されます。
そこで、 「 E」を選択すると、「 EVT_BUTTON 」イベントが表示されます。
そこで、チェックボックスにチェックを入れます。
11 posted from フォト蔵 その後、中央のウィンドウ の 「 Python」を選択すると、ダイアログのコードウィンドウが現れます。
すると、さっき の「 EVT_BUTTON 」イベントに該当する箇所のコードテンプレートが挿入されています。
( VBや Delphiみたく、ダブルクリックでコードウィンドウに移動…という事はありません。ちょっと残念)
12 posted from フォト蔵 ここで、エディットボック ス( edtURL ) のテキスト値をURLとして、HTMLコントロール( htmlCtrl)に移動・描画させてみます。
以下のコードを追加します。
( 追加するのは 、" add your code here " の下の3 行です ) # [ win ] add your code here def btnGO_VwXEvOnButtonClick ( self , event ) : #init function # [ 3d6 ]
Code event VwX ... Do n't modify [ 3d6 ] # #add your code here url = self.edtURL.GetValue( ) print url self.htmlCtrl.LoadPage( url ) return #end function
